00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.610 
show the strumming pattern and stuff so
I<00:00:13.530> figured<00:00:13.679> I'd<00:00:14.160> go<00:00:14.820> ahead<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.089> do<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.289> so

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:19.620 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.240 

I'm<00:00:20.490> gonna<00:00:20.730> do<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.030> with<00:00:21.270> em<00:00:22.020> webcam<00:00:22.860> and<00:00:23.130> it

I'm gonna do this with em webcam and it

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.600 
I'm gonna do this with em webcam and it
really<00:00:23.670> sucks<00:00:24.030> but<00:00:24.870> anyway<00:00:25.550> you're<00:00:26.550> gonna

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
really sucks but anyway you're gonna

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.200 
really sucks but anyway you're gonna
have<00:00:26.910> an<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.270> minor<00:00:27.540> chord<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.970> basically<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
have an a minor chord and basically the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.640 
have an a minor chord and basically the
strumming<00:00:30.570> pattern<00:00:30.600> is<00:00:31.050> pretty<00:00:31.080> simple

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
strumming pattern is pretty simple

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.520 
strumming pattern is pretty simple
you're<00:00:34.650> just<00:00:34.890> going<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.070> have<00:00:35.580> an<00:00:35.760> open<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.530> but

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
you're just going to have an open a but

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.930 
you're just going to have an open a but
you're<00:00:37.650> going<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.830> palm<00:00:38.010> mute<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.400> so<00:00:38.790> it's

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
you're going to palm mute it so it's

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.970 
you're going to palm mute it so it's
just<00:00:39.090> you're<00:00:40.080> going<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.260> hit<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.739> twice

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.009 

once<00:00:45.980> through<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.460> whole<00:00:46.609> board<00:00:46.910> and<00:00:47.179> then<00:00:47.480> a

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
once through the whole board and then a

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.520 
once through the whole board and then a
quick<00:00:48.500> little<00:00:48.800> up<00:00:49.550> up<00:00:50.420> strum

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
quick little up up strum

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.350 
quick little up up strum
basically<00:00:53.250> catching<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.790> last<00:00:53.910> three

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
basically catching the last three

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.180 
basically catching the last three
strings<00:00:54.720> so<00:00:55.500> it's<00:00:55.650> just

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.060 

then<00:00:59.970> you're<00:01:00.120> going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.270> switch<00:01:00.360> to<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.660> G<00:01:01.070> and

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
then you're going to switch to a G and

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.870 
then you're going to switch to a G and
you're<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.790> to<00:01:02.850> play<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:04.290> third<00:01:05.250> fret<00:01:05.610> of

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
you're going to play the third fret of

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:18.680 
you're going to play the third fret of
the<00:01:05.990> sixth<00:01:06.990> string<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:08.150> palm<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.420> did

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.530 

and<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.950> this<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.460> basic<00:01:21.880> strumming

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
and it's this the basic strumming

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:38.520 
and it's this the basic strumming
pattern<00:01:22.870> but<00:01:23.170> I'll<00:01:23.290> show<00:01:23.500> it<00:01:23.590> here<00:01:23.830> I<00:01:37.530> mean

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
pattern but I'll show it here I mean

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.730 
pattern but I'll show it here I mean
it's<00:01:38.800> it's<00:01:39.130> it's<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:40.570> little<00:01:40.810> tricky<00:01:41.140> if<00:01:41.260> you

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
it's it's it's a little tricky if you

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.030 
it's it's it's a little tricky if you
know<00:01:42.660> if<00:01:43.660> you're<00:01:43.870> not<00:01:43.990> used<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.320> doing<00:01:44.830> the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
know if you're not used to doing the

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.640 
know if you're not used to doing the
palm<00:01:45.220> muting<00:01:45.580> and<00:01:45.700> like<00:01:46.510> me<00:01:46.720> in<00:01:47.440> between<00:01:49.650> the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
palm muting and like me in between the

00:01:50.650 --> 00:02:06.200 
palm muting and like me in between the
strumming<00:01:51.369> I<00:01:51.520> go<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:54.340> I<00:01:55.300> stop<00:01:56.670> with<00:01:57.670> my<00:01:58.000> palm

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:19.530 

so<00:02:07.210> it's<00:02:07.390> not<00:02:07.479> just

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.479 

and<00:02:21.480> there's<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:23.110> little<00:02:23.230> intro<00:02:23.920> lick<00:02:24.310> he

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
and there's the little intro lick he

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.780 
and there's the little intro lick he
does<00:02:24.700> is<00:02:25.030> just<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:26.349> third<00:02:26.590> fret<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.189> the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
does is just a the third fret of the

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.850 
does is just a the third fret of the
e-string

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
e-string

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.350 
e-string
play<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.520> once<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:31.030> then<00:02:31.120> open

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
play it once and then open

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.630 
play it once and then open
third<00:02:33.360> fret<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:34.010> B<00:02:35.010> string<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.819> then<00:02:36.060> open

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
third fret of the B string and then open

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.380 
third fret of the B string and then open
second<00:02:38.640> fret<00:02:38.819> of<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:38.970> g<00:02:39.180> string<00:02:39.209> open<00:02:40.160> and

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390

then second fret of the D 2nd fret of
the<00:02:46.290> key<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.940> it's<00:02:48.030> just

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.280

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
something like that took I can't

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.370 
something like that took I can't
remember<00:03:10.209> exactly<00:03:10.420> which<00:03:10.780> one<00:03:10.930> so<00:03:11.110> he<00:03:11.230> goes

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
remember exactly which one so he goes

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:19.000 
remember exactly which one so he goes
from<00:03:11.650> a<00:03:11.920> minor

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.190 

back<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.300> a<00:03:20.330> money

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
back to the a money

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.350 
back to the a money
and<00:03:23.200> then

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.250 

which<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.560> open<00:03:29.430> e<00:03:32.120> 2nd<00:03:33.120> fret<00:03:33.270> of<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.390> a<00:03:33.450> 2nd

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
which is a open e 2nd fret of the a 2nd

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.559 
which is a open e 2nd fret of the a 2nd
fret<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.530> D<00:03:34.740> and<00:03:35.630> 1st<00:03:36.630> fret<00:03:36.840> of<00:03:36.960> the<00:03:36.990> G

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.289 

and<00:03:42.110> he<00:03:42.829> plays<00:03:43.280> it<00:03:43.459> in<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.610> same<00:03:43.819> pattern<00:03:44.030> it's

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
and he plays it in the same pattern it's

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:51.080 
and he plays it in the same pattern it's
just<00:03:44.510> that<00:03:44.659> one<00:03:44.989> too

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.520 

so<00:03:52.090> it's<00:03:52.300> just<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.660> same<00:03:52.959> pattern<00:03:53.200> through

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
so it's just the same pattern through

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.490 
so it's just the same pattern through
the<00:03:53.620> whole<00:03:53.769> song<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.900> that's<00:03:55.900> basically<00:03:56.349> it

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
the whole song and that's basically it

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.809 
the whole song and that's basically it
for<00:03:56.800> the<00:03:56.890> song<00:03:58.290> just<00:03:59.340> you<00:04:00.340> kind<00:04:00.519> of<00:04:00.580> have<00:04:00.700> to

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
for the song just you kind of have to
