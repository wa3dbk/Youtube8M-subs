Four member I believe the wall means she
obviously<00:03:15.040> is<00:03:15.400> she<00:03:15.610> stated<00:03:15.940> that<00:03:16.120> at<00:03:16.810> the

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
obviously is she stated that at the

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.630 
obviously is she stated that at the
beginning<00:03:17.380> when<00:03:17.650> we<00:03:17.770> first<00:03:17.800> spoke<00:03:18.160> with<00:03:18.490> her

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.730 
actually when I first got the mega stone
I<00:04:34.070> used<00:04:34.700> it<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.360> tested<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:36.020> in<00:04:36.140> battle<00:04:36.500> so<00:04:36.710> I

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
I used it and I tested it in battle so I

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.800 
I used it and I tested it in battle so I
mean<00:04:36.950> it<00:04:37.040> was<00:04:37.340> like<00:04:37.460> an<00:04:37.670> extended<00:04:38.180> cutscene

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
mean it was like an extended cutscene

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.380 
mean it was like an extended cutscene
it's<00:04:39.350> probably<00:04:39.800> why<00:04:39.950> it<00:04:40.010> never<00:04:40.370> ridden<00:04:41.060> image

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
it's probably why it never ridden image
