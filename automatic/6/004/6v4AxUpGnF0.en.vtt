00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.569 
literally just blindsided our whole team
there<00:01:00.930> was<00:01:01.050> no<00:01:01.410> signs<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:02.039> anything<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.550> that

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
there was no signs of anything like that

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.549 
there was no signs of anything like that
like<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.090> didn't<00:01:03.329> he<00:01:03.719> wasn't<00:01:03.899> being<00:01:04.080> distant

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
like we didn't he wasn't being distant

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.380 
like we didn't he wasn't being distant
like<00:01:04.860> Brian's<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.369> most<00:01:05.580> distant<00:01:05.909> person<00:01:06.150> I

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
like Brian's the most distant person I

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.080 
like Brian's the most distant person I
know<00:01:06.450> from<00:01:06.780> everybody<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.650> guess<00:01:08.280> that

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
know from everybody so I guess that

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.120 
know from everybody so I guess that
benefits<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:10.280> last<00:01:11.280> play<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.850> don't<00:01:11.970> know<00:01:13.130> we

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
benefits is last play I don't know we

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.350 
benefits is last play I don't know we
don't<00:01:14.189> know<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:14.520> we're<00:01:14.610> gonna<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.180> don't

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
don't know what we're gonna do we don't

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.840 
don't know what we're gonna do we don't
know<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:16.320> really<00:01:16.530> don't<00:01:16.619> know<00:01:16.799> like

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
know we really don't know like

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.039 
know we really don't know like
necessarily<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.060> role<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.659> he<00:01:18.780> played

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
necessarily like the role that he played

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.870 
necessarily like the role that he played
like<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.560> thought<00:01:19.770> our<00:01:19.950> team<00:01:20.130> was<00:01:20.310> perfect<00:01:20.729> with

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
like I thought our team was perfect with

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.570 
like I thought our team was perfect with
us<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.600> thought<00:01:22.320> we<00:01:22.470> had<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> mean

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
us for I thought we had like you I mean

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.550 
us for I thought we had like you I mean
we<00:01:23.759> didn't<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.119> better<00:01:24.509> Slayers<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.380> don't

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
we didn't have better Slayers I don't

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.320 
we didn't have better Slayers I don't
think<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.009> pistola<00:01:26.340> formal<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.880> snipe<00:01:27.119> down

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
think that pistola formal and snipe down

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.289 
think that pistola formal and snipe down
but<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:28.020> beat<00:01:28.170> them<00:01:28.409> like<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:28.860> 3:1<00:01:29.250> them<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.670> we

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
but we beat them like we 3:1 them and we

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.969 
but we beat them like we 3:1 them and we
beat<00:01:30.509> every<00:01:30.900> other<00:01:30.990> team<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.409> their<00:01:31.590> way<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:31.740> to

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
beat every other team on their way up to

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.550 
beat every other team on their way up to
the<00:01:32.070> top<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:33.119> think<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.110> team<00:01:34.380> like

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the top and I think to have a team like

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.140 
the top and I think to have a team like
that<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.009> chemistry<00:01:35.460> like<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.790> is

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
that and have chemistry like that is

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.300 
that and have chemistry like that is
better<00:01:36.600> than<00:01:36.869> having<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.680> know<00:01:37.770> some<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
better than having you know some of the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.700 
better than having you know some of the
best<00:01:38.430> players<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.880> your<00:01:38.909> team<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.500> know<00:01:40.500> we

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
best players on your team you know we

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.230 
best players on your team you know we
won<00:01:40.950> with<00:01:41.100> communication<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.759> small<00:01:42.030> talk

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
won with communication and small talk

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.840 
won with communication and small talk
and<00:01:42.600> then<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.439> we<00:01:43.590> won<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:43.979> pretty<00:01:44.280> pretty

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
and then and we won like pretty pretty

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.999 
and then and we won like pretty pretty
nicely<00:01:45.439> coming<00:01:46.439> through<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.649> losers<00:01:46.979> bracket

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
nicely coming through the losers bracket

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.859 
nicely coming through the losers bracket
so<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.399> guess<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.090> pretty<00:01:51.390> much<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.780> like

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
so I guess this is pretty much just like

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.859 
so I guess this is pretty much just like
this<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.229> like<00:01:52.320> an<00:01:52.470> informative<00:01:53.689> notice<00:01:54.689> I

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
this is like an informative notice I

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.840 
this is like an informative notice I
