it<00:00:36.960> see<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.680> looks<00:00:37.860> good<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.340> know<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.820> you

it see it looks good I know that you
should<00:00:39.030> always<00:00:39.149> replace<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.660> seal<00:00:39.840> when

should always replace to seal when

should always replace to seal when
you're<00:00:40.110> doing<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:40.649> from<00:00:41.070> what<00:00:41.250> I

I<00:01:00.859> you<00:01:01.859> know<00:01:01.980> I'm<00:01:02.879> moving<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:04.070> nice

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
I you know I'm moving this and it's nice

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.500 
I you know I'm moving this and it's nice
and<00:01:05.309> tight<00:01:05.489> there<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.820> some<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.150> hear<00:01:06.330> some

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
and tight there is some you hear some

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.030 
and tight there is some you hear some
stuff<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> inside<00:01:07.409> here<00:01:07.740> when<00:01:07.920> you're

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
stuff on the inside here when you're

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.010 
stuff on the inside here when you're
turning<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.790> assume<00:01:09.720> that's<00:01:09.960> because

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
turning that I assume that's because

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.730 
turning that I assume that's because
there's<00:01:10.439> no<00:01:10.670> I<00:01:12.229> don't<00:01:13.229> know<00:01:13.290> if<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.530> hear

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
there's no I don't know if you can hear

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.359 
there's no I don't know if you can hear
that

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
that

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.640 
that
it's<00:01:14.869> because<00:01:15.869> there's<00:01:16.020> no<00:01:16.140> fluid<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.530> there

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
it's because there's no fluid in there

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.039 
it's because there's no fluid in there
maybe<00:01:16.830> or<00:01:17.070> maybe<00:01:17.189> that's<00:01:17.400> normal<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.049> before

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
maybe or maybe that's normal but before

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.440 
maybe or maybe that's normal but before
if<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.610> kind<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.640> put<00:01:20.850> your<00:01:20.970> finger<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.270> here

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
if you kind of put your finger in here

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.130 
if you kind of put your finger in here
and<00:01:21.570> move<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.830> moved<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.850> out<00:01:24.140> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
and move this this moved in and out the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.660 
and move this this moved in and out the
other<00:01:25.170> side<00:01:25.350> moving<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.009> out<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> little

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
other side moving in and out so a little

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.920 
other side moving in and out so a little
bit<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.939> play<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.299> front<00:01:27.570> differential

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
bit of play on the front differential

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.690 
bit of play on the front differential
bearing<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.650> I'm<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:28.920> excited<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.520> got

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
bearing so I'm really excited that I got

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.480 
bearing so I'm really excited that I got
these<00:01:29.850> replaced<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.720> lot<00:01:31.590> more<00:01:31.950> work<00:01:32.189> than<00:01:32.220> I

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
these replaced a lot more work than I

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.969 
these replaced a lot more work than I
anticipated<00:01:33.049> to<00:01:34.049> take<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.380> out<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.650> do<00:01:34.860> this

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
anticipated to take this out and do this

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.170 
anticipated to take this out and do this
but<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.340> know<00:01:35.430> at<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.729> end<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> day

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
but you know at the end of the day

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.749 
but you know at the end of the day
you're<00:01:37.020> doing<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.259> yourself<00:01:37.590> you're<00:01:38.579> not

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
you're doing it yourself you're not

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.190 
you're doing it yourself you're not
putting<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.150> trust<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.600> someone<00:01:39.780> else<00:01:39.990> it

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
putting the trust and someone else it

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.010 
putting the trust and someone else it
might<00:01:40.350> mess<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.710> up<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.420> if<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.540> ever<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.869> to

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
might mess it up and if I ever have to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.679 
might mess it up and if I ever have to
redo<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.350> again<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:44.009> gonna<00:01:44.100> be<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.310> lot<00:01:44.520> easier

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
redo it again it's gonna be a lot easier

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.969 
redo it again it's gonna be a lot easier
which<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:46.020> probably<00:01:46.290> shouldn't<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.860> do

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
which I probably shouldn't have to do

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.730 
which I probably shouldn't have to do
for<00:01:47.189> another<00:01:48.170> depending<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.350> how<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.530> ride

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
for another depending on how to ride

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.480 
for another depending on how to ride
maybe<00:01:49.920> another<00:01:50.899> 1500<00:01:51.899> miles<00:01:52.140> or<00:01:52.619> two<00:01:52.979> thousand

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
maybe another 1500 miles or two thousand

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.399 
maybe another 1500 miles or two thousand
miles<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.880> think<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.750> was<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:54.960> feel<00:01:55.380> I

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
miles I think this was the feel I

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.039 
miles I think this was the feel I
definitely<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:56.100> was<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.430> original

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
definitely this was the original

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.090 
definitely this was the original
bearings<00:01:58.049> inside<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.590> front<00:01:58.890> differential

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
bearings inside this front differential

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.590 
bearings inside this front differential
from<00:02:02.100> when<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.250> bought<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.729> because<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.119> person

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
from when I bought it because the person

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.630 
from when I bought it because the person
that<00:02:03.719> had<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.020> definitely<00:02:04.439> didn't<00:02:04.680> replace

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
that had it definitely didn't replace

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.670 
that had it definitely didn't replace
the<00:02:05.820> bearings<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:07.290> anyway

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
the bearings in this so anyway

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.059 
the bearings in this so anyway
trying<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.759> be<00:02:09.030> as<00:02:09.149> descriptive<00:02:09.810> as<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.770> on

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
trying to be as descriptive as I can on

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.300 
trying to be as descriptive as I can on
you<00:02:12.000> know<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.239> whole<00:02:12.420> front<00:02:12.629> differential

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
you know this whole front differential

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.430 
you know this whole front differential
I<00:02:13.700> did<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.880> couple<00:02:14.060> videos<00:02:14.300> nothing<00:02:14.870> in<00:02:14.990> detail

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
I did a couple videos nothing in detail

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.130 
I did a couple videos nothing in detail
about<00:02:15.940> just<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.330> know<00:02:17.420> someone<00:02:17.780> that<00:02:17.810> wants

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
about just you know someone that wants

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.130 
about just you know someone that wants
to<00:02:18.200> be<00:02:18.459> inspired<00:02:19.510> can<00:02:20.510> listen<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:20.870> this<00:02:20.959> video

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
to be inspired can listen to this video

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.530 
to be inspired can listen to this video
and<00:02:21.560> maybe<00:02:22.180> rebuild<00:02:23.180> their<00:02:23.330> front

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
and maybe rebuild their front

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.330 
and maybe rebuild their front
differential<00:02:23.930> I'll<00:02:24.200> hopefully<00:02:24.890> do<00:02:25.010> some<00:02:25.040> more

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
differential I'll hopefully do some more

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.720 
differential I'll hopefully do some more
videos<00:02:25.510> when<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.540> put<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.870> in<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:27.550> stuff<00:02:28.550> like

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
videos when I put it in and stuff like

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.570 
videos when I put it in and stuff like
that<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.590> maybe<00:02:30.590> if<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:30.920> whole<00:02:31.069> thing<00:02:31.280> blows

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
that and maybe if the whole thing blows

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.870 
that and maybe if the whole thing blows
up<00:02:32.680> we'll<00:02:33.680> do<00:02:33.800> some<00:02:33.980> videos<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.489> what<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:34.670> did

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
up we'll do some videos of what I did

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.120 
up we'll do some videos of what I did
wrong<00:02:35.060> but<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.600> said<00:02:35.900> obviously<00:02:36.560> should<00:02:37.010> be

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
wrong but I said obviously should be

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.320 
wrong but I said obviously should be
fine<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:38.209> put<00:02:38.810> some<00:02:39.850> with<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:40.940> electrical

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
fine I put some with the electrical

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.380 
fine I put some with the electrical
goals<00:02:41.540> into<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.020> front<00:02:42.940> differential<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.239> was

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
goals into the front differential it was

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.390 
goals into the front differential it was
kind<00:02:44.630> of<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:45.290> piece<00:02:45.530> was<00:02:45.709> hanging<00:02:46.070> out<00:02:46.190> or

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
kind of the piece was hanging out or

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.130 
kind of the piece was hanging out or
whatever<00:02:46.670> not<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.510> huge<00:02:47.780> deal<00:02:47.930> but<00:02:48.140> I<00:02:49.150> used<00:02:50.150> Sam

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.250 

what<00:02:54.140> do<00:02:54.200> they<00:02:54.290> call<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:54.709> here<00:02:56.590> black<00:02:57.590> RTV

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
what do they call it here black RTV

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:06.780 
what do they call it here black RTV
adhesive<00:03:00.430> sealant<00:03:01.430> to<00:03:02.239> kind<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:04.360> you<00:03:05.360> know<00:03:05.480> I

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
adhesive sealant to kind of you know I

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.300 
adhesive sealant to kind of you know I
can't<00:03:07.790> see<00:03:07.970> it<00:03:08.060> is<00:03:08.269> dark<00:03:08.540> but<00:03:08.630> anyway<00:03:09.500> it<00:03:10.250> just

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
can't see it is dark but anyway it just

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.800 
can't see it is dark but anyway it just
wasn't<00:03:10.819> sealed<00:03:11.000> very<00:03:11.300> well<00:03:11.510> without

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
wasn't sealed very well without

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.680 
wasn't sealed very well without
electrical<00:03:12.430> park<00:03:13.430> went<00:03:13.670> in<00:03:13.730> there<00:03:13.910> so<00:03:14.390> I<00:03:14.420> did

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
electrical park went in there so I did

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.610 
electrical park went in there so I did
that<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:17.000> know<00:03:17.239> I<00:03:17.450> could<00:03:17.690> have<00:03:17.780> cleaned

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
that and you know I could have cleaned

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.479 
that and you know I could have cleaned
this<00:03:18.769> whole<00:03:18.980> thing<00:03:19.190> up<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:21.130> know<00:03:22.130> shaved

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
this whole thing up and you know shaved

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:23.860 
this whole thing up and you know shaved
it<00:03:22.670> down<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:23.239> made<00:03:23.329> it<00:03:23.420> look<00:03:23.510> all<00:03:23.690> beautiful

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
it down and made it look all beautiful

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.930 
it down and made it look all beautiful
but<00:03:24.410> I'm<00:03:24.920> not<00:03:25.130> trying<00:03:25.340> to<00:03:25.459> win<00:03:25.610> a<00:03:25.640> beauty

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
but I'm not trying to win a beauty

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.430 
but I'm not trying to win a beauty
contest<00:03:25.970> here<00:03:26.630> I'm<00:03:26.720> just<00:03:26.840> trying<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.230> make

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
contest here I'm just trying to make

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.020 
contest here I'm just trying to make
this<00:03:28.360> be<00:03:29.360> reliable<00:03:29.930> because<00:03:30.140> we<00:03:30.380> go<00:03:30.579> up<00:03:31.579> to<00:03:31.730> 100

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
this be reliable because we go up to 100

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.580 
this be reliable because we go up to 100
miles<00:03:32.180> in<00:03:32.450> one<00:03:32.630> trip<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.079> if<00:03:33.140> it<00:03:33.260> breaks<00:03:33.380> down

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
miles in one trip and if it breaks down

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.690 
miles in one trip and if it breaks down
we're<00:03:34.220> in<00:03:34.310> trouble

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
we're in trouble

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.860 
we're in trouble
so<00:03:34.959> anyway<00:03:35.959> this<00:03:36.140> also<00:03:36.590> went<00:03:36.799> in<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.160> out<00:03:37.870> this

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
so anyway this also went in and out this

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.539 
so anyway this also went in and out this
had<00:03:39.170> plane<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:39.709> they<00:03:39.769> went<00:03:39.950> in<00:03:40.100> and<00:03:40.220> out<00:03:40.310> you

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
had plane and they went in and out you

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.099 
had plane and they went in and out you
know<00:03:40.640> it<00:03:40.820> doesn't<00:03:41.329> appear<00:03:41.600> to<00:03:41.630> be<00:03:41.750> going<00:03:41.840> in

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
know it doesn't appear to be going in

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.340 
know it doesn't appear to be going in
and<00:03:42.260> out<00:03:42.350> Oh<00:03:42.700> big<00:03:43.700> thing<00:03:44.200> packing<00:03:45.200> the

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
and out Oh big thing packing the

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.470 
and out Oh big thing packing the
bearings<00:03:45.769> I<00:03:46.010> did<00:03:46.579> a<00:03:46.609> little<00:03:46.940> bit<00:03:47.090> of<00:03:47.120> research

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
bearings I did a little bit of research

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.640 
bearings I did a little bit of research
and<00:03:47.600> talked<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:47.840> some<00:03:48.109> mechanics<00:03:48.500> they

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
and talked to some mechanics they

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.920 
and talked to some mechanics they
recommended<00:03:49.280> I<00:03:49.400> pack<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.850> bearings<00:03:50.120> in<00:03:50.570> here

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
recommended I pack the bearings in here

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.530 
recommended I pack the bearings in here
and<00:03:51.049> the<00:03:51.500> other<00:03:51.650> side<00:03:51.920> this<00:03:52.549> came<00:03:52.820> this<00:03:53.329> came

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
and the other side this came this came

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.580 
and the other side this came this came
pre-packed<00:03:54.489> these<00:03:55.489> did<00:03:55.850> not<00:03:56.060> so<00:03:56.390> I<00:03:56.450> did<00:03:57.380> pack

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
pre-packed these did not so I did pack

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.479 
pre-packed these did not so I did pack
these<00:03:57.829> a<00:03:57.859> little<00:03:58.160> bit<00:03:58.250> probably<00:03:58.760> about<00:03:58.880> 50%<00:03:59.440> I

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
these a little bit probably about 50% I

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.099 
these a little bit probably about 50% I
saw<00:04:01.489> some<00:04:01.760> mixed<00:04:02.000> reviews<00:04:02.120> online<00:04:02.480> I<00:04:02.690> said<00:04:03.019> you

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
saw some mixed reviews online I said you

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.880 
saw some mixed reviews online I said you
know<00:04:03.230> if<00:04:03.980> you<00:04:04.070> pack<00:04:04.340> in<00:04:04.609> you<00:04:05.420> know<00:04:05.540> gets<00:04:06.410> you

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
know if you pack in you know gets you

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.569 
know if you pack in you know gets you

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
know it dust and dirt gets in there but

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.099 
know it dust and dirt gets in there but
there's<00:04:10.790> seals<00:04:10.970> in<00:04:11.209> here<00:04:11.329> too<00:04:11.540> so<00:04:11.840> I<00:04:11.900> mean

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
there's seals in here too so I mean

gets inside the front if it'll attract
it<00:04:17.239> but<00:04:17.870> you<00:04:18.799> know<00:04:18.890> what<00:04:19.039> I<00:04:19.070> don't<00:04:19.220> want<00:04:19.459> the

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
it but you know what I don't want the

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.250 
it but you know what I don't want the
bearing<00:04:19.820> to<00:04:19.850> overheat<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:20.570> anything<00:04:21.200> to

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
bearing to overheat and anything to

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.810 
bearing to overheat and anything to
happen<00:04:21.620> when<00:04:21.799> I<00:04:21.859> first<00:04:22.130> started<00:04:22.400> out<00:04:22.460> so<00:04:22.760> I

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
happen when I first started out so I

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.730 
happen when I first started out so I
packed<00:04:23.060> a<00:04:23.210> little<00:04:23.360> bit<00:04:23.630> not<00:04:24.080> much<00:04:24.110> and<00:04:24.530> I<00:04:24.560> wiped

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
packed a little bit not much and I wiped

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.070 
packed a little bit not much and I wiped
it<00:04:24.860> off<00:04:24.979> with<00:04:25.159> a<00:04:25.220> rag<00:04:25.400> so<00:04:25.669> anyway<00:04:25.970> big
