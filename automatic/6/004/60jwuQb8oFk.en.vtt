that we've got these folk tunes and

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.870 
that we've got these folk tunes and
reefs<00:01:28.420> of<00:01:28.720> them<00:01:29.680> as<00:01:29.799> a<00:01:29.830> jazz<00:01:30.130> musician<00:01:30.549> would

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:49.490 
and thought what can we do with this I
think<00:01:37.150> it's<00:01:37.300> a<00:01:37.450> really<00:01:38.100> exciting<00:01:39.100> new<00:01:39.369> sound

so<00:04:45.760> as<00:04:46.060> to<00:04:46.150> bring<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:46.480> sound<00:04:46.780> back<00:04:47.110> a<00:04:47.170> bit<00:04:47.440> I

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
so as to bring the sound back a bit I

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.060 
so as to bring the sound back a bit I
use<00:04:47.860> hot<00:04:48.220> rods<00:04:48.490> which<00:04:48.640> is<00:04:48.820> a<00:04:48.850> group<00:04:49.570> of<00:04:50.070> small

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
use hot rods which is a group of small

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.860 
use hot rods which is a group of small
twigs<00:04:51.640> which<00:04:52.000> make<00:04:52.210> it<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.390> little<00:04:52.510> bit<00:04:52.720> of<00:04:52.780> a

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
twigs which make it a little bit of a

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.960 
twigs which make it a little bit of a
lighter<00:04:53.140> sound<00:04:53.500> and<00:04:53.800> in<00:04:54.370> doing<00:04:54.580> that<00:04:54.760> because

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
lighter sound and in doing that because

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.610 
lighter sound and in doing that because
there's<00:04:55.270> only<00:04:55.330> three<00:04:55.690> of<00:04:55.750> us<00:04:55.870> rather<00:04:56.410> than

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
there's only three of us rather than

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.070 
there's only three of us rather than
feeling<00:04:57.100> that<00:04:57.370> we<00:04:57.460> have<00:04:57.640> to<00:04:57.820> fill<00:04:58.150> every<00:04:58.840> ounce

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
feeling that we have to fill every ounce

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.020 
feeling that we have to fill every ounce
and<00:04:59.410> every<00:04:59.710> second<00:05:00.130> of<00:05:00.190> every<00:05:00.400> piece<00:05:00.580> of<00:05:00.730> music

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
and every second of every piece of music

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.570 
and every second of every piece of music
how<00:05:01.630> we<00:05:01.810> try<00:05:02.020> and<00:05:02.080> make<00:05:02.230> it<00:05:02.260> nice<00:05:02.650> and<00:05:02.680> spacious

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
how we try and make it nice and spacious

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.910 
how we try and make it nice and spacious
which<00:05:04.030> gives<00:05:04.930> them<00:05:05.050> using<00:05:05.320> a<00:05:05.350> chance<00:05:05.590> to

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
which gives them using a chance to

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:33.790 
which gives them using a chance to
debris

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:44.140 

I<00:05:40.389> think<00:05:41.389> it's<00:05:41.740> playing<00:05:42.740> folk<00:05:43.069> music<00:05:43.099> it<00:05:43.909> has<00:05:44.090> a

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
I think it's playing folk music it has a

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.170 
I think it's playing folk music it has a
connection<00:05:44.599> to<00:05:45.220> people<00:05:46.220> they<00:05:46.699> hear<00:05:46.970> those

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
connection to people they hear those

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.820 
connection to people they hear those
melodies<00:05:47.629> and<00:05:48.020> there's<00:05:48.409> a<00:05:48.500> connection

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
melodies and there's a connection

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.070 
melodies and there's a connection
between<00:05:49.099> folk<00:05:49.940> melodies<00:05:50.360> from<00:05:50.479> around<00:05:50.840> the

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
between folk melodies from around the

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.230 
between folk melodies from around the
world<00:05:51.229> so<00:05:51.620> if<00:05:51.680> you<00:05:51.800> playing<00:05:52.099> irish<00:05:52.699> melodies

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
world so if you playing irish melodies

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.379 
world so if you playing irish melodies
or<00:05:53.270> peruvian<00:05:54.169> melodies<00:05:54.919> even<00:05:55.550> african<00:05:56.120> tunes

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
or peruvian melodies even african tunes

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.719 
or peruvian melodies even african tunes
there<00:05:56.690> is<00:05:56.810> a<00:05:56.840> connection<00:05:57.229> there<00:05:57.740> and<00:05:58.159> i<00:05:58.520> think

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
there is a connection there and i think

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.149 
there is a connection there and i think
people<00:05:58.909> do<00:05:59.240> have<00:05:59.479> a<00:05:59.539> connection<00:06:00.020> and<00:06:00.349> it's

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:01.159 
people do have a connection and it's

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.960 
people do have a connection and it's
just<00:06:01.370> something<00:06:01.759> that's<00:06:02.409> kind<00:06:03.409> of<00:06:03.590> in<00:06:04.340> you<00:06:04.729> and

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
just something that's kind of in you and

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.350 
just something that's kind of in you and
you<00:06:06.009> find<00:06:07.009> a<00:06:07.129> connection<00:06:07.490> with<00:06:07.879> that<00:06:07.909> music

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
you find a connection with that music

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.450 
you find a connection with that music
and<00:06:09.349> we're<00:06:09.530> just<00:06:09.710> putting<00:06:09.949> a<00:06:10.159> slightly

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
and we're just putting a slightly

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.300 
and we're just putting a slightly
different<00:06:10.990> twist<00:06:11.990> on<00:06:12.349> the<00:06:12.530> normal<00:06:12.919> way<00:06:13.069> that

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
different twist on the normal way that

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:28.580 
different twist on the normal way that
you<00:06:13.460> would<00:06:13.580> perhaps<00:06:13.849> hear<00:06:14.210> these<00:06:14.389> tunes

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.650 

you
