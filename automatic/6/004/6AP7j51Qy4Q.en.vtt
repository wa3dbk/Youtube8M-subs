attaches<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.830> bottom<00:02:37.100> there<00:02:37.250> so<00:02:37.459> it<00:02:37.550> actually

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
attaches the bottom there so it actually

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.370

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
the side panel pulled off some of your

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.270 
the side panel pulled off some of your
curious<00:02:54.230> about<00:02:54.380> my<00:02:54.410> system<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:54.950> what<00:02:55.100> i<00:02:55.130> have

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
curious about my system and what i have

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.830 
curious about my system and what i have
in<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:56.330> case<00:02:56.540> is<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.810> carbide<00:02:57.260> 500r<00:02:58.250> i<00:02:58.310> think

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
in it the case is a carbide 500r i think

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.970 
in it the case is a carbide 500r i think
so<00:02:59.840> that's<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.050> case<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.410> sets<00:03:00.620> in<00:03:00.769> and<00:03:00.890> this

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
so that's the case it sets in and this

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.309 
so that's the case it sets in and this
is<00:03:01.100> my<00:03:01.220> build<00:03:01.489> for<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:02.569> enthusiasts<00:03:03.200> out

is my build for you enthusiasts out

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.600 
is my build for you enthusiasts out
there<00:03:03.380> who<00:03:03.650> build<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.950> lot<00:03:04.069> of<00:03:04.160> computers

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
there who build a lot of computers

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.059 
there who build a lot of computers
forgive<00:03:04.940> me<00:03:05.120> because<00:03:05.269> my<00:03:06.200> wiring<00:03:06.500> probably

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
forgive me because my wiring probably

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.620 
forgive me because my wiring probably
wasn't<00:03:07.340> perfect<00:03:07.700> this<00:03:07.760> is<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:07.940> first<00:03:08.239> field<00:03:08.480> i

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
wasn't perfect this is the first field i

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.720 
wasn't perfect this is the first field i
ever<00:03:08.780> did<00:03:09.019> but<00:03:09.860> yeah<00:03:09.980> that's<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.400> inside<00:03:10.700> of

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
ever did but yeah that's the inside of

ever did but yeah that's the inside of
my<00:03:10.940> my<00:03:11.360> computer<00:03:11.840> this<00:03:12.500> is<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.830> upgrade<00:03:13.160> i

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
my my computer this is the upgrade i

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.530 
my my computer this is the upgrade i
really<00:03:13.519> wanted<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.790> tell<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.090> about<00:03:14.180> right

here<00:03:15.019> this<00:03:15.709> is<00:03:15.860> my<00:03:16.069> new<00:03:16.250> gtx<00:03:17.000> 970<00:03:17.690> card<00:03:17.989> i<00:03:18.140> think

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
here this is my new gtx 970 card i think

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.069 
here this is my new gtx 970 card i think
some<00:03:18.470> of<00:03:18.500> these<00:03:18.620> are<00:03:18.680> in<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:18.920> way<00:03:19.040> but<00:03:19.299> ya<00:03:20.299> know

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
some of these are in the way but ya know

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.030 
some of these are in the way but ya know
if<00:03:21.140> i<00:03:21.200> can<00:03:21.260> get<00:03:21.380> it<00:03:21.470> out<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.620> way<00:03:21.650> there<00:03:21.860> it<00:03:21.920> is

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
if i can get it out the way there it is

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.890 
if i can get it out the way there it is
anyway<00:03:22.730> that's<00:03:22.880> it<00:03:22.970> is<00:03:23.090> how<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.510> sits<00:03:23.660> in<00:03:23.810> my

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
anyway that's it is how it sits in my

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
here's an i7 4770k believe there's a

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.550 
here's an i7 4770k believe there's a
couple<00:04:05.239> of<00:04:05.420> better<00:04:05.570> processors<00:04:06.170> out<00:04:06.260> now<00:04:06.440> but

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
couple of better processors out now but

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.690 
couple of better processors out now but
at<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.680> time<00:04:06.739> that<00:04:07.040> thing<00:04:07.190> was<00:04:07.280> a<00:04:07.310> beast<00:04:07.519> and

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
at the time that thing was a beast and

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.460 
at the time that thing was a beast and
it's<00:04:07.820> still<00:04:08.030> a<00:04:08.060> fantastic<00:04:08.810> processor<00:04:09.380> if

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
it's still a fantastic processor if

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.900 
it's still a fantastic processor if
you're<00:04:09.590> looking<00:04:09.799> for<00:04:09.829> a<00:04:10.010> good<00:04:10.160> one<00:04:10.340> though<00:04:10.880> i

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
you're looking for a good one though i

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.849 
you're looking for a good one though i
do<00:04:11.030> believe<00:04:11.269> they<00:04:11.510> have<00:04:11.630> like<00:04:11.750> a<00:04:11.780> 4970<00:04:12.739> or

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
do believe they have like a 4970 or

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.500 
do believe they have like a 4970 or
something<00:04:13.100> up<00:04:13.220> that's<00:04:13.340> better<00:04:13.609> now<00:04:13.850> or

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
something up that's better now or

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.849 
something up that's better now or
basically<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:14.930> same<00:04:15.049> price<00:04:15.350> that<00:04:15.380> paid<00:04:15.680> for

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
basically the same price that paid for

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.599 
basically the same price that paid for
that<00:04:15.980> one<00:04:16.660> that's<00:04:17.660> probably<00:04:17.780> see<00:04:18.200> there<00:04:18.380> so<00:04:18.609> my

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
that one that's probably see there so my

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.570 
that one that's probably see there so my
computer<00:04:19.970> came<00:04:20.180> with<00:04:20.450> a<00:04:20.720> total<00:04:21.169> of<00:04:21.349> two<00:04:21.769> hard

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
disk trays there's one here and there

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
which you can it's very small and I

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.760 
which you can it's very small and I
don't<00:04:48.480> think<00:04:48.810> you're<00:04:48.960> gonna<00:04:49.050> be<00:04:49.230> able<00:04:49.260> to<00:04:49.530> see

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
it yeah there you can just barely see it

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.470 
it yeah there you can just barely see it
there<00:04:52.170> that<00:04:52.800> is<00:04:53.010> my<00:04:53.190> solid<00:04:53.880> state<00:04:54.090> drive<00:04:54.330> that

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
there that is my solid state drive that

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.880 
there that is my solid state drive that
little<00:04:54.690> bitty<00:04:54.840> one<00:04:55.020> on<00:04:55.140> the<00:04:55.230> top<00:04:55.380> shelf<00:04:55.440> there

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
little bitty one on the top shelf there

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.040 
little bitty one on the top shelf there
so<00:04:56.340> solid<00:04:56.670> state<00:04:56.850> drives<00:04:57.120> very<00:04:57.300> very<00:04:57.780> small

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
so solid state drives very very small

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.920 
so solid state drives very very small
it's<00:04:58.380> a<00:04:58.860> samsung<00:04:59.340> solid-state<00:05:00.240> drive<00:05:00.540> that's

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
it's a samsung solid-state drive that's
