sits in the real
position<00:02:12.319> ok<00:02:12.830> so<00:02:13.550> for<00:02:13.940> holding<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.420> guitar

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
position ok so for holding the guitar

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.619 
position ok so for holding the guitar
just<00:02:15.410> remember<00:02:15.830> keep<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.250> roughly<00:02:16.760> in<00:02:17.390> this

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
just remember keep it roughly in this

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.570 
just remember keep it roughly in this
position<00:02:18.080> again<00:02:18.319> this<00:02:18.530> try<00:02:18.830> not<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:19.190> hold<00:02:19.400> it

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
position again this try not to hold it

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.520 
position again this try not to hold it
too<00:02:20.269> low<00:02:20.540> or<00:02:20.840> too<00:02:21.019> high<00:02:21.769> but<00:02:22.580> for<00:02:23.239> beginners<00:02:23.629> if

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
too low or too high but for beginners if

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.470 
too low or too high but for beginners if
let's<00:02:24.800> say<00:02:24.920> this<00:02:25.310> position<00:02:25.849> is<00:02:26.000> still<00:02:26.239> you

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
let's say this position is still you

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.270 
let's say this position is still you
still<00:02:26.720> find<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:27.019> hard<00:02:27.080> for<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.830> Prescotts

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
still find it hard for the Prescotts

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.369 
still find it hard for the Prescotts
instead<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.819> over<00:02:29.120> stretching<00:02:29.420> ahead<00:02:29.690> what

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
instead of over stretching ahead what

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.220 
instead of over stretching ahead what
you<00:02:30.410> want<00:02:30.799> to<00:02:30.890> do<00:02:31.010> is<00:02:31.450> if<00:02:32.450> you're<00:02:32.690> standing<00:02:33.110> up

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
you want to do is if you're standing up

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.220 
you want to do is if you're standing up
increase<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.400> tightness<00:02:34.730> of<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.209> strap<00:02:35.540> so

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
increase the tightness of the strap so

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.979 
increase the tightness of the strap so
that<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:37.060> guitar<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.180> higher<00:02:38.390> because<00:02:38.660> when

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
that the guitar is higher because when

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.750 
that the guitar is higher because when
it's<00:02:39.140> higher<00:02:39.319> it<00:02:39.620> is<00:02:39.769> actually<00:02:40.040> just<00:02:40.340> easier

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
it's higher it is actually just easier

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:49.180 
it's higher it is actually just easier
to<00:02:40.970> reach<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.870> neck<00:02:42.080> so<00:02:45.459> just<00:02:46.459> like<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:48.190> like

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
to reach the neck so just like that like

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.450 
to reach the neck so just like that like
that

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.250 

and<00:02:52.970> that's<00:02:53.150> how<00:02:53.240> you<00:02:53.360> hold<00:02:53.570> your<00:02:53.720> guitar<00:02:53.990> with

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
and that's how you hold your guitar with

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.430 
and that's how you hold your guitar with
your<00:02:54.470> right<00:02:54.920> arm<00:02:54.950> not<00:02:55.910> over<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.750> but<00:02:57.020> just<00:02:57.050> sort

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
your right arm not over it but just sort

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.730 
your right arm not over it but just sort
of<00:02:57.500> resting<00:02:58.010> on<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:59.390> top<00:02:59.600> so<00:03:00.140> that<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.590> have

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
of resting on the top so that you have

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.970 
of resting on the top so that you have
easy<00:03:00.980> reach<00:03:01.280> of<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.580> strings<00:03:02.050> and<00:03:03.050> your<00:03:03.770> left

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
easy reach of the strings and your left

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.650 
easy reach of the strings and your left
hand<00:03:04.220> or<00:03:04.370> right<00:03:04.430> hand<00:03:04.850> if<00:03:05.240> you're<00:03:05.360> left-handed

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
hand or right hand if you're left-handed

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.300 
hand or right hand if you're left-handed
just<00:03:07.390> roughly<00:03:08.390> about<00:03:08.570> 90<00:03:09.170> degrees<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:10.280> the

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
just roughly about 90 degrees to the

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.940 
just roughly about 90 degrees to the
neck<00:03:10.610> with<00:03:11.450> an<00:03:11.570> easy<00:03:11.750> reach<00:03:12.050> 90<00:03:12.410> degrees<00:03:12.710> or

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
neck with an easy reach 90 degrees or

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.690 
neck with an easy reach 90 degrees or
higher<00:03:13.160> not<00:03:13.520> really<00:03:13.850> lower<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:18.700> that's

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
higher not really lower and that's

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.010 
higher not really lower and that's
pretty<00:03:19.850> much<00:03:20.000> how<00:03:20.300> you<00:03:20.330> would<00:03:20.540> hold<00:03:20.810> your

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
pretty much how you would hold your

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.320 
pretty much how you would hold your
guitar
