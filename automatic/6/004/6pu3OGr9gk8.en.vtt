the garden Tower is easiest to assemble
on<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> chair<00:00:40.770> or<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.370> table<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:42.600> want<00:00:42.750> to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
on a chair or on a table you want to

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.490 
on a chair or on a table you want to
match<00:00:43.079> up<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.800> letter<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.550> leg<00:00:44.840> to<00:00:45.840> its

match up the letter on the leg to its
corresponding<00:00:46.890> position<00:00:48.289> so<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:49.590> have

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
corresponding position so here we have

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.689 
corresponding position so here we have
see<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:51.530> washer<00:00:52.530> goes<00:00:52.739> on<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> outside<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.489> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
productivity you're going to be able to

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.630 
productivity you're going to be able to
have<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.840> higher<00:01:24.990> your<00:01:25.229> yields<00:01:25.650> almost<00:01:26.340> no

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
have in the higher your yields almost no

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.690 
have in the higher your yields almost no
matter<00:01:26.790> what<00:01:27.030> you're<00:01:27.150> growing<00:01:27.590> so<00:01:28.590> we're<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.640> a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
matter what you're growing so we're in a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.480 
matter what you're growing so we're in a
shady<00:01:29.939> location<00:01:30.540> now<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:31.439> not<00:01:31.619> perfect<00:01:31.860> but

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
shady location now it's not perfect but

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.719 
shady location now it's not perfect but
it's<00:01:32.850> what<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.329> work<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
it's what we have to work with so the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.560 
it's what we have to work with so the
other<00:01:35.880> thing<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.150> keep<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.049> mind<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.590> that

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
other thing to keep in mind is that

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.080 
other thing to keep in mind is that
these<00:01:39.570> are<00:01:39.630> water<00:01:40.320> sealed<00:01:40.650> oak<00:01:41.340> legs<00:01:41.700> with<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
these are water sealed oak legs with a

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.819 
these are water sealed oak legs with a
3-year<00:01:42.570> sealant

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
3-year sealant

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.370 
3-year sealant
however<00:01:44.670> they<00:01:45.570> really<00:01:45.899> should<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.110> out<00:01:46.350> of

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
however they really should be out of

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.240 
however they really should be out of
contact<00:01:46.979> with<00:01:47.280> soil<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.229> patio<00:01:49.710> or<00:01:50.159> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
contact with soil so on a patio or a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.090 
contact with soil so on a patio or a
hard<00:01:50.700> scape<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.240> any<00:01:51.360> sort<00:01:51.689> they're<00:01:51.990> fine<00:01:52.290> if

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
hard scape of any sort they're fine if

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.800 
hard scape of any sort they're fine if
you<00:01:53.220> were<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.460> put<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.729> tower<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.119> grass<00:01:54.390> I

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
you were to put the tower in grass I

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.050 
you were to put the tower in grass I
recommend<00:01:55.740> using<00:01:55.950> bricks<00:01:56.369> or<00:01:56.610> pavers<00:01:57.030> or

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
recommend using bricks or pavers or

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.359 
recommend using bricks or pavers or
rocks<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.409> keep<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.740> legs<00:01:58.950> out<00:01:59.189> of

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
rocks just to keep the legs out of

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.370 
rocks just to keep the legs out of
contact<00:01:59.759> with<00:01:59.909> moisture<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.659> way<00:02:01.320> you

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
contact with moisture and that way you

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.990 
contact with moisture and that way you
get<00:02:01.619> many<00:02:01.890> many<00:02:02.009> years<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.520> use<00:02:02.700> out<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:02.969> them

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
get many many years of use out of them

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.609 
get many many years of use out of them
so<00:02:05.740> also<00:02:06.740> before<00:02:07.730> you<00:02:07.790> put<00:02:08.240> soil<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:09.050> water

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
so also before you put soil and water

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.340 
so also before you put soil and water
and<00:02:09.950> plants<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.700> compost<00:02:11.180> in<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.390> tower<00:02:11.600> you

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
and plants and compost in the tower you

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.680 
and plants and compost in the tower you
really<00:02:12.590> want<00:02:12.770> it<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:12.950> be<00:02:13.040> level<00:02:13.450> it'll<00:02:14.450> just

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
really want it to be level it'll just

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.570 
really want it to be level it'll just
work<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:15.050> little<00:02:15.170> bit<00:02:15.380> better<00:02:15.620> if<00:02:15.980> it's<00:02:16.370> level

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
work a little bit better if it's level

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.220 
work a little bit better if it's level
it'll<00:02:17.000> be<00:02:17.180> easier<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.570> water<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:20.050> for<00:02:21.050> that

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
it'll be easier to water and for that

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.810 
it'll be easier to water and for that
I'm<00:02:21.440> just<00:02:21.770> going<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:21.920> use<00:02:22.070> that<00:02:22.250> one<00:02:22.430> rock<00:02:24.820> all

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
I'm just going to use that one rock all

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.960 
I'm just going to use that one rock all
right<00:02:25.910> so<00:02:26.900> this<00:02:27.410> is<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.800> compression<00:02:28.370> plug<00:02:28.700> as

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
right so this is the compression plug as

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.290 
right so this is the compression plug as
you<00:02:29.720> turn<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.080> handle<00:02:30.490> this<00:02:31.490> rubber<00:02:32.030> ring

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
you turn the handle this rubber ring

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.160 
you turn the handle this rubber ring
actually<00:02:32.690> expands<00:02:33.140> outward<00:02:34.570> so<00:02:35.570> I'm<00:02:35.960> going<00:02:36.140> to

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
actually expands outward so I'm going to

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.410 
actually expands outward so I'm going to
turn<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:39.250> clockwise<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.670> tighten<00:02:41.120> it

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
turn it clockwise to tighten it

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.980 
turn it clockwise to tighten it
counterclockwise<00:02:42.020> to<00:02:42.650> loosen<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:43.990> so

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
counterclockwise to loosen it so

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.140 
counterclockwise to loosen it so
basically<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:45.620> want<00:02:45.740> to<00:02:45.890> turn<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.310> until<00:02:46.459> the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
basically you want to turn it until the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.740 
basically you want to turn it until the
plug<00:02:47.709> just<00:02:48.709> fits<00:02:48.950> in<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.160> bottom<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:53.630> then

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
plug just fits in the bottom and then

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:02.010 
plug just fits in the bottom and then
you<00:02:53.780> can<00:02:54.020> tighten<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.410> up<00:02:56.080> and<00:02:57.080> it's<00:02:57.980> in<00:02:59.830> and

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
you can tighten it up and it's in and

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.110 
you can tighten it up and it's in and
top<00:03:03.020> cap<00:03:03.320> is<00:03:03.590> pretty<00:03:03.830> self-explanatory

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
top cap is pretty self-explanatory

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.530 
top cap is pretty self-explanatory
there's<00:03:06.310> welded<00:03:07.310> marks<00:03:07.610> on<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.850> inside<00:03:08.180> so

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
there's welded marks on the inside so

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.860 
there's welded marks on the inside so
that<00:03:08.570> it<00:03:08.720> only<00:03:08.930> goes<00:03:09.200> down<00:03:09.470> so<00:03:10.250> far<00:03:10.580> on<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.660> on

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
that it only goes down so far on the on

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.630 
that it only goes down so far on the on
the<00:03:12.230> compost<00:03:12.650> too

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.700 

you
