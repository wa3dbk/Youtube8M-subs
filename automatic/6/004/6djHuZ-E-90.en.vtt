00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
I believe of the manufacturer this is

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.410 
I believe of the manufacturer this is
actually<00:01:32.250> not<00:01:32.400> five<00:01:32.579> by<00:01:32.729> seven<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:33.180> it's<00:01:33.299> more

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
actually not five by seven but it's more

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.120 
actually not five by seven but it's more
narrow<00:01:33.689> more<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> widescreen<00:01:34.530> frame<00:01:34.979> as

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
narrow more like a widescreen frame as

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.710 
narrow more like a widescreen frame as
you<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.340> see<00:01:35.460> there<00:01:35.579> which<00:01:35.790> will<00:01:36.329> work<00:01:36.540> really

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
you can see there which will work really

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.920 
you can see there which will work really
well<00:01:36.869> for<00:01:37.079> our<00:01:37.530> external<00:01:38.009> monitor<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.750> all

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
well for our external monitor so all

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.770 
well for our external monitor so all
we're<00:01:40.049> doing<00:01:40.380> now<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:41.850> mount<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.630> we're

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
we're doing now to mount this is we're

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.080 
we're doing now to mount this is we're
taking<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.979> flash<00:01:44.220> bracket<00:01:44.640> we're<00:01:44.729> pushing

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
taking the flash bracket we're pushing

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.210 
taking the flash bracket we're pushing
the<00:01:45.240> two<00:01:45.390> knobs<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.020> middle<00:01:46.229> there<00:01:46.409> and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the two knobs to the middle there and

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.230

on<00:03:56.049> the<00:03:56.110> frugal<00:03:56.380> cage<00:03:56.560> when<00:03:56.739> I'm<00:03:56.829> using<00:03:56.950> it<00:03:57.130> as

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
on the frugal cage when I'm using it as

but<00:03:59.380> you<00:03:59.650> get<00:03:59.829> the<00:03:59.920> basic<00:04:00.040> idea<00:04:00.310> as<00:04:00.730> you've

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
but you get the basic idea as you've

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.300 
but you get the basic idea as you've
probably<00:04:01.720> guessed<00:04:02.320> the<00:04:02.709> advantage<00:04:03.070> to<00:04:03.190> using

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
probably guessed the advantage to using

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.890 
probably guessed the advantage to using
a<00:04:03.489> teleprompter<00:04:03.730> is<00:04:04.209> you<00:04:04.359> can<00:04:04.510> read<00:04:04.720> written

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
a teleprompter is you can read written

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.300 
a teleprompter is you can read written
copy<00:04:05.200> while<00:04:05.470> looking<00:04:05.709> directly<00:04:05.919> into<00:04:06.220> the

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
copy while looking directly into the

the<00:04:07.150> downside<00:04:07.540> is<00:04:07.570> is<00:04:07.959> that<00:04:08.079> you

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
the downside is is that you

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.660 
the downside is is that you
have<00:04:08.379> to<00:04:08.469> write<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.860> copy<00:04:09.040> you<00:04:09.189> intend<00:04:09.549> on

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
reading this will take a little time but
