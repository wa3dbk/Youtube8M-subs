00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
saw that earlier on Roger I think what

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.050 
saw that earlier on Roger I think what
would<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.210> very<00:01:06.480> interesting<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:06.990> see<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:08.060> why

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
would be very interesting to see is why

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.450 
would be very interesting to see is why
we<00:01:09.240> got<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.480> yesterday<00:01:09.960> Alice<00:01:10.460> yesterday's

we got on yesterday Alice yesterday's
we're<00:01:11.760> developing<00:01:13.010> have<00:01:14.010> another<00:01:14.250> one<00:01:14.460> down

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
we're developing have another one down

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:24.250 
we're developing have another one down
here

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.480 

haha

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.390 

which<00:01:27.850> looks<00:01:28.090> in<00:01:28.240> very<00:01:28.450> good<00:01:28.690> for

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.210 

so<00:01:32.030> Roger<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:33.050> has<00:01:33.200> been<00:01:33.350> going<00:01:33.590> for<00:01:33.680> what

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
so Roger this has been going for what

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.490 
so Roger this has been going for what
looks<00:01:34.370> like<00:01:34.610> about<00:01:34.760> 18<00:01:35.270> or<00:01:35.450> 19<00:01:35.510> or<00:01:35.960> something

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
looks like about 18 or 19 or something

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.980 
looks like about 18 or 19 or something
like<00:01:36.620> that<00:01:36.680> but<00:01:37.040> now<00:01:37.190> let's<00:01:38.090> see<00:01:38.390> what<00:01:38.720> sort<00:01:38.900> of

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
like that but now let's see what sort of

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.590 
like that but now let's see what sort of
strength<00:01:39.320> I<00:01:39.950> mean<00:01:40.790> we<00:01:40.910> know<00:01:41.030> what<00:01:41.210> strikes<00:01:41.480> it

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
strength I mean we know what strikes it

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.800 
strength I mean we know what strikes it
shouldn't<00:01:41.870> have<00:01:41.990> it<00:01:42.110> would<00:01:42.200> be<00:01:42.320> about<00:01:42.500> 23<00:01:43.280> 24

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
shouldn't have it would be about 23 24

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.580 
shouldn't have it would be about 23 24
something<00:01:44.810> around<00:01:45.020> there
