00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.469
 hello how about in this video I'm going to 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:10.510
 bring my daily makeup routine more 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.360
 or less, although it will change a bit 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.299
 woman lipstick or change the base but 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.130
 more or less this is the process that I follow 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.170
 It is usually the type of makeup that 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.730
 I usually carry everyday when I have a 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.380
 little time to put on makeup is a 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.340
 very simple makeup very fast that 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.200
 case then if we remove the delineate is 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.910
 much simpler still and I do not expect anything 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.559
 you like it and you stay to see it good I 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.750
 always start applying me the 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.720
 corrections and how to see this and still 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.570
 a little brunette to use tone 67 of 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.560
 English that is there in between 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:47.450
 my tone and the one that I have was the one that I have 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.329
 Normally because it's a bit of a clear 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.070
 for now 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.420
 and nothing I always apply with the 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.420
 fingers with the fingertips 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.800
 a small amount to not pass me if 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.560
 we need more we continue to apply the 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.540
 sun has left me some small because I 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.520
 I cover it a little bit with corrector and 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.110
 some brands that I have of granites 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.110
 well I also give a little pass 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.759
 like a little bit in return 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.430
 now I'm going to apply a vile bicrim this 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.130
 is the deity of mine in the middle tone is the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.079
 that he normally used in summer to 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.299
 Weekly use is in winter a sun 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.430
 alive and we were to apply it with the 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.119
 hands I applied a small amount 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.119
 watching well 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.270
 and always from the center towards strong 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.600
 in the ojera we arrived a little 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.180
 because the corrector was a tad more 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.180
 clear so to save the tone 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.769
 I'm going to apply a corrector a tad more 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.870
 clear on the line this dwelling because I 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.330
 I have a lot of gera and I like it 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.540
 cover it a little bit because otherwise it will not 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.420
 remove so we do not apply a line 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.620
 with very little product not even 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.620
 tight is with what was left 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.620
 one and 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.760
 with this gross amount the same from the 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.379
 we squeeze it 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.239
 and then in another the most 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.170
 lighting is in summer I'm using 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.620
 these matifying powders of kiko which is 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.040
 powder 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.659
 tips with and dry in tone number 4 with 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.659
 any brochas and grandecita 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.650
 let's make the corrections with this 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.270
 bronzer this is tous in tone 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.580
 0 2 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.680
 and a skewer I'm pretty loose are you 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.739
 of 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.950
 and from him and together we take a small 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.950
 quantity 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.200
 and we apply it in the triangle 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.069
 the contour triangle 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.069
 blurring well 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.950
 with what we have left, we simply do 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.170
 do a little bit to fine tune the na 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.450
 and even without taking product because it is a 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.670
 very natural makeup now with a are 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.520
 with a lucky brush this is the 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.370
 blush of royal techniques and a 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.250
 blusher this is the hot powder of the 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:01.920
 This collection of savannah deliplus la 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.920
 we apply blush over the contour 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.810
 now let's apply the illuminator 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.160
 in the highest area of the cheekbone a 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.090
 bit 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.090
 so neither 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.740
 I do not like it too much because it does 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:34.389
 Much to talk about later does not know much 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.500
 nasal partition arch host a little bit 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.270
 we live with eyes being 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.400
 using shadows in cream I'll 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.669
 start with the soft paint or perez 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:47.949
 not deleted but one and I apply it for 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.949
 all the eyelid both fixed as a mobile 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.509
 so that our shadow in cream I will 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:02.740
 use wash mac stati I will light 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.740
 a little eyebrow arch 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.860
 I also apply a little on the eyelid 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.940
 mobile 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.280
 to give more light 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.290
 we could leave it like that but I like it 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.750
 Apply some powder shadow to 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.540
 that the cream shadow lasts longer 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.040
 that nothing with a clear shadow I go to 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.720
 use 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.820
 this is the 107 of jim I'm going to seal 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.240
 a little the shadow in cream by the 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.540
 eyelid on the mobile eyelid and bow 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.540
 of the eyebrow 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.610
 now we are going to mark a tad the basin 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.319
 anything with a brush or quite 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.319
 blur and a butt shadow 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.850
 very slightly 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:09.759
 online, I always use this eye 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:13.440
 eyeliner tx and transform it when 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:13.440
 I want a path so fast 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.540
 and we apply mascara 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.720
 with the human pencil we are going to fill a 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.290
 I do not want a very exaggerated eyebrow 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.290
 for diary 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.020
 and now we just fix with a fixative 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.020
 of eyebrows 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.550
 something good 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.940
 let's finish using a bar 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.310
 lips very well this is of venecos in the 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:19.020
 tone reviews 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.020
 and nothing directly from the bar 

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:29.290
 and nothing would stay the look as you see is 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.960
 very simple does not seem to carry 

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:34.240
 excessive makeup yes I usually score 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:37.120
 a little more the eyeliner but the rest 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.530
 as you see in very neutral tones so 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.260
 nothing I hope you liked this 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:43.500
 video and I'll see you in the next one a 

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.500
