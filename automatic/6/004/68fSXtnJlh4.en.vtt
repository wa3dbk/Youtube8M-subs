00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
TNT and flint and steel and I used a

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.570 
TNT and flint and steel and I used a
glitch<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.480> duplicate<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.439> TNT<00:00:29.039> don't<00:00:29.400> call

legit<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.739> just<00:00:35.070> kind<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.460> glitched<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:36.059> in

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
legit so I just kind of glitched it in

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.530 
legit so I just kind of glitched it in
so<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.520> just<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.670> know<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.090> glitch<00:00:39.329> with

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
so on just so you know the glitch with

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.330 
so on just so you know the glitch with
unlimited<00:00:39.989> diamonds<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.649> didn't<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.309> that

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
unlimited diamonds I didn't in that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.459 
unlimited diamonds I didn't in that
video<00:00:41.879> works<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.420> any<00:00:42.660> item<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.230> can<00:00:43.260> do

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
video works with any item and you can do

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.500 
video works with any item and you can do
it<00:00:43.500> with<00:00:43.710> 64<00:00:44.219> SEC<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:44.820> very<00:00:44.940> easy<00:00:45.210> you

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
it with 64 SEC so it's very easy you

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.680 
it with 64 SEC so it's very easy you
just<00:00:46.610> start<00:00:47.610> placing<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.149> TNT<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:51.300> ground

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
just start placing the TNT on the ground

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.610 
just start placing the TNT on the ground
and<00:00:52.140> then<00:00:52.350> run<00:00:52.680> like<00:00:53.039> crap<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:55.170> let<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
and then run like crap and let the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.180 
and then run like crap and let the
tension<00:00:55.829> kind<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.520> do<00:00:56.670> its<00:00:56.820> own<00:00:56.940> work<00:00:57.000> and

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
tension kind of do its own work and

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.810 
tension kind of do its own work and
it'll<00:00:59.190> start<00:00:59.460> forming<00:00:59.910> kind<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> cave<00:01:01.820> so

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
it'll start forming kind of the cave so

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.530 
it'll start forming kind of the cave so
on<00:01:03.030> if<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.600> repeat<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.290> process<00:01:05.540> eventually

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
on if you repeat this process eventually

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.830 
on if you repeat this process eventually
you'll<00:01:07.110> get<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.830> K<00:01:08.869> so<00:01:10.340> watch<00:01:11.340> them<00:01:12.979> so<00:01:13.979> now

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
you'll get a K so watch them so now

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.730 
you'll get a K so watch them so now
that's<00:01:15.840> turning<00:01:16.590> into<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:18.180> next<00:01:18.540> part<00:01:18.780> so

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
that's turning into the next part so

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.130 
that's turning into the next part so
what<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.159> also<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:22.610> dig<00:01:23.610> down<00:01:24.140> like

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
what you can also do is dig down like

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.510 
what you can also do is dig down like
that<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:28.640> then<00:01:30.140> places<00:01:31.140> crap-ton<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:32.130> that

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
that and then places crap-ton in that

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.039 
that and then places crap-ton in that
little<00:01:32.970> hole<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:34.079> it'll<00:01:34.619> make<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.159> mungus

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
little hole and it'll make you mungus

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:44.770 
little hole and it'll make you mungus
explosion<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.600> let's<00:01:39.840> watch<00:01:40.049> this

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.930 

so<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:46.050> is<00:01:46.260> a<00:01:46.290> legit<00:01:46.830> way<00:01:47.040> for<00:01:47.370> caves<00:01:47.670> in

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
so this is a legit way for caves in

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.780 
so this is a legit way for caves in
Minecraft<00:01:48.450> PE<00:01:49.250> but<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.480> to<00:01:52.520> glitch<00:01:53.520> in

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
TNT unless you can just get a lot by
