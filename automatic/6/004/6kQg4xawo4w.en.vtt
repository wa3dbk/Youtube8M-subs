 seven hundred and five rubles 80 kopecks 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.760
 jewelry that does not cause 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.280
 suspicion we put off in 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.870
 a separate party of these products which 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.890
 causes suspicion we will check 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.150
 on our machine 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.980
 I can briefly explain what's what 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.360
 each jewel has its own 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.040
 minik has his sample 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.680
 accordingly, how much pure gold 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.250
 is in this product ie everything 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.479
 jewelry as we now see 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.000
 585 tests but if you look closely 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.100
 carefully and more carefully that is 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.470
 Here is the jewel data you can 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.360

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.670
 a little bit added and no minicar 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.170
 It has 3 digits which causes me 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.360
 suspicions to check it on 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.090
 here tell the convenience of the device cover 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.010
 long to explain how the device works all 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.070

 percentage of gold 3 peak 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.970
 means we have a percentage 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.610
 medic and 4 peak mean percentage 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.890

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.630

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.610
 don't speak 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.100
 unfortunately the jewelry market is very 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.530
 a lot of jewelry imitations and jewelry 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.510
 products with low try private 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.520
 jewelers uses not affiliated 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.630
 metal as prescribed by law 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.730
 Russian Federation 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.640
 and uses the product of the former 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.880
 use that is a product that is already 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.600
 once worn remember how our 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.640
 Soviet time beer was diluted 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.250
 so at the moment here is the same 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.790
 it happens and gold is diluted but it 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.410
 it's not good yet what else is jewelery 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.960
 the item is actually made of gold 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.690
 it happens that the top is just covered 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.560
 gold us inside is copper examples 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.300
 typical fake jewelry 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.480
 who have been to our practice you 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:43.240
 can see on our site 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:44.550
 [music] 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.470
 [applause] 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.350
 we finished checking 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.070
 your jewelry you are on hand 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.230
 get 79000 609 rubles 19 kopecks 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:00.030
 what is up with the preliminary act 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:04.360
 the difference is 6000 96 rubles 61 kopecks 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:07.210
 for some reason I will now explain when you are to 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.850
 we came you said how all 585 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.850
 we try correctly correctly but after 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.100
 verification turned out that here at this 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.720
 the moment is not all your jewelry 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:22.660
 sample products 585 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:24.570
 a is 570 560 550 which is reflected 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.880
 directly on cash equivalent 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:32.170
 that is, if we now have 585 sample 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:35.070
 It costs 830 rubles, so 570 already costs 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:38.350
 808 rubles 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.510
 550 right costs 780 rubles that 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.500
 makes from declared already for 1 gram 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.500
 50 rubles 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:50.449
 what turned out I look like she will 

00:05:47.299 --> 00:05:52.249
 quite right you say here 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.339
 folder mayhem 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:57.889
 no one could be no why 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:58.519
 the spectrometer can by the way recently we 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:02.209

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:04.249
 few jewelry could 

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:06.169
