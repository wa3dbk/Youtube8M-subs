backwards in the movie you just jump

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:45.430 
backwards in the movie you just jump
little<00:01:38.210> ways<00:01:38.300> through<00:01:44.020> sometimes<00:01:45.020> there's<00:01:45.380> a

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
little ways through sometimes there's a

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.710 
little ways through sometimes there's a
little<00:01:45.650> bit<00:01:45.770> of<00:01:45.800> a<00:01:46.450> buffering<00:01:47.450> time<00:01:48.460> but<00:01:49.460> also

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
little bit of a buffering time but also

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.550 
little bit of a buffering time but also
your<00:01:50.720> forwards<00:01:51.050> backwards<00:01:51.200> play<00:01:52.100> pause<00:01:52.340> and

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
your forwards backwards play pause and

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.139 
your forwards backwards play pause and
you<00:01:54.560> can<00:01:54.710> also<00:01:54.830> add<00:01:55.009> subtitles<00:01:55.580> as<00:01:55.729> well<00:01:55.909> with

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
the app when the phone is off when

just for the sole fact that we're not
using<00:02:04.700> display<00:02:05.390> mirroring<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.200> phone<00:02:06.619> can

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
using display mirroring so the phone can

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.139 
using display mirroring so the phone can
be<00:02:06.860> off<00:02:07.070> it<00:02:07.340> can<00:02:07.490> sit<00:02:07.670> next<00:02:07.759> to<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:08.000> on<00:02:08.060> the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.880 

so<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.610> did<00:02:29.819> find<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.260> using<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.349> app<00:02:31.470> I

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
so I did find that using the app I

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.770 
so I did find that using the app I
watched<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.760> full-length<00:02:33.120> movie<00:02:33.329> last<00:02:33.629> night

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
did use a quite a bit of battery so it

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.280 
did use a quite a bit of battery so it
might<00:02:36.180> be<00:02:36.299> helpful<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.629> have<00:02:36.689> a<00:02:36.780> charger<00:02:37.170> on

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290
