 let's say the first page you have immediately 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.140
 Here's all that's really shown here 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.110
 such settings are a little bit 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.540
 later to start with the settings that we have 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.460

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.069
 low nits for example 4 stakes 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.569
 it is one and it will not fold 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:17.120
 put back 500 points 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.150
 so that it doesn't bother you too much 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.870
 this flaws and beta screen a bit 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.000
 Windows pointer speed goes out 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.340

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.530
 screen 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.269
 Further, as the setting is implemented here . 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.530
 the button did not really like it first 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:42.380
 You can choose any function here. 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.310
 Internet multimedia pin non-standard 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.459
 put dubbing say as 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.220
 keyboard 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.810
 but the most interesting to me here are the presets 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.209
 there is but you can do it yourself 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.600
 set up here for example, delete this one 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.870
 mouse 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.640
 a button and put it here 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.840
 come on just don't fly or 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.390
 here here is such a put okay 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.600
 put here big and each of 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.959
 these buttons you can customize what 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.910
 I really, really like it 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:17.239
 Well done , you can also delete it again 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.150
 to return to a different state of the 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.290
 battles can customize everything enough 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.750
 standard 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.510
 there is nothing more advanced 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.400
 settings we have activity on 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.109
 axes 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.510
 Calibration under the carpet setting left of 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.090
 distance setting poling raid driver 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.200
 from newspapers you return to settings 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.890

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.160
 backlight constant lighting blinking 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.730
 I don't know, I don't know, I forgot it sharply 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.060
 such a change between colors of pressure 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.840
 this is a fade out hobbit is like 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.910
 heart beating effect sleeps various 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.609
 color effect and so on there like 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.829
 sound setup all 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:07.010
 there is a paraffin manager 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:09.450
 ok macro manager i don't use 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.900
 I paint them no place for shadows 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.690
 use see reviews but this one 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.320
 all the same here there are such here 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.620
 pies 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.070
 so dear friends have a mouse here 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.770
 us all sidewall pulled out lock 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.700
 is in the open position and i 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:32.880
 made a major mistake i just 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:37.340
 went through all the combinations and realized that this 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.080
 no buttons here this row is a stub 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.930
 stubs are single stubs 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.690
 quad so the main buttons here 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.380
 these and these are the natural ones that you 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.320
 print on a 3d printer and so on 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.860
 I want to make this combination for 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.470
 I will have one active button 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:04.050
 small in the top row 1 will be 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:06.510
 active big and cap between them 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.460
 on the second row we will not have 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.970
 active buttons 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.010
 so I will choose a quadruple stub on 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.990
 lower river 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:19.020
 number we will have the opposite one 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.310
 the button in this corner will be a small a 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:27.560
 the big button will be the bottom row but already 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:32.120
 on the left and so between them we will have 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:36.900
 we chose to cap all 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:39.870
 So take a mouse's position and 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:45.660
 starting to vomit 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:50.250
 we all saw it beautifully 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:54.080
 what's the keyhole and so the buttons are inserted 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:59.160
 then went stub 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:01.280
 then the bottom big button is a cap 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.280
 and 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:08.580
 big garnier small button bottom 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.940
 so we all set checked as 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:16.430
 pressed as close and close 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:19.260
 lock all combination of buttons we have 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:22.100
 nothing is pressed here 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:25.080
 and it can be used like this 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:30.420
 variant of such combinations may be 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:34.340
 big big set and so let's 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.340
 by clicking the buttons on the spin wheel
