first<00:02:19.320> things<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.710> notice<00:02:19.950> about<00:02:20.040> these

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
first things that I notice about these

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.650 
first things that I notice about these
headphones<00:02:20.550> is<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.970> openness<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.540> these

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
headphones is the openness of these

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.260 
headphones is the openness of these
headphones<00:02:22.020> so<00:02:22.830> what<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:22.980> mean<00:02:23.160> by<00:02:23.220> openness<00:02:24.090> is

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
headphones so what I mean by openness is

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.350 
headphones so what I mean by openness is
that<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.960> sound<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.380> not<00:02:25.410> directly<00:02:26.360> focused

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
that the sound is not directly focused

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.820 
that the sound is not directly focused
towards<00:02:27.840> your<00:02:27.930> ears<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.290> they<00:02:28.710> actually

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
towards your ears and they actually

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.650 
towards your ears and they actually
spread<00:02:29.280> out<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.880> sound<00:02:30.090> actually<00:02:30.450> feels

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
spread out so the sound actually feels

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.050 
spread out so the sound actually feels
sounds<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.410> lot<00:02:31.560> better<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.040> overall<00:02:32.670> gives

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
sounds a lot better and overall gives

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.130 
sounds a lot better and overall gives
you<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.210> much<00:02:33.750> better<00:02:34.370> listening<00:02:35.370> experience

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
you a much better listening experience

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.480 
you a much better listening experience
another<00:02:37.140> thing<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.980> bass<00:02:38.160> on<00:02:38.370> these

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
another thing is that the bass on these

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.310 
another thing is that the bass on these
headphones<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:39.030> good<00:02:39.270> but<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.600> don't<00:02:39.840> expect<00:02:40.170> it

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
headphones is good but I don't expect it

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.920 
headphones is good but I don't expect it
to<00:02:40.350> be<00:02:40.470> better<00:02:40.740> since<00:02:41.040> these<00:02:41.130> headphones<00:02:41.370> are

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
to be better since these headphones are

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.390 
to be better since these headphones are
179<00:02:42.930> I'd<00:02:43.230> expect<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.770> bass<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.070> be<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.190> little

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
179 I'd expect the bass to be a little

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.220 
179 I'd expect the bass to be a little
better<00:02:44.550> for<00:02:44.700> such<00:02:44.850> expensive<00:02:45.300> headphones<00:02:45.420> but

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
better for such expensive headphones but

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.230 
better for such expensive headphones but
they<00:02:46.380> still<00:02:46.650> don't<00:02:47.160> still<00:02:47.730> do<00:02:47.880> give<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.210> a

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
they still don't still do give you a

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.850 
they still don't still do give you a
much<00:02:48.510> better<00:02:48.690> bass<00:02:49.020> experience<00:02:49.500> than<00:02:49.650> any

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
much better bass experience than any

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.900 
much better bass experience than any
regular<00:02:50.010> headphones<00:02:50.460> that<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:50.610> can<00:02:50.790> never

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
regular headphones that you can never

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.870 
regular headphones that you can never
listen<00:02:51.270> to<00:02:52.100> overall<00:02:53.100> these<00:02:53.310> are<00:02:53.370> really<00:02:53.790> good

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880
