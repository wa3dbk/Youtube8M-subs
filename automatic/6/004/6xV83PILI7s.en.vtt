00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
the last major tool that we've added to

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.620 
the last major tool that we've added to
the<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.710> can<00:00:17.010> do<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.369> kit<00:00:17.700> we<00:00:18.180> tried<00:00:18.450> to<00:00:18.540> get

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
the I can do that kit we tried to get

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.210 
the I can do that kit we tried to get
along<00:00:18.750> well<00:00:19.020> we<00:00:19.140> did<00:00:19.290> get<00:00:19.470> along<00:00:19.560> without<00:00:19.980> them

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
along well we did get along without them

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.370 
along well we did get along without them
for<00:00:20.580> about<00:00:21.000> five<00:00:21.270> years<00:00:21.300> but<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.080> decided

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
for about five years but we decided

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.530 
for about five years but we decided
there's<00:00:23.010> just<00:00:23.310> some<00:00:23.490> instances<00:00:24.119> where<00:00:24.390> it's

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
there's just some instances where it's

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.050 
there's just some instances where it's
the<00:00:24.689> best<00:00:24.900> tool<00:00:25.140> for<00:00:25.169> the<00:00:25.770> job<00:00:25.820> anything<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.880> can

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the best tool for the job anything I can

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.319 
the best tool for the job anything I can
do<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.329> lexicon<00:00:27.900> that's<00:00:28.169> generally<00:00:28.650> for

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:29.329 
do that lexicon that's generally for

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.240 
do that lexicon that's generally for
profiling<00:00:30.329> an<00:00:30.599> edge<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.930> a<00:00:31.020> piece<00:00:31.259> or<00:00:31.529> using<00:00:32.130> it

for<00:00:32.400> a<00:00:32.460> pattern<00:00:32.640> routing<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:34.399> it's<00:00:35.399> good<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
for a pattern routing so it's good to

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.069 
for a pattern routing so it's good to
have<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.820> router<00:00:36.060> in<00:00:36.239> your<00:00:36.270> shop<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.930> get

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
have a router in your shop as you get

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.810

more experienced as a woodworker you

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.420 
more experienced as a woodworker you
might<00:00:38.970> find<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.390> lot<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.630> uses<00:00:40.200> for<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.949> lot<00:00:41.280> of

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
might find a lot of uses for it a lot of

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.639 
might find a lot of uses for it a lot of
joinery<00:00:41.850> uses<00:00:42.300> you'd<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.600> using<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:43.079> for<00:00:43.109> lots

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
joinery uses you'd be using it for lots

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.590 
joinery uses you'd be using it for lots
of<00:00:43.800> jigs<00:00:44.070> for<00:00:44.280> cutting<00:00:44.519> dovetails<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.390> other

but<00:00:49.079> as<00:00:49.199> I<00:00:49.350> said<00:00:49.410> we're<00:00:49.800> keeping<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.129> pretty

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
but as I said we're keeping it pretty

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.669 
but as I said we're keeping it pretty
basic<00:00:50.550> for<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.660> kit<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.590> how

00:00:52.669 --> 00:00:52.679 
basic for the I can do that kit so how

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:54.349 
basic for the I can do that kit so how
do<00:00:52.769> you<00:00:52.859> choose<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.129> router<00:00:53.460> there<00:00:54.030> are<00:00:54.179> many

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
do you choose a router there are many

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.090 
do you choose a router there are many
types<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.929> sizes<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.530> them<00:00:55.679> and<00:00:55.890> there<00:00:56.010> are

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
types and sizes of them and there are

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.430 
types and sizes of them and there are
lots<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.460> options<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.629> want<00:00:57.839> a<00:00:57.899> fixed<00:00:58.230> base

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
lots of options do you want a fixed base

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.459 
lots of options do you want a fixed base
router<00:00:58.820> this<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.969> a<00:00:59.999> fixed<00:01:00.359> base<00:01:00.570> router<00:01:00.749> you

router this is a fixed base router you
lock<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.070> motor<00:01:02.339> into<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> base<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.690> it

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
lock the motor into the base and it

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.509 
lock the motor into the base and it
stays<00:01:04.140> at<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.530> level<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.190> whole<00:01:05.309> time

trim router a trim router is a nice
little<00:01:28.110> tool<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.800> a<00:01:29.210> actually<00:01:30.210> called<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
little tool it's a actually called a

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.030 
little tool it's a actually called a
laminate<00:01:30.900> trimmer<00:01:31.110> outer<00:01:31.470> because<00:01:31.800> it<00:01:31.920> was

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
laminate trimmer outer because it was

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.520 
laminate trimmer outer because it was
developed<00:01:32.700> for<00:01:32.970> trimming<00:01:33.870> off<00:01:34.020> laminate

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
developed for trimming off laminate

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.110 
developed for trimming off laminate
countertops<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.370> like<00:01:35.580> but<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.030> a

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
countertops and the like but it's a

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.490 
countertops and the like but it's a
great<00:01:36.270> little<00:01:36.540> tool<00:01:36.660> in<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> shop<00:01:37.140> too

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
great little tool in the shop too

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.440 
great little tool in the shop too
because<00:01:38.160> you<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.400> grab<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:38.790> one<00:01:38.910> hand

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450

because you can grab it with one hand
one<00:01:40.050> of<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.260> challenges<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.070> however<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.880> it

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
one of the challenges is however that it

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.780 
one of the challenges is however that it
has<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> small<00:01:43.230> base<00:01:43.440> on<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.100> sometimes<00:01:44.340> it's

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
has a small base on it so sometimes it's

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.540 
has a small base on it so sometimes it's
hard<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.300> keep<00:01:45.690> balanced<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.410> your<00:01:46.830> workpiece

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
hard to keep balanced on your workpiece

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.630 
hard to keep balanced on your workpiece

the other challenge or limitation I

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.730 
the other challenge or limitation I
suppose<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.420> trim<00:01:51.660> router<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.230> that<00:01:52.650> it

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
suppose of the trim router is that it

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.830 
suppose of the trim router is that it
only<00:01:52.890> has<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.160> quarter<00:01:53.640> inch<00:01:53.670> collet<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.510> it<00:01:54.660> and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
only has a quarter inch collet in it and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.390 
only has a quarter inch collet in it and
the<00:01:54.930> collet<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.410> what<00:01:55.650> holds<00:01:55.980> the<00:01:56.100> bit<00:01:56.250> in

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
the collet is what holds the bit in

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.330 
the collet is what holds the bit in
position<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:57.210> when<00:01:57.810> you're<00:01:57.990> doing<00:01:58.350> work<00:01:59.130> with

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
position and when you're doing work with

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.300 
position and when you're doing work with
larger<00:01:59.790> bits<00:02:00.030> you're<00:02:00.720> going<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.080> want<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.530> half

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
larger bits you're going to want a half

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.280 
larger bits you're going to want a half
inch<00:02:02.610> maybe<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.330> three-eighths<00:02:03.780> but<00:02:04.080> we<00:02:04.170> only

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
inch maybe a three-eighths but we only

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.250 
inch maybe a three-eighths but we only
have<00:02:04.440> half<00:02:04.650> inch<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.040> quarter<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.550> chair

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
have half inch and quarter and chair

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.830 
have half inch and quarter and chair
shaft<00:02:07.260> on<00:02:07.650> your<00:02:07.920> bit<00:02:08.489> because<00:02:09.330> you'll<00:02:09.720> get

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
shaft on your bit because you'll get

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.479 
shaft on your bit because you'll get
less<00:02:10.019> vibration<00:02:10.739> you'll<00:02:10.950> be<00:02:11.069> able<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.340> do

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
less vibration you'll be able to do

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.080 
less vibration you'll be able to do
heavier<00:02:12.030> work<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:13.519> that's<00:02:14.519> one<00:02:14.849> of<00:02:14.970> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
heavier work and that's one of the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.700 
heavier work and that's one of the
things<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.720> keep<00:02:15.870> in<00:02:16.050> mind<00:02:16.260> when<00:02:16.470> you're<00:02:16.560> also

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
things to keep in mind when you're also

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.110 
things to keep in mind when you're also
looking<00:02:16.980> at<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.340> Kaulitz<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:18.000> are

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
looking at the Kaulitz that are

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.400 
looking at the Kaulitz that are
available<00:02:18.470> with<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:20.000> router<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.450> buy

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
available with the router that you buy

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.250 
available with the router that you buy
lot<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.530> them<00:02:22.710> will<00:02:22.830> come<00:02:23.100> with<00:02:23.760> both<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.570> half

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
lot of them will come with both a half

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.190 
lot of them will come with both a half
inch<00:02:25.530> collet<00:02:25.890> which<00:02:26.640> holds<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.450> larger<00:02:28.020> bit

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
inch collet which holds the larger bit

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.320 
inch collet which holds the larger bit
and<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:29.100> quarter<00:02:29.400> inch<00:02:29.550> collet<00:02:29.820> so<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.180> can

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
and a quarter inch collet so you can

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.240 
and a quarter inch collet so you can
switch<00:02:30.570> back<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:30.810> forth<00:02:31.020> if<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:32.010> have<00:02:32.220> a

switch back and forth if you have a

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.120 
switch back and forth if you have a
larger<00:02:32.970> router<00:02:33.210> trim<00:02:33.930> routers<00:02:34.320> I'm<00:02:34.710> pretty

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
larger router trim routers I'm pretty

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.920 
larger router trim routers I'm pretty
sure<00:02:35.400> I've<00:02:35.670> never<00:02:35.700> seen<00:02:36.210> one<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.420> comes<00:02:36.780> with

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
sure I've never seen one that comes with

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.410 
sure I've never seen one that comes with
a<00:02:37.080> half<00:02:37.170> inch<00:02:37.500> collet<00:02:37.890> in<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:38.970> another

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
a half inch collet in it so another

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.730 
a half inch collet in it so another
thing<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.750> want<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.050> keep<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.380> mind<00:02:40.410> when

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
thing you want to keep in mind when

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.230 
thing you want to keep in mind when
you're<00:02:40.830> looking<00:02:41.070> your<00:02:41.280> bits<00:02:41.550> is<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:42.060> it

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
you're looking your bits is is it

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.020 
you're looking your bits is is it
bearing<00:02:42.600> guided<00:02:42.990> or<00:02:43.110> not<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:44.010> bearing<00:02:44.460> is<00:02:44.670> a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
bearing guided or not and a bearing is a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.160 
bearing guided or not and a bearing is a
little<00:02:45.330> piece<00:02:45.570> here<00:02:46.190> that<00:02:47.190> spins<00:02:47.640> free<00:02:48.150> as<00:02:48.420> you

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
little piece here that spins free as you

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.050 
little piece here that spins free as you
move<00:02:49.350> around<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.740> edge<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.160> your<00:02:50.280> workpiece

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
move around the edge of your workpiece

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.450 
move around the edge of your workpiece
sometimes<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.200> rides<00:02:52.410> on<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.770> work<00:02:52.980> itself

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
sometimes it rides on the work itself

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.630 
sometimes it rides on the work itself
and<00:02:53.730> limits<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.450> travel<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:56.250> cutting

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
and limits the travel of the the cutting

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.210 
and limits the travel of the the cutting
edge<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.270> bit<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:58.500> helps<00:02:58.830> keep<00:02:58.860> you

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
edge of the bit and that helps keep you

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.680 
edge of the bit and that helps keep you
a<00:02:59.250> cutting<00:02:59.910> where<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.180> want<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.510> cut

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
a cutting where you want to cut

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.900 
a cutting where you want to cut
sometimes<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.860> travels<00:03:02.250> around<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.580> edge<00:03:02.760> of

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
sometimes it travels around the edge of

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.320 
sometimes it travels around the edge of
a<00:03:03.000> pattern<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:05.370> we're<00:03:05.820> going<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.030> use<00:03:06.180> this

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
a pattern and we're going to use this

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.240 
a pattern and we're going to use this
one<00:03:06.570> in<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.780> little<00:03:06.990> while<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.920> set

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
one in a little while that you set

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.480 
one in a little while that you set
against<00:03:08.670> your<00:03:08.850> work<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.980> where<00:03:10.980> did<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.220> one

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
against your work and where did that one

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.400 
against your work and where did that one
go<00:03:11.550> so<00:03:12.390> this<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.690> going<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.990> ride<00:03:13.170> on<00:03:13.200> the

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
go so this is going to ride on the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.060 
go so this is going to ride on the
pattern<00:03:13.890> here<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:15.230> that's<00:03:16.230> going<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.860> keep

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
pattern here and that's going to keep

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.100 
pattern here and that's going to keep
the<00:03:17.310> cutting<00:03:17.550> edge<00:03:17.850> from<00:03:18.150> going<00:03:18.510> any<00:03:18.780> farther

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
the cutting edge from going any farther

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.260 
the cutting edge from going any farther
into<00:03:19.530> your<00:03:19.830> wood<00:03:20.100> than<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.820> edge<00:03:20.940> of<00:03:21.150> your
