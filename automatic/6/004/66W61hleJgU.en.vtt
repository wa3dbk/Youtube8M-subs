if<00:00:34.559> they're<00:00:34.710> there<00:00:34.739> yet<00:00:35.130> but<00:00:35.730> anyway<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
if they're there yet but anyway the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.810 
if they're there yet but anyway the
first<00:00:37.290> thing<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.649> they<00:00:37.680> added<00:00:38.010> was<00:00:38.190> fog<00:00:38.520> in

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
first thing that they added was fog in

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.990 
first thing that they added was fog in
the<00:00:39.360> distance<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.260> map<00:00:40.440> because<00:00:41.000> there

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the distance of the map because there

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.020 
the distance of the map because there
was<00:00:42.120> issues<00:00:42.300> with<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.399> render<00:00:44.399> distance<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
was issues with the render distance and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.760 
was issues with the render distance and
things<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> background<00:00:45.989> looking<00:00:46.350> kind<00:00:46.710> of

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
things in the background looking kind of

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.860 
things in the background looking kind of
bad<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.550> they<00:00:47.579> added<00:00:47.940> fog<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.420> reduce<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
bad so they added fog to reduce the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.299 
bad so they added fog to reduce the
render<00:00:49.140> distance<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:52.199> tunable<00:00:52.559> files<00:00:52.800> AKA

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
render distance the tunable files AKA

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.490 
render distance the tunable files AKA
dns<00:00:53.910> servers<00:00:54.270> are<00:00:54.449> now<00:00:54.690> patched<00:00:55.110> and

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
dns servers are now patched and

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.490 
dns servers are now patched and
encrypted<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:57.510> means<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.989> there<00:00:58.350> might

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
encrypted so this means that there might

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.770 
encrypted so this means that there might
not<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.739> any<00:00:59.129> more<00:00:59.280> dns<00:01:00.059> servers<00:01:00.449> money

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
not be any more dns servers money

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.640 
not be any more dns servers money
lobbies<00:01:01.230> free<00:01:01.890> dlc<00:01:02.960> things<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.350> unless

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
lobbies free dlc things like that unless

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.109 
lobbies free dlc things like that unless
someone<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.309> find<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.610> way<00:01:05.700> around<00:01:05.820> it

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
someone can find a way around it

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.730 
someone can find a way around it
obviously<00:01:06.510> i<00:01:06.750> hope<00:01:07.200> they're<00:01:07.409> completely

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
obviously i hope they're completely

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.789 
obviously i hope they're completely
patched<00:01:08.040> it's<00:01:08.400> kind<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.700> ridiculous<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.799> yeah

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
patched it's kind of ridiculous but yeah

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.070 
patched it's kind of ridiculous but yeah
i<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.010> hope<00:01:11.310> they're<00:01:11.430> patched<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.840> if<00:01:12.990> you

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
i just hope they're patched so if you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.870 
i just hope they're patched so if you
find<00:01:13.229> some<00:01:13.470> type<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.680> video<00:01:13.979> with<00:01:14.189> dns<00:01:14.520> servers

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
find some type of video with dns servers

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.010 
find some type of video with dns servers
in<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.090> don't<00:01:15.330> put<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.720> because<00:01:15.869> you

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
in it don't put it in because you

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.570 
in it don't put it in because you
probably<00:01:16.380> will<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.159> chance<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.520> getting

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
probably will have a chance of getting

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.210 
probably will have a chance of getting
banned<00:01:18.259> also<00:01:19.259> supposedly<00:01:19.770> they<00:01:20.070> did

banned also supposedly they did

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.039 
banned also supposedly they did

bands and remove money and things like
that<00:01:44.840> also<00:01:45.840> obviously<00:01:46.590> because<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.130> would

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
that also obviously because you would

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.219 
that also obviously because you would
have<00:01:47.340> known<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.610> by<00:01:47.790> now<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:47.970> no<00:01:48.780> hice<00:01:48.990> were

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
have known this by now but no hice were

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.340 
have known this by now but no hice were
added<00:01:49.530> yet<00:01:49.560> because<00:01:50.340> they<00:01:50.549> are<00:01:50.729> slow<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.450> that

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
added yet because they are slow and that

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.929 
added yet because they are slow and that
is<00:01:52.470> ridiculous<00:01:52.950> but<00:01:53.100> no<00:01:53.250> hice<00:01:53.399> ready<00:01:53.700> yet

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
is ridiculous but no hice ready yet

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.480 
is ridiculous but no hice ready yet
they're<00:01:54.240> probably<00:01:54.450> going<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.869> do<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.310> build<00:01:56.310> up

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
they're probably going to do a build up

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.800 
they're probably going to do a build up
so<00:01:56.670> you'll<00:01:56.820> probably<00:01:56.939> know<00:01:57.360> when<00:01:57.630> there's

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
so you'll probably know when there's

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.030 
so you'll probably know when there's
going<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.049> high<00:01:58.290> SAT<00:01:58.590> it'll<00:01:58.890> probably

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
going to be high SAT it'll probably

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.039 
going to be high SAT it'll probably
release<00:01:59.369> some<00:01:59.549> videos<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.390> things<00:02:00.930> like

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
release some videos and and things like

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.690 
release some videos and and things like
that<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.290> hype<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.979> up<00:02:02.240> but<00:02:04.250> pretty<00:02:05.250> much<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
that to hype it up but pretty much the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.730 
that to hype it up but pretty much the
last<00:02:05.729> thing<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.689> obviously<00:02:06.960> no<00:02:07.409> money<00:02:07.649> or

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
last thing is that obviously no money or

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.830 
last thing is that obviously no money or
levels<00:02:08.220> were<00:02:08.340> removed<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.239> if<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.479> got<00:02:09.629> on

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
levels were removed so if you got on

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.360 
levels were removed so if you got on
today<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.140> still<00:02:10.530> have<00:02:10.679> all<00:02:10.860> your<00:02:10.890> modded

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
today you still have all your modded

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.320 
today you still have all your modded
money<00:02:11.520> you

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
money you

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.480 
money you
have<00:02:12.420> your<00:02:12.630> modded<00:02:13.290> level<00:02:13.680> possibly<00:02:14.310> or

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
have your modded level possibly or

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.970 
have your modded level possibly or
boosted<00:02:15.390> level<00:02:15.720> from<00:02:16.200> RP<00:02:16.500> glitches<00:02:16.860> and

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
boosted level from RP glitches and

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.680 
boosted level from RP glitches and
things<00:02:17.130> like<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.760> don't<00:02:18.450> think<00:02:18.480> they're

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
things like that I don't think they're

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.180 
things like that I don't think they're
going<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.870> remove<00:02:19.140> your<00:02:19.200> level<00:02:19.650> if<00:02:19.710> you<00:02:19.800> did<00:02:19.920> RP

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
going to remove your level if you did RP

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.940 
going to remove your level if you did RP
glitches<00:02:20.520> but<00:02:20.670> modded<00:02:21.120> RP<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.570> RP<00:02:22.470> then<00:02:22.710> yes

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
glitches but modded RP the RP then yes

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.520 
glitches but modded RP the RP then yes
they<00:02:23.160> will<00:02:23.280> remove<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.170> same<00:02:25.170> with<00:02:25.200> money

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
they will remove it and same with money

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.770 
they will remove it and same with money
and<00:02:25.770> things<00:02:26.010> like<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:26.670> also<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.510> lot<00:02:27.750> of

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
and things like that so also a lot of

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.240 
and things like that so also a lot of
glitches<00:02:28.020> have<00:02:28.290> not<00:02:28.440> been<00:02:28.650> patched<00:02:28.860> yet<00:02:29.100> you

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
glitches have not been patched yet you

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.010 
glitches have not been patched yet you
can<00:02:29.370> still<00:02:29.400> do<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.910> duplication<00:02:30.570> car<00:02:30.780> glitch

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
can still do the duplication car glitch

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.290 
can still do the duplication car glitch
and<00:02:31.200> sell<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.590> for<00:02:31.770> money<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.760> can<00:02:32.880> still<00:02:33.120> do

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
and sell it for money you can still do

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.000 
and sell it for money you can still do
the<00:02:33.690> bike<00:02:33.870> glitch<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.470> can<00:02:34.590> fly<00:02:34.800> across

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
the bike glitch so you can fly across

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.380 
the bike glitch so you can fly across
the<00:02:35.250> map<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.520> actually<00:02:35.640> didn't<00:02:35.970> upload<00:02:36.180> that

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
the map I actually didn't upload that

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.000 
the map I actually didn't upload that
but<00:02:36.570> you<00:02:36.630> can<00:02:36.750> still<00:02:36.900> do<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.710> can<00:02:37.860> still

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
but you can still do that you can still

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.290 
but you can still do that you can still
do<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.160> bunch<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.430> glitches<00:02:38.610> but<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:38.940> cannot

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
do a bunch of glitches but you cannot

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.810 
do a bunch of glitches but you cannot
suppose<00:02:39.870> we<00:02:40.080> they<00:02:40.380> patch<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:41.100> free

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
suppose we they patch the free

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.550 
suppose we they patch the free
collector's<00:02:42.270> edition<00:02:42.630> cars<00:02:42.900> where<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.350> went

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
into the URL bar and change the number

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.390 
into the URL bar and change the number
and<00:02:45.330> bought<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.110> car<00:02:46.290> in<00:02:46.320> game<00:02:46.710> so<00:02:46.950> supposedly

and bought the car in game so supposedly

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.610 
and bought the car in game so supposedly
