00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.460 

so<00:02:43.320> again<00:02:43.590> my<00:02:43.890> clean<00:02:44.250> tone<00:02:44.900> regular<00:02:45.900> bypass

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
so again my clean tone regular bypass

00:02:46.470 --> 00:03:14.890 
so again my clean tone regular bypass
mode

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:53.460 

that's<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:16.020> bridge<00:03:16.260> pickup<00:03:18.230> together

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.050 

by<00:03:54.470> digging<00:03:54.709> into<00:03:54.950> it<00:03:55.100> just<00:03:55.220> like<00:03:55.670> with<00:03:55.880> the

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
by digging into it just like with the

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.990 
by digging into it just like with the
agile<00:03:56.540> it<00:03:56.900> breaks<00:03:57.709> up<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.280> end<00:03:58.489> because<00:03:58.790> I<00:03:58.850> got

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
agile it breaks up the end because I got

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:11.650 
agile it breaks up the end because I got
it<00:03:59.120> set<00:03:59.300> on

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.690 

my<00:04:12.660> immediate<00:04:12.930> take<00:04:13.470> on<00:04:13.740> both<00:04:14.250> of<00:04:14.520> them

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
my immediate take on both of them

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.240 
my immediate take on both of them
together<00:04:14.940> is<00:04:15.570> that<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.079> output<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.859> the

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
together is that the output of the

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.580 
together is that the output of the
alnico<00:04:17.640> tubes<00:04:18.060> is<00:04:18.269> slightly<00:04:19.010> lower<00:04:20.010> than<00:04:20.310> the

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
alnico tubes is slightly lower than the

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.380 
alnico tubes is slightly lower than the
agile<00:04:22.730> amico<00:04:23.730> fives<00:04:24.030> so<00:04:25.340> just<00:04:26.340> a<00:04:26.460> little<00:04:26.790> but<00:04:27.360> I

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
agile amico fives so just a little but I

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.180 
agile amico fives so just a little but I
can<00:04:27.810> hear<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:28.080> so<00:04:29.070> here's<00:04:29.430> our<00:04:29.700> gain

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
can hear it so here's our gain

00:04:31.190 --> 00:05:09.020 
can hear it so here's our gain
gonna<00:04:32.190> play<00:04:32.490> it<00:04:32.640> the<00:04:32.760> same<00:04:32.790> way

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:39.219 

Hey

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:41.899 

until<00:05:40.229> there<00:05:40.379> sustains<00:05:40.949> not<00:05:41.219> a<00:05:41.249> problem<00:05:41.550> this

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
until there sustains not a problem this

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:46.040 
until there sustains not a problem this
guitar<00:05:42.330> either<00:05:44.300> just<00:05:45.300> by<00:05:45.449> what<00:05:45.719> my<00:05:45.839> gate

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
guitar either just by what my gate

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.869 
guitar either just by what my gate
settings<00:05:46.469> are<00:05:46.680> in<00:05:46.860> that<00:05:47.039> little<00:05:47.339> interruption

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 
settings are in that little interruption

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.719 
settings are in that little interruption
of<00:05:48.330> the<00:05:48.389> buzz<00:05:48.689> I'm<00:05:49.319> going<00:05:49.649> to<00:05:49.740> guess<00:05:49.919> that<00:05:49.949> that

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
of the buzz I'm going to guess that that

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.519 
of the buzz I'm going to guess that that
these<00:05:51.149> pickups<00:05:51.659> are<00:05:51.839> actually<00:05:52.259> a<00:05:52.289> little

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:52.529 
these pickups are actually a little

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:55.010 
these pickups are actually a little
noisier<00:05:53.069> than<00:05:53.189> those<00:05:53.669> that<00:05:54.149> are<00:05:54.210> on<00:05:54.479> the<00:05:54.659> agile

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
noisier than those that are on the agile

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.070 
noisier than those that are on the agile
because<00:05:55.259> the<00:05:55.499> agile<00:05:55.939> wit<00:05:56.939> in<00:05:57.089> rest<00:05:57.330> mode<00:05:57.539> on

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
because the agile wit in rest mode on

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.369 
because the agile wit in rest mode on
that<00:05:58.319> same<00:05:58.589> game<00:05:58.860> setting<00:05:59.279> does<00:06:00.059> not<00:06:00.449> give<00:06:01.229> me

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:01.379 
that same game setting does not give me

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:04.939 
that same game setting does not give me
a<00:06:01.409> noise<00:06:01.729> so<00:06:02.729> here<00:06:03.149> is<00:06:03.419> the<00:06:03.779> sound<00:06:04.020> of<00:06:04.349> the<00:06:04.469> neck

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:04.949 
a noise so here is the sound of the neck

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:06.769 
a noise so here is the sound of the neck
pickup<00:06:05.369> kind<00:06:05.729> of<00:06:05.879> get<00:06:06.029> that<00:06:06.149> butter<00:06:06.449> sound

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:06.779 
pickup kind of get that butter sound

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:41.300 
pickup kind of get that butter sound
that<00:06:06.990> I<00:06:07.020> was<00:06:07.139> talking<00:06:07.379> about<00:06:07.439> the<00:06:07.680> other

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.990 

I<00:06:44.270> would<00:06:45.270> say<00:06:46.070> given<00:06:47.070> the<00:06:47.220> cost<00:06:47.490> differences

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
I would say given the cost differences

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.810 
I would say given the cost differences
between<00:06:48.210> these<00:06:48.510> two<00:06:48.750> instruments<00:06:49.140> the<00:06:50.130> agile

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
between these two instruments the agile

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.200 
between these two instruments the agile
not<00:06:51.240> only<00:06:51.510> competes<00:06:52.020> with<00:06:52.200> this<00:06:52.620> /<00:06:53.460> signature

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
not only competes with this / signature

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.640 
not only competes with this / signature
which<00:06:54.390> I<00:06:54.570> adore<00:06:55.730> it<00:06:56.730> it<00:06:57.210> also<00:06:57.570> in<00:06:58.140> some

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
which I adore it it also in some

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.640 
which I adore it it also in some
fashions<00:07:00.260> has<00:07:01.260> an<00:07:01.440> advantage<00:07:01.770> and<00:07:02.570> I<00:07:03.650> would

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
fashions has an advantage and I would

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.190 
fashions has an advantage and I would
say<00:07:04.890> that<00:07:05.220> the<00:07:05.700> neck<00:07:05.910> is<00:07:05.940> a<00:07:06.180> slightly<00:07:06.930> slimmer

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.200 
say that the neck is a slightly slimmer

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.430 
say that the neck is a slightly slimmer
on<00:07:07.500> the<00:07:07.620> agile<00:07:07.980> the<00:07:09.620> the<00:07:10.620> weight<00:07:10.860> of<00:07:11.040> it<00:07:11.220> is<00:07:12.440> you

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 
on the agile the the weight of it is you

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.020 
on the agile the the weight of it is you
know<00:07:13.500> they're<00:07:13.770> they're<00:07:14.070> comparable<00:07:14.520> this<00:07:14.820> way

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.030 
know they're they're comparable this way

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.830 
know they're they're comparable this way
is<00:07:15.210> almost<00:07:15.600> 8<00:07:15.960> pounds<00:07:16.470> so<00:07:17.270> we're<00:07:18.270> only<00:07:18.390> off<00:07:18.600> by

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 
is almost 8 pounds so we're only off by

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.020 
is almost 8 pounds so we're only off by
about<00:07:18.930> a<00:07:19.050> half<00:07:19.230> pound<00:07:19.460> 3/4<00:07:20.460> of<00:07:20.490> a<00:07:20.580> pound<00:07:20.610> there

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.030 
about a half pound 3/4 of a pound there

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.110 
about a half pound 3/4 of a pound there
so<00:07:21.210> they're<00:07:21.360> pretty<00:07:21.540> close<00:07:22.820> but<00:07:23.820> there's

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 
so they're pretty close but there's

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.520 
so they're pretty close but there's
something<00:07:24.360> about<00:07:24.510> playing<00:07:24.690> the<00:07:24.900> agile<00:07:25.260> it

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:25.530 
something about playing the agile it

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.260 
something about playing the agile it
might<00:07:25.680> be<00:07:25.830> the<00:07:25.950> flatter<00:07:26.190> radius<00:07:26.610> board<00:07:26.970> it

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:27.270 
might be the flatter radius board it

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.030 
might be the flatter radius board it
might<00:07:27.420> be<00:07:27.540> the<00:07:27.660> ebony<00:07:28.050> this<00:07:28.590> is<00:07:28.740> rosewood

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:29.040 
might be the ebony this is rosewood

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.940 
might be the ebony this is rosewood
obviously<00:07:29.820> this<00:07:30.480> is<00:07:30.660> more<00:07:30.870> traditional<00:07:31.050> Les

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:31.950 
obviously this is more traditional Les

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.780 
obviously this is more traditional Les

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.170 
comfortable guitar to play the Epiphone

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.960 
comfortable guitar to play the Epiphone
as<00:07:43.440> well<00:07:43.740> it's<00:07:43.980> very<00:07:44.220> comfortable<00:07:44.610> to<00:07:44.700> play

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:44.970

I can get a guitar of that quality that
