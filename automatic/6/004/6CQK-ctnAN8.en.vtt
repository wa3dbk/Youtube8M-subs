I<00:00:14.790> thought<00:00:15.240> about<00:00:15.509> anatomy<00:00:16.020> education<00:00:16.529> day

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
I thought about anatomy education day

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.910 
I thought about anatomy education day
for<00:00:17.160> an<00:00:17.490> opportunity<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.750> expose<00:00:19.170> our<00:00:19.529> young

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
students to the opportunities that they

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.679 
students to the opportunities that they

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
and to give them a chance to see what's

them how Anatomy can change their lives
this<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.120> unprecedented<00:00:39.710> given<00:00:40.710> their

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
this is unprecedented given their

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.520 
this is unprecedented given their
position<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.239> they<00:00:42.570> don't<00:00:42.750> have<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.020> time<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
position and they don't have the time to

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.410 
position and they don't have the time to
really<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.399> yet<00:00:44.610> they<00:00:44.789> sacrifice

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
really do this and yet they sacrifice

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.660 
really do this and yet they sacrifice
their<00:00:45.660> time<00:00:45.930> because<00:00:46.379> they<00:00:46.530> feel<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.399> an

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
their time because they feel this is an

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.369 
their time because they feel this is an
important<00:00:48.180> message<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.570> we're<00:00:48.930> sending<00:00:48.960> to

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
important message that we're sending to

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.799 
important message that we're sending to
that<00:00:49.739> most<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.399> us<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.910> are<00:00:51.059> here<00:00:51.239> today<00:00:51.420> are

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
that most of us that are here today are

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.170 
that most of us that are here today are
teaching<00:00:52.620> doctors<00:00:53.039> but<00:00:53.730> most<00:00:53.940> people

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
teaching doctors but most people

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.250 
teaching doctors but most people
actually<00:00:54.360> don't<00:00:54.600> know<00:00:54.750> what<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.930> word<00:00:55.050> doctor

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
actually don't know what the word doctor

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.779 
actually don't know what the word doctor
means<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:56.670> word<00:00:56.850> doctor<00:00:57.239> means<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:58.199> teach<00:00:58.379> a

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
means the word doctor means to teach a

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.000 
means the word doctor means to teach a
doctor<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.180> teacher<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:01.289> for<00:01:01.530> us<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.829> quite

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
doctor is a teacher so for us it's quite

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.280 
doctor is a teacher so for us it's quite
a<00:01:02.039> privilege<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.690> start<00:01:03.960> teaching

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
a privilege to be here to start teaching

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.230 
a privilege to be here to start teaching
the<00:01:04.409> next<00:01:04.559> generation<00:01:04.850> about<00:01:05.850> some<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the next generation about some of the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.039 
the next generation about some of the
wonders<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.780> body<00:01:08.600> learning<00:01:09.600> about<00:01:09.869> it

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
wonders of the body learning about it

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:18.280 
wonders of the body learning about it
and<00:01:10.229> I'm<00:01:10.740> not<00:01:10.979> you're<00:01:11.130> pretty<00:01:11.369> interesting

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.810 

but<00:01:19.290> actually<00:01:19.740> will<00:01:19.890> probably<00:01:20.070> reinforce

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
but actually will probably reinforce

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.370 
but actually will probably reinforce
what<00:01:21.180> we've<00:01:21.360> already<00:01:21.479> been<00:01:21.689> discussing<00:01:21.840> in

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
what we've already been discussing in

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.380 
what we've already been discussing in
class<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:23.159> I'm<00:01:23.369> sure<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.700> adding<00:01:24.119> from<00:01:24.270> what

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
class and I'm sure it's adding from what

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.520 
class and I'm sure it's adding from what
I've<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.540> heard<00:01:24.780> adding<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.350> lot<00:01:25.500> more

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
I've just heard adding a lot more

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.469 
I've just heard adding a lot more
information<00:01:25.920> than<00:01:26.250> what<00:01:26.520> I've<00:01:26.640> covered<00:01:26.939> so

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
information than what I've covered so

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.760 
information than what I've covered so
it's<00:01:27.659> great<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> think<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.290> opening<00:01:28.619> and

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
it's great I think it's opening and

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.590 
it's great I think it's opening and
expanding<00:01:28.799> their<00:01:29.430> minds<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.880> new<00:01:30.030> ideas<00:01:30.150> that

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
expanding their minds to new ideas that

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.330 
expanding their minds to new ideas that
we<00:01:30.689> didn't<00:01:30.840> even<00:01:30.960> discuss<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.829> one<00:01:32.130> thing<00:01:32.280> to

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
we didn't even discuss it's one thing to

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.859 
we didn't even discuss it's one thing to
look<00:01:32.610> at<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> textbook<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.600> I'm<00:01:33.689> sure

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
look at it in a textbook and I'm sure

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.719 
look at it in a textbook and I'm sure
they<00:01:33.990> do<00:01:34.259> learn<00:01:34.530> about<00:01:34.799> these<00:01:35.009> structures<00:01:35.490> and

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
they do learn about these structures and

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.520 
they do learn about these structures and
you<00:01:35.970> know<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.180> school<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.600> classroom<00:01:36.869> but

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
you know in school and classroom but

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.719 
you know in school and classroom but
it's<00:01:37.619> quite<00:01:37.799> another<00:01:37.979> thing<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.220> hold<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.640> in

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
it's quite another thing to hold it in

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.030 
it's quite another thing to hold it in
your<00:01:38.850> hands<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.360> really<00:01:40.140> hold<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.619> human

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
your hands and to really hold a human

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.950 
your hands and to really hold a human
bone<00:01:41.340> compare<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.119> say<00:01:42.420> an<00:01:42.570> ape<00:01:42.689> or

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
bone compare it to that of say an ape or

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.499 
bone compare it to that of say an ape or
you<00:01:43.350> know<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.710> pathological<00:01:44.490> specimen<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.060> you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
you know a pathological specimen and you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.359 
you know a pathological specimen and you
got<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.720> realize<00:01:45.899> yeah<00:01:46.290> that's<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.619> medicine

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
got to realize yeah that's it medicine

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.249 
got to realize yeah that's it medicine
so<00:01:47.759> much<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.270> hands-on<00:01:48.750> learning<00:01:48.990> not<00:01:49.229> just

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
so much is a hands-on learning not just

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.899 
so much is a hands-on learning not just
a<00:01:49.500> book<00:01:49.710> learning<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.460> speak

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
a book learning so to speak

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.719 
a book learning so to speak
I<00:01:50.939> saw<00:01:51.299> how<00:01:51.540> from<00:01:52.259> back<00:01:52.500> then<00:01:52.829> how<00:01:53.310> there<00:01:53.549> was<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
I saw how from back then how there was a

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.499 
I saw how from back then how there was a
skull<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:55.520> involved<00:01:56.520> throughout<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
skull that just involved throughout the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.419 
skull that just involved throughout the
years<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.340> you<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.549> see<00:01:59.790> how<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> change

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
years and you can see how a change

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.300 
years and you can see how a change
and<00:02:01.520> how<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.479> brain<00:02:02.659> expand<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:04.009> how<00:02:04.159> much

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
and how the brain expand so how much

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.849 
and how the brain expand so how much
knowledge<00:02:04.670> we<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:05.329> that<00:02:05.719> we<00:02:05.960> have<00:02:06.200> now

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
knowledge we and that we have now

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:10.119 
knowledge we and that we have now
I<00:02:06.890> enjoyed<00:02:07.640> really<00:02:08.000> seeing<00:02:08.300> how<00:02:09.129> important

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
I enjoyed really seeing how important

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.199 
I enjoyed really seeing how important
the<00:02:10.190> heart<00:02:10.399> really<00:02:10.640> is<00:02:10.759> because<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.000> know<00:02:11.150> you

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
the heart really is because you know you

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.050 
the heart really is because you know you
stretch<00:02:11.569> it<00:02:11.599> is<00:02:12.050> just<00:02:12.349> a<00:02:12.440> lot<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:12.910> even<00:02:13.910> more

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
stretch it is just a lot and even more

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.550 
stretch it is just a lot and even more
knowing<00:02:14.360> that<00:02:14.510> if<00:02:14.690> something's<00:02:15.080> wrong<00:02:15.500> you

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
knowing that if something's wrong you

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.130 
knowing that if something's wrong you
could<00:02:15.890> pretty<00:02:16.099> much<00:02:16.220> die<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.989> blood<00:02:17.989> pressure

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
could pretty much die and blood pressure

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.220 
could pretty much die and blood pressure
is<00:02:18.379> also<00:02:18.530> equally<00:02:18.980> important<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:20.140> want<00:02:21.140> to

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
is also equally important I want to

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.680 
is also equally important I want to
learn<00:02:21.290> more<00:02:21.500> about<00:02:21.560> anatomy<00:02:22.129> anatomy<00:02:22.599> from<00:02:23.599> my

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
learn more about anatomy anatomy from my

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.500 
learn more about anatomy anatomy from my
interest<00:02:23.959> in<00:02:24.049> art<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:24.650> it'll<00:02:25.489> help<00:02:25.610> me<00:02:25.730> like<00:02:25.940> no

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
interest in art so it'll help me like no

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.000 
interest in art so it'll help me like no
more<00:02:26.720> placement<00:02:27.260> of<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:27.440> bones<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:27.890> things

more placement of the bones and things
as<00:02:28.220> such<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.750> would<00:02:29.750> consider<00:02:30.110> being<00:02:30.410> a

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
as such I would consider being a

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.699 
as such I would consider being a
scientist<00:02:31.580> because<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.750> studies<00:02:33.170> more<00:02:33.440> about

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
scientist because it studies more about

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.729 
scientist because it studies more about
the<00:02:34.040> body<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:35.260> medicines<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.530> how<00:02:36.620> it
