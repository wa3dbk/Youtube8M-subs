means something so I think we should all
keep<00:03:09.569> our<00:03:09.720> eyes<00:03:09.840> out<00:03:10.049> for<00:03:10.109> it<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.889> we<00:03:11.370> should

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
keep our eyes out for it and we should

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
definitely really try to my my idea is

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.149 
definitely really try to my my idea is
that<00:03:14.909> it's<00:03:15.420> it's<00:03:16.170> hinting<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.769> something

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
that it's it's hinting to something

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
the new skill or its hinting to a new

had a dream was weird I had dreamed that

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.980 
had a dream was weird I had dreamed that
I<00:05:03.639> went<00:05:03.910> on<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.030> computer<00:05:04.389> and<00:05:04.510> the<00:05:04.570> new<00:05:04.750> skill

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
I went on the computer and the new skill

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.260 
I went on the computer and the new skill
came<00:05:05.169> out<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:05.710> new<00:05:05.889> skill<00:05:06.190> was<00:05:06.370> swimming
