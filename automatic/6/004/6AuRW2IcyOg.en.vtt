rub it in you want to just Pat it in and

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.040 
rub it in you want to just Pat it in and
this<00:02:36.520> is<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.730> small<00:02:37.060> brisket<00:02:37.630> if<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:37.870> have<00:02:38.020> a

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
this is a small brisket if I have a

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.920 
this is a small brisket if I have a
larger<00:02:38.470> brisket<00:02:39.130> sometimes<00:02:39.550> I<00:02:39.730> eject<00:02:40.210> it<00:02:40.360> with

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
larger brisket sometimes I eject it with

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.410 
larger brisket sometimes I eject it with
a<00:02:41.040> 50-percent<00:02:42.040> apple<00:02:42.760> juice<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.120> fifty

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
a 50-percent apple juice and fifty

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.720 
a 50-percent apple juice and fifty
percent<00:02:43.780> coca-cola<00:02:44.200> solution<00:02:45.010> but<00:02:45.490> i'm<00:02:45.610> not

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
percent coca-cola solution but i'm not

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.300 
percent coca-cola solution but i'm not
going<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.030> inject<00:02:46.390> this<00:02:46.630> one<00:02:46.870> because<00:02:47.830> it's

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
going to inject this one because it's

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.190 
going to inject this one because it's
pretty<00:02:48.790> small<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.270> i<00:02:49.360> don't<00:02:49.540> think<00:02:49.720> i<00:02:49.810> need<00:02:49.870> to

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
pretty small and i don't think i need to

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:58.170 
pretty small and i don't think i need to
subject<00:02:50.350> it<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:54.420> when<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:55.510> put<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:57.180> brisket

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
subject it and when you put the brisket

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.940 
subject it and when you put the brisket
on<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.600> smoker<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.230> want<00:02:59.410> always<00:02:59.710> put<00:02:59.920> it

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
on the smoker you want always put it

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.790 
on the smoker you want always put it
with<00:03:00.130> a<00:03:00.160> fat<00:03:00.460> side<00:03:00.730> up<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.500> fact

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
with a fat side up and this is a fact

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.300 
with a fat side up and this is a fact
side<00:03:03.070> so<00:03:03.370> this<00:03:03.520> will<00:03:03.700> go<00:03:03.850> on<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:05.440> smoker<00:03:05.890> just

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
side so this will go on the smoker just

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.610 
side so this will go on the smoker just
like<00:03:06.670> this<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.240> the<00:03:07.780> reason<00:03:08.110> for<00:03:08.140> that<00:03:08.290> is

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
like this and the reason for that is

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.060 
like this and the reason for that is
because<00:03:08.680> of<00:03:09.130> fat<00:03:09.630> adds<00:03:10.630> moisture<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:11.890> will

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
because of fat adds moisture and it will

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.290 
because of fat adds moisture and it will
coat<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:13.170> brisket<00:03:14.170> as<00:03:14.370> smoking<00:03:15.370> so<00:03:15.940> it's<00:03:16.120> kind

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
coat the brisket as smoking so it's kind

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:27.420 
coat the brisket as smoking so it's kind
of<00:03:16.360> like<00:03:16.450> based<00:03:16.780> in<00:03:17.020> it

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:43.480 

we<00:03:28.430> just<00:03:28.670> rub<00:03:28.880> this<00:03:29.290> mushroom<00:03:30.290> there

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:04:02.170 

more<00:03:44.360> for<00:03:44.510> my<00:03:44.570> hand<00:03:44.840> off

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:21.310 

one<00:04:02.810> put<00:04:03.079> the<00:04:03.530> rub<00:04:03.739> on

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:05:10.470 

then<00:04:21.920> just<00:04:22.100> kind<00:04:22.220> of<00:04:22.370> Pat<00:04:22.580> it<00:04:22.730> in

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.629 

and<00:05:11.480> you<00:05:11.570> won't<00:05:11.780> let<00:05:12.170> this<00:05:12.350> sit<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:13.370> rest<00:05:13.490> for

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
and you won't let this sit and rest for

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.700 
and you won't let this sit and rest for
at<00:05:14.000> least<00:05:14.210> 30<00:05:14.570> minutes<00:05:14.870> before<00:05:15.139> it<00:05:15.350> goes<00:05:15.500> on

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
at least 30 minutes before it goes on

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.860 
at least 30 minutes before it goes on
the<00:05:15.860> smoker<00:05:16.870> because<00:05:17.870> that<00:05:18.080> way<00:05:18.230> the<00:05:19.870> spices

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
the smoker because that way the spices

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.629 
the smoker because that way the spices
from<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.110> rub<00:05:21.380> and<00:05:21.530> everything<00:05:21.889> penetrates

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
from the rub and everything penetrates

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.420 
from the rub and everything penetrates
of<00:05:22.790> meat<00:05:22.970> and<00:05:23.120> it<00:05:23.600> gets<00:05:23.780> a<00:05:24.080> flavor<00:05:24.919> in<00:05:25.130> it<00:05:25.160> and

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
of meat and it gets a flavor in it and

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.250 
of meat and it gets a flavor in it and
something<00:05:26.330> else<00:05:26.450> what<00:05:26.690> you<00:05:26.810> have<00:05:26.960> to<00:05:27.110> have
