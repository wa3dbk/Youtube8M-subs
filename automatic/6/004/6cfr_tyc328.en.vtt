elegance so what are the techniques

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.999 
elegance so what are the techniques
involved<00:01:07.909> well<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:09.170> most<00:01:09.320> important

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
involved well the most important

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.100 
involved well the most important
technique<00:01:10.430> for<00:01:10.670> staccatos<00:01:11.270> is<00:01:11.509> generally

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
technique for staccatos is generally

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.830 
technique for staccatos is generally
using<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.979> wrist<00:01:13.250> now<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:14.180> reason<00:01:14.659> why<00:01:14.780> this

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
using the wrist now the reason why this

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.840 
using the wrist now the reason why this
is<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:15.229> important<00:01:15.710> is<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:15.950> arms<00:01:16.399> are<00:01:16.610> very

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
is so important is the arms are very

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.540 
is so important is the arms are very
heavy<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.270> big<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.140> if<00:01:18.590> I<00:01:18.710> tried<00:01:19.130> to<00:01:19.280> play<00:01:19.399> the

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
heavy and big and if I tried to play the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.399 
heavy and big and if I tried to play the
staccato<00:01:19.880> is<00:01:20.000> using<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.420> arm<00:01:20.659> you'd<00:01:21.200> get<00:01:21.380> a

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
staccato is using the arm you'd get a

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:30.969 
staccato is using the arm you'd get a
sound<00:01:21.710> like<00:01:21.979> this

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.440 

sounds<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.039> a<00:01:32.100> limp<00:01:32.399> Biskit<00:01:32.969> doesn't<00:01:33.329> it

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
sounds like a limp Biskit doesn't it

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.389 
sounds like a limp Biskit doesn't it
doesn't<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.079> snack<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:35.070> arms<00:01:35.310> are

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
doesn't have that snack the arms are

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.910 
doesn't have that snack the arms are
just<00:01:35.429> too<00:01:35.729> big<00:01:35.969> and<00:01:36.119> ponderous<00:01:36.750> now<00:01:37.289> how<00:01:37.859> do

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
just too big and ponderous now how do

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.770 
just too big and ponderous now how do
you<00:01:38.070> approach<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.759> staccato<00:01:39.359> from<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
you approach the staccato from the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.349 
you approach the staccato from the
wrists<00:01:39.990> well<00:01:40.500> if<00:01:40.649> it's<00:01:40.799> single<00:01:41.159> notes<00:01:41.429> you<00:01:42.149> go

staccato<00:02:14.190> ZAR<00:02:14.489> done<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.849> one<00:02:15.360> motion<00:02:15.660> it's<00:02:16.440> a

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
staccato ZAR done is one motion it's a

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.500 
staccato ZAR done is one motion it's a
down<00:02:16.890> for<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.310> first<00:02:17.489> note<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.940> slur<00:02:18.239> and

down for the first note of the slur and
then<00:02:18.810> up<00:02:19.019> for<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.410> staccato<00:02:19.769> as<00:02:20.129> follows<00:02:21.200> down

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
then up for the staccato as follows down

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.460 
then up for the staccato as follows down
up<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:24.390> that's<00:02:24.599> all<00:02:24.810> there<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.170> it

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
up so that's all there is to it

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.509 
up so that's all there is to it
and<00:02:26.299> so<00:02:27.299> in<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.810> case<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.890> beginning<00:02:29.340> of

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
and so in the case of the beginning of

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.080 
and so in the case of the beginning of
this<00:02:30.000> Sonata<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.989> would<00:02:31.079> be<00:02:31.230> down<00:02:31.890> up<00:02:32.280> down<00:02:33.030> up

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
this Sonata it would be down up down up

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:41.720 
this Sonata it would be down up down up
down<00:02:33.690> up<00:02:33.750> down<00:02:34.380> up<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:39.829> this<00:02:40.829> is<00:02:41.010> true<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.280> all

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
down up down up and this is true of all

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.789 
down up down up and this is true of all
staccato<00:02:42.269> so<00:02:42.510> for<00:02:42.750> example<00:02:43.260> in<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.590> right

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
staccato so for example in the right

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.699 
staccato so for example in the right
hand<00:02:44.100> we<00:02:44.519> have<00:02:44.730> five<00:02:45.060> notes<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:46.139> are<00:02:46.290> slurred

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
hand we have five notes that are slurred

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.110 
hand we have five notes that are slurred
and<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.160> last<00:02:47.370> one<00:02:47.519> is<00:02:47.639> staccato

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
and the last one is staccato

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.629 
and the last one is staccato
so<00:02:48.450> it's<00:02:48.599> down<00:02:48.989> in<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.230> first<00:02:49.530> one<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:49.980> up<00:02:50.340> on

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
so it's down in the first one and up on

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:55.250 
so it's down in the first one and up on
the<00:02:50.819> last<00:02:51.000> one<00:02:53.359> this<00:02:54.359> happens<00:02:54.930> again<00:02:55.079> and

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
the last one this happens again and

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.090 
the last one this happens again and
again<00:02:55.620> as<00:02:55.799> you'll<00:02:55.980> see

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.040 

notice<00:03:03.100> how<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.310> wrist<00:03:03.640> goes<00:03:03.970> up<00:03:04.270> it<00:03:04.990> goes

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
notice how the wrist goes up it goes

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.840 
notice how the wrist goes up it goes
down<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.830> start<00:03:06.160> of<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.550> slurred<00:03:06.819> notes

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
down to the start of the slurred notes

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.690 
down to the start of the slurred notes
and<00:03:07.360> up<00:03:07.630> on<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:07.990> last<00:03:08.230> notes<00:03:08.590> this<00:03:09.280> gives<00:03:09.580> a

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
and up on the last notes this gives a

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.180 
and up on the last notes this gives a
beautiful<00:03:10.319> architecture<00:03:11.319> to<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.500> phrasing

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
beautiful architecture to the phrasing

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.980 
beautiful architecture to the phrasing
and<00:03:12.400> so<00:03:12.910> once<00:03:13.120> again<00:03:13.240> when<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:13.630> put<00:03:13.660> it<00:03:13.900> all

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
and so once again when you put it all

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.650 
and so once again when you put it all
together<00:03:14.200> I'm<00:03:14.680> going<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.040> play<00:03:15.190> it<00:03:15.310> slowly<00:03:15.790> so

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
together I'm going to play it slowly so

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.570 
together I'm going to play it slowly so
you<00:03:16.750> can<00:03:16.900> see<00:03:17.170> how<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.530> risks<00:03:18.040> are<00:03:18.160> working<00:03:18.459> in

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
you can see how the risks are working in

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.120 
you can see how the risks are working in
both<00:03:19.090> hands<00:03:19.420> both<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.230> down<00:03:20.530> up<00:03:20.800> the<00:03:20.920> quick

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
both hands both the down up the quick

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.309 
both hands both the down up the quick
down<00:03:21.340> up<00:03:21.520> for<00:03:21.700> each<00:03:21.850> individual<00:03:22.569> staccato<00:03:22.989> as

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
down up for each individual staccato as

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.150 
down up for each individual staccato as
well<00:03:24.010> as<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.340> down<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.090> up<00:03:25.569> for<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.440> extended

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
well as the down and up for the extended

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:44.509 
well as the down and up for the extended
notes<00:03:27.730> of<00:03:28.000> a<00:03:28.180> slur<00:03:28.540> ending<00:03:29.050> in<00:03:29.140> staccato<00:03:29.530> and

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.130 

that<00:03:45.519> is<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.910> secret<00:03:46.209> you'll<00:03:46.750> get<00:03:46.959> great

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
that is the secret you'll get great

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.430 
that is the secret you'll get great
speed<00:03:47.650> more<00:03:48.310> than<00:03:48.489> that<00:03:48.700> it<00:03:49.000> actually<00:03:49.930> has<00:03:50.230> the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
speed more than that it actually has the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.790 
speed more than that it actually has the
perception<00:03:51.370> of<00:03:51.580> being<00:03:52.120> faster<00:03:53.050> when<00:03:53.410> you<00:03:53.530> play

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
perception of being faster when you play

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.670 
perception of being faster when you play
very<00:03:54.069> very<00:03:54.450> articulated<00:03:55.450> so<00:03:56.170> you<00:03:56.230> may<00:03:56.470> not

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
very very articulated so you may not

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.500 
very very articulated so you may not
have<00:03:56.830> to<00:03:56.980> play<00:03:57.130> as<00:03:57.280> fast<00:03:57.550> a<00:03:57.730> tempo<00:03:58.030> to<00:03:58.180> make<00:03:58.360> it

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
have to play as fast a tempo to make it

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.380 
have to play as fast a tempo to make it
have<00:03:58.780> a<00:03:58.810> lively<00:03:59.530> feel<00:03:59.769> in<00:04:00.130> your<00:04:00.250> music<00:04:00.700> this<00:04:01.180> is

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
have a lively feel in your music this is

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.910 
have a lively feel in your music this is
something<00:04:01.630> that<00:04:01.660> translates<00:04:02.319> not<00:04:02.530> just<00:04:02.769> for

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
something that translates not just for

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.640 
something that translates not just for
Mozart<00:04:03.100> but<00:04:03.910> all<00:04:04.150> period<00:04:04.720> styles<00:04:05.110> of<00:04:05.230> music
