 hello everyone my name is screamer vitali and 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.099
 This is a review of the backpack tactics from Stitch Pros 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.139
 this is an ordinary backpack it is designed to 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.800
 field exits and is also suitable for 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.000
 extreme tourism such equipment 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.760
 always raised 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.650
 reliability requirements we 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.340
 We will tell about it in detail as well 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.320
 test for strength 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.880
 the first thing you want to mention tactics do not 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.800
 has a metal frame 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.410
 and rigidity provide polymer 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.750
 inserts which greatly facilitates the backpack 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.670
 soft cushioning panels on the back 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.890
 do not let her get tired during long 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.200
 wearing a lap band allows 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.960
 evenly distribute the load to the total 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.750
 backpack volume 50 liters main volume 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.969
 offices 35 and thanks to the front 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.219
 downloads can actually accommodate much 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.410
 there is more special here 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.149
 partition mounted on Velcro with 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.410
 through which the branch can 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.140
 divided into 2 parts 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.140
 as well as four pockets with elastic bands 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.700
 the top of the main compartment is located 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.590
 An adjustable mesh pocket in it is comfortable 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.270
 which should have equipment 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.270
 be fixed and not hang out 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.159
 side pockets close to false 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.869
 taxi and quite roomy but with 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.970
 this they are very compact and being 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.860
 Empty does not interfere because they do not create 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.290
 additional volume to regulate 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.210
 which helps hardware one more 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.310
 pocket is on top of the backpack 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.960
 and on the front side is open 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.030
 pocket for things that can 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.070
 require quick access for 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.520
 fixing the tent and karemat on top and 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.890
 below 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.289
 there are stretch lines that are 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.240
 dismantle them so they can be 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.759
 removed so as not to interfere when they are not 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.950
 You need or can outweigh on the side 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.479
 or the front of the backpack to 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.670
 to fasten us additional equipment 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.289
 since she has a large backpack 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.390
 number of accessories we decided it 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.100
 try the first thing we bought ordinary 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.700
 Chinese Fastex so that was what 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.619
 compare 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.399
 and then it's your turn dachshund stich 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.319
 against but we never succumbed to tactics 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.480
 has comfortable wide shoulder straps with soft 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:20.720
 lining which we also experienced on 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:22.790
 strength bandage as the webbing is equipped 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.579
 padded and equipped with moths on 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.680
 to the outside if we talk about molly then 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:30.049
 there is enough of it from the trail 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.109
 top side pockets and front 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.220
 side of the backpack 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:36.109
 to check the quality of the fabric on 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.000
 abrasion we dragged tactics along 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.739
 concrete floor with broken glass and 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.299
 bricks 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.340
 however, the thousandth carda previously showed and 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.100
 mind as the cell fell only a little 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.230
 stained 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.630
 the next point was to try 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.910
 the handle we loaded into the backpack about 30 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.740
 kilogram however our scales were 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.120
 designed for only 10 and failed 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.160
 display exact weight 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.350
 and then we dropped it thereby 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:06.260
 checking for break test data 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:08.750
 tactics passed with ease we did not hear 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.120
 they didnâ€™t see the crack 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.980
 design changes were therefore 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.750
 it was decided to repeat the test which also 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.040
 ended successfully below tactic 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.050
 there is a special compartment 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.450
 Where is in waterproof case 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.480
 to protect the backpack from rain and other 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.310
 precipitation was decided to test it in 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.010
 pond to check the impact is not 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.140
 only water but also dirt but in a case 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.210
 backpack float like a boat on 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.760
 the test results turned out to be a case 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:43.010
 clean and did not collect moisture and the backpack itself 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:45.140
 completely dry more information about
