00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
personally as fanatic I don't think of

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.020 
personally as fanatic I don't think of
it<00:00:31.289> well<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.800> went<00:00:32.160> as<00:00:32.309> well<00:00:32.700> as<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.910> should

it well it went as well as it should
have<00:00:33.270> at<00:00:33.390> all<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.690> expected<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.290> do<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> lot

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
have at all we expected to do a lot

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.229 
have at all we expected to do a lot
better<00:00:34.920> than<00:00:35.070> we<00:00:35.130> did<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.550> got<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.880> brackets

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
better than we did we got the brackets

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.990 
better than we did we got the brackets
we<00:00:36.360> wanted<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:37.010> just<00:00:38.010> did<00:00:38.190> not<00:00:38.309> perform<00:00:38.550> as

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
we wanted and we just did not perform as

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.959 
we wanted and we just did not perform as
well<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.600> we<00:00:39.840> should<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:40.050> at<00:00:40.230> all<00:00:40.489> as<00:00:41.489> far<00:00:41.550> as

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
well as we should have at all as far as

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.119 
well as we should have at all as far as
the<00:00:42.149> event<00:00:42.450> itself<00:00:42.600> goes<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.440> think<00:00:43.890> there<00:00:44.040> are

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the event itself goes I think there are

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.850 
the event itself goes I think there are
some<00:00:44.399> pros<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.300> cons<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.660> for<00:00:45.930> sure<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
some pros and cons to it for sure the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.430 
some pros and cons to it for sure the
way<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> rules<00:00:47.610> were<00:00:47.820> set<00:00:48.030> up<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.440> just

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
way that the rules were set up and just

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.869 
way that the rules were set up and just
some<00:00:49.620> problems<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.160> format<00:00:50.489> itself

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
some problems with the format itself

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.299 
some problems with the format itself
really<00:00:51.480> manifested<00:00:52.140> itself<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.829> infected

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
really manifested itself and infected

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.959 
really manifested itself and infected
the<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.910> results<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.629> my<00:00:54.780> opinion<00:00:55.110> but<00:00:55.860> at<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
the the results in my opinion but at the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.090 
the the results in my opinion but at the
same<00:00:57.210> time<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.750> also<00:00:57.780> hit<00:00:58.079> peak<00:00:58.350> viewership<00:00:58.710> so

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
same time we also hit peak viewership so

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.340 
same time we also hit peak viewership so
I<00:00:59.129> think<00:00:59.250> that<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.270> really<00:01:00.300> proves<00:01:00.780> where<00:01:01.170> this

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
I think that it really proves where this

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.889 
I think that it really proves where this
sport<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:02.010> go<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.550> at<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.180> same<00:01:03.329> time<00:01:03.390> shows

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
sport can go and at the same time shows

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.230 
sport can go and at the same time shows
what's<00:01:04.170> wrong<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:05.400> one<00:01:05.640> ways<00:01:05.820> are

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
what's wrong with it so in one ways are

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.450 
what's wrong with it so in one ways are
in<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.750> big<00:01:07.170> way<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.710> kind<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.950> encouraging

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
in a big way it's kind of encouraging

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.890 
in a big way it's kind of encouraging
because<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:08.970> anything<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.570> going<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.810> change

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
because if anything is going to change

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.530 
because if anything is going to change
for<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:11.040> better<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.490> if<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.420> get

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
for the better and if it's going to get

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.789 
for the better and if it's going to get
better<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.020> going<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.200> get<00:01:13.290> really<00:01:13.350> big

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
better and it's going to get really big

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.800 
better and it's going to get really big
it's<00:01:13.979> going<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.159> happen<00:01:14.340> very<00:01:14.909> soon<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.540> that's

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
it's going to happen very soon so that's

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.740 
it's going to happen very soon so that's
a<00:01:16.080> that's<00:01:16.710> encouraging<00:01:17.340> at<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.479> very<00:01:18.600> least

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
a that's encouraging at the very least

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.410 
a that's encouraging at the very least
but<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.500> us<00:01:19.590> again<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> lot<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.240> work

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
but for us again we have a lot of work

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.870 
but for us again we have a lot of work
to<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> lot<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.900> changes<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.729> regardless<00:01:23.729> of

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880

David was saying basically we saw a

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.350 
David was saying basically we saw a
glimpse<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.530> hope<00:01:37.740> for<00:01:38.130> World<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.640> Tanks<00:01:38.820> it's

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
glimpse of hope for World of Tanks it's

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.300 
glimpse of hope for World of Tanks it's
trying<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.750> prove<00:01:39.930> itself<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.799> global

trying to prove itself on the global
scene<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.610> eSports<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.930> definitely<00:01:43.140> a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
scene of eSports it's definitely a

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.830 
scene of eSports it's definitely a
deserving<00:01:43.950> title<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.119> requires<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.630> little

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
deserving title but it requires a little

that<00:01:48.930> wargaming<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:50.189> going<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.460> be<00:01:50.549> stepping

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
that wargaming is going to be stepping

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.120 
that wargaming is going to be stepping
up<00:01:51.090> their<00:01:51.540> game<00:01:51.649> coming<00:01:52.649> into<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> next

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
up their game coming into the next

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.850 
up their game coming into the next
season<00:01:53.430> next<00:01:54.060> year<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.689> hopefully<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.710> next

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
season next year and hopefully the next

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.330 
season next year and hopefully the next
grand<00:01:56.520> finals<00:01:57.000> are<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> be<00:01:57.719> only<00:01:58.020> better

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
grand finals are going to be only better

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.620 
grand finals are going to be only better

well<00:02:10.420> within<00:02:11.379> this<00:02:11.530> year<00:02:11.769> as<00:02:12.040> for<00:02:12.639> us<00:02:12.760> as<00:02:13.269> David

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
well within this year as for us as David

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.170 
well within this year as for us as David
said<00:02:13.659> I<00:02:13.959> mean<00:02:14.230> we<00:02:14.639> learned<00:02:15.639> a<00:02:15.700> pretty<00:02:15.879> harsh

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
said I mean we learned a pretty harsh

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.559 
said I mean we learned a pretty harsh
lesson<00:02:16.629> this<00:02:17.349> this<00:02:17.950> time<00:02:18.159> around<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.670> I'm

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
lesson this this time around and I'm

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.780 
lesson this this time around and I'm
think<00:02:19.930> there<00:02:20.260> will<00:02:20.349> be<00:02:20.409> definitely<00:02:20.829> changes

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
think there will be definitely changes

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.629 
think there will be definitely changes
that<00:02:21.969> will<00:02:22.150> will<00:02:22.780> account<00:02:23.049> for<00:02:23.200> into<00:02:24.159> the<00:02:24.370> next

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:24.639 
that will will account for into the next

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.250 
that will will account for into the next
tournament<00:02:25.329> all<00:02:25.689> right<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:25.959> mean<00:02:26.109> it<00:02:26.170> seems

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
tournament all right I mean it seems

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.690 
tournament all right I mean it seems
guys<00:02:26.530> are<00:02:26.620> addressing<00:02:26.950> two<00:02:27.099> things<00:02:27.400> here<00:02:27.579> of

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
guys are addressing two things here of

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.129 
guys are addressing two things here of
course<00:02:27.730> one<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.329> things<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:28.959> you

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:29.139 
course one that things that you

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:30.959 
course one that things that you
personally<00:02:29.469> want<00:02:29.859> to<00:02:29.950> change<00:02:30.129> and<00:02:30.340> then<00:02:30.430> the

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:30.969 
personally want to change and then the

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.149 
personally want to change and then the
other<00:02:31.000> being<00:02:31.359> look<00:02:31.840> about<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.439> event<00:02:32.680> so

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
other being look about the event so

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.860 
other being look about the event so
could<00:02:33.310> we<00:02:33.430> maybe<00:02:33.579> elaborate<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.419> begin<00:02:34.689> with

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
could we maybe elaborate to begin with

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.110 
could we maybe elaborate to begin with
what<00:02:35.139> you<00:02:35.290> would<00:02:35.409> change<00:02:35.590> in<00:02:35.799> your<00:02:36.010> game<00:02:36.819> style

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
what you would change in your game style

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.780 
what you would change in your game style
or<00:02:37.389> what<00:02:37.569> went<00:02:37.780> wrong<00:02:37.959> so<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.349> say<00:02:38.639> this<00:02:39.639> time

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
or what went wrong so to say this time

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.610 
or what went wrong so to say this time
for<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.150> guys<00:02:42.180> really<00:02:43.180> we've<00:02:43.599> always<00:02:44.230> tried

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
for you guys really we've always tried

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.039 
for you guys really we've always tried
to<00:02:44.739> play<00:02:45.069> an<00:02:45.370> aggressive<00:02:46.209> way<00:02:46.389> for<00:02:47.019> a

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
to play an aggressive way for a

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.670 
to play an aggressive way for a
multitude<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.769> reasons<00:02:47.949> for<00:02:48.219> viewership<00:02:48.790> for

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
multitude of reasons for viewership for

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.809 
multitude of reasons for viewership for
controlled<00:02:50.680> because<00:02:50.889> we<00:02:51.489> think<00:02:51.639> it's

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
controlled because we think it's

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.699 
controlled because we think it's
important<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.299> and<00:02:52.719> I<00:02:52.750> think<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:52.989> think<00:02:53.379> I<00:02:53.439> still

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
important to and I think I think I still

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.339 
important to and I think I think I still
think<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.219> it's<00:02:55.000> ideal<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.569> take<00:02:55.989> control<00:02:56.109> of

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
think that it's ideal to take control of

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.289 
think that it's ideal to take control of
the<00:02:56.500> match<00:02:56.680> but<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.489> way<00:02:57.609> the<00:02:57.730> game<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:57.939> right

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
the match but the way the game is right

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.959 
the match but the way the game is right
now<00:02:58.449> doing<00:02:59.439> so<00:02:59.680> puts<00:02:59.949> you<00:03:00.159> at<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.400> greatest

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:00.969 
now doing so puts you at the greatest

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.849 
now doing so puts you at the greatest
risk<00:03:01.329> however<00:03:01.810> if<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.349> do<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.650> perfectly

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
risk however if you do it perfectly

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.179 
risk however if you do it perfectly
nobody<00:03:03.639> can<00:03:03.730> stop<00:03:03.969> you<00:03:04.650> some<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.829> aspects

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
nobody can stop you some of the aspects

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.429 
nobody can stop you some of the aspects
of<00:03:06.219> the<00:03:06.340> game<00:03:06.370> make<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.230> extremely<00:03:08.230> difficult

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439 
of the game make it extremely difficult

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.409 
of the game make it extremely difficult
even<00:03:09.099> the<00:03:09.219> best<00:03:09.400> in<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.639> world<00:03:09.819> don't<00:03:10.120> do<00:03:10.299> it

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:10.419 
even the best in the world don't do it

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.509 
even the best in the world don't do it
perfectly<00:03:10.599> so<00:03:11.019> they<00:03:11.139> themselves<00:03:11.349> chose<00:03:11.949> to

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
perfectly so they themselves chose to

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.580 
perfectly so they themselves chose to
play<00:03:12.699> passively<00:03:13.180> this<00:03:13.419> time<00:03:13.629> and<00:03:13.840> in<00:03:14.349> the<00:03:14.439> end

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
play passively this time and in the end

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.249 
play passively this time and in the end
it<00:03:14.859> was<00:03:15.459> proven<00:03:15.909> to<00:03:16.090> be<00:03:16.209> more<00:03:16.389> effective<00:03:16.840> so<00:03:16.989> I

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:17.259 
it was proven to be more effective so I

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.219 
it was proven to be more effective so I
think<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:17.889> we<00:03:18.669> either<00:03:18.939> need<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.299> address

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:20.229 
think that we either need to address

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:22.770 
think that we either need to address
that<00:03:20.949> and<00:03:21.189> play<00:03:21.519> more<00:03:21.790> defensively<00:03:22.389> which

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
that and play more defensively which

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.319 
that and play more defensively which
we're<00:03:23.590> still<00:03:23.829> hesitant<00:03:24.129> to<00:03:24.220> do<00:03:24.430> but<00:03:24.819> hopefully

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
we're still hesitant to do but hopefully

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.539 
we're still hesitant to do but hopefully
with<00:03:26.049> these<00:03:26.259> lessons<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:26.859> with<00:03:27.220> what's<00:03:27.430> been

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
with these lessons and with what's been

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.149 
with these lessons and with what's been
shown<00:03:27.790> wargaming<00:03:28.359> will<00:03:28.599> help<00:03:29.409> change<00:03:29.500> some<00:03:30.129> of

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
shown wargaming will help change some of

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.240 
shown wargaming will help change some of
these<00:03:30.370> things<00:03:30.639> so<00:03:30.819> perhaps<00:03:31.030> aggression<00:03:31.810> is

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
these things so perhaps aggression is

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.530 
these things so perhaps aggression is
maybe<00:03:33.250> not<00:03:34.470> easier<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.500> play<00:03:35.889> but<00:03:36.099> is<00:03:36.189> at<00:03:36.310> least

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
maybe not easier to play but is at least

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.289 
maybe not easier to play but is at least
more<00:03:37.540> effective<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:38.739> it's<00:03:39.609> not<00:03:39.849> nearly<00:03:40.209> as

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
more effective and it's not nearly as

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.899 
more effective and it's not nearly as
much<00:03:40.479> for<00:03:40.689> risk<00:03:40.900> as<00:03:41.079> it<00:03:41.199> is<00:03:41.319> right<00:03:41.439> now<00:03:41.909> okay

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
much for risk as it is right now okay

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.499 
much for risk as it is right now okay
just<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:44.049> kind<00:03:44.349> of<00:03:44.439> give<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:45.040> parallel<00:03:46.030> example

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:46.509 
just to kind of give a parallel example

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.780 
just to kind of give a parallel example
I<00:03:46.569> guess<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.959> what<00:03:47.169> we<00:03:47.319> try<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.590> do<00:03:47.859> and<00:03:48.220> perhaps

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
I guess of what we try to do and perhaps

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.080 
I guess of what we try to do and perhaps
what<00:03:49.269> we<00:03:49.590> should<00:03:50.590> have<00:03:50.620> done<00:03:50.709> is<00:03:51.009> every<00:03:51.969> now

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
what we should have done is every now

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.300 
what we should have done is every now
and<00:03:52.239> then<00:03:52.359> in<00:03:52.509> sports<00:03:53.319> you<00:03:53.560> have<00:03:53.709> a<00:03:53.739> team

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
and then in sports you have a team

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.849 
and then in sports you have a team
that's<00:03:54.519> trying<00:03:54.729> to<00:03:54.909> play<00:03:55.239> against<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:56.079> certain

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
that's trying to play against a certain

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.559 
that's trying to play against a certain
set<00:03:57.189> of<00:03:57.219> the<00:03:57.669> meta<00:03:57.909> so<00:03:58.629> to<00:03:58.689> speak<00:03:58.930> right<00:03:59.290> and

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
set of the meta so to speak right and

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.949 
set of the meta so to speak right and
you<00:04:01.569> know<00:04:01.689> in<00:04:02.650> NBA<00:04:03.009> you<00:04:03.129> have<00:04:03.509> this<00:04:04.509> you<00:04:04.840> know

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
you know in NBA you have this you know

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.659 
you know in NBA you have this you know
the<00:04:05.139> sun's<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.739> Phoenix<00:04:06.099> sounds<00:04:06.310> used<00:04:06.489> to<00:04:06.549> be

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
the sun's the Phoenix sounds used to be

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.520 
the sun's the Phoenix sounds used to be
very<00:04:06.699> aggressive<00:04:07.120> very<00:04:07.419> offensive<00:04:07.959> and<00:04:08.289> then

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
very aggressive very offensive and then

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.099 
very aggressive very offensive and then
come<00:04:08.949> the<00:04:08.979> playoffs<00:04:09.599> they<00:04:10.599> would<00:04:10.810> fall<00:04:11.079> to

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
come the playoffs they would fall to

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.770 
come the playoffs they would fall to
very<00:04:11.500> defensive<00:04:12.009> teams<00:04:12.250> I<00:04:12.459> would<00:04:13.359> say<00:04:13.750> that

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
very defensive teams I would say that

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.110 
very defensive teams I would say that
it's<00:04:14.229> something<00:04:14.469> that<00:04:14.739> we<00:04:14.919> we<00:04:15.400> try<00:04:15.669> to<00:04:15.729> set

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
it's something that we we try to set

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.289 
it's something that we we try to set
it's<00:04:16.359> very<00:04:16.599> fun<00:04:17.409> for<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.769> fans<00:04:18.130> we<00:04:18.459> we<00:04:19.120> have<00:04:19.239> a

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
it's very fun for the fans we we have a

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.580 
it's very fun for the fans we we have a
lot<00:04:19.510> of<00:04:19.709> viewers<00:04:20.709> and

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
lot of viewers and

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.200 
lot of viewers and

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
but he likes us because we play a very

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.659 
but he likes us because we play a very
aggressive<00:04:23.449> form<00:04:24.350> of<00:04:24.440> format<00:04:25.250> of<00:04:25.400> World<00:04:25.580> of

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
aggressive form of format of World of

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.170 
aggressive form of format of World of
Tanks<00:04:25.990> but<00:04:27.040> you<00:04:28.040> know<00:04:28.160> when<00:04:28.639> it<00:04:28.730> comes<00:04:28.850> to

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
Tanks but you know when it comes to

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.860 
Tanks but you know when it comes to
coming<00:04:30.110> up<00:04:30.290> on<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.620> international<00:04:31.100> stage<00:04:31.870> the

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
coming up on the international stage the

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.810 
coming up on the international stage the
pace<00:04:33.110> is<00:04:33.139> much<00:04:33.470> slower<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:34.400> teams

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
pace is much slower and teams

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.060 
pace is much slower and teams
emphasizing<00:04:35.660> your<00:04:35.690> mistakes<00:04:36.169> which<00:04:36.830> do

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
emphasizing your mistakes which do

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.580 
emphasizing your mistakes which do
happen<00:04:37.460> unfortunately<00:04:37.610> and<00:04:38.360> especially<00:04:38.870> when

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
happen unfortunately and especially when

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.320 
happen unfortunately and especially when
you<00:04:39.680> played<00:04:39.860> a<00:04:39.889> very<00:04:40.100> offensive<00:04:40.430> style<00:04:41.060> in

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
you played a very offensive style in

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.480 
you played a very offensive style in
World<00:04:41.540> of<00:04:41.600> Tanks<00:04:41.780> timing<00:04:42.560> is<00:04:42.710> very<00:04:42.770> important

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
World of Tanks timing is very important

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.219 
World of Tanks timing is very important
it's<00:04:43.610> very<00:04:43.790> hard<00:04:44.000> to<00:04:44.030> nail<00:04:44.270> down<00:04:44.300> so<00:04:45.020> if<00:04:45.139> you

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
it's very hard to nail down so if you

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.170 
it's very hard to nail down so if you
make<00:04:45.410> a<00:04:45.440> small<00:04:45.770> tiny<00:04:46.070> tiny<00:04:46.610> mistake<00:04:47.000> and

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
make a small tiny tiny mistake and

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.240 
make a small tiny tiny mistake and
timing<00:04:47.540> it<00:04:47.990> backfires<00:04:48.560> and<00:04:48.710> ripples

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
timing it backfires and ripples

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.830 
timing it backfires and ripples
throughout<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.699> match<00:04:49.880> and<00:04:50.180> it's<00:04:50.630> much

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
throughout the match and it's much

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.650 
throughout the match and it's much
harder<00:04:51.050> to<00:04:51.169> win<00:04:51.440> in<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.620> end
