that<00:01:40.159> it<00:01:40.280> helps<00:01:40.610> Black<00:01:40.820> Friday<00:01:41.119> opening<00:01:41.659> up<00:01:41.780> on

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
that it helps Black Friday opening up on

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.440 
that it helps Black Friday opening up on
Thursday<00:01:42.649> or<00:01:42.829> day<00:01:42.979> that<00:01:43.310> it<00:01:43.399> hurts<00:01:43.670> it<00:01:43.789> no<00:01:44.060> I

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
Thursday or day that it hurts it no I

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.730 
Thursday or day that it hurts it no I
think<00:01:44.659> it<00:01:44.899> hurts<00:01:45.079> if<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.319> lines<00:01:45.530> are

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
think it hurts if the lines are

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.679 
think it hurts if the lines are
definitely<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:46.220> lot<00:01:46.399> shorter<00:01:46.640> this<00:01:47.270> close<00:01:47.569> to
