00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
of people were disappointed that when we

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.580 
of people were disappointed that when we

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
brought out the c300 its 8-bit recording

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.420 
brought out the c300 its 8-bit recording
and<00:02:56.690> 4228<00:02:57.690> bit<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.290> they<00:02:58.740> said<00:02:58.920> well<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.400> know

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
and 4228 bit and they said well you know

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.500 
and 4228 bit and they said well you know
for<00:02:59.700> high-end<00:03:00.090> were<00:03:00.300> used<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.680> RGB<00:03:01.680> 444<00:03:02.520> with

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
for high-end were used to RGB 444 with

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.850 
for high-end were used to RGB 444 with
10<00:03:03.810> minutes<00:03:04.140> 12<00:03:04.530> bits<00:03:05.060> so<00:03:06.060> we<00:03:06.450> said<00:03:06.630> okay<00:03:06.860> c500

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
10 minutes 12 bits so we said okay c500

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.160 
10 minutes 12 bits so we said okay c500
give<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.490> exactly<00:03:08.940> that<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.780> we<00:03:09.900> give<00:03:10.080> you

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
give you exactly that and we give you

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.290 
give you exactly that and we give you
that<00:03:10.380> in<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:11.090> HD<00:03:12.090> or<00:03:12.330> 2k<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.440> 4k<00:03:13.860> @<00:03:14.790> n<00:03:15.060> bits

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
that in the HD or 2k and the 4k @ n bits

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.650 
that in the HD or 2k and the 4k @ n bits
for<00:03:15.660> K<00:03:16.100> so<00:03:17.100> it's<00:03:17.580> big<00:03:17.880> big<00:03:18.120> difference<00:03:18.510> between

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
for K so it's big big difference between

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.050 
for K so it's big big difference between

to<00:03:31.800> pick<00:03:32.730> picture<00:03:33.480> sounds<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.110> think<00:03:34.200> that<00:03:34.530> so

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
to pick picture sounds I think that so

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.180 
to pick picture sounds I think that so
we<00:03:35.580> have<00:03:35.730> all<00:03:35.910> of<00:03:35.940> those<00:03:36.150> on<00:03:36.450> board<00:03:36.720> now

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
we have all of those on board now

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.490 
we have all of those on board now

stops at 60 frames per second but each

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.670 
stops at 60 frames per second but each

of them is working on elevating their

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.210 
of them is working on elevating their
speeds<00:04:15.060> but<00:04:16.060> this<00:04:16.209> way<00:04:16.440> each<00:04:17.440> of<00:04:17.680> them<00:04:17.799> uses

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
speeds but this way each of them uses

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.090 
speeds but this way each of them uses
different<00:04:18.720> tactics<00:04:19.720> strategies<00:04:19.930> and<00:04:20.620> that

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
different tactics strategies and that

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.610 
different tactics strategies and that
allows<00:04:21.430> different<00:04:21.940> workflows<00:04:22.450> so<00:04:23.260> there<00:04:23.500> are

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
allows different workflows so there are

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.500 
allows different workflows so there are
some<00:04:23.770> recorders<00:04:24.370> people<00:04:24.760> prefer<00:04:25.120> them<00:04:25.330> from

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
some recorders people prefer them from

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.659 
some recorders people prefer them from
moviemaking<00:04:25.990> they<00:04:26.620> prepare<00:04:26.950> other<00:04:27.130> recorders

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
moviemaking they prepare other recorders

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.970 
moviemaking they prepare other recorders
for<00:04:27.820> television<00:04:28.300> type<00:04:28.480> production<00:04:29.050> so<00:04:29.710> by
