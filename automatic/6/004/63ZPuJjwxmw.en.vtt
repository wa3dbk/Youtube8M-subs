00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
going to be the left bar that's going to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.399 
going to be the left bar that's going to
be<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.150> front<00:01:20.330> mounting<00:01:20.659> location<00:01:21.170> this<00:01:21.290> is

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
be the front mounting location this is

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.080 
be the front mounting location this is
going<00:01:21.560> to<00:01:21.620> be<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.860> rear<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:22.640> at<00:01:22.760> the<00:01:22.880> front

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
going to be the rear so at the front

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.640 
going to be the rear so at the front
they<00:01:23.240> kind<00:01:23.450> of<00:01:23.479> come<00:01:23.659> with<00:01:23.780> a<00:01:23.810> special<00:01:24.110> bracket

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
they kind of come with a special bracket

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.539 
they kind of come with a special bracket
these<00:01:25.100> are<00:01:25.280> slides<00:01:25.460> specific<00:01:26.060> so<00:01:26.570> these<00:01:26.720> are

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
these are slides specific so these are

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.500 
these are slides specific so these are
actually<00:01:28.549> in<00:01:28.610> this<00:01:28.700> case<00:01:28.909> it<00:01:29.060> would<00:01:29.180> be<00:01:29.210> this

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
actually in this case it would be this

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.170 
actually in this case it would be this
side<00:01:29.750> I<00:01:29.780> believe<00:01:30.280> that<00:01:31.280> kind<00:01:31.520> of<00:01:31.580> bracket<00:01:31.970> kind

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
side I believe that kind of bracket kind

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.500 
side I believe that kind of bracket kind
of<00:01:32.270> ties<00:01:32.450> into<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:32.869> back<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.770> bike<00:01:33.950> from

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
of ties into the back to the bike from

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.240 
of ties into the back to the bike from
where<00:01:35.510> the<00:01:35.600> foot<00:01:35.780> pegs<00:01:35.990> go<00:01:36.260> there's<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:37.010> bolt

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
where the foot pegs go there's a bolt

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.320 
where the foot pegs go there's a bolt
that<00:01:37.400> passes<00:01:37.790> through<00:01:37.940> that<00:01:38.119> kind<00:01:38.240> of

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
that passes through that kind of

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.510 
that passes through that kind of
connects<00:01:38.659> those<00:01:38.869> and<00:01:39.470> then<00:01:39.560> in<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:39.770> back<00:01:39.979> they

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
connects those and then in the back they

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.210 
connects those and then in the back they
actually<00:01:40.880> share<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.510> same<00:01:41.770> bolt<00:01:42.770> that<00:01:43.040> the

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
actually share the same bolt that the

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.620 
actually share the same bolt that the
rear<00:01:45.280> removable<00:01:46.280> lower<00:01:46.790> cowl<00:01:47.770> fits<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:49.630> that's

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
rear removable lower cowl fits to that's

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.300 
rear removable lower cowl fits to that's
basically<00:01:50.930> what<00:01:51.080> they<00:01:51.200> look<00:01:51.380> like<00:01:51.409> off<00:01:51.799> the

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
basically what they look like off the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.620 
basically what they look like off the

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
bike we actually have a pair of them

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.749 
bike we actually have a pair of them
installed<00:01:53.990> on<00:01:54.170> this<00:01:54.340> blue<00:01:55.340> GTS<00:01:57.580> so<00:01:58.580> you'll

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
that bracket kind of sticking out that

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.450 
that bracket kind of sticking out that
bracket<00:02:02.390> kind<00:02:02.689> of<00:02:02.750> ties<00:02:02.960> back<00:02:03.320> in<00:02:03.590> that

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
bracket kind of ties back in that

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.670 
bracket kind of ties back in that
actually<00:02:04.759> comes<00:02:05.119> with<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.600> semi<00:02:06.320> detailed

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
actually comes with the semi detailed

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.139 
actually comes with the semi detailed
instructions<00:02:07.250> on<00:02:07.369> this<00:02:07.520> one<00:02:07.700> there's<00:02:07.909> a<00:02:07.970> bolt

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
instructions on this one there's a bolt

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.429 
instructions on this one there's a bolt
that<00:02:08.299> goes<00:02:08.330> through<00:02:08.720> that<00:02:08.750> kind<00:02:09.019> of<00:02:09.110> connects

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:09.439 
that goes through that kind of connects

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:10.989 
that goes through that kind of connects
the<00:02:09.590> bars<00:02:09.799> you<00:02:10.369> can<00:02:10.429> kind<00:02:10.639> of<00:02:10.669> see<00:02:10.849> they're

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:10.999 
the bars you can kind of see they're

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.989 
the bars you can kind of see they're
contoured<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:11.629> match<00:02:11.719> pretty<00:02:12.019> well<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:13.459> then

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:13.999 
contoured and match pretty well and then

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.090 
contoured and match pretty well and then
this<00:02:14.689> back<00:02:14.959> portion<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.650> guess

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
this back portion I guess

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.970 
this back portion I guess
where<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.370> kind<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:16.640> see<00:02:16.850> this<00:02:17.680> strap<00:02:18.680> back

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
where you kind of see this strap back

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.160 
where you kind of see this strap back
here<00:02:19.280> where<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.120> see<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.570> that<00:02:20.840> basically

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
here where you see that that basically

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.620 
here where you see that that basically
tucks<00:02:21.530> up<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.040> kind<00:02:22.310> of<00:02:22.370> shares<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.790> rear

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
tucks up and it kind of shares that rear

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.770 
tucks up and it kind of shares that rear
mounting<00:02:24.470> stud<00:02:24.830> that<00:02:25.280> basically<00:02:25.610> keeps<00:02:26.000> this

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
mounting stud that basically keeps this

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.620 
mounting stud that basically keeps this
lower<00:02:27.490> side<00:02:28.490> fairing<00:02:28.970> attached<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.510> the
