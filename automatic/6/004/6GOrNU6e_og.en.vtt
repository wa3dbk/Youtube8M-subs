well we want to take the technologies

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.090 
well we want to take the technologies
that<00:00:02.540> allow<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.600> computer<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.319> be<00:00:04.589> a<00:00:04.620> bit<00:00:05.069> more

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
that allow the computer to be a bit more

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.049 
that allow the computer to be a bit more
like<00:00:05.609> people<00:00:06.270> people<00:00:07.259> you<00:00:08.250> know<00:00:08.340> see<00:00:08.670> and

like people people you know see and

like people people you know see and
touch<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:10.670> hear<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.820> speak<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.809> in

touch and and hear and speak and and in
we've<00:00:13.889> really<00:00:14.130> only<00:00:14.160> done<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> very<00:00:15.299> little<00:00:16.250> job

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
we've really only done a very little job

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.890 
we've really only done a very little job
in<00:00:17.520> making<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:18.000> computer<00:00:18.480> deal<00:00:18.660> with<00:00:18.750> those

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
in making the computer deal with those

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.720 
in making the computer deal with those
and<00:00:19.140> usually<00:00:19.529> only<00:00:19.680> one<00:00:19.980> at<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.160> time<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.640> know

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
and usually only one at a time you know

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.090 
and usually only one at a time you know
we<00:00:20.850> might<00:00:21.060> add<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.300> handwriting<00:00:22.140> input<00:00:22.500> or<00:00:23.070> a

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
we might add a handwriting input or a

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.029 
we might add a handwriting input or a
speech<00:00:23.550> input<00:00:23.820> but<00:00:24.810> people<00:00:25.140> don't<00:00:25.350> use<00:00:25.800> those

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
speech input but people don't use those

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.240 
speech input but people don't use those
those<00:00:26.939> senses<00:00:27.750> only<00:00:28.050> one<00:00:28.230> at<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.439> time<00:00:28.650> that's

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250

for<00:00:57.600> people<00:00:57.960> from<00:00:58.079> one<00:00:58.320> building<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> next

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
for people from one building to the next

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.569 
for people from one building to the next
was<00:01:00.270> an<00:01:00.690> attempt<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> bring<00:01:01.440> together<00:01:01.620> 3d

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
was an attempt to bring together 3d

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.030 
was an attempt to bring together 3d

speech recognition and and image

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.179 
speech recognition and and image
processing<00:01:08.780> in<00:01:09.780> order<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.290> create<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.740> more

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
processing in order to create a more

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.640 
processing in order to create a more
natural<00:01:11.820> interaction<00:01:12.750> between<00:01:13.080> people<00:01:13.110> and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
natural interaction between people and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.289 
natural interaction between people and
the<00:01:13.770> computer<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.850> think<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.090> does<00:01:15.270> a

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the computer and I think it does a

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.270 
the computer and I think it does a
pretty<00:01:15.479> effective<00:01:15.689> job<00:01:16.380> at<00:01:16.680> showing<00:01:16.710> that

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
pretty effective job at showing that

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.550 
pretty effective job at showing that
we're<00:01:17.430> really<00:01:17.640> at<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.180> at<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.840> cusp<00:01:19.259> now

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
we're really at the at the cusp now

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.130 
we're really at the at the cusp now
being<00:01:20.040> able<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> computer<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
being able to have the computer have a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.760 
being able to have the computer have a
more<00:01:22.409> integrated<00:01:23.000> humanistic<00:01:24.770> relationship

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
more integrated humanistic relationship
