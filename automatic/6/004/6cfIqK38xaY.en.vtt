00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000

my<00:06:33.310> scares<00:06:33.610> weren't<00:06:33.880> in<00:06:33.969> the<00:06:34.090> goodie<00:06:34.270> bags<00:06:34.510> so

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
my scares weren't in the goodie bags so

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.510 
my scares weren't in the goodie bags so
I<00:06:35.110> think<00:06:35.349> all<00:06:35.590> the<00:06:35.680> reps<00:06:35.860> that<00:06:35.979> attended<00:06:36.430> that

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
I think all the reps that attended that

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.040 
I think all the reps that attended that
got<00:06:36.849> them<00:06:37.029> for<00:06:37.240> free<00:06:37.270> so<00:06:37.630> you'll<00:06:37.779> probably

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
got them for free so you'll probably

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.300 
got them for free so you'll probably
