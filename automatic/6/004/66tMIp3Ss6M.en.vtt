00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.300 
work great but you anywhere it's kind of
lighter<00:05:58.300> it<00:05:59.169> will<00:05:59.320> work<00:05:59.500> in<00:05:59.710> if<00:05:59.919> you<00:06:00.100> get<00:06:00.280> a

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
lighter it will work in if you get a

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.750 
lighter it will work in if you get a
kind<00:06:00.699> of<00:06:00.880> like<00:06:01.090> on<00:06:01.360> an<00:06:01.690> area<00:06:02.020> and<00:06:02.500> you<00:06:03.400> let<00:06:03.610> it

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
kind of like on an area and you let it

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.010 
kind of like on an area and you let it
and<00:06:04.449> you<00:06:04.540> kind<00:06:04.750> of<00:06:04.810> just<00:06:05.020> work<00:06:05.260> it<00:06:05.470> and<00:06:06.810> do<00:06:07.810> let

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
and you kind of just work it and do let

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.450 
and you kind of just work it and do let
it<00:06:08.139> dry<00:06:08.410> it<00:06:08.770> will<00:06:09.070> stay<00:06:09.720> it's<00:06:10.720> not<00:06:10.840> permanent

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
it dry it will stay it's not permanent

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.640 
it dry it will stay it's not permanent
the<00:06:12.460> acrylic<00:06:13.150> acts<00:06:13.360> is<00:06:13.630> sort<00:06:13.870> of<00:06:13.930> a<00:06:14.080> resist<00:06:14.500> so

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
the acrylic acts is sort of a resist so

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.550 
the acrylic acts is sort of a resist so
you<00:06:14.740> can<00:06:14.889> always<00:06:15.100> wipe<00:06:15.250> it<00:06:15.460> off<00:06:15.610> with<00:06:16.560> some

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
you can always wipe it off with some

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.110 
you can always wipe it off with some
water<00:06:17.830> but<00:06:18.430> it<00:06:18.639> will<00:06:18.820> stay<00:06:19.180> and<00:06:19.449> will<00:06:19.660> dry<00:06:20.020> so

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
water but it will stay and will dry so

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:28.320 
water but it will stay and will dry so
that's<00:06:22.120> pretty<00:06:23.080> awesome<00:06:26.639> so<00:06:27.639> I'm<00:06:28.090> just

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
that's pretty awesome so I'm just

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.510 
that's pretty awesome so I'm just
noodling<00:06:28.690> around<00:06:28.889> i'm<00:06:29.889> going<00:06:30.070> to<00:06:30.160> try<00:06:30.370> a

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
noodling around i'm going to try a

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.450 
noodling around i'm going to try a
distress<00:06:31.210> marker<00:06:32.610> these<00:06:33.610> are<00:06:33.880> quite<00:06:34.810> a<00:06:34.870> bit

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
distress marker these are quite a bit

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:44.159 
distress marker these are quite a bit
denser<00:06:36.460> in<00:06:36.610> terms<00:06:36.880> of<00:06:37.090> ink<00:06:37.570> flow<00:06:40.169> but<00:06:41.340> just<00:06:43.169> you

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.169 
denser in terms of ink flow but just you

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:46.650 
denser in terms of ink flow but just you
know<00:06:44.289> when<00:06:44.440> these<00:06:44.590> start<00:06:44.889> going<00:06:45.220> over<00:06:45.660> this

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
know when these start going over this

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.420 
know when these start going over this
area<00:06:46.990> it's<00:06:47.349> just<00:06:49.289> I've<00:06:50.289> never<00:06:50.710> I've<00:06:51.400> never

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
area it's just I've never I've never

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.940 
area it's just I've never I've never
been<00:06:51.849> able<00:06:52.289> to<00:06:53.289> do<00:06:53.410> something<00:06:53.680> like<00:06:53.889> that

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:53.950 
been able to do something like that

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.890 
been able to do something like that
where<00:06:54.400> you<00:06:54.520> can<00:06:54.639> just<00:06:54.789> draw<00:06:55.060> a<00:06:55.120> marker<00:06:55.599> over

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
where you can just draw a marker over

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.650 
where you can just draw a marker over
acrylic<00:06:56.380> and<00:06:56.620> it's<00:06:57.460> a<00:06:57.550> water-based<00:06:58.030> marker<00:06:58.510> I

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:58.660 
acrylic and it's a water-based marker I

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.100 
acrylic and it's a water-based marker I
mean<00:06:58.810> it's<00:06:58.960> not<00:06:59.940> it's<00:07:00.940> not<00:07:01.090> an<00:07:01.270> alcohol-based

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
mean it's not it's not an alcohol-based

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.100 
mean it's not it's not an alcohol-based
or<00:07:02.770> a<00:07:03.729> paint<00:07:04.450> base<00:07:04.690> marker<00:07:05.200> it's<00:07:05.380> just<00:07:05.770> a

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
or a paint base marker it's just a

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.690 
or a paint base marker it's just a
straight-up<00:07:08.110> water-based<00:07:09.039> marker<00:07:09.550> and<00:07:09.639> it

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:09.700 
straight-up water-based marker and it

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:14.219 
straight-up water-based marker and it
just<00:07:09.940> goes<00:07:10.270> right<00:07:11.020> over<00:07:11.080> all<00:07:11.560> of<00:07:11.740> it<00:07:12.990> it's<00:07:13.990> so

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:14.229 
just goes right over all of it it's so

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:23.469 
just goes right over all of it it's so
crazy

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:23.479 

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:27.790 

so<00:07:24.479> that's<00:07:24.660> distress<00:07:25.410> paint<00:07:25.680> and<00:07:26.030> distressing

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 
so that's distress paint and distressing

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.160 
so that's distress paint and distressing
catch<00:07:28.800> you<00:07:28.889> next<00:07:28.919> time
