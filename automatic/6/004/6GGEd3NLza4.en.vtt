right cut slowly making sure that all
the<00:05:22.070> points<00:05:22.400> of<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.580> saw<00:05:22.849> teeth<00:05:23.150> line<00:05:23.510> up

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
the points of the saw teeth line up

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:32.320 
the points of the saw teeth line up
evenly

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.180 

the<00:05:33.330> last<00:05:33.540> sawtooth<00:05:34.110> should<00:05:34.560> be<00:05:34.650> even<00:05:35.040> with

the last sawtooth should be even with
edge

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:46.269 

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:48.939 

you<00:05:47.269> can<00:05:47.449> also<00:05:47.629> cut<00:05:47.989> the<00:05:48.139> pattern<00:05:48.499> without

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
you can also cut the pattern without

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.879 
you can also cut the pattern without
