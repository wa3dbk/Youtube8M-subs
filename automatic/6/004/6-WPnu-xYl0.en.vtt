00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
so for me it's a interesting mix of

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.640 
so for me it's a interesting mix of
abstraction<00:01:24.440> narrative<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.409> whole

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
abstraction narrative and the whole

abstraction narrative and the whole
evening<00:01:28.040> i<00:01:28.700> think<00:01:29.030> is<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.510> meditation<00:01:30.380> of<00:01:31.010> sorts

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
evening i think is a meditation of sorts

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.020 
evening i think is a meditation of sorts
of<00:01:32.170> balancing<00:01:33.170> abstract<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:34.280> narrative<00:01:34.700> in

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
of balancing abstract and narrative in

of balancing abstract and narrative in
ballet<00:01:35.780> we<00:01:36.409> don't<00:01:36.560> have<00:01:36.770> big<00:01:37.310> sets<00:01:37.700> or<00:01:38.030> roll<00:01:38.690> up

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
grounded when they feel the floor and

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.660 
grounded when they feel the floor and
they<00:06:15.880> can<00:06:16.060> move<00:06:16.300> and<00:06:16.690> change<00:06:16.720> the<00:06:17.670> the

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
very important also imagination I want

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.120 
very important also imagination I want
to<00:06:26.800> leave<00:06:27.010> it<00:06:27.160> open<00:06:27.700> for<00:06:27.730> interpretations

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130

because<00:06:30.130> sometimes<00:06:31.030> you<00:06:31.390> can't<00:06:31.810> really

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
because sometimes you can't really

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.530 
because sometimes you can't really
translate<00:06:32.650> the<00:06:33.250> dance<00:06:33.550> into<00:06:33.940> words<00:06:34.150> sometimes
