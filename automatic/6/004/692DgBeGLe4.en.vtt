this is a multi rotor RC helicopter
mine<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.490> an<00:00:20.609> octocopter<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.960> has<00:00:22.529> eight

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
mine is an octocopter so it has eight

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.509 
mine is an octocopter so it has eight

lipo<00:00:30.810> batteries<00:00:31.520> I've<00:00:32.520> got<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> gimbal<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
lipo batteries I've got a gimbal on the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.479 
lipo batteries I've got a gimbal on the
bottom<00:00:34.590> made<00:00:35.130> by<00:00:35.340> photo<00:00:35.700> shipped<00:00:36.120> one<00:00:37.250> with<00:00:38.250> my

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
bottom made by photo shipped one with my

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.330 
bottom made by photo shipped one with my
Panasonic<00:00:39.329> gh4<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:40.140> there<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:40.950> 4k

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
Panasonic gh4 on there so it's 4k

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.709 
Panasonic gh4 on there so it's 4k
capable<00:00:42.590> meaning<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.739> record<00:00:44.190> 4k

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
capable meaning I can record 4k

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.810 
capable meaning I can record 4k
resolution<00:00:45.719> video<00:00:46.230> which<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.280> cinematic

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
resolution video which is cinematic

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.670 
resolution video which is cinematic
quality<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.899> also<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> gh4<00:00:50.100> because<00:00:50.789> it

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
quality I also like the gh4 because it

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.250 
quality I also like the gh4 because it
shoots<00:00:52.680> 96<00:00:53.489> frames<00:00:53.789> per<00:00:54.030> second<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
shoots 96 frames per second in the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.229 
shoots 96 frames per second in the
variable<00:00:55.860> frame<00:00:56.219> rate<00:00:56.489> setting<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:57.030> there

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
variable frame rate setting on there

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.090 
variable frame rate setting on there
which<00:00:57.660> looks<00:00:57.960> really<00:00:58.350> great<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.770> aerial

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
which looks really great for aerial

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.380 
which looks really great for aerial
shots<00:00:59.370> as<00:00:59.550> well<00:01:01.160> so<00:01:02.160> basically<00:01:02.730> here<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> was

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
shots as well so basically here I was

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.050 
shots as well so basically here I was
just<00:01:03.600> testing<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.199> out<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:05.400> put<00:01:05.760> some<00:01:05.790> new

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
just testing it out I just put some new

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.820 
just testing it out I just put some new
propellers<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.750> there<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.170> was<00:01:07.260> making<00:01:07.619> sure

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
propellers on there so I was making sure

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.000 
propellers on there so I was making sure
everything<00:01:08.340> was<00:01:08.490> running<00:01:08.670> smoothly<00:01:10.010> flying

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
everything was running smoothly flying

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.420 
everything was running smoothly flying
it<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.580> attitude<00:01:12.540> mode<00:01:12.780> first<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:13.799> GPS

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
it in attitude mode first and then GPS

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.700 
it in attitude mode first and then GPS
mode<00:01:15.500> after<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.159> test<00:01:17.430> out<00:01:17.640> both

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
mode after that just to test out both

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.100 
mode after that just to test out both
different<00:01:19.710> modes<00:01:20.100> there<00:01:20.430> GPS<00:01:21.299> mode<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.840> more

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
different modes there GPS mode is more

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.270 
different modes there GPS mode is more
stable<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.979> kind<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.780> hovers<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> same<00:01:25.470> GPS

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
stable it kind of hovers in the same GPS

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.749 
stable it kind of hovers in the same GPS
location<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:27.390> if<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.610> mess<00:01:29.610> around

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
location and then if you mess around

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.249 
location and then if you mess around
with<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.030> joysticks<00:01:30.509> it'll<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> little

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
with the joysticks it'll be a little

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.859 
with the joysticks it'll be a little
slower<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.799> react<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.670> then<00:01:33.119> attitude<00:01:33.630> mode

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
slower to react and then attitude mode

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.390 
slower to react and then attitude mode
is<00:01:34.460> still<00:01:35.460> very<00:01:35.700> stable<00:01:36.000> but<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.720> has<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> little

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
is still very stable but it has a little

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.580 
is still very stable but it has a little
more<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.210> free<00:01:39.570> movement<00:01:39.900> when<00:01:40.409> you're

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
more of a free movement when you're

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.200 
more of a free movement when you're
turning<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> joysticks<00:01:42.020> so<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.079> was<00:01:43.439> basically

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
turning the joysticks so I was basically

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.330 
turning the joysticks so I was basically
just<00:01:45.210> doing<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.540> really<00:01:45.780> short<00:01:46.200> quick<00:01:47.070> little

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
just doing a really short quick little

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.690 
just doing a really short quick little
test<00:01:47.579> flight<00:01:47.850> here<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:49.200> big<00:01:49.380> open<00:01:49.860> parking

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
test flight here in the big open parking

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.399 
test flight here in the big open parking
lot<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.540> didn't<00:01:51.899> have<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.140> worry<00:01:52.350> about

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
lot so I didn't have to worry about

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.969 
lot so I didn't have to worry about
hidden<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.100> cactuses<00:01:53.759> or<00:01:54.590> bushes<00:01:55.590> or

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
hidden and cactuses or bushes or

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:56.540 
hidden and cactuses or bushes or
anything

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
anything

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.460 
anything
I<00:01:56.640> would<00:01:57.210> hate<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.780> go<00:01:57.930> running<00:01:58.350> after

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
I would hate to have to go running after

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.820 
I would hate to have to go running after
this<00:01:58.770> thing<00:01:59.150> if<00:02:00.150> anything<00:02:00.570> wasn't<00:02:00.930> working

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
this thing if anything wasn't working

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.550 
this thing if anything wasn't working
right<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.640> desert<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.300> get<00:02:03.750> my<00:02:04.290> just

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
right in the desert and get my just

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.580 
right in the desert and get my just
stickers<00:02:05.040> with<00:02:05.340> me<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:05.990> did<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> first<00:02:07.350> test

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
stickers with me so did a first test

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.040 
stickers with me so did a first test
flight<00:02:07.800> there<00:02:08.040> and<00:02:08.280> then<00:02:09.240> what<00:02:09.930> I'm<00:02:10.020> doing

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
flight there and then what I'm doing

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.210 
flight there and then what I'm doing
here<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.590> I'm<00:02:10.800> turning<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.310> my<00:02:11.640> Panasonic<00:02:12.450> gh4

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
here is I'm turning on my Panasonic gh4

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.170 
here is I'm turning on my Panasonic gh4
I<00:02:14.220> then<00:02:14.940> plug<00:02:15.390> in<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:16.050> gimbal<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.880> there's<00:02:18.120> a

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
I then plug in the gimbal and there's a

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.740 
I then plug in the gimbal and there's a
switch<00:02:18.660> on<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.050> gimbal<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:19.970> my<00:02:20.970> photo<00:02:21.450> ship

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
switch on the gimbal so my photo ship

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.650 
switch on the gimbal so my photo ship

full<00:02:55.200> roll<00:02:56.270> 180<00:02:57.270> roll<00:02:57.630> so<00:02:57.960> you<00:02:57.990> can<00:02:58.260> go<00:02:58.410> 90<00:02:58.920> to

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
full roll 180 roll so you can go 90 to

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.199 
full roll 180 roll so you can go 90 to
the<00:02:59.700> left<00:03:00.080> 90<00:03:01.080> degrees<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.800> right<00:03:02.209> we

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
the left 90 degrees to the right we

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.840 
the left 90 degrees to the right we
usually<00:03:03.510> just<00:03:03.540> leave<00:03:03.989> that<00:03:04.170> right<00:03:04.230> on<00:03:04.850> right

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
usually just leave that right on right

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.190 
usually just leave that right on right
in<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.030> middle<00:03:06.239> there<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.660> then<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:06.989> has<00:03:07.370> a

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
in the middle there and then it has a

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.020 
in the middle there and then it has a
tilt<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.530> goes<00:03:10.770> all<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.070> way<00:03:11.220> down<00:03:11.550> so<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:11.850> can

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
tilt that goes all the way down so I can

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.470 
tilt that goes all the way down so I can
face<00:03:12.270> my<00:03:12.480> camera<00:03:12.870> down<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:14.250> as<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:15.300> can<00:03:15.420> see

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
face my camera down so as you can see

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.930 
face my camera down so as you can see
here<00:03:15.900> I'm<00:03:16.020> just<00:03:16.050> testing<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.830> out<00:03:17.010> while<00:03:17.910> it's

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
here I'm just testing it out while it's

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.540 
here I'm just testing it out while it's

the gh4 is it's a little bit smaller
than<00:04:43.040> the<00:04:43.310> Canon<00:04:43.700> DSLR<00:04:44.180> cameras<00:04:44.570> but<00:04:44.840> you<00:04:45.440> can

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
than the Canon DSLR cameras but you can

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.580 
than the Canon DSLR cameras but you can
still<00:04:45.890> see<00:04:46.310> that<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:47.780> multi-rotor

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
still see that the the multi-rotor

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.980 
still see that the the multi-rotor
Dwarfs<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.760> camera<00:04:50.180> eye<00:04:50.210> just<00:04:50.480> makes<00:04:50.690> it<00:04:50.810> look

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
Dwarfs the camera eye just makes it look

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.720 
Dwarfs the camera eye just makes it look
so<00:04:51.020> small<00:04:51.560> when<00:04:52.040> it's<00:04:52.160> actually<00:04:52.460> a<00:04:52.520> pretty

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
so small when it's actually a pretty

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.680 
so small when it's actually a pretty
decent<00:04:52.910> sized<00:04:53.330> camera<00:04:53.750> on<00:04:53.810> there<00:04:55.120> so<00:04:56.120> I<00:04:56.480> was

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
decent sized camera on there so I was

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.140 
decent sized camera on there so I was
just<00:04:56.900> getting<00:04:57.140> a<00:04:57.200> feel<00:04:57.410> of<00:04:57.470> it<00:04:57.710> today<00:04:58.120> with<00:04:59.120> the

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
just getting a feel of it today with the

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.530 
just getting a feel of it today with the
new<00:04:59.330> propellers<00:04:59.840> on<00:05:00.080> they're<00:05:01.150> not<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.330> best

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
new propellers on they're not the best

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.040 
new propellers on they're not the best
conditions<00:05:03.200> out<00:05:03.440> is<00:05:03.620> a<00:05:03.650> little<00:05:03.980> cloudy<00:05:05.050> the

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
conditions out is a little cloudy the

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.810 
conditions out is a little cloudy the
lighting<00:05:06.410> wasn't<00:05:06.590> that<00:05:06.860> great<00:05:07.220> there's<00:05:07.730> a

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
lighting wasn't that great there's a

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.570 
lighting wasn't that great there's a
tiny<00:05:08.180> bit<00:05:08.360> of<00:05:08.510> drizzle<00:05:09.220> earlier<00:05:10.220> but<00:05:10.490> we

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
tiny bit of drizzle earlier but we

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.450 
tiny bit of drizzle earlier but we
waited<00:05:10.760> for<00:05:10.940> that<00:05:11.210> rain<00:05:11.450> to<00:05:11.660> stop<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.460> managed

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
waited for that rain to stop and managed

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.270 
waited for that rain to stop and managed
to<00:05:13.520> get<00:05:13.700> a<00:05:13.760> nice<00:05:14.030> little<00:05:14.300> 8<00:05:15.260> to<00:05:15.500> 10<00:05:15.710> minute<00:05:16.010> test

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
to get a nice little 8 to 10 minute test

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.710 
to get a nice little 8 to 10 minute test
flight<00:05:16.600> so<00:05:18.970> basically<00:05:19.970> I<00:05:20.090> was<00:05:20.240> just<00:05:20.300> doing

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
flight so basically I was just doing

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.409 
flight so basically I was just doing
some<00:05:20.960> straight<00:05:21.350> runs<00:05:21.880> on<00:05:22.880> a<00:05:23.320> nice<00:05:24.320> horizontal

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
some straight runs on a nice horizontal

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:31.390 
some straight runs on a nice horizontal
access<00:05:28.300> panning<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:29.330> camera<00:05:29.450> down<00:05:30.400> doing

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
access panning the camera down doing

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.659 
access panning the camera down doing
rotations<00:05:32.650> going<00:05:33.650> up<00:05:33.770> in<00:05:33.950> the<00:05:34.040> air<00:05:34.160> stuff<00:05:34.490> like

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
rotations going up in the air stuff like

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.880 
rotations going up in the air stuff like
that<00:05:34.880> so<00:05:35.870> you<00:05:35.960> can<00:05:36.080> see<00:05:36.260> here's<00:05:36.500> the<00:05:36.560> test

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
that so you can see here's the test

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.330 
that so you can see here's the test
footage<00:05:37.100> coming<00:05:37.490> straight<00:05:37.820> from<00:05:38.030> the<00:05:38.240> gh4<00:05:38.630> I

actually<00:05:43.730> I've<00:05:44.120> been<00:05:44.180> using<00:05:44.510> the<00:05:44.780> Newman<00:05:45.169> film

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
actually I've been using the Newman film

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.120 
actually I've been using the Newman film
presets<00:05:47.270> for<00:05:47.570> Adobe<00:05:48.080> Premiere<00:05:48.530> and<00:05:48.560> Adobe

After Effects a lot lately for color

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.500 
After Effects a lot lately for color
correcting<00:05:51.320> they<00:05:52.280> just<00:05:52.580> save<00:05:52.760> a<00:05:52.790> lot<00:05:53.150> of<00:05:53.180> time

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
correcting they just save a lot of time

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.830 
correcting they just save a lot of time
I<00:05:53.840> hate<00:05:54.320> doing<00:05:54.560> a<00:05:55.520> lot<00:05:56.000> of<00:05:56.030> color<00:05:56.300> correcting

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
I hate doing a lot of color correcting

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.990 
I hate doing a lot of color correcting
and<00:05:56.990> After<00:05:57.380> Effects<00:05:57.740> just<00:05:58.070> manually<00:05:58.520> it<00:05:58.760> takes

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
and After Effects just manually it takes

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.990 
and After Effects just manually it takes

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
forever so you can just drop on the

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.870 
forever so you can just drop on the

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
word Center position and then that cuts

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.950 
word Center position and then that cuts
all<00:06:24.410> the<00:06:24.650> propellers<00:06:25.220> and<00:06:25.490> I<00:06:26.450> just<00:06:26.630> make<00:06:26.810> sure
