00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.609
 course and burgundy will talk a lot throughout this day is this 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.120
 that he was richard of resentment as difficult as grueling as this 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.309
 we feared when we saw him in training 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.089
 yes it was a difficult course but for that reason it would have delayed 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:18.189
 resulting 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.570
 in the heart of the subject that is to say late afternoon 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.619
 rahan your life is good 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.140
 the two escaped house behind it was gone it's not really the 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.599
 fight with the fight started and jacky durand who are looking who to 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.550
 listening 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.589
 I was there 

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:33.770
 on his side m 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.379
 however the final I was more the sea and world 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.319
 I had to be there half of the Montérégie race was present 

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:42.780
 exactly as we were told yesterday at your job is that it 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.110
 jacky to be at the start the good shots starting 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.820
 so then we noticed one thing is well who took power 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.690
 those who really 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.430
 of dynamite show he wanted to win this world championship these 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.710
 Italian 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.370
 q that you have noticed that the Italians you want in any case 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.960
 show as the strongest they unlocked the race it must be the 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.930
 recognize evening 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.260
 we sacrifice the runners for them to evoke the race that's what happened 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.520
 past there was the selection 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.440
 we are immediately 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.100
 I thought to find forty or so curves in f1 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.270
 selection was done 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.720
 more and more hard from behind and end up on Thursday with tens of 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.610
 runners at 2km not two laps from the finish here are the Italians 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.090
 who make work we will see in a few moments that the French the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.350
 fossil very well 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.530
 since a few 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.680
 km the arrival we will find three French on the line 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.580
 let's talk a bit about the atmosphere of this championship he had so much of 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.870
 heat that the audience really could not mass themselves at the edge of the road 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.870
 I am still you felt while the aja who did his job 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.870
 when you come back he goes back to the booth how formula 1 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.260
 can we say that yes and still a beautiful atmosphere in this 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.120
 championship 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.190
 I like too the auteuil atmosphere trait I believe that in a lot of time 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.680
 forza italia today 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.860
 all the more so since we did not have to go too close to the means because we 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.300
 was getting our glasses on two caps and that's what 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.690
 did not go bad during the whole race but it's true that good with that 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.060
 the italian tifosi were really at that then the hat trick 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.870
 to stéphane lo bravo these women a little word for you has been to 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.540
 outposts very very very long 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.440
 let's say I try to get the Italians to work as much as possible 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.939
 Toothbrush too appointed leader of the team 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.420
 seven consecutives consecutives and the maximum and I think france has managed the 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.049
 only breakage 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.619
 you are a small piece of this medal 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:16.249
 and then we'll see the French who went on the attack after the 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:18.439
 French are good 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.059
 you impose yourself this time he decided to start doubting 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:24.209
 because they see you very comfortable and we know that there are still three cards 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.370
 mistress to play yet its place that thanks 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.510
 we think to change in confidence with the plan 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.509
 and there is some mattress what will show 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:31.839
 and which is cold in the 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:35.109
 the great great wretch of history 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.179
 revelation of this world championship is there 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:38.169
 he proved that he had 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:40.909
 and win her selection and on top of that he did an amazing job 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.669
 for the team as well 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:44.089
 and management 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:47.089
 controversial Parisian initiated broke 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.689
 variegated a dog type being the biggest risk to take 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.269
 so here we will see this image in a few moments the reference stir the 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.189
 knife in the wound 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.889
 because at that moment there you were still counted and pauline 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.429
 lefèvre his passion 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:03.129
 we were three escaped and then for me j 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.939
 I did not want to look at the forces for all the final was good 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.369
 I thought that 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:09.999
 it's going to the end but it's enough 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:12.539
 if it's not so bad 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:16.899
 alain juppé gradually discovering that it is necessary to bring in 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:18.599
 France both in the sense of Islam 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.599
 with 8% of drivers in the final between richard there 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.809
 I think we had to put a blow for proof behind scrum 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:28.609
 the Italian runner 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.800
 the road to enter as i was with the eu in front of the wto 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.289
 we were in a good position before the final jump in hand 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:35.809
 we played face 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:39.079
 you played his convenience the hood because we can say 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.529
 gold while there is where we will see his little mechanical glitch I 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:43.109
 think 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.589
 obama must 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:48.809
 last month time it was the case at home in the car the time that I 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:49.539
 am there no 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:52.449
 and not as years when we missed, we were both with the 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.269
 tanks and there is 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.319
 until my sweet that told me yesterday by changing the agenda 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.909
 it overflows with richardson to actually look at banks it's this 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:01.809
 what remains to be done 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:04.819
 exactly at that moment does it come back with you? 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.690
 concentration since we will find in the final it was with Toulon 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.460
 yes he was already walking very very well so I was going through that I 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.959
 am there easy 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.279
 to keep up the forces for the future 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:16.900
 but hey the click to simard at least right now that he who has passed 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.479
 directly from the shipper and shout at them that because he had 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.039
 not visited hide cars 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.229
 for charitable projects and champions 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.169
 no chance 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.879
 photo especially that the troubleshooting was very long we offered a bike 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:30.830
 then the 7s rear wheel was complicated simply they wanted 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.330
 give me a bike with them as soon as we see that it does not stick 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.919
 at all 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.279
 as a free electron so only I lost at least a minute 

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:41.119
 we stayed around his five in front and then we see that the team 

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:42.830
 with daring that society 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.580
 Labor Day to drive on this group because it did not take them 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.409
 leave alone every two years 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:50.800
 yes that's the revolt 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.509
 at 14 hours 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.569
 but it is true that at the level of the defenders of the tmt regale with the 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:58.529
 customer-states worked very well with cats 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:00.249
 and so that years 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:03.909
 before we had confidence in the euro and we knew that the Italian women 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:05.069
 the time let go like that 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.439
 what are the recipes so we speak with the Italians have according to this 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:09.940
 challenge how is it going 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.890
 man for my part my last ride I was a little on a chair 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.279
 since the vehicles were returned 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:19.770
 the 125 but me my wedding I will not rolled 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.460
 so I said to myself in the last round percent and the flora that I attack 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.880
 but for before attacking the fact that the attacked good 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:29.849
 it's giving way to the new system 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.879
 French is everywhere in this sense of this attack 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:35.080
 to follow in the last round 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.150
 after the previous as the breakaway with rest on a stage that he 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.590
 had agreed we are both I want to clarify anyway 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.270
 while I was forced to fetch there and the other to 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.949
 every time 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:44.889
 element 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.050
 that makes it to mans it did not result percent and I was waiting for the band 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.319
 the most popular richardson chapel maker in the world to deal with this 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:52.050
 type well 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.039
 it returns 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.889
 from the benefit of factors 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.779
 so that's only five so if he's coming back on us so 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:00.739
 and which therefore causes the grouping we end up with a very 

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:04.609
 nice since the ex-chemistry husband french guys there are two italians 

00:06:04.609 --> 00:06:07.669
 kyoto that will end I admit we were afraid a comment we have a little 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.239
 near clear saying careful we must not let him go we felt he 

00:06:10.239 --> 00:06:13.629
 was not very strong but one wonders if poker shot had not and 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:15.949
 I'm not going to have anything you're sure you look 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:17.270
 it was important 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.569
 if you want I had already let go we will not know so reindeer 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:21.860
 at the time I had joined on the returns series and the lover the 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.050
 collective to the attacked in the second as for him commented that the abbot louis 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.669
 dagenais better to ski 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.259
 but I put the maximum of 20 years that is at stake 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:32.779
 I had sixteen foot and I put a genie 14 recently I went out 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:33.969
 I have the rhythm 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:38.059
 with 42 14 in the most difficult part of this bump it's beautiful but 

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:40.849
 I knew that was where I had to play my card I can say rate was 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:43.849
 faster than me in the sprint and then there I turned more 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.250
 lavender 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.999
 for me it was fantastic because 

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:50.349
 already in the turn 300 to 400 meters before the line I saw that I had 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:51.819
 won 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:55.069
 it's a fabulous moment for a runner to be able to decide alone in his 

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:58.009
 room it is asked to be able to remove my like that I already knew 

00:06:58.009 --> 00:06:59.520
 before the crisis 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.690
 this favors the images happens pretty 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.349
 it's extraordinary 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:07.209
 I hope my friends% and friends will be there in addition saved for 

00:07:07.209 --> 00:07:09.889
 time but we will send you all the cassettes concerned 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:11.599
 at this stage the beaujoire 

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:14.809
 hood is still there but you hang on the third yes because I 

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:16.149
 think that 

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:19.209
 it was necessary to put these few hunts the commodity of Le Mans for me it was necessary 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:22.759
 had to do the podium at the pot to conclude all this is paid 

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:26.110
 it was still good 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.819
 she fully acknowledged that are given up in full
