Kinect list version now before we get
too<00:00:47.460> into<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.789> let<00:00:47.969> me<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.059> say<00:00:48.329> I

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.569 
too into this let me just say I
understand<00:00:49.110> why<00:00:49.230> Microsoft<00:00:49.620> included<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
understand why Microsoft included it the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.639 
understand why Microsoft included it the
Xbox<00:00:50.879> 360s<00:00:51.449> version<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.899> Kinect<00:00:52.050> while<00:00:52.500> it

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
Xbox 360s version of Kinect while it

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.590 
Xbox 360s version of Kinect while it
sold<00:00:52.920> well<00:00:53.010> did<00:00:53.520> not<00:00:53.550> sell<00:00:53.940> well<00:00:54.149> enough<00:00:54.420> to

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
sold well did not sell well enough to

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.479 
sold well did not sell well enough to
warrant<00:00:54.840> developers<00:00:55.530> at<00:00:55.800> least<00:00:55.980> third-party

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
warrant developers at least third-party

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.250 
warrant developers at least third-party
developers<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.180> make<00:00:57.300> games<00:00:57.570> specifically

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
developers to make games specifically

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.689 
developers to make games specifically
for<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.770> Kinect<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.340> know<00:00:59.399> that's<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
for the Kinect you know that's the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.740 
for the Kinect you know that's the
reason<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.000> Kinect<00:01:00.239> didn't<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> ton<00:01:00.719> of

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
reason the Kinect didn't get a ton of

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.270 
reason the Kinect didn't get a ton of
support<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.770> didn't<00:01:02.010> have<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
support is because it didn't have the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.280 
support is because it didn't have the
install<00:01:02.670> base<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.210> really<00:01:03.329> sell<00:01:03.690> games<00:01:03.989> that

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
install base to really sell games that

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.320 
install base to really sell games that
were<00:01:04.379> specifically<00:01:04.979> tailored<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.820> and

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
were specifically tailored to it and and

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.609 
were specifically tailored to it and and
still<00:01:06.570> make<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> profit<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.320> lot<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.500> people

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
still make a profit so a lot of people

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.080 
still make a profit so a lot of people
said<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.159> know<00:01:08.250> include<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.760> Kinect

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
said this you know include the Kinect

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.940 
said this you know include the Kinect
with<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> Xbox<00:01:09.810> one<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.049> every<00:01:10.560> person<00:01:10.770> that

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
with the Xbox one and every person that

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.570 
with the Xbox one and every person that
has<00:01:11.189> an<00:01:11.520> Xbox<00:01:11.909> one<00:01:12.000> will<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:13.159> Kinect<00:01:14.159> so

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
has an Xbox one will have a Kinect so

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.010 
has an Xbox one will have a Kinect so
there<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.850> go<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.270> your<00:01:15.330> install<00:01:15.810> base

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
there you go you have your install base

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.120 
there you go you have your install base
now<00:01:16.200> people<00:01:16.500> can<00:01:16.650> develop<00:01:16.799> games

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
now people can develop games

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.770 
now people can develop games
specifically<00:01:17.759> for<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.330> Kinect

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
specifically for the Kinect

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.539 
specifically for the Kinect
now<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.200> that's<00:01:19.350> why<00:01:19.470> they<00:01:19.740> included<00:01:20.430> it

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
now so that's why they included it

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.920 
now so that's why they included it
that's<00:01:20.880> why<00:01:21.030> they<00:01:21.150> kept<00:01:21.330> put<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> box

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
that's why they kept put it in the box

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.510 
that's why they kept put it in the box
now<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.200> understand<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.340> putting

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
now I understand that but just putting

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.130 
now I understand that but just putting
it<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> box<00:01:23.939> was<00:01:24.210> clearly<00:01:24.659> not<00:01:24.780> enough

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
it in the box was clearly not enough

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.380 
it in the box was clearly not enough
because<00:01:25.740> now<00:01:26.189> they<00:01:26.610> are<00:01:26.640> getting<00:01:26.939> rid<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.180> it

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
because now they are getting rid of it

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.210 
because now they are getting rid of it
from<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> box<00:01:27.810> what<00:01:28.259> Microsoft<00:01:28.920> really

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
from the box what Microsoft really

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.580 
from the box what Microsoft really
needed<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.549> do<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.270> Kinect<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.869> show<00:01:31.200> why

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
needed to do with the Kinect is show why

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.859 
needed to do with the Kinect is show why
it's<00:01:31.829> important<00:01:32.400> why<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.729> good<00:01:33.060> for<00:01:33.299> games<00:01:33.479> you

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
it's important why is good for games you

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.330 
it's important why is good for games you
know<00:01:33.960> what<00:01:34.200> they<00:01:34.350> needed<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.710> show<00:01:34.740> why<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.130> was

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
know what they needed to show why it was

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.069 
know what they needed to show why it was
good<00:01:35.520> for<00:01:35.700> gamers<00:01:35.970> which<00:01:36.360> they<00:01:36.570> completely

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
good for gamers which they completely

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.899 
good for gamers which they completely
failed<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.619> do<00:01:37.799> all<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.250> games<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.520> came<00:01:38.729> out

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
failed to do all the games that came out

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.819 
failed to do all the games that came out
that<00:01:39.090> were<00:01:39.210> Kinect<00:01:39.600> oriented<00:01:40.200> or<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.590> same

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
that were Kinect oriented or the same

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
because they look the same but

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.270 
because they look the same but
unfortunately<00:04:01.590> for<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.769> hardcore<00:04:02.010> gaming

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280

actual technology behind the box you

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.370 
actual technology behind the box you
know<00:04:05.850> price<00:04:06.090> doesn't<00:04:06.420> matter<00:04:06.450> as<00:04:06.780> much<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:07.140> the

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
know price doesn't matter as much to the

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.080 
know price doesn't matter as much to the
hardcore<00:04:07.590> sure<00:04:07.920> it's<00:04:08.070> a<00:04:08.160> factor<00:04:08.550> but<00:04:08.970> then

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
hardcore sure it's a factor but then

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.270 
hardcore sure it's a factor but then
they<00:04:09.209> look<00:04:09.360> okay<00:04:09.810> well<00:04:10.040> multi-platform<00:04:11.040> games

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
they look okay well multi-platform games

the background may help the Xbox one get
a<00:04:33.630> little<00:04:33.900> bit<00:04:34.020> of<00:04:34.110> power<00:04:34.320> that<00:04:34.740> it<00:04:34.860> didn't

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
a little bit of power that it didn't

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.710 
a little bit of power that it didn't
have<00:04:35.190> before<00:04:35.220> but<00:04:35.729> honestly<00:04:36.030> I<00:04:36.090> don't<00:04:36.449> know<00:04:36.570> if

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
have before but honestly I don't know if

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.180 
have before but honestly I don't know if
it'll<00:04:36.840> be<00:04:36.960> enough<00:04:37.199> to<00:04:37.410> catch<00:04:37.560> up<00:04:37.770> to<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:37.949> ps4

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
it'll be enough to catch up to the ps4

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.610 
it'll be enough to catch up to the ps4
there<00:04:38.580> is<00:04:38.699> a<00:04:38.729> pretty<00:04:39.090> big<00:04:39.360> hardware<00:04:40.139> gap<00:04:40.320> there

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
there is a pretty big hardware gap there

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.320 
there is a pretty big hardware gap there
and<00:04:40.800> unfortunately<00:04:41.250> Xbox<00:04:41.639> can't<00:04:41.940> do<00:04:42.150> anything

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
and unfortunately Xbox can't do anything

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.850

they<00:04:45.720> have<00:04:45.900> to<00:04:46.110> keep<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.650> console<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:47.340> same

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.390 
power they can't change that anymore
I<00:04:49.199> think<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.560> hard<00:04:49.740> core<00:04:49.919> will<00:04:50.070> still<00:04:50.280> pick

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
I think the hard core will still pick

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.670 
I think the hard core will still pick
the<00:04:50.580> ps4<00:04:50.850> and<00:04:51.330> then<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.870> casual<00:04:52.260> market<00:04:52.560> will

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
the ps4 and then the casual market will

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.560 
the ps4 and then the casual market will
follow<00:04:52.919> them<00:04:53.190> and<00:04:53.340> this<00:04:53.699> is<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:53.970> same<00:04:54.240> exact

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
follow them and this is the same exact

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.570

stuff
same<00:05:29.160> exact<00:05:29.550> thing<00:05:29.610> TV<00:05:30.120> they<00:05:30.419> focused<00:05:30.720> on<00:05:30.780> TV

at<00:05:31.260> the<00:05:31.349> casual<00:05:31.710> with<00:05:31.860> Kinect<00:05:32.190> which<00:05:32.430> I<00:05:32.700> think

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
at the casual with Kinect which I think

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.580 
at the casual with Kinect which I think
was<00:05:33.150> detrimental<00:05:33.419> to<00:05:33.870> them<00:05:34.110> they're<00:05:34.349> making

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
was detrimental to them they're making

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.290 
was detrimental to them they're making
the<00:05:34.680> same<00:05:34.710> mistakes<00:05:35.130> Tony<00:05:35.400> did<00:05:35.639> and<00:05:35.849> yes<00:05:36.120> they

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
the same mistakes Tony did and yes they

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.879 
the same mistakes Tony did and yes they
will<00:05:36.450> still<00:05:36.720> exist<00:05:37.020> they'll<00:05:37.500> still<00:05:37.710> be<00:05:37.740> there

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
will still exist they'll still be there

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.310 
will still exist they'll still be there
but<00:05:38.310> they're<00:05:38.460> not<00:05:38.580> going<00:05:38.729> to<00:05:38.789> be<00:05:39.000> on<00:05:39.180> top<00:05:39.750> like

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320
