00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.779
 Evening the polar bears Regensburg in panic about 5000 spectators in the stadium on 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:17.460
 powder tower 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.900
 I was part of the party 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.310
 into the game it runs the last minute 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.070
 Vitalij Janke and already it happened 1 0 dusty 49 seconds were there now 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.720
 played 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.720
 a Sunday shot on Friday evening 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.050
 and that gave the home security three minutes later the pointers with it 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.310
 to want a man more on the ice trotter Garance BEGO two 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.310
 what a start the Niederbayer 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.230
 us a class goal on and by the way also 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.970
 there is their coach Erich Kühnhackl tried after this shock first 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.970
 to wake up his team and after a break 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.750
 Brian's cash also seemed to curse a little 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.520
 the best polar bear scene of the entire first third a post shot from 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.690
 Pößneck St 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.760
 the clearly better team stayed during the first 20 minutes 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.890
 but vital guest 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.370
 Niklas Hede 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.350
 maybe that's what you want 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.960
 Markus Janka has defeated for the third time and for the fourth time 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.730
 guiltless 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.830
 three to zero at the same time to approx 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.300
 how would they act as a buy-in on those catastrophic acts like that 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.440
 best answer 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.660
 2 the Burgenländer with the connecting goal in the 30 minutes 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.410
 more or less out of the blue but with a 500cc coupe 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.740
 only the Regensburger played 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.430
 Jason convoy in private duel with goalie Mike Bates however same 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.790
 twice the shorter one 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.310
 then as 37 minutes of play the icebergs outnumbered Martina Jauch gave Perez on 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.830
 Bottom of the polar bears KPZ on top only three to two 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.230
 a class-tor that from a spark of hope among the guests 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.230
 Conflagration triggered 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.579
 because even in the final third gave the mighty gas 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:25.409
 with the chance to equalize 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.209
 The tension thus increased a bit in this wedge 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.209
 but everything was within limits 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:38.779
 54 10 minutes 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:40.369

 believed game bears kg 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.159
 at least one point ahead of the polar bears so sure 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.329
 it stayed at the 13 prizes probably after regular time 13 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.519
 award the shootout Willard White Lady beforehand 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:07.419
 for the three gas 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.859
 and the WADA 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.859
 there may be two misses on both sides 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:16.179
 Florian logo for the polar bears 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:19.179
 Alex up again

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:26.359
 the pointers on the winning road because now I had to meet him 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.599
 delicate but not the number of civilians 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.369
 the Zuger a penalty shootout the final score 

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:35.499
 do not forget that could have 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:38.499
 Wiesinger it was still 0 0 Kolnik 2 percent 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:41.339
 none of his teammates 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:44.839
 he is more near service mail address that is very clear 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:47.839
 Google 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.099
 on paper we have him but the two points retracted next chance 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.710
 for a real one as if they were 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.039
