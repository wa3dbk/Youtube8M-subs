going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.540> see<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:56.130> picture<00:01:56.610> at<00:01:56.880> what<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.600> call

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
going to see is a picture at what I call

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.190 
going to see is a picture at what I call
low<00:01:58.649> light<00:01:58.950> now<00:01:59.909> the<00:01:59.939> low<00:02:00.240> light<00:02:00.479> setting<00:02:00.990> in

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
low light now the low light setting in

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.130 
low light now the low light setting in
my<00:02:01.619> office<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.369> only<00:02:02.700> had<00:02:02.939> two<00:02:03.210> lights<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
my office I only had two lights on the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.219 
my office I only had two lights on the
subject<00:02:04.619> okay

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
subject okay

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.410 
subject okay
the<00:02:08.229> next<00:02:08.530> thing<00:02:08.649> you're<00:02:08.770> going<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:08.950> see<00:02:09.190> is

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
the next thing you're going to see is

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.720 
the next thing you're going to see is
3/4<00:02:10.420> light<00:02:10.570> this<00:02:10.930> is<00:02:11.140> comparable<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.310> a

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
3/4 light this is comparable to a

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.180 
3/4 light this is comparable to a
standard<00:02:13.660> room<00:02:14.020> like<00:02:14.320> your<00:02:14.470> bedroom<00:02:14.920> if<00:02:15.040> it's

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
standard room like your bedroom if it's

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.160 
standard room like your bedroom if it's
well<00:02:15.400> lit<00:02:15.610> or<00:02:15.850> like<00:02:16.360> your<00:02:16.510> living<00:02:16.720> room<00:02:16.960> has

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
well lit or like your living room has

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.520 
well lit or like your living room has
well-lit<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:18.430> is<00:02:18.610> what<00:02:18.820> we're<00:02:19.030> looking<00:02:19.060> for

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.910 

the<00:02:23.530> third<00:02:23.710> one<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.160> actually<00:02:24.430> at<00:02:25.350> full<00:02:26.350> light

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
the third one is actually at full light

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.710 
the third one is actually at full light
so<00:02:27.310> this<00:02:27.460> is<00:02:27.610> my<00:02:27.850> studio<00:02:28.150> lighting<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.690> I

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
so this is my studio lighting that I

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.130 
so this is my studio lighting that I
have<00:02:29.250> right<00:02:30.250> now<00:02:30.430> I'm<00:02:30.670> running<00:02:30.820> probably<00:02:31.450> 3/4

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
have right now I'm running probably 3/4

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.730 
have right now I'm running probably 3/4
right<00:02:32.320> now

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
right now

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.650 
right now
but<00:02:33.370> there's<00:02:33.580> another<00:02:33.820> level<00:02:34.240> that<00:02:34.360> goes<00:02:34.510> on

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
but there's another level that goes on

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.200 
but there's another level that goes on
top<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:35.080> that<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.650> that's<00:02:36.010> full<00:02:36.370> settings

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
top of that and that's full settings

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.600 
top of that and that's full settings
full<00:02:37.600> blast<00:02:37.840> lights<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:39.040> last<00:02:39.280> setting

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
full blast lights and the last setting

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.790 
full blast lights and the last setting
right<00:02:39.760> here<00:02:39.820> is<00:02:40.240> what<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:40.690> call<00:02:40.959> freestyle<00:02:41.560> mode

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
right here is what I call freestyle mode

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.340 
right here is what I call freestyle mode
this<00:02:42.459> is<00:02:42.760> me<00:02:43.180> changing<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.840> settings<00:02:44.230> on<00:02:44.320> the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
this is me changing the settings on the

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:53.000 
this is me changing the settings on the
camera<00:02:44.740> to<00:02:44.920> take<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.190> best<00:02:45.459> picture<00:02:45.880> possible

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.340 

all<00:02:54.010> right<00:02:54.160> now<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.520> you<00:02:54.610> saw<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.850> pictures

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
all right now that you saw the pictures

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.540 
all right now that you saw the pictures
I'm<00:02:56.350> gonna<00:02:56.560> tell<00:02:56.830> you<00:02:56.920> what<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.040> found

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
I'm gonna tell you what I found

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.580 
I'm gonna tell you what I found
all<00:02:58.510> right<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:58.900> I<00:02:58.930> shouldn't<00:02:59.260> have<00:02:59.380> to<00:02:59.500> tell

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
all right so I shouldn't have to tell

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.670 
all right so I shouldn't have to tell
you<00:02:59.830> it<00:03:00.160> should<00:03:00.400> be<00:03:00.430> obvious<00:03:00.760> but<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.810> s5<00:03:02.350> is<00:03:02.380> a

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
you it should be obvious but the s5 is a

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.670 
you it should be obvious but the s5 is a
far<00:03:03.160> better<00:03:03.190> camera<00:03:03.910> than<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.180> HTC<00:03:04.390> One<00:03:05.170> m8

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
far better camera than the HTC One m8

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.770 
far better camera than the HTC One m8
and<00:03:05.980> this<00:03:06.610> is<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.790> best<00:03:06.970> experiment<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:07.570> could

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
and this is the best experiment I could

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.390 
and this is the best experiment I could
use<00:03:08.020> I<00:03:08.230> use<00:03:08.380> different<00:03:08.770> types<00:03:08.950> of<00:03:09.130> lighting

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
use I use different types of lighting

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.250 
use I use different types of lighting
and<00:03:09.730> from<00:03:10.300> there<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.570> have<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.720> exact<00:03:11.200> same

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
and from there you have the exact same

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.620 
and from there you have the exact same
results<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.980> s5<00:03:12.459> camera<00:03:12.940> was<00:03:13.120> able<00:03:13.239> to<00:03:13.330> bring

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
results the s5 camera was able to bring

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.540 
results the s5 camera was able to bring
out<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.900> colors<00:03:14.170> better<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.709> also<00:03:15.340> had<00:03:15.519> a

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
out the colors better and also had a

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.920 
out the colors better and also had a
better<00:03:15.850> natural<00:03:16.420> lighting

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
better natural lighting

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.229 
better natural lighting
it<00:03:17.170> looks<00:03:17.350> like<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.650> m8<00:03:18.130> for<00:03:18.489> some<00:03:18.670> reason<00:03:19.060> why

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
it looks like the m8 for some reason why

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.070 
it looks like the m8 for some reason why
I<00:03:19.269> know<00:03:19.540> why<00:03:19.690> it<00:03:20.200> used<00:03:20.590> a<00:03:20.890> a<00:03:21.459> game<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.630> actually

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
I know why it used a a game to actually

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.470 
I know why it used a a game to actually
make<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:24.040> image<00:03:24.370> look<00:03:24.550> brighter<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.300> lot

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
make the image look brighter and a lot

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.570 
make the image look brighter and a lot
of<00:03:25.600> times<00:03:25.810> unless<00:03:26.050> sort<00:03:26.560> of<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.709> fuzzy<00:03:26.980> halo

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
of times unless sort of a fuzzy halo

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.050 
of times unless sort of a fuzzy halo
around<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.300> actual<00:03:28.510> image<00:03:29.080> so<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:30.070> s5<00:03:30.519> camera

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
around the actual image so the s5 camera

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.530 
around the actual image so the s5 camera
versus<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.959> HTC<00:03:32.530> m8<00:03:33.010> camera<00:03:33.610> is<00:03:34.120> really<00:03:34.510> a

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
versus the HTC m8 camera is really a

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.440 
versus the HTC m8 camera is really a
no-contest<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.560> s5<00:03:35.950> camera<00:03:36.430> is<00:03:36.640> way<00:03:37.120> better

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
no-contest the s5 camera is way better

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.530 
no-contest the s5 camera is way better
than<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.690> HTC<00:03:38.290> One<00:03:38.530> m8<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.190> that's<00:03:40.180> just<00:03:40.420> the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
than the HTC One m8 and that's just the

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.759 
than the HTC One m8 and that's just the
bottom<00:03:40.690> line<00:03:40.890> now<00:03:41.890> I<00:03:41.920> prefer<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:44.200> m8<00:03:44.530> way

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
bottom line now I prefer the m8 way

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.410 
bottom line now I prefer the m8 way
better<00:03:44.980> than<00:03:45.100> s5<00:03:45.549> right<00:03:45.820> now<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.000> think<00:03:46.360> the

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
better than s5 right now I think the

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.840 
better than s5 right now I think the
inmates<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.780> better<00:03:46.959> phone<00:03:47.230> overall<00:03:47.799> but<00:03:48.640> when

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
inmates a better phone overall but when

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.820 
inmates a better phone overall but when
it<00:03:48.970> comes<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.299> cameras<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.870> s5<00:03:50.380> is<00:03:50.410> probably

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
it comes to cameras the s5 is probably

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.320 
it comes to cameras the s5 is probably
the<00:03:50.950> best<00:03:51.160> camera<00:03:51.489> you<00:03:51.519> can<00:03:51.670> find<00:03:51.880> on<00:03:52.000> a<00:03:52.060> phone

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
the best camera you can find on a phone

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.170 
the best camera you can find on a phone
comparing<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.440> LG<00:03:53.830> g2<00:03:54.250> they<00:03:54.790> are<00:03:54.940> both

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
comparing to the LG g2 they are both

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.199
