has<00:00:55.739> better<00:00:55.770> build<00:00:56.250> quality<00:00:56.309> what<00:00:57.149> do<00:00:57.210> you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
has better build quality what do you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.860 
has better build quality what do you
think<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> iPhone<00:00:59.039> 5<00:00:59.340> or<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
think is that the iPhone 5 or is it the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:10.660 
think is that the iPhone 5 or is it the
HTC<00:01:01.500> One<00:01:02.480> what<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.629> think

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.749 

the<00:01:11.210> iPhone<00:01:11.509> 5<00:01:11.720> is<00:01:12.220> seven<00:01:13.220> point<00:01:13.490> six

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
the iPhone 5 is seven point six

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.340 
the iPhone 5 is seven point six
millimeters<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:16.330> HTC<00:01:17.330> One<00:01:17.570> is<00:01:18.080> nine

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
millimeters and the HTC One is nine

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.800 
millimeters and the HTC One is nine
point<00:01:18.650> nine<00:01:18.729> as<00:01:19.729> you<00:01:19.939> can<00:01:20.060> see<00:01:20.240> here<00:01:20.450> it<00:01:20.540> curves

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
point nine as you can see here it curves

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.510 
point nine as you can see here it curves
out<00:01:21.049> and<00:01:21.439> it<00:01:21.590> makes<00:01:21.740> it<00:01:21.830> feel<00:01:22.040> thinner<00:01:22.369> than

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
out and it makes it feel thinner than

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.210 
out and it makes it feel thinner than
what<00:01:22.640> it<00:01:22.729> really<00:01:22.790> is<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:23.479> say<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.409> HTC<00:01:24.860> One<00:01:25.040> has

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
what it really is I say the HTC One has

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.029 
what it really is I say the HTC One has
great<00:01:25.580> build<00:01:25.850> quality<00:01:26.440> but<00:01:27.440> the<00:01:27.530> iPhone<00:01:27.799> 5<00:01:28.009> has

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
great build quality but the iPhone 5 has

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.149 
great build quality but the iPhone 5 has
really<00:01:28.670> nice<00:01:28.850> build<00:01:29.720> quality<00:01:29.869> overall<00:01:30.860> though

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
really nice build quality overall though

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.550 
really nice build quality overall though
I<00:01:31.190> think<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.460> HTC<00:01:31.880> One<00:01:32.119> has<00:01:32.810> better<00:01:33.259> build

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
I think the HTC One has better build

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.730 
I think the HTC One has better build
quality<00:01:33.880> yeah<00:01:34.880> it<00:01:35.509> did<00:01:35.659> take<00:01:35.869> notes<00:01:36.110> from<00:01:36.649> the

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
quality yeah it did take notes from the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.070 
quality yeah it did take notes from the
iphone<00:01:37.100> 5<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:37.580> mean<00:01:37.759> just<00:01:37.789> basically<00:01:38.479> the<00:01:38.960> way

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
iphone 5 I mean just basically the way

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.260 
iphone 5 I mean just basically the way
it<00:01:39.170> looks<00:01:39.439> you<00:01:40.100> would<00:01:40.250> think<00:01:40.280> that<00:01:40.460> it's<00:01:41.149> like

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
it looks you would think that it's like

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.240 
it looks you would think that it's like
the<00:01:41.360> front<00:01:41.630> of<00:01:41.689> it<00:01:41.810> looks<00:01:41.990> like<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:42.200> back<00:01:42.439> of

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
the front of it looks like the back of

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.580 
the front of it looks like the back of
this<00:01:43.690> but<00:01:44.690> that's<00:01:44.810> just<00:01:45.050> one<00:01:45.610> of<00:01:46.610> those<00:01:46.670> things

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
this but that's just one of those things

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.190 
this but that's just one of those things
but<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.950> back<00:01:49.190> is<00:01:49.460> a<00:01:49.520> one<00:01:50.270> full<00:01:50.569> sheet<00:01:50.929> here

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
but the back is a one full sheet here

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.600 
but the back is a one full sheet here
and<00:01:51.229> it's<00:01:51.440> a<00:01:51.970> really<00:01:52.970> really<00:01:53.210> nice<00:01:53.740> I<00:01:54.740> would

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
and it's a really really nice I would

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.830 
and it's a really really nice I would
say<00:01:55.789> the<00:01:56.350> HTC<00:01:57.350> One<00:01:57.970> definitely<00:01:58.970> a<00:01:59.000> superior
