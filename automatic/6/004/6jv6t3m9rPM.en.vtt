talk<00:00:04.440> about<00:00:04.680> contouring<00:00:05.430> with<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.240> blush

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
talk about contouring with a blush

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.020 
talk about contouring with a blush
format<00:00:07.109> called<00:00:07.410> raisin<00:00:08.000> it<00:00:09.000> looks<00:00:09.330> like<00:00:09.540> this

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
format called raisin it looks like this

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.870 
format called raisin it looks like this
and<00:00:12.650> it<00:00:13.650> looks<00:00:13.710> like<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.219> bronzer<00:00:14.639> but<00:00:14.759> it

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
and it looks like a bronzer but it

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.010 
and it looks like a bronzer but it
actually<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> blush<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.590> has<00:00:16.740> kind<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.070> a

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
actually is a blush and it has kind of a

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.779 
actually is a blush and it has kind of a
reddish<00:00:19.020> brown<00:00:19.050> undertone<00:00:20.039> which<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.460> wouldn't

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
reddish brown undertone which I wouldn't

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.450 
reddish brown undertone which I wouldn't
normally<00:00:21.060> use<00:00:21.600> for<00:00:21.630> contouring<00:00:22.350> but<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.010> think

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
normally use for contouring but I think

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.620 
normally use for contouring but I think
during<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.970> summer<00:00:24.300> months

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
during the summer months

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.120 
during the summer months
it<00:00:24.750> actually<00:00:24.930> works<00:00:25.320> because<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.800> helps<00:00:26.010> to

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
it actually works because it helps to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.220 
it actually works because it helps to
bronze<00:00:26.369> up<00:00:26.580> your<00:00:26.730> skin<00:00:26.939> at<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> same<00:00:27.180> time<00:00:27.570> so

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
bronze up your skin at the same time so

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.009 
bronze up your skin at the same time so
I<00:00:28.260> think<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:29.010> use<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.429> as<00:00:29.810> both<00:00:30.810> a

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
I think you can use this as both a

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.810 
I think you can use this as both a
bronzer<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.830> kind<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.610> contouring<00:00:33.200> powder

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
bronzer and kind of a contouring powder

type<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.680> thing<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.840> I'm<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:56.449> take<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
type of thing so I'm going to take the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.099 
type of thing so I'm going to take the
blush<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.579> just<00:00:59.579> get<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> little<00:00:59.969> bit<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
blush and just get a little bit on the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.810 
blush and just get a little bit on the
brush<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.219> very<00:01:02.550> highly

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
brush and this is a very highly

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.960 
brush and this is a very highly
pigmented<00:01:03.239> blush<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.670> definitely<00:01:05.670> use

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
pigmented blush so definitely use

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.370 
pigmented blush so definitely use
sparingly<00:01:06.540> at<00:01:06.720> first<00:01:06.960> because<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.229> can

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
sparingly at first because you can

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.800 
sparingly at first because you can
always<00:01:07.619> add<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.670> you're<00:01:08.939> going<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.510> want<00:01:09.720> to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
always add so you're going to want to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.090 
always add so you're going to want to
start<00:01:10.020> off<00:01:10.080> by<00:01:10.110> finding<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> hollows<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.070> your

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
start off by finding the hollows of your

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.490 
start off by finding the hollows of your
cheeks<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:12.450> me<00:01:12.600> one<00:01:12.900> side<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> lot

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
cheeks and for me one side is a lot

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.960 
cheeks and for me one side is a lot
easier<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.979> find<00:01:14.280> than<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.490> other<00:01:14.700> I'm<00:01:14.939> not

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
easier to find than the other I'm not

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.539 
easier to find than the other I'm not
really<00:01:15.240> sure<00:01:15.450> why<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:16.460> usually<00:01:17.460> I'll

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
really sure why that is but usually I'll

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.330 
really sure why that is but usually I'll
just<00:01:17.700> suck<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.030> my<00:01:18.150> cheeks

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.069 

and<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.240> kind<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.509> see<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.810> hollow

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
and you can kind of see that hollow

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:35.010 
and you can kind of see that hollow
start<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.649> form<00:01:25.890> so

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.200 

and<00:01:35.530> I<00:01:35.650> literally<00:01:35.920> just<00:01:36.250> do<00:01:36.340> a<00:01:36.369> nice<00:01:36.729> straight

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
and I literally just do a nice straight

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.200 
and I literally just do a nice straight
line<00:01:37.240> just<00:01:37.689> like<00:01:37.869> that<00:01:38.049> and<00:01:38.500> then<00:01:38.979> we're<00:01:39.100> done

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
line just like that and then we're done

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.510 
line just like that and then we're done
now<00:01:40.210> I'm<00:01:40.299> just<00:01:40.420> kidding<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:41.439> is<00:01:41.950> just<00:01:42.340> the

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
now I'm just kidding that is just the

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.520 
now I'm just kidding that is just the
first<00:01:42.880> step<00:01:43.299> so<00:01:43.360> let<00:01:43.899> me<00:01:43.990> go<00:01:44.110> ahead<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:44.320> do<00:01:44.439> it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
first step so let me go ahead and do it

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.760 
first step so let me go ahead and do it
on<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.710> other<00:01:44.740> side

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.160 

the<00:01:50.280> site<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.610> always<00:01:50.939> harder<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.329> me<00:01:51.479> my

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the site is always harder for me my

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:15.339 
the site is always harder for me my
mirror<00:01:53.570> this<00:01:54.570> mirror

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.629 

okay<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:16.459> now<00:02:16.790> we<00:02:17.299> have<00:02:17.329> two<00:02:18.340> stripes<00:02:19.340> on

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:19.639 
okay so now we have two stripes on

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.099 
okay so now we have two stripes on
either<00:02:19.999> side<00:02:20.299> of<00:02:20.389> our<00:02:20.510> face<00:02:20.689> and<00:02:20.900> that

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109 
either side of our face and that

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.050 
either side of our face and that
absolutely<00:02:21.680> doesn't<00:02:21.859> look<00:02:22.040> natural<00:02:22.249> or<00:02:22.730> cute

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
absolutely doesn't look natural or cute

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.789 
absolutely doesn't look natural or cute
or<00:02:23.090> anything<00:02:23.569> like<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:23.870> so<00:02:24.230> we<00:02:24.379> have<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.650> fix

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
or anything like that so we have to fix

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:32.080 
or anything like that so we have to fix
that<00:02:25.540> so<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:31.430> next<00:02:31.549> thing<00:02:31.760> I'm<00:02:31.819> going<00:02:31.909> to<00:02:31.969> do

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
that so the next thing I'm going to do

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.240 
that so the next thing I'm going to do
is<00:02:32.209> take<00:02:32.389> a<00:02:32.599> smaller<00:02:32.989> more<00:02:33.439> dense<00:02:33.650> brush<00:02:33.950> and

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
is take a smaller more dense brush and

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:42.339 
is take a smaller more dense brush and
just<00:02:34.459> blend<00:02:34.760> in<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.810> line

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.679 

and<00:02:42.439> at<00:02:43.069> this<00:02:43.189> point<00:02:43.459> in<00:02:43.579> your<00:02:43.670> makeup<00:02:43.849> or<00:02:44.540> at

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
and at this point in your makeup or at

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.119 
and at this point in your makeup or at
this<00:02:44.840> point<00:02:45.079> I<00:02:45.170> usually<00:02:45.530> have<00:02:45.680> my<00:02:45.829> foundation

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
this point I usually have my foundation

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:53.140

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
so I'm kind of running the brush over

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.100 
so I'm kind of running the brush over
the<00:02:55.800> line<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.310> blending<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.930> the
