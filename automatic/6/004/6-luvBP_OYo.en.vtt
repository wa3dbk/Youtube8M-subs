00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
thing that is important actually is to

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.430 
thing that is important actually is to
have<00:00:43.500> cold<00:00:43.980> damage<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.180> braces<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:46.050> well

have cold damage on the braces as well
as<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.370> get<00:00:47.789> familiar<00:00:48.149> damage<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
as if you can get familiar damage on the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.270 
as if you can get familiar damage on the
shoulders<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.320> that's<00:00:49.500> not<00:00:49.770> hugely

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
shoulders but that's not hugely

important here's just a full breakdown

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.850 
important here's just a full breakdown
of<00:00:54.390> what<00:00:54.629> should<00:00:54.840> be<00:00:54.899> looking<00:00:55.140> at<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.530> terms<00:00:55.559> of

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
of what should be looking at in terms of

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.729 
of what should be looking at in terms of
the<00:00:55.949> stats<00:00:56.190> these<00:00:56.820> are<00:00:56.940> unbuffed<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.449> course

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
the stats these are unbuffed of course

way of a link but basically how the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.440 
way of a link but basically how the
build<00:01:12.030> works<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.600> use<00:01:13.290> diamonds<00:01:13.770> again<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
build works is use diamonds again and

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.960 
build works is use diamonds again and

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.910 

I<00:01:52.150> was<00:01:53.150> doing<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.479> few<00:01:53.689> casual<00:01:54.140> runs<00:01:54.350> in<00:01:54.650> the

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
I was doing a few casual runs in the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.859 
I was doing a few casual runs in the
crypt<00:01:55.189> just<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:55.850> see<00:01:56.000> how<00:01:56.090> long<00:01:56.270> it'll<00:01:56.420> take<00:01:56.509> me

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
crypt just to see how long it'll take me

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.030 
crypt just to see how long it'll take me
roughly<00:01:57.110> to<00:01:57.590> get<00:01:57.939> to<00:01:59.290> 196<00:02:00.290> power<00:02:00.590> of<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.770> level

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
roughly to get to 196 power of the level

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.600 
roughly to get to 196 power of the level
and<00:02:01.299> this<00:02:02.299> all<00:02:02.990> together<00:02:03.140> took<00:02:03.799> me<00:02:03.920> about<00:02:04.130> 15

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
and this all together took me about 15

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.630 
and this all together took me about 15
minutes<00:02:04.990> normally<00:02:05.990> I<00:02:06.229> can<00:02:06.710> do<00:02:06.830> it<00:02:06.950> in<00:02:07.040> about<00:02:07.100> 12

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
minutes normally I can do it in about 12

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.419 
minutes normally I can do it in about 12
minutes<00:02:07.940> so<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:09.470> get<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.649> level<00:02:09.979> that's<00:02:10.130> about

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
minutes so to get a level that's about

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.880 
minutes so to get a level that's about
300<00:02:10.850> million<00:02:11.000> XP<00:02:11.390> so<00:02:11.959> all<00:02:12.110> knows<00:02:12.350> about<00:02:12.380> me

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
300 million XP so all knows about me

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.670 
300 million XP so all knows about me
it's<00:02:13.130> about<00:02:13.220> 1.2<00:02:13.819> billion<00:02:14.000> XP<00:02:14.450> an<00:02:14.569> hour<00:02:14.720> it's

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
it's about 1.2 billion XP an hour it's

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.270 
it's about 1.2 billion XP an hour it's
pretty<00:02:16.130> good<00:02:16.459> but<00:02:17.739> yeah<00:02:18.739> it's<00:02:18.890> not<00:02:19.040> reliable

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
pretty good but yeah it's not reliable

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.650 
pretty good but yeah it's not reliable
I'm<00:02:19.550> in<00:02:19.640> scripts<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.090> ancient<00:02:20.420> says

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
I'm in scripts the ancient says

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
basic gist of the bill but this is a

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.600 
basic gist of the bill but this is a
little<00:02:30.049> just<00:02:30.590> up<00:02:30.709> here<00:02:30.739> is<00:02:31.040> where<00:02:31.250> i<00:02:31.280> show<00:02:31.580> you

little just up here is where i show you
why<00:02:32.120> i<00:02:32.150> use<00:02:32.660> wormhole<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:33.620> teleport<00:02:34.160> is<00:02:35.049> to

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
why i use wormhole and teleport is to

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.949 
why i use wormhole and teleport is to
basically<00:02:36.459> get<00:02:37.459> in<00:02:37.670> he'll<00:02:38.390> shooting<00:02:38.780> at<00:02:38.870> the

fuck out very quick very easy sometimes

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.930 
fuck out very quick very easy sometimes
you<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.440> teleport<00:02:42.739> around<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.220> map<00:02:43.400> or<00:02:43.700> to

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
you to teleport around the map or to

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.780 
you to teleport around the map or to
avoid<00:02:44.239> like<00:02:44.900> jailer<00:02:45.560> that<00:02:45.890> kind<00:02:46.130> of<00:02:46.160> thing<00:02:46.400> or

avoid like jailer that kind of thing or
like<00:02:47.120> for<00:02:47.269> instance<00:02:47.330> here<00:02:47.810> where<00:02:48.049> I'm<00:02:48.170> kind<00:02:48.500> of

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
like for instance here where I'm kind of

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.940 
like for instance here where I'm kind of
pointing<00:02:48.799> down<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.160> kill<00:02:49.519> a<00:02:49.549> shitload<00:02:50.360> of<00:02:50.600> mobs

pointing down to kill a shitload of mobs

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.240 
pointing down to kill a shitload of mobs
but<00:02:52.840> most<00:02:53.840> of<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.049> time<00:02:54.230> i'll<00:02:54.410> be<00:02:54.440> using<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:54.920> to

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
but most of the time i'll be using it to

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.920 
but most of the time i'll be using it to
get<00:02:55.940> out<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.650> reset<00:02:58.570> obviously<00:02:59.570> get<00:02:59.750> out<00:02:59.840> of

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
get out and reset obviously get out of

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.550 
get out and reset obviously get out of
danger<00:03:01.030> also<00:03:02.030> on<00:03:02.299> them<00:03:02.480> that's<00:03:02.600> very<00:03:02.959> very

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
danger also on them that's very very

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.289 
danger also on them that's very very

and I've put an example at the end here
for<00:04:11.249> you<00:04:11.340> so<00:04:11.519> you<00:04:11.609> can<00:04:11.670> see<00:04:12.060> what<00:04:12.389> it's<00:04:12.569> like<00:04:12.810> to

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
for you so you can see what it's like to

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.920 
for you so you can see what it's like to
cuddle<00:04:13.379> elite<00:04:13.969> that<00:04:14.969> it<00:04:15.180> does<00:04:15.359> take<00:04:15.629> a<00:04:15.659> good

cuddle elite that it does take a good
amount<00:04:16.139> of<00:04:16.410> time<00:04:16.789> so<00:04:17.789> that's<00:04:18.060> why<00:04:18.209> I<00:04:18.239> generally

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
amount of time so that's why I generally

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.580 
amount of time so that's why I generally
just<00:04:18.959> don't<00:04:19.560> give<00:04:19.739> a<00:04:19.799> shit<00:04:20.009> I<00:04:20.220> normally<00:04:20.729> just

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
just don't give a shit I normally just

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.710 
just don't give a shit I normally just

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
and that's pretty much a build hope it
