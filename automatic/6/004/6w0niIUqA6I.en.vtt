00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
going to show you what it does is it's a

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.619 
going to show you what it does is it's a
battery-powered<00:00:45.680> system<00:00:46.309> that<00:00:46.790> also<00:00:47.000> runs<00:00:47.360> on

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
battery-powered system that also runs on

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.399 
battery-powered system that also runs on
radio<00:00:48.400> that<00:00:49.400> works<00:00:49.610> with<00:00:49.879> your<00:00:50.030> DCC<00:00:50.780> system<00:00:51.229> to

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
radio that works with your DCC system to

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.619 
radio that works with your DCC system to
run<00:00:51.589> your<00:00:51.979> trains<00:00:52.400> and<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:53.239> nice<00:00:53.390> thing<00:00:53.420> about

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
run your trains and the nice thing about

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.280 
run your trains and the nice thing about
it<00:00:54.019> is<00:00:54.050> that<00:00:54.430> it<00:00:55.430> doesn't<00:00:56.180> use<00:00:56.300> any<00:00:56.659> power<00:00:56.989> from

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
it is that it doesn't use any power from

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.229 
it is that it doesn't use any power from
the<00:00:57.379> track<00:00:57.589> at<00:00:57.769> all<00:00:57.890> everything<00:00:58.879> is<00:00:59.000> coming

other end of it is hooked up to the
track<00:01:06.590> bus<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:07.580> it's<00:01:08.030> got<00:01:08.210> a<00:01:08.240> small<00:01:08.540> antenna

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
track bus and it's got a small antenna

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.719 
track bus and it's got a small antenna
on<00:01:09.080> it<00:01:09.110> back<00:01:09.409> around<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.100> corner<00:01:10.130> here<00:01:10.549> and

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
on it back around the corner here and

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.260 
on it back around the corner here and
underneath<00:01:11.720> there<00:01:12.200> is<00:01:12.530> in<00:01:12.830> here<00:01:13.220> a<00:01:13.430> lithium

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
underneath there is in here a lithium

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.410 
underneath there is in here a lithium
polymer<00:01:14.770> battery<00:01:15.820> which<00:01:16.820> we<00:01:16.970> will<00:01:17.150> be<00:01:17.240> using

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
polymer battery which we will be using

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.090 
polymer battery which we will be using
smaller<00:01:17.840> ones<00:01:18.140> when<00:01:18.380> we<00:01:18.409> get<00:01:18.740> around<00:01:18.830> to

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
smaller ones when we get around to

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.710 
smaller ones when we get around to
actually<00:01:19.190> doing<00:01:19.610> this<00:01:19.970> as<00:01:20.270> I<00:01:20.360> said<00:01:20.540> this<00:01:20.660> is

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
actually doing this as I said this is

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.590 
actually doing this as I said this is
just<00:01:20.930> a<00:01:21.080> prototype<00:01:21.290> for<00:01:21.710> testing<00:01:22.070> purposes

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
just a prototype for testing purposes

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.970 
just a prototype for testing purposes
which<00:01:23.600> can't<00:01:23.870> see<00:01:24.050> in<00:01:24.170> here<00:01:24.320> also<00:01:24.530> is<00:01:24.860> that

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
which can't see in here also is that

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.880 
which can't see in here also is that
there's<00:01:25.130> a<00:01:25.190> standard<00:01:25.490> DCC<00:01:26.480> decoder<00:01:26.930> in<00:01:27.500> here

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
there's a standard DCC decoder in here

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.850 
there's a standard DCC decoder in here
as<00:01:28.040> well<00:01:28.250> it<00:01:29.210> does<00:01:29.270> work<00:01:29.690> in<00:01:29.930> consumed<00:01:30.440> concert

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
as well it does work in consumed concert

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.730 
as well it does work in consumed concert
with<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.130> DCC<00:01:31.640> system<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.560> you'll<00:01:33.560> have

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
with the DCC system and you'll have

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.530 
with the DCC system and you'll have
basically<00:01:33.950> one<00:01:34.550> transmitter<00:01:35.060> that<00:01:35.300> you<00:01:35.390> hook

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
basically one transmitter that you hook

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.910 
basically one transmitter that you hook
up<00:01:35.690> which<00:01:35.870> is<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.110> one<00:01:36.230> that<00:01:36.320> we<00:01:36.440> have<00:01:36.620> over

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
up which is the one that we have over

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.800 
up which is the one that we have over
there<00:01:37.040> for<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.430> radio<00:01:37.760> and<00:01:38.060> it'll<00:01:38.630> run

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
there for the radio and it'll run

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.630 
there for the radio and it'll run
multiple<00:01:39.080> locomotives<00:01:39.950> all<00:01:40.100> over<00:01:40.520> your

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
multiple locomotives all over your

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.580 
multiple locomotives all over your
railroad<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.630> beautiful<00:01:42.020> thing<00:01:42.170> about<00:01:42.200> this

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
railroad the beautiful thing about this

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.190 
railroad the beautiful thing about this
like<00:01:42.770> I<00:01:42.890> said<00:01:42.920> is<00:01:43.160> that<00:01:43.430> it<00:01:43.550> is<00:01:43.820> DCC<00:01:44.540> compatible

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
like I said is that it is DCC compatible

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.980 
like I said is that it is DCC compatible
and<00:01:45.440> it<00:01:45.950> will<00:01:46.160> run<00:01:46.370> with<00:01:46.550> any<00:01:46.700> DCC<00:01:47.390> system<00:01:47.810> that

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
and it will run with any DCC system that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.650 
and it will run with any DCC system that
you<00:01:48.080> have<00:01:48.350> whether<00:01:48.740> that's<00:01:49.070> north<00:01:50.030> coast<00:01:50.360> or

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
you have whether that's north coast or

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.030 
you have whether that's north coast or
NCE<00:01:51.170> or<00:01:51.910> digitrax<00:01:52.910> or<00:01:53.390> lens<00:01:53.660> or<00:01:54.020> pretty<00:01:54.980> much

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
NCE or digitrax or lens or pretty much

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.340 
NCE or digitrax or lens or pretty much
any<00:01:55.310> system<00:01:55.670> that's<00:01:55.790> out<00:01:55.970> there<00:01:56.180> all<00:01:56.450> DCC

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
any system that's out there all DCC

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.320 
any system that's out there all DCC
systems<00:01:57.800> will<00:01:57.980> work<00:01:58.130> fine<00:01:58.400> with<00:01:58.580> this<00:01:58.760> because

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
systems will work fine with this because

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.899 
systems will work fine with this because
just<00:01:59.690> like<00:01:59.900> with<00:02:00.170> any<00:02:00.710> other<00:02:00.800> decoder<00:02:01.370> it's

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
just like with any other decoder it's

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.670 
just like with any other decoder it's
basically<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.510> signal<00:02:02.900> that<00:02:03.020> goes<00:02:03.230> out<00:02:03.440> and

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
basically the signal that goes out and

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.860 
basically the signal that goes out and
so<00:02:04.159> any<00:02:04.490> system<00:02:04.730> will<00:02:05.030> work<00:02:05.180> with<00:02:05.360> pretty<00:02:05.720> much

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
so any system will work with pretty much

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.450 
so any system will work with pretty much
any<00:02:06.020> decoder<00:02:06.409> this<00:02:06.650> is<00:02:06.770> just<00:02:06.950> taking<00:02:07.310> the

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
any decoder this is just taking the

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.210 
any decoder this is just taking the
information<00:02:08.239> off<00:02:08.750> of<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:09.349> rails<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:09.769> putting

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
information off of the rails and putting

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.699 
information off of the rails and putting
it<00:02:10.340> into<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:11.090> air<00:02:11.239> by<00:02:11.930> radio<00:02:12.319> and<00:02:12.560> also

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
it into the air by radio and also

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.680 
it into the air by radio and also
running<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.190> back<00:02:13.370> there<00:02:13.730> locomotive<00:02:14.269> off<00:02:14.420> of

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
running the back there locomotive off of

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.050 
running the back there locomotive off of
battery<00:02:15.050> power<00:02:15.280> now<00:02:16.280> I'm<00:02:16.610> gonna<00:02:16.730> start<00:02:16.970> the

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
battery power now I'm gonna start the

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.580 
battery power now I'm gonna start the
locomotive<00:02:17.599> up<00:02:17.720> now<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:17.900> give<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.230> Sean<00:02:18.409> I'm

locomotive up now to give you Sean I'm
going<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:18.800> bring<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.069> throttle<00:02:19.430> up<00:02:19.519> here<00:02:19.760> so

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
going to bring the throttle up here so

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.920 
going to bring the throttle up here so
that<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.300> can<00:02:20.480> see<00:02:20.659> it

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
that you can see it

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.199 
that you can see it
and<00:02:21.019> I'm<00:02:21.440> gonna<00:02:21.560> go<00:02:21.769> ahead<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.069> start<00:02:22.670> by

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
and I'm gonna go ahead and start by

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.209 
and I'm gonna go ahead and start by
having<00:02:23.359> the<00:02:23.540> locomotive<00:02:24.019> move<00:02:24.139> forward<00:02:24.499> and

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:25.219 
having the locomotive move forward and

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:26.830 
having the locomotive move forward and
you<00:02:25.370> can<00:02:25.519> see<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.969> actually<00:02:26.150> runs<00:02:26.569> quite

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
you can see it actually runs quite

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.870 
you can see it actually runs quite
smoothly

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
smoothly

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.790 
smoothly
since<00:02:28.270> there's<00:02:28.510> no<00:02:28.570> battery<00:02:29.050> power<00:02:29.470> pickup

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
since there's no battery power pickup

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.770 
since there's no battery power pickup
from<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.100> track<00:02:30.370> it's<00:02:31.090> running<00:02:31.360> along<00:02:31.540> quite

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
from the track it's running along quite

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.340 
from the track it's running along quite
nicely

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
nicely

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.320 
nicely
now<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:32.980> amazing<00:02:33.250> thing<00:02:33.490> of<00:02:33.700> course<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.060> be<00:02:34.240> in

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
now the amazing thing of course to be in

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.180 
now the amazing thing of course to be in
that<00:02:34.480> it's<00:02:34.600> batteries<00:02:35.050> when<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.320> do<00:02:35.470> this<00:02:35.830> and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
that it's batteries when I do this and

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.150 
that it's batteries when I do this and
pick<00:02:36.850> it<00:02:36.880> up<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:38.320> can<00:02:38.500> see<00:02:38.650> this<00:02:38.800> locomotive

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
pick it up you can see this locomotive

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.520 
pick it up you can see this locomotive
is<00:02:39.520> still<00:02:39.790> running<00:02:40.210> that's<00:02:40.990> pretty<00:02:41.260> amazing

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
is still running that's pretty amazing

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.650 
is still running that's pretty amazing
and<00:02:41.920> I'm<00:02:42.730> gonna<00:02:42.820> go<00:02:43.000> ahead<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.210> back<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.540> down

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
and I'm gonna go ahead and back it down

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.420 
and I'm gonna go ahead and back it down
just<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:44.050> show<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.350> that<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:44.710> am<00:02:44.830> actually

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
just to show you that I am actually

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.980 
just to show you that I am actually
running<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.090> then<00:02:46.630> change<00:02:46.900> the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
running it and then change the

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.280 
running it and then change the
directions<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.530> can<00:02:47.680> see<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:49.020> there<00:02:50.020> it<00:02:50.140> goes

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
directions you can see and there it goes

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.540 
directions you can see and there it goes
back<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.740> backwards<00:02:52.320> so<00:02:53.320> this<00:02:53.800> locomotive<00:02:54.190> is

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
back and backwards so this locomotive is

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.980 
back and backwards so this locomotive is
completely<00:02:54.970> being<00:02:55.180> powered<00:02:55.570> at<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.750> moment

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
completely being powered at the moment

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.930 
completely being powered at the moment
by<00:02:56.110> that<00:02:56.290> battery<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:56.920> by<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:57.520> radio

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
by that battery and by the radio

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.090 
by that battery and by the radio
receiver<00:02:58.120> that's<00:02:58.600> in<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.840> tender<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.710> just

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
receiver that's in the tender and just

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.230 
receiver that's in the tender and just
to<00:03:00.250> show<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.460> something<00:03:00.760> else<00:03:00.880> that's<00:03:01.000> kind

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
to show you something else that's kind

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.230 
to show you something else that's kind
of<00:03:01.300> cold<00:03:01.540> that<00:03:01.630> I'll<00:03:02.070> if<00:03:03.070> I'm<00:03:03.280> lyin<00:03:03.640> I'm<00:03:03.760> dying

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
of cold that I'll if I'm lyin I'm dying

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.660 
of cold that I'll if I'm lyin I'm dying
we'll<00:03:05.110> be<00:03:05.200> right<00:03:05.410> like<00:03:05.650> this<00:03:05.830> on<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.520> home

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
we'll be right like this on the home

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.300 
we'll be right like this on the home
aside<00:03:10.260> take<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.320> look<00:03:11.530> at<00:03:11.620> that<00:03:11.770> folks

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
aside take a look at that folks

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.070 
aside take a look at that folks
pretty<00:03:13.090> amazing<00:03:15.330> put<00:03:16.330> this<00:03:16.420> deer<00:03:16.690> very<00:03:16.870> that

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
pretty amazing put this deer very that

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.410 
pretty amazing put this deer very that
steer<00:03:17.380> very<00:03:17.410> well<00:03:17.830> obvious<00:03:18.700> reasons<00:03:19.060> but<00:03:19.210> look

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
steer very well obvious reasons but look

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.600 
steer very well obvious reasons but look
it's<00:03:19.630> running<00:03:19.960> along<00:03:20.170> on<00:03:20.350> them<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:20.890> with<00:03:21.430> no

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
it's running along on them so with no

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.780 
it's running along on them so with no
connection<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.270> track<00:03:22.510> at<00:03:22.780> all<00:03:23.790> now

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
connection to the track at all now

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.400 
connection to the track at all now
hopefully<00:03:25.180> this<00:03:25.600> system<00:03:25.990> would<00:03:26.080> be<00:03:26.200> ready

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
hopefully this system would be ready

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.260 
hopefully this system would be ready
probably<00:03:27.250> before<00:03:27.490> the<00:03:27.670> end<00:03:27.940> of<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.090> year<00:03:28.210> in

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
probably before the end of the year in

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.260 
probably before the end of the year in
May<00:03:28.390> possibly<00:03:28.900> even<00:03:29.050> by<00:03:29.260> summer<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:30.610> we're

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
May possibly even by summer and we're

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.520 
May possibly even by summer and we're
looking<00:03:31.480> forward<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.840> getting<00:03:32.020> it<00:03:32.230> into<00:03:32.380> your

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
looking forward to getting it into your

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.840 
looking forward to getting it into your
hands<00:03:32.950> we<00:03:33.160> think<00:03:33.400> it's<00:03:33.520> going<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.700> be<00:03:33.820> a

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
hands we think it's going to be a

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.060 
hands we think it's going to be a
game-changer<00:03:34.380> because<00:03:35.380> now<00:03:35.590> you'll<00:03:35.770> be<00:03:35.860> able

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
game-changer because now you'll be able

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.400 
game-changer because now you'll be able
to<00:03:36.220> not<00:03:36.370> have<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.610> power<00:03:36.910> any<00:03:37.300> frogs<00:03:37.900> imagine

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
to not have to power any frogs imagine

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.410 
to not have to power any frogs imagine

shorting out the railroad you could even

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.000 
shorting out the railroad you could even
go<00:03:46.330> ahead<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:46.690> paint<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.050> track<00:03:47.290> completely

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010

and<00:03:48.220> I<00:03:48.730> have<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.060> worry<00:03:49.270> at<00:03:49.540> all<00:03:49.690> about<00:03:50.050> whether

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
and I have to worry at all about whether

course but the battery you'll cop excuse
me<00:04:00.520> the<00:04:00.640> locomotives<00:04:01.210> will<00:04:01.330> run<00:04:01.570> much<00:04:01.840> more

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
me the locomotives will run much more

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.690 
me the locomotives will run much more
