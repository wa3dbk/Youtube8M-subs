 100 bursting because she gets 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.190
 that is, in his here through lacquer 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.940

 here and the platform is a hospital here 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.710
 give vidal platform quarrels from the trail 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.330

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.890
 ordinary can they also differ in 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.989
 stiffness and for beginners 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.459
 accordingly, not very tough ones are needed 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.950
