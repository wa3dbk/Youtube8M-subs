that<00:06:09.979> bad<00:06:10.340> i<00:06:10.400> mean<00:06:10.700> the<00:06:10.850> action<00:06:11.180> is<00:06:11.270> done<00:06:11.510> fine

that bad i mean the action is done fine
i<00:06:11.870> guess<00:06:12.080> the<00:06:12.530> cgi<00:06:12.919> looks<00:06:13.220> all<00:06:13.400> right<00:06:13.430> but

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
i guess the cgi looks all right but

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.420 
i guess the cgi looks all right but
literally<00:06:14.900> everything<00:06:15.380> else<00:06:15.650> about<00:06:15.979> the<00:06:16.190> film
