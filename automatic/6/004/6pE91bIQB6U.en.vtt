00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.690 
lightly cuz you don't want to break them
all<00:03:29.720> up<00:03:30.080> into<00:03:30.560> tiny<00:03:30.860> little<00:03:30.950> pieces<00:03:31.250> like<00:03:31.610> if

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
all up into tiny little pieces like if

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
you were to put in the beginning because

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.400
