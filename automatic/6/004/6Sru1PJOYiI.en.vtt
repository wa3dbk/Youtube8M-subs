Fuji iPad them in there and then close
it<00:01:10.479> up<00:01:11.280> basically<00:01:12.280> this<00:01:12.760> fits<00:01:13.270> in<00:01:13.450> there<00:01:13.690> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
it up basically this fits in there and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.889 
it up basically this fits in there and
you<00:01:16.090> just<00:01:16.119> could<00:01:16.660> about<00:01:17.340> as<00:01:18.340> tight<00:01:18.670> as<00:01:18.910> needed

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
you just could about as tight as needed

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.350 
you just could about as tight as needed
so<00:01:20.110> that<00:01:20.259> it<00:01:20.410> can<00:01:20.530> flex<00:01:20.800> around<00:01:21.250> this<00:01:22.000> is<00:01:22.180> also

so that it can flex around this is also

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.749 
so that it can flex around this is also
kind<00:01:22.840> of<00:01:22.930> flexible<00:01:23.830> you<00:01:23.979> can<00:01:24.009> bend<00:01:24.399> that<00:01:24.460> as

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
kind of flexible you can bend that as

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.920 
kind of flexible you can bend that as
much<00:01:25.690> as<00:01:25.720> you<00:01:25.869> want<00:01:26.290> to<00:01:26.740> get<00:01:26.920> extra<00:01:27.720> extra<00:01:28.720> Ben

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
for it to really lock in that area up

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.199 
for it to really lock in that area up
there<00:02:00.959> so<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:03.280> go<00:02:03.459> ahead<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:03.970> filter
