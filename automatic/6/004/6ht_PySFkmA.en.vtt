fed like a 375 but I had the refeed
Sunday<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:50.419> then<00:04:50.539> my<00:04:50.630> weight<00:04:50.810> was<00:04:50.960> shooting

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
Sunday and then my weight was shooting

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.589 
Sunday and then my weight was shooting
down<00:04:51.620> after<00:04:52.039> that<00:04:52.190> so<00:04:52.490> I'm<00:04:53.300> sure<00:04:53.479> we'll

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
down after that so I'm sure we'll

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.450 
down after that so I'm sure we'll
probably<00:04:53.780> keep<00:04:53.990> it<00:04:54.139> up<00:04:54.229> around<00:04:54.740> 450<00:04:55.340> or

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
probably keep it up around 450 or

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.610

track<00:05:57.919> our<00:05:58.130> macros<00:05:58.490> honestly<00:05:58.970> because<00:05:59.270> it's

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
track our macros honestly because it's

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.340 
track our macros honestly because it's

going to allow us to stay on point and I
don't<00:06:03.680> know<00:06:03.770> people<00:06:04.190> probably<00:06:04.430> think<00:06:04.639> we're

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
don't know people probably think we're

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.510 
don't know people probably think we're
crazy<00:06:05.000> but<00:06:05.500> we're<00:06:06.500> on<00:06:06.590> contest<00:06:07.009> prep<00:06:07.250> if

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
crazy but we're on contest prep if

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.129 
crazy but we're on contest prep if
you're<00:06:07.699> not<00:06:07.820> on<00:06:07.940> contest<00:06:08.389> prep<00:06:08.630> and<00:06:08.930> there's

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
you're not on contest prep and there's

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:12.870 
you're not on contest prep and there's
no<00:06:09.289> point<00:06:09.560> in<00:06:09.770> my<00:06:10.490> opinion<00:06:10.789> to<00:06:11.630> track<00:06:12.169> so

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
no point in my opinion to track so

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.969 
no point in my opinion to track so
precisely<00:06:13.880> on<00:06:14.330> like<00:06:15.289> the<00:06:15.440> holidays<00:06:15.680> or

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
precisely on like the holidays or

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.249 
precisely on like the holidays or
whatever<00:06:16.220> but<00:06:17.030> if<00:06:17.389> we<00:06:17.630> can<00:06:17.900> we<00:06:18.080> might<00:06:18.229> as<00:06:18.349> well

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:20.259 
whatever but if we can we might as well

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:23.140 
whatever but if we can we might as well
it's<00:06:21.259> obviously<00:06:21.590> better<00:06:21.800> if<00:06:22.190> you<00:06:22.400> can<00:06:22.669> stay<00:06:22.970> on

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
it's obviously better if you can stay on

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.760 
it's obviously better if you can stay on
point<00:06:23.330> so<00:06:24.610> that's<00:06:25.610> it<00:06:25.789> I<00:06:26.599> want<00:06:27.530> to<00:06:27.590> show<00:06:27.680> you
