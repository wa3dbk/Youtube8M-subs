00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.220 

the<00:01:53.400> trailers<00:01:54.090> off<00:01:54.240> sideways<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:56.960> guess<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.140> got

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
the trailers off sideways I guess it got

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.490 
the trailers off sideways I guess it got
herself<00:01:58.380> into<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.860> truck<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.310> decided<00:02:00.150> to<00:02:00.500> ride

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
herself into a truck and decided to ride

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.970 
herself into a truck and decided to ride
it<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.630> guess<00:02:03.810> I'd<00:02:03.990> go<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.140> little<00:02:04.320> slower<00:02:04.680> I

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
it so I guess I'd go a little slower I

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.890 
it so I guess I'd go a little slower I
guess<00:02:05.370> five<00:02:05.640> miles<00:02:05.910> an<00:02:06.090> hour's<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> ten<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.670> don't

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:08.900 
guess five miles an hour's a ten I don't

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.550 
guess five miles an hour's a ten I don't
that<00:02:09.900> was<00:02:10.050> fun
