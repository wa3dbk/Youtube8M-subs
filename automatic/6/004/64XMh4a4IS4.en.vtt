00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.350
 6 finally on the waterfront promenade and the front when that experience in the blog 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.200
 sometimes they do not know that work is in the second workout season 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.099
 3 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.239
 trained 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.239
 I like things this promise said 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.749
 so actually all 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.679
 the segment 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.569
 and it's showing like a farm 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.029
 in relation to last season 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.480
 about 7 thousand 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.480
 have experience yes people 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.290
 quite different then 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.330
 we are good 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.110
 it's a new version 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.790
 the entity should remember our experience last year as a part 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.790
 the fence that separates 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.180
 the crime was a fascinating experience symptomatically 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.490
 it's the coolest 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.890
 I learned a lot 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.160
 besides representatives of about 300 mayors 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.290
 there is nothing 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.690
 hostages 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.980
 one more study than I did not 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.470
 help 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.970
 There's a lot for me to go out. 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.580
 it's more than it really has 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.180
 the mayor's office 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.390
 and now professional future the interest is to end the dream 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.119
 the bottom line 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.920
 we have 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.020
 I actually 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.020
 I want to be sure to know that I 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.400
 he 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.410
 certainly more 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.660
 seems done 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.660
 outside the houses the critical spirit of the magazine 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.950
 in exchange for disarmament but among the traffickers 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.130
 Blog lectures created a batch of five thousand doses 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.860
 this season only on Saturday 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.260
 that's how it works 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.520
 these interviews 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.630
 It's good on the blog here
