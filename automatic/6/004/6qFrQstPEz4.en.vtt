00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:08.220
 twist-twirl tangle want hello 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:10.679
 questions come from our customers like 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.820
 install correctly 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:19.380
 the cover received from us because the cover 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:23.369
 produced highly accurately dressed in 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:28.920
 stretch and so specifically for you 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:33.380
 the rest we have two yaponchika 4 5 for them 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.000
 respectively the cases are prepared both 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.440
 iPhone wrapped in film 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.320
 protective front and rear but here 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.190
 there is a nuance that the films are different 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.789
 that is, if 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.309
 iPhone is pasted over with a thin film 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.980
 no problems should arise 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.670
 films now have thicker punches 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.520
 protective 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.039
 there may be problems because 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.129
 the cases actually 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:04.129
 produced millimeter to millimeter and so 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:12.479
 iphone case puts on very simple 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.479
 the only key movement is the block 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:21.420
 Button controls need to be served first 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.990
 case in the hole of the case 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:29.939
 and then snap the dad across 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:34.040
 plane look what happened f he 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:38.210
 running doesn't swear the same with 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:41.600
 iphone fourth movement key this 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.460
 pushbutton unit is fed into the hole 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.560
 cover 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:54.000
 then snaps the characteristic look 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:58.120
 iphone works all right iphone 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:05.080
 everything works fine 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:08.200
 means if necessary, remove the cover as 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:13.630
 say the military in reverse order 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.360
 there is a far edge of the phone which we 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.090
 snap the last turn removed 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.920
 first of all from the bottom where the button 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:27.060
 home 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:34.180
 a little nail picked up removed 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:36.960
 the phone is working does not swear at all 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.960
 good bye
