00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
can you see the ball just pumping over

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.050 
can you see the ball just pumping over
the<00:00:23.859> clot<00:00:24.100> and<00:00:24.340> just<00:00:24.670> moving<00:00:25.000> on<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:26.410> the<00:00:26.529> top

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the clot and just moving on to the top

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.200 
the clot and just moving on to the top
and<00:00:28.060> the<00:00:28.150> clot<00:00:28.359> reacts<00:00:28.869> to<00:00:29.289> the<00:00:29.880> shape<00:00:30.880> of<00:00:30.910> the

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
and the clot reacts to the shape of the

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.250 
and the clot reacts to the shape of the
clot<00:00:34.440> okay<00:00:35.440> you<00:00:35.500> can<00:00:35.710> see<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:35.980> but<00:00:36.790> just<00:00:37.260> pump

okay<00:03:28.470> I'm<00:03:29.470> just<00:03:29.680> going<00:03:29.889> to<00:03:29.980> head<00:03:30.220> out<00:03:30.280> field

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
okay I'm just going to head out field

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.770 
okay I'm just going to head out field
I<00:03:33.630> feel<00:03:34.630> okay

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.270 

just<00:03:38.780> change<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.230> magnitude<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:41.500> some<00:03:42.500> 200

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
just change the magnitude to some 200

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.900 
just change the magnitude to some 200
that's<00:03:43.580> it<00:03:43.790> now<00:03:44.569> play<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:45.019> video<00:03:45.550> you<00:03:46.550> can<00:03:46.580> see

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
that's it now play the video you can see

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.080 
that's it now play the video you can see
the<00:03:47.180> clot<00:03:47.900> just<00:03:48.379> gets<00:03:48.819> over<00:03:50.920> riced<00:03:52.090> because

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
the clot just gets over riced because

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.339 
the clot just gets over riced because
after<00:03:53.540> magnitude

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
after magnitude

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.920 
after magnitude
they<00:03:55.010> are<00:03:55.250> just<00:03:55.700> I'm<00:03:55.880> going<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.209> stop<00:03:56.480> this<00:03:56.660> and

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
they are just I'm going to stop this and

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.160 
they are just I'm going to stop this and
just<00:03:57.290> make<00:03:58.250> this<00:03:58.430> below<00:03:58.730> 50<00:03:59.269> okay<00:03:59.690> fine

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
just make this below 50 okay fine

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.800 
just make this below 50 okay fine
now<00:04:00.860> play<00:04:01.099> this<00:04:01.160> when<00:04:01.790> you<00:04:01.880> see<00:04:02.090> it<00:04:02.150> is<00:04:02.330> that

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
now play this when you see it is that

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.020 
now play this when you see it is that
loud<00:04:02.989> is<00:04:03.170> being<00:04:03.410> raised<00:04:03.680> but<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.489> ball<00:04:04.640> bead

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
loud is being raised but the ball bead

you<00:04:29.920> can<00:04:30.070> see<00:04:30.340> here<00:04:31.000> some<00:04:32.100> sharper<00:04:33.100> edges<00:04:33.460> why

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
you can see here some sharper edges why

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.030 
you can see here some sharper edges why
we<00:04:34.030> get<00:04:34.240> these<00:04:34.360> because<00:04:34.840> have<00:04:36.000> given<00:04:37.000> to<00:04:37.150> 5050

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
we get these because have given to 5050

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.150 
we get these because have given to 5050
