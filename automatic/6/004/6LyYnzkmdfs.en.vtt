00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
hey guys it's been a while since we took

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.610 
hey guys it's been a while since we took
a<00:00:02.220> look<00:00:02.370> at<00:00:02.580> Plan<00:00:02.850> C<00:00:03.149> in<00:00:03.330> Pocket<00:00:03.720> infinity<00:00:04.200> but

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
a look at Plan C in Pocket infinity but

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.530 
a look at Plan C in Pocket infinity but
today<00:00:04.859> I<00:00:04.890> would<00:00:05.279> like<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.520> finally<00:00:05.940> do<00:00:06.330> their

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
today I would like to finally do their

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.720 
today I would like to finally do their
comparison<00:00:07.200> I<00:00:07.379> know<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:07.830> gave<00:00:07.950> scores<00:00:08.370> for<00:00:08.610> each

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
comparison I know I gave scores for each

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.310 
comparison I know I gave scores for each
weapon<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:09.210> my<00:00:09.330> reviews<00:00:09.719> but<00:00:09.960> in<00:00:10.050> this<00:00:10.139> video

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
weapon in my reviews but in this video

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.900 
weapon in my reviews but in this video
we'll<00:00:10.620> talk<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.800> little<00:00:11.160> bit<00:00:11.309> more<00:00:11.490> about<00:00:11.639> why

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
we'll talk a little bit more about why

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.419 
we'll talk a little bit more about why
those<00:00:12.179> scores<00:00:12.570> were<00:00:12.780> given<00:00:13.200> first<00:00:13.889> let's<00:00:14.280> talk

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
those scores were given first let's talk

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.910 
those scores were given first let's talk
about<00:00:14.490> PvE<00:00:15.059> as<00:00:15.420> usual<00:00:16.170> if<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.379> need<00:00:16.680> Ark

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
about PvE as usual if you need Ark

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.260 
about PvE as usual if you need Ark
damage<00:00:17.340> or<00:00:17.490> you're<00:00:17.640> doing<00:00:17.850> something<00:00:18.090> with

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
damage or you're doing something with

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.790 
damage or you're doing something with
Ark<00:00:18.539> burn<00:00:18.779> you're<00:00:19.109> probably<00:00:19.380> going<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.740> use

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
Ark burn you're probably going to use

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.250 
Ark burn you're probably going to use
Plan<00:00:20.189> C<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.670> if<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.150> need<00:00:21.330> solar<00:00:21.660> damage<00:00:21.960> or

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
Plan C and if you need solar damage or

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.630 
Plan C and if you need solar damage or
you're<00:00:22.380> going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.769> do<00:00:22.890> something<00:00:23.130> with<00:00:23.369> solar

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
you're going to do something with solar

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.880 
you're going to do something with solar
burn<00:00:23.939> you're<00:00:24.390> going<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.660> use<00:00:24.779> Pocket<00:00:25.230> infinity

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
burn you're going to use Pocket infinity

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.000 
burn you're going to use Pocket infinity
maybe<00:00:26.660> Pocket<00:00:27.660> infinities<00:00:28.109> damage<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.769> higher

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
maybe Pocket infinities damage is higher

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.620 
maybe Pocket infinities damage is higher
than<00:00:29.250> planned<00:00:29.550> seas<00:00:29.820> but<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.240> takes<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.510> little

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
than planned seas but it takes a little

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.139 
than planned seas but it takes a little
bit<00:00:30.750> longer<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.260> fire<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.830> low<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.700> mid<00:00:32.880> tier

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
bit longer to fire on low and mid tier

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.000 
bit longer to fire on low and mid tier
enemies<00:00:33.630> you're<00:00:33.870> going<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.230> pretty<00:00:34.500> much<00:00:34.680> kill

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
enemies you're going to pretty much kill

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.130 
enemies you're going to pretty much kill
them<00:00:35.190> outright<00:00:35.370> with<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> single<00:00:36.570> burst<00:00:36.780> but

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
them outright with a single burst but

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.780 
them outright with a single burst but
you<00:00:37.260> really<00:00:37.649> shouldn't<00:00:37.950> be<00:00:38.070> using<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.489> fusion

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
you really shouldn't be using a fusion

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.430 
you really shouldn't be using a fusion
rifle<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.180> those<00:00:39.360> kinds<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.750> enemies<00:00:39.899> anyway

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
rifle on those kinds of enemies anyway

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.440 
rifle on those kinds of enemies anyway
you<00:00:40.860> should<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.100> using<00:00:41.399> them<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.760> shielded

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
you should be using them on shielded

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.119 
you should be using them on shielded
enemies<00:00:42.780> or<00:00:42.989> enemies<00:00:43.379> with<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> lot<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.800> health

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
enemies or enemies with a lot of health

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.310 
enemies or enemies with a lot of health
so<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.670> don't<00:00:44.940> waste<00:00:45.180> any<00:00:45.450> damage<00:00:45.930> or<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.289> a

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
so you don't waste any damage or have a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.740 
so you don't waste any damage or have a
lot<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.680> overkill<00:00:47.120> there<00:00:48.120> aren't<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.450> huge

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
lot of overkill there aren't a huge

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.360 
lot of overkill there aren't a huge
amount<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.140> enemies<00:00:49.469> with<00:00:49.649> high<00:00:49.829> health<00:00:50.129> with

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
no shields though and any that there are

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.930 
no shields though and any that there are
you're<00:00:52.800> probably<00:00:53.250> going<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.550> want<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.789> take

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
you're probably going to want to take

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.200 
you're probably going to want to take
them<00:00:54.120> out<00:00:54.239> from<00:00:54.510> afar<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.079> endgame<00:00:55.620> PvE<00:00:56.039> Plan<00:00:56.940> C

them out from afar in endgame PvE Plan C

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.720 
them out from afar in endgame PvE Plan C
is<00:00:57.360> low<00:00:57.780> risk<00:00:58.170> while<00:00:58.739> Pocket<00:00:59.160> infinity<00:00:59.640> is

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
is low risk while Pocket infinity is

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.180 
is low risk while Pocket infinity is
higher<00:01:00.030> risk<00:01:00.420> since<00:01:01.050> Plan<00:01:01.350> C<00:01:01.649> has<00:01:01.920> better

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
higher risk since Plan C has better

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.700 
higher risk since Plan C has better

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
stability with fusion rifles in general

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.830 
stability with fusion rifles in general
you<00:01:04.890> don't<00:01:05.129> want<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.549> be<00:01:05.670> wasting<00:01:05.850> shots<00:01:06.390> you

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
you don't want to be wasting shots you

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.480 
you don't want to be wasting shots you
can<00:01:07.020> even<00:01:07.170> think<00:01:07.500> about<00:01:07.680> using<00:01:08.100> pocket

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
can even think about using pocket

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.730 
can even think about using pocket
infinity<00:01:09.119> as<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> fusion<00:01:09.570> rifle<00:01:09.780> if<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.439> don't

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
infinity as a fusion rifle if you don't

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.649 
infinity as a fusion rifle if you don't
take<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.310> stability<00:01:11.850> upgrades<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.390> might<00:01:12.540> as

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
take the stability upgrades you might as

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.120 
take the stability upgrades you might as
well<00:01:12.780> equip<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.140> shotgun<00:01:13.409> at<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.860> point

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
well equip a shotgun at that point

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.920 
well equip a shotgun at that point
because<00:01:14.490> without<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.090> stability<00:01:15.570> upgrades

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
because without the stability upgrades

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.200 
because without the stability upgrades
the<00:01:16.350> thing<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.770> terrible<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.790> really

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the thing is terrible and is really

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.359 
the thing is terrible and is really
really<00:01:18.630> difficult<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.170> control<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.740> fact

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
really difficult to control in fact

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.160 
really difficult to control in fact
let's<00:01:20.909> compare<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.420> stability<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:21.990> both

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
let's compare the stability of both

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.890 
let's compare the stability of both
weapons<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.729> see<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.119> with<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.600> full

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
weapons you can see that with the full

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.870 
weapons you can see that with the full
stability<00:01:25.439> upgrades<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:25.920> Pocket<00:01:26.280> infinity

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
stability upgrades on Pocket infinity

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.270 
stability upgrades on Pocket infinity
it<00:01:26.939> matches<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.720> stability<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.409> Plan<00:01:28.710> C<00:01:29.040> with

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
it matches the stability of Plan C with

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.149 
it matches the stability of Plan C with
only<00:01:29.460> one<00:01:29.909> stability<00:01:30.540> upgrade<00:01:30.960> Plan<00:01:31.680> C<00:01:31.920> can

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
only one stability upgrade Plan C can

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.399 
only one stability upgrade Plan C can
get<00:01:32.280> even<00:01:32.549> more<00:01:33.060> stable<00:01:33.390> which<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:33.990> ideal<00:01:34.380> for

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
get even more stable which is ideal for

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.640

the nightfall I would give more

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:07.009 
reason why people liked pocket infinity

so<00:04:07.220> much<00:04:07.519> is<00:04:07.759> because<00:04:07.970> used<00:04:08.659> to<00:04:08.780> be<00:04:08.900> able<00:04:09.139> to

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:09.229 
so much is because used to be able to

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:10.990 
so much is because used to be able to
upgrade<00:04:09.439> it<00:04:09.739> to<00:04:09.769> eight<00:04:10.129> shots<00:04:10.699> in<00:04:10.909> the

insanely<00:04:13.759> high<00:04:14.180> burst<00:04:14.479> in<00:04:14.689> PvE<00:04:14.989> pocket

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:15.949 
insanely high burst in PvE pocket

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:17.649 
insanely high burst in PvE pocket
infinity<00:04:16.310> had<00:04:16.459> a<00:04:16.489> small<00:04:16.880> place<00:04:17.150> in<00:04:17.180> that<00:04:17.449> meta

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:17.659 
infinity had a small place in that meta

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.180 
infinity had a small place in that meta
game<00:04:17.900> when<00:04:18.109> it<00:04:18.199> could<00:04:18.320> get<00:04:18.470> that<00:04:18.650> upgrade<00:04:18.859> to

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
game when it could get that upgrade to

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.189 
game when it could get that upgrade to
eight<00:04:19.430> full<00:04:19.880> auto<00:04:20.150> shots<00:04:20.509> in<00:04:20.659> the<00:04:20.750> magazine

but without that upgrade around anymore

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.390 
but without that upgrade around anymore
the<00:04:23.599> weapon<00:04:23.930> becomes<00:04:24.200> more<00:04:24.529> of<00:04:24.620> a<00:04:24.710> chore<00:04:25.099> to

fusion rifle at all pocket infinity is

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.110 
fusion rifle at all pocket infinity is
just<00:04:39.139> too<00:04:39.379> much<00:04:39.530> of<00:04:39.560> an<00:04:39.770> all-in<00:04:40.370> weapon<00:04:40.789> for<00:04:41.000> me

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
just too much of an all-in weapon for me

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.480 
just too much of an all-in weapon for me
too<00:04:41.240> like<00:04:41.389> Plan<00:04:42.080> C<00:04:42.259> is<00:04:42.289> just<00:04:42.620> easier<00:04:43.009> to<00:04:43.069> handle

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
too like Plan C is just easier to handle

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.029 
too like Plan C is just easier to handle
and<00:04:43.639> it<00:04:43.729> gets<00:04:43.939> the<00:04:44.120> job<00:04:44.150> done<00:04:44.389> much<00:04:45.349> safer<00:04:45.889> and

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
and it gets the job done much safer and

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:48.999 
and it gets the job done much safer and

more reliably once again pocket infinity
is<00:04:49.129> not<00:04:49.340> a<00:04:49.370> bad<00:04:49.639> weapon<00:04:50.150> I<00:04:50.180> just<00:04:50.509> think<00:04:50.689> Plan<00:04:50.960> C

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 
is not a bad weapon I just think Plan C

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.129 
is not a bad weapon I just think Plan C
slightly<00:04:51.889> outperforms<00:04:52.550> it<00:04:52.699> overall<00:04:53.180> anyway

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
slightly outperforms it overall anyway
