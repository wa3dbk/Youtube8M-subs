00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.519
 can be the public accountant lorenzo 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.440
 Hernandez today I will present a barbecue 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.470
 which is a typical barbecue of the lands of 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.470
 my parents 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.970
 it is a very rich packaging apart that is 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.730
 a very good community for summer 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:30.650
 my mother in the kitchen because she taught me 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.840
 do this state observing this and then 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.550
 there is a final touch that gives her 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.230
 difference from the heavier, not dry 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.780
 is a dish that I know that all the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.550
 world will be much and more right now 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.220
 in summer you do not decide it because you take 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.860
 culminated with snatch some can 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.050
 be beer now let's start 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.050
 to make the roast more to tehco 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.390
 the ingredients to make the meat are 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.269
 first of all we have the garlic so that 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.189
 flavor the meat pleasantly 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.430
 We are the 2 garlic cloves are 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:15.110
 four bay leaves and half onion and 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:18.050
 little salt I use garlic salt 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.410
 sea ​​salt with chopped sea salt 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.770
 We also use the rocket or worm 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.770
 beef 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.690
 we use about a kilo for 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.640
 Sew it up we do not have to do it with everyone 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.470
 the ingredients approximately two 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.100
 to three hours until it is well cooked 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.100
 The worm 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.119
 a saucer of 45 people we were 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.789
 four potatoes crossing these would be 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.880
 four carrots and four pumpkins 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.840
 to make the sauce from the waves and that is 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.320
 the base of the roast we practically use 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.710
 tomato four tomatoes and the juice where 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.810
 we cook the oregano meat to taste and 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.759
 we also use chicken consommé for 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.759
 as a touch to taste 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:14.240
 but first we started this we started 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.340
 for making the sauce 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.710
 that must lead them to the massacre as 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.440
 for that we use 44 tomatoes 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.990
 that we previously cut them so that 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.380
 easier to be diluted 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.410
 after explaining something I made you 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.960
 same more this we also put salt to 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.350
 taste to make the sauce we are going to 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.170
 make it in the blender but in the type 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:43.070
 My mom is because since the time of 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.400
 the 30 40 then there were no blenders 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:49.280
 modern then the people in sinaloa what 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.310
 I did this with the hot broth 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.330
 tomatoes and treated them by hand 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.560
 which then suffered the good 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.200
 burns that I also suffered 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.330
 because it was football do not think my mom was 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.610
 so I derail the tomato inside 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.980
 juice and that it burns much the 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.390
 hands are not the blender because 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.840
 we are in modern times and we want 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.540
 avoid fatigue let's leave it let's 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.090
 let it boil with the city that 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.670
 the shell can be easily removed and 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.380
 then pass it to the blender with a 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.920
 little juice is made to the 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.590
 sauce and once it is liquefied it becomes 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.440
 to put in the juice of the meat and here 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.120
 add a little oregano then 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.750
 let's also put him 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.700
 the chicken consommé to let him leave his 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.220
 flavor there is also what you consume from 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.010
 res if they get it then it is better to try 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.170
 the consumption of beef that chicken and we 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.239
 we wait until the end to put it on 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.090
 that then to all the aromas to the tecos with 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.310
 the purpose of the vegetable that we are going 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.920
 to put the roast does not stay hard 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:57.799
 hard we put it to boil water 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.590
 moment to soften and is not 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.900
 be unpleasant at the moment of 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.519
 chew it to this water also you 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.680
 we put a little apple cider vinegar 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:10.190
 in order that it takes flavor is 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.760
 something that we hope then we put the 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.760
 pumpkin 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.600
 once the five minutes passed 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.910
 those of us who are stove and with a colander 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.760
 with a colander we transfer it to another 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:29.180
 container so that the broth this juice 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.330
 This is then thrown to prepare the 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.540
 meat we are going to stir the potatoes that already 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.250
 previously we cut 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.100
 the meat that is also previously 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.080
 cut into pieces more or less than a 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.240
 centimeter each 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.620
 we spent a little bit olive oil is what 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.139
 very special about this dish is that 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.960
 every revolution must be cooked by 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.550
 separated not all in one fell swoop because 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.419
 then it would not be the texture that 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:01.960
 must have then the laborious of this 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:04.990
 dish is that if it is cooked by 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.750
 portion we throw the meat first because 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.030
 this takes longer to cook than 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.770
 we take more or less calculating the 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:18.300
 portion that must be for a dish 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:22.190
 since we see that the meat is cooked 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.190
 we also take a portion of potatoes 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.990
 remember that with you is a salt the 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.180
 papa removes the salty food 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.780
 this is the vital touch that my 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:35.330
 mom nobody puts you sports if they put you 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.699
 one or two tablespoons of juice from the 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.030
 jalapeño peppers in order to 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:43.370
 catch a different flavor than others 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.360
 grilled mazatlecos because this touch is 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.949
 by juanita hernández fog 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.949
 chub mace 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:59.359
 since it is well cooked 

00:05:56.989 --> 00:06:01.569
 meat with cola dad puts himself served 

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.569
 in a dish 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:10.540
 more or less a portion 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.540
 make it nice 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.830
 and once the portion is followed it is already 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.099
 they start to put all the 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.409
 ingredients since we have made 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.930
 the meat and put on a saucer we are going to 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:25.180
 proceed to put some vegetables 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.420
 so first we start with the 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:32.000
 lettuce 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.000
 this is served to taste also 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.200
 then we proceed to put the vegetable the 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.720
 vegetable also to taste and then therefore 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.750
 let's put the cucumber 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.750
 it's also to taste 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.670
 and then we put it to you if you like how 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.710
 people like the onion we put on 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:52.260
 Onion also to taste remember that 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:55.290
 the onion can be purple or it can be 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:58.050
 white the onion of sinaloa is purple 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.820
 my mom taught me to do it to me with 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.310
 White onion 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.590
 remember that the onion is very 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.750
 important to be bad with lemon the 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.600
 lemon there I put it in the recipe should 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:12.060
 be the American yellow or the one of colima 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.270
 that has no seed and not with the simón 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.669
 of colima because the lemon of colima is 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.240
 oxidizes and gives a sour taste to the 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:22.240
 food 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:26.080
 and then you put the sauce that is the part 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:28.530
 important of this dish it gets well 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.530
 hot 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:37.160
 finally let's put the touch that is 

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.160
 the cheese to quote that is also at 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.080
 good taste this is my dish I hope 

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.200
 Enjoy them as I will enjoy it 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.380
 right now remember the saucer bears 

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.760
 a lot of time but when eating it 

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.050
 they forget how long you 

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.050
 they spent in power 

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:59.260
 my name is lorenzo hernandez it seems 

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:03.460

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.480
 very positive very rich health 

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.140
