monster on the field so this card it has
two<00:01:04.140> real<00:01:04.379> good<00:01:04.619> ways<00:01:04.970> that<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.420> win<00:01:06.570> with

two real good ways that you can win with

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.380 
two real good ways that you can win with
it<00:01:06.900> one<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:08.000> obviously<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.119> they<00:01:09.210> don't<00:01:09.330> have

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
it one is obviously if they don't have

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.390 
it one is obviously if they don't have
the<00:01:09.540> defense<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.500> 8000<00:01:11.159> point

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the defense you can have a 8000 point

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.330 
the defense you can have a 8000 point
attacking<00:01:12.090> monster<00:01:12.570> or<00:01:13.100> if<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.250> another

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
attacking monster or if you have another

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.920 
attacking monster or if you have another
monster<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.060> addition<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> wing<00:01:15.780> and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
monster in addition to the wing and

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.359 
monster in addition to the wing and
dragon<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.409> could<00:01:16.560> clear<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> field<00:01:17.070> pretty

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
dragon you could clear the field pretty

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.070 
dragon you could clear the field pretty
easily<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:18.030> by<00:01:18.060> paying<00:01:18.270> some<00:01:18.570> life<00:01:18.720> points

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
easily just by paying some life points

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.130 
easily just by paying some life points
so<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> decent<00:01:21.150> card<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.720> could<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:21.960> tough

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
so it's a decent card it could be tough

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.440 
so it's a decent card it could be tough
to<00:01:22.229> get<00:01:22.350> out<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.799> it's<00:01:23.040> still<00:01:23.250> very<00:01:23.490> risky<00:01:23.970> but

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
to get out and it's still very risky but

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.390 
to get out and it's still very risky but
talk<00:01:25.140> about<00:01:25.290> how<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.409> restavek<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.189> help

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
talk about how the restavek can help

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.990

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
bait doll is a really cool card I like

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.180 
bait doll is a really cool card I like
this<00:04:47.620> one<00:04:47.680> so<00:04:49.169> basically<00:04:50.169> you<00:04:50.560> choose<00:04:50.980> one<00:04:51.130> of

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
this one so basically you choose one of

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.180 
this one so basically you choose one of
their<00:04:51.340> face<00:04:51.520> down<00:04:51.760> magic<00:04:52.120> or<00:04:52.240> trap<00:04:52.270> cards<00:04:52.840> and

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
their face down magic or trap cards and

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.010 
their face down magic or trap cards and
if<00:04:54.190> it's<00:04:54.550> a<00:04:54.610> trap<00:04:54.790> card<00:04:55.180> but<00:04:55.450> the<00:04:55.540> timing<00:04:55.780> is

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
if it's a trap card but the timing is

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.990 
if it's a trap card but the timing is
wrong<00:04:56.230> like<00:04:56.830> its<00:04:56.980> mirror<00:04:57.190> force<00:04:57.520> and<00:04:57.880> you

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
wrong like its mirror force and you

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.570 
wrong like its mirror force and you
aren't<00:04:58.510> attacking<00:04:58.780> it<00:04:59.410> gets<00:04:59.620> destroyed<00:05:01.320> so

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
aren't attacking it gets destroyed so

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.280 
aren't attacking it gets destroyed so
although<00:05:03.580> if<00:05:03.760> the<00:05:03.880> activation<00:05:04.419> is<00:05:04.570> incorrect

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
although if the activation is incorrect

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.200 
although if the activation is incorrect
their<00:05:05.470> trap<00:05:05.740> gets<00:05:05.889> activated<00:05:06.280> but<00:05:06.580> possibly

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
their trap gets activated but possibly

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.830 
their trap gets activated but possibly
they<00:05:07.389> don't<00:05:07.510> want<00:05:07.660> to<00:05:07.780> be<00:05:07.870> activated<00:05:08.410> so<00:05:09.100> and

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
they don't want to be activated so and

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.570 
they don't want to be activated so and
and<00:05:10.840> also<00:05:11.080> neat<00:05:11.470> thing<00:05:11.620> about<00:05:11.680> this<00:05:11.950> is<00:05:12.160> it

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
and also neat thing about this is it

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.890 
and also neat thing about this is it
doesn't<00:05:12.610> get<00:05:12.910> destroyed<00:05:13.060> it<00:05:13.510> gets<00:05:13.630> sent<00:05:13.870> to

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
doesn't get destroyed it gets sent to
