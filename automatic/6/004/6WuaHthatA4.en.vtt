going to shoot you or hit you so you

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.250 
going to shoot you or hit you so you

don't want to stay too long right and he

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
your regular separate on everything you

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.340 
your regular separate on everything you
keep<00:03:44.340> spamming<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.239> if<00:03:45.840> it's<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.050> decent

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
keep spamming it and if it's a decent

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.810 
keep spamming it and if it's a decent
engineer<00:03:46.709> he<00:03:46.830> probably<00:03:47.070> will<00:03:47.310> smack<00:03:47.640> you

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
engineer he probably will smack you

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.690 
engineer he probably will smack you
first<00:03:48.180> before<00:03:48.480> doing<00:03:48.690> anything<00:03:49.019> else<00:03:49.290> and

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
first before doing anything else and

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.860 
first before doing anything else and
then<00:03:50.700> he<00:03:50.820> has<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:51.000> repair<00:03:51.269> a<00:03:51.300> little<00:03:51.600> bit<00:03:51.690> more

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
then he has to repair a little bit more

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.229 
then he has to repair a little bit more
but<00:03:52.050> everything<00:03:52.560> still<00:03:53.100> stays<00:03:53.550> and<00:03:53.730> perhaps

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
but everything still stays and perhaps

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.000 
but everything still stays and perhaps
he<00:03:54.480> loses<00:03:54.750> one<00:03:54.989> building<00:03:55.709> by<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:55.830> way<00:03:55.980> i

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
he loses one building by the way i

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.740 
he loses one building by the way i
didn't<00:03:56.370> cut<00:03:56.580> this<00:03:56.790> def<00:03:57.030> comment<00:03:57.360> out<00:03:57.450> because

didn't cut this def comment out because
i<00:03:57.780> did<00:03:58.200> get<00:03:58.440> both<00:03:58.709> buildings<00:03:59.100> with<00:03:59.310> my<00:03:59.430> red

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
i did get both buildings with my red

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.340 
i did get both buildings with my red
tape<00:03:59.760> recorder<00:04:00.570> i<00:04:00.600> just<00:04:00.780> wanted<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.019> show<00:04:01.200> that

off<00:04:01.530> i<00:04:01.769> have<00:04:02.700> no<00:04:02.880> clue<00:04:03.090> why<00:04:03.299> I<00:04:03.510> did<00:04:03.750> that<00:04:03.780> but

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
off i have no clue why I did that but

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.070 
off i have no clue why I did that but
there<00:04:04.380> you<00:04:04.440> go<00:04:04.580> so<00:04:05.580> he<00:04:05.700> loses<00:04:06.060> potentially<00:04:06.840> one

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
there you go so he loses potentially one

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.199 
there you go so he loses potentially one
building<00:04:07.560> let's<00:04:08.010> say<00:04:08.340> for<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.790> sake<00:04:09.000> of<00:04:09.060> this

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
building let's say for the sake of this

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.259 
building let's say for the sake of this
argument<00:04:09.360> he<00:04:09.720> loses<00:04:10.080> the<00:04:10.580> dispenser<00:04:11.580> which<00:04:12.239> is

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
argument he loses the dispenser which is

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.370 
argument he loses the dispenser which is
about<00:04:12.660> 500<00:04:13.470> medal<00:04:13.769> if<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.430> go<00:04:15.360> from<00:04:15.600> placing

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
about 500 medal if you go from placing

about 500 medal if you go from placing
it<00:04:16.530> as<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:16.799> new<00:04:17.220> dispense<00:04:17.609> as<00:04:17.760> well<00:04:17.940> as

that<00:04:22.530> you<00:04:22.919> have<00:04:23.040> to<00:04:23.130> repair<00:04:23.400> his<00:04:23.520> level<00:04:23.760> three

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
that you have to repair his level three

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.219 
that you have to repair his level three
century<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.330> his<00:04:24.419> teleportal<00:04:24.900> let's<00:04:25.080> say<00:04:25.200> for

century and his teleportal let's say for

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.159 
century and his teleportal let's say for
the<00:04:25.380> sake<00:04:25.530> of<00:04:25.590> this<00:04:25.770> argument<00:04:25.890> he<00:04:26.790> loses<00:04:27.270> 600

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
the sake of this argument he loses 600

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.340 
the sake of this argument he loses 600
medal<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:28.770> that<00:04:28.919> entire<00:04:29.630> example<00:04:30.630> where<00:04:30.990> the

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
medal and that entire example where the

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.409 
medal and that entire example where the
spy<00:04:31.560> sticks<00:04:31.890> around<00:04:32.010> a<00:04:32.220> bit<00:04:32.370> longer<00:04:32.400> gets<00:04:33.300> a

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
spy sticks around a bit longer gets a

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.750 
spy sticks around a bit longer gets a
building<00:04:33.750> destroyed<00:04:34.070> but<00:04:35.070> has<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.490> get<00:04:35.640> out

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
building destroyed but has to get out

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.100 
building destroyed but has to get out
because<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.180> engineers<00:04:36.510> that's<00:04:36.690> stupid<00:04:36.990> and

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
because the engineers that's stupid and

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.480 
because the engineers that's stupid and
you<00:04:37.200> will<00:04:37.320> smack<00:04:37.590> you<00:04:37.710> in<00:04:37.860> your<00:04:37.890> face<00:04:38.130> all

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
you will smack you in your face all

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.310 
you will smack you in your face all
right<00:04:39.180> now<00:04:39.330> let's<00:04:39.539> go<00:04:39.720> to<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:39.960> red<00:04:40.140> tape

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
right now let's go to the red tape

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.760 
right now let's go to the red tape
record

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
record

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.320 
record
and<00:04:41.009> this<00:04:41.699> is<00:04:41.819> where<00:04:41.970> it<00:04:42.090> gets<00:04:42.120> very

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
and this is where it gets very

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.969 
and this is where it gets very
interesting<00:04:42.930> and<00:04:42.990> it<00:04:43.139> still<00:04:43.349> shows<00:04:43.650> why<00:04:43.919> this

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
interesting and it still shows why this

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.249 
interesting and it still shows why this
weapon<00:04:44.460> is<00:04:44.490> highly<00:04:44.879> overpowered<00:04:45.419> let's<00:04:46.080> say

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
weapon is highly overpowered let's say

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.320 
weapon is highly overpowered let's say
if<00:04:46.560> we<00:04:46.770> go<00:04:46.889> into<00:04:47.069> the<00:04:47.250> first<00:04:47.490> example<00:04:47.970> but<00:04:48.150> then

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
if we go into the first example but then

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.570 
if we go into the first example but then
use<00:04:48.539> this<00:04:48.690> with<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:49.080> middle<00:04:49.710> ooh<00:04:49.800> separ<00:04:50.190> you

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
use this with the middle ooh separ you

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.029 
use this with the middle ooh separ you
go<00:04:50.759> in<00:04:50.940> as<00:04:51.090> a<00:04:51.120> spy<00:04:51.810> you<00:04:52.169> place<00:04:52.620> your<00:04:52.830> red<00:04:53.009> tape

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
go in as a spy you place your red tape

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.129 
go in as a spy you place your red tape
recorders<00:04:53.669> down<00:04:53.879> on<00:04:54.150> every<00:04:54.599> building<00:04:54.930> and

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
recorders down on every building and

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.830 
recorders down on every building and
they<00:04:55.409> start<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.740> downgrade<00:04:55.979> all<00:04:56.819> right<00:04:57.240> the

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
they start to downgrade all right the

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.710 
they start to downgrade all right the
engineer<00:04:58.409> directly<00:04:59.280> starts<00:04:59.699> hitting<00:05:00.599> them

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
engineer directly starts hitting them

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.960 
engineer directly starts hitting them
off<00:05:00.900> of<00:05:00.930> course<00:05:01.379> but<00:05:01.740> things<00:05:02.430> already<00:05:02.699> have

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
off of course but things already have

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.600 
off of course but things already have
started<00:05:03.419> to<00:05:03.449> downgrade<00:05:03.720> and<00:05:04.550> if<00:05:05.550> that

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
started to downgrade and if that

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.450 
started to downgrade and if that
engineer<00:05:06.330> doesn't<00:05:06.629> react<00:05:07.460> instantaneously

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
engineer doesn't react instantaneously

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.029 
engineer doesn't react instantaneously
he<00:05:09.389> doesn't<00:05:09.690> have<00:05:09.750> to<00:05:09.930> repair<00:05:10.349> but<00:05:10.800> it<00:05:10.919> has<00:05:11.009> to

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
he doesn't have to repair but it has to

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.600 
he doesn't have to repair but it has to
rebuild<00:05:11.759> or<00:05:12.000> we<00:05:12.270> upgrade<00:05:13.050> his<00:05:13.259> buildings<00:05:13.800> so

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
rebuild or we upgrade his buildings so

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.559 
rebuild or we upgrade his buildings so
let's<00:05:14.789> just<00:05:14.940> say<00:05:15.030> they<00:05:15.090> all<00:05:15.270> have<00:05:15.419> been

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:15.569 
let's just say they all have been

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:17.450 
let's just say they all have been
downgraded<00:05:15.720> to<00:05:16.080> level<00:05:16.380> two<00:05:16.560> which<00:05:17.039> means<00:05:17.340> it

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
downgraded to level two which means it

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.450 
downgraded to level two which means it
has<00:05:17.490> to<00:05:17.729> spend<00:05:18.030> 600<00:05:18.900> metal<00:05:19.409> to<00:05:19.919> get<00:05:20.069> everything

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
has to spend 600 metal to get everything

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.510 
has to spend 600 metal to get everything
up<00:05:20.819> to<00:05:20.970> level<00:05:21.240> 3<00:05:21.690> again<00:05:21.990> and<00:05:22.280> that's<00:05:23.280> basically

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
up to level 3 again and that's basically

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.520 
up to level 3 again and that's basically
just<00:05:23.940> a<00:05:24.060> spy<00:05:24.330> getting<00:05:24.870> out<00:05:25.020> you<00:05:25.229> know<00:05:25.319> just

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
just a spy getting out you know just

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.170 
just a spy getting out you know just
running<00:05:25.830> around<00:05:25.949> just<00:05:26.310> placing<00:05:26.849> and<00:05:26.970> getting

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
running around just placing and getting

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.749 
running around just placing and getting
out<00:05:27.270> again<00:05:27.569> 600<00:05:28.289> metal<00:05:28.530> gone<00:05:28.740> without<00:05:29.159> too

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
out again 600 metal gone without too

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.820 
out again 600 metal gone without too
much<00:05:29.880> of<00:05:30.030> an<00:05:30.150> effort<00:05:30.270> as<00:05:30.479> a<00:05:30.509> spy<00:05:30.840> now<00:05:31.530> if<00:05:31.680> that

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
much of an effort as a spy now if that

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.589 
much of an effort as a spy now if that
spy<00:05:32.069> stayed<00:05:32.370> on<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.729> little<00:05:32.969> bit<00:05:33.060> longer<00:05:33.330> and

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
spy stayed on a little bit longer and

nerf of the red tape recorder it's still
fairly<00:05:42.780> easy<00:05:43.139> to<00:05:43.289> actually<00:05:43.710> do<00:05:43.919> then<00:05:44.550> he<00:05:44.669> has

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
fairly easy to actually do then he has

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.649 
fairly easy to actually do then he has

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
to spend double the amount double so it

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:50.689

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.750 
competitive play but we'll have to see

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.590 
competitive play but we'll have to see
