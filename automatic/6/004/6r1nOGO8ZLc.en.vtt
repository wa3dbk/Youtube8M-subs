00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.040 
I was in a bit shocked that I got
eliminated<00:03:41.850> think<00:03:42.850> it<00:03:43.000> would<00:03:43.360> have<00:03:43.450> been<00:03:43.570> good

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
eliminated think it would have been good

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.950 
eliminated think it would have been good
to<00:03:44.380> maybe<00:03:44.920> go<00:03:45.130> a<00:03:45.160> bit<00:03:45.280> further<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:46.120> maybe<00:03:46.660> some

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
to maybe go a bit further and maybe some

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.170 
to maybe go a bit further and maybe some
of<00:03:47.020> the<00:03:47.080> shorter<00:03:47.380> girls<00:03:47.880> they<00:03:48.880> could<00:03:49.090> be

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
of the shorter girls they could be

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.950 
of the shorter girls they could be
earlier<00:03:49.330> I<00:03:49.750> was<00:03:50.110> quite<00:03:51.040> upset<00:03:51.330> when<00:03:52.330> I<00:03:52.600> not

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
earlier I was quite upset when I not

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.860 
earlier I was quite upset when I not
told<00:03:53.170> oh<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:54.760> I<00:03:54.790> was<00:03:55.000> gonna<00:03:55.150> be<00:03:55.270> eliminated

I'm not sure what I'm gonna be joining

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.440 
I'm not sure what I'm gonna be joining
with<00:03:57.790> myself<00:03:58.590> um<00:03:59.590> because<00:04:00.250> cordance<00:04:00.970> is<00:04:01.150> a<00:04:01.180> big

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
with myself um because cordance is a big

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.220 
with myself um because cordance is a big
issue<00:04:01.600> I<00:04:02.670> used<00:04:03.670> to<00:04:03.790> think<00:04:03.880> that<00:04:04.420> it<00:04:04.810> was<00:04:04.990> just

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
issue I used to think that it was just

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.080 
issue I used to think that it was just
Simone<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:05.860> ebony<00:04:06.490> that<00:04:06.640> were<00:04:06.730> really<00:04:06.940> in<00:04:07.030> the

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
Simone and ebony that were really in the

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.600 
Simone and ebony that were really in the
race<00:04:07.270> but<00:04:07.570> I've<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:08.080> add<00:04:08.200> Louise<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.370> that<00:04:09.490> now

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
race but I've to add Louise to that now

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.110 
race but I've to add Louise to that now
I<00:04:10.920> think's<00:04:11.920> mine<00:04:12.190> isn't<00:04:12.550> a<00:04:12.670> really<00:04:12.940> good

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
I think's mine isn't a really good

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:48.380 
I think's mine isn't a really good
chance<00:04:13.330> because<00:04:14.020> she<00:04:14.410> has<00:04:14.560> an<00:04:14.680> amazing<00:04:14.770> look

00:04:48.380 --> 00:05:05.570 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.639
