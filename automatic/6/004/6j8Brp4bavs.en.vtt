corals are sort of withdrawn and not
coming<00:00:11.370> out<00:00:11.580> there's<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.599> reason<00:00:12.990> for<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:14.660> one

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
was that if you recall from my prior

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.429 
was that if you recall from my prior
video<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.380> had<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:23.359> brass<00:00:24.359> valve<00:00:25.199> on<00:00:25.650> my<00:00:26.310> som

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
video I had this brass valve on my som

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.380 
video I had this brass valve on my som
intake<00:00:28.490> and<00:00:30.470> one<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> viewers<00:00:32.520> on<00:00:32.940> YouTube

correctly<00:00:34.079> pointed<00:00:35.070> out<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.700> is

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
correctly pointed out that that is

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.340 
correctly pointed out that that is
probably<00:00:36.270> not<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.480> good<00:00:36.660> thing<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:37.170> because

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
probably not a good thing to do because

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.490 
probably not a good thing to do because

were<00:00:49.890> all<00:00:50.010> kind<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.309> withdrawn<00:00:50.700> before<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.690> put

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
were all kind of withdrawn before I put

were all kind of withdrawn before I put
that<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.879> was<00:00:54.030> assuming<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.629> was<00:00:54.750> just

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
that on and I was assuming it was just

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.200 
that on and I was assuming it was just
because<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:55.920> messing<00:00:56.309> inside<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.030> tank

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
because I was messing inside of the tank

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.349 
because I was messing inside of the tank
putting<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.809> overflow<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.359> just

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
putting the overflow in and just

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.939 
putting the overflow in and just
generally<00:01:00.870> screwing<00:01:01.260> around<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> tank

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
generally screwing around with the tank

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.690 
generally screwing around with the tank
and<00:01:02.190> disturbing<00:01:03.030> everything<00:01:04.460> but<00:01:05.460> then<00:01:05.610> I

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
and disturbing everything but then I

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.770 
and disturbing everything but then I
started<00:01:06.060> reading<00:01:06.330> up<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:07.340> copper<00:01:08.340> in

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
started reading up on copper in

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.420 
started reading up on copper in
saltwater<00:01:09.780> tanks<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.650> got<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> little<00:01:11.189> freaked

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
saltwater tanks and got a little freaked

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.649 
saltwater tanks and got a little freaked
out<00:01:11.610> because<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.939> know<00:01:12.210> people<00:01:12.510> were<00:01:12.600> saying

took the took the valve off you know get
it<00:01:25.020> out<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> out<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.100> water<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
it out of the out of the water here and

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.840 
it out of the out of the water here and
this<00:01:27.450> morning<00:01:27.930> I've<00:01:28.110> got<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> new<00:01:28.680> PVC<00:01:29.100> valve<00:01:29.579> on

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
this morning I've got a new PVC valve on

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.920 
this morning I've got a new PVC valve on
there<00:01:31.430> but<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> other<00:01:33.420> things<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.900> I

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
there but one of the other things that I

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.249 
there but one of the other things that I
also<00:01:34.079> realized<00:01:34.740> yesterday<00:01:35.990> because<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.140> was

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
also realized yesterday because I was

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.200 
also realized yesterday because I was
thinking<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:38.189> know<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.880> corals

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
thinking that you know the the corals

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.410 
thinking that you know the the corals
were<00:01:39.270> pretty<00:01:39.479> withdrawn<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:41.390> before<00:01:42.390> I

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
were pretty withdrawn like this before I

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.510 
were pretty withdrawn like this before I
put<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.780> valve<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.189> double-check

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
put the valve in so just to double-check

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.550 
put the valve in so just to double-check
I<00:01:45.000> went<00:01:45.240> ahead<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.720> checked<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> salinity

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
I went ahead and I checked the salinity

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.300 
I went ahead and I checked the salinity
of<00:01:46.740> my<00:01:47.100> water<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.820> lo<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.270> behold<00:01:49.310> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
of my water and lo and behold the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.940 
of my water and lo and behold the
salinity<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:51.060> my<00:01:51.299> water<00:01:52.159> was<00:01:53.159> right<00:01:53.939> around

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
salinity on my water was right around

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.920 
salinity on my water was right around
one<00:01:55.950> point<00:01:56.219> zero<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:57.360> zero<00:01:57.979> way<00:01:58.979> low<00:01:59.930> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
one point zero to zero way low the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.800 
one point zero to zero way low the
reason<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.860> because<00:02:02.070> when<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:02.939> added

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
reason for that is because when I added

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.980 
reason for that is because when I added
water<00:02:04.290> into<00:02:04.920> my<00:02:04.950> some

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
water into my some

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.410 
water into my some
I<00:02:07.049> went<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.860> local<00:02:08.069> pet<00:02:08.520> store<00:02:08.819> or<00:02:09.090> local

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
I went to a local pet store or local

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.839 
I went to a local pet store or local
fish<00:02:10.319> shop<00:02:10.590> got<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.580> five<00:02:11.849> gallon<00:02:12.739> jug<00:02:13.739> of<00:02:14.010> salt

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
fish shop got a five gallon jug of salt

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.740 
fish shop got a five gallon jug of salt
water<00:02:15.800> but<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.730> fish<00:02:17.970> shop<00:02:18.239> but<00:02:18.540> they<00:02:18.690> were

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
water but the fish shop but they were

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.710

replumb there ro and salt water

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.650 
replumb there ro and salt water

distribution and apparently those two
got<00:02:28.250> mixed<00:02:29.250> together<00:02:29.810> at<00:02:30.810> some<00:02:31.110> point<00:02:31.310> so<00:02:32.310> the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
got mixed together at some point so the

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.880 
got mixed together at some point so the
salt<00:02:33.030> water<00:02:33.300> that<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.569> thought<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:34.140> bought<00:02:34.380> from

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
salt water that I thought I bought from

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.380 
salt water that I thought I bought from
the<00:02:35.099> fish<00:02:35.489> shop<00:02:35.840> was<00:02:36.840> actually<00:02:38.269> because<00:02:39.269> I

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
the fish shop was actually because I

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.910 
the fish shop was actually because I
still<00:02:39.600> have<00:02:39.780> someone<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.230> tested<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.709> was

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
still have someone I tested it was

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.539 
still have someone I tested it was
actually<00:02:41.370> down<00:02:41.580> here<00:02:41.640> at<00:02:42.209> about<00:02:43.340> sorry<00:02:44.340> for

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
the focus it was actually down here at

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.820 
the focus it was actually down here at
about<00:02:48.830> one<00:02:49.830> point<00:02:50.069> zero<00:02:50.370> one<00:02:51.120> eight<00:02:51.560> was<00:02:52.560> that

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
about one point zero one eight was that

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.140 
about one point zero one eight was that
what<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.130> bought<00:02:53.459> as<00:02:53.840> supposedly<00:02:54.840> salt<00:02:55.200> water

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
what I bought as supposedly salt water

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.630 
what I bought as supposedly salt water
so<00:02:57.170> what<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.200> did<00:02:58.350> was<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.709> ended<00:02:59.280> up<00:02:59.430> putting

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
pretty much all of the five gallons into

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.960 
pretty much all of the five gallons into
the<00:03:02.190> sump<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:03.660> top<00:03:03.840> everything<00:03:04.080> off<00:03:04.580> so<00:03:05.580> for

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
the sump to top everything off so for

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.570 
the sump to top everything off so for
about<00:03:06.180> six<00:03:06.569> hours<00:03:06.750> yesterday<00:03:07.290> my<00:03:07.799> tank<00:03:08.190> was

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
about six hours yesterday my tank was

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.259 
about six hours yesterday my tank was
running<00:03:09.120> at<00:03:10.370> low<00:03:11.370> salinity<00:03:12.000> at<00:03:12.209> about<00:03:13.910> 1.0<00:03:14.910> or

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
running at low salinity at about 1.0 or

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:21.020 
running at low salinity at about 1.0 or
sorry<00:03:16.140> one<00:03:16.350> point<00:03:16.620> zero<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.519> zero<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:20.030> that's

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
sorry one point zero to zero and that's

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.740 
sorry one point zero to zero and that's
why<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:22.350> corals<00:03:22.739> all<00:03:22.950> withdrew<00:03:23.750> basically

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
why the corals all withdrew basically

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.940 
why the corals all withdrew basically
they<00:03:24.930> got<00:03:25.079> almost<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.890> fresh<00:03:26.220> water<00:03:27.950> long-term

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
they got almost a fresh water long-term

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.530 
they got almost a fresh water long-term
dip<00:03:29.340> now<00:03:30.709> I<00:03:31.709> obviously<00:03:32.400> have<00:03:32.730> some<00:03:32.940> salt<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:33.510> I

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
dip now I obviously have some salt so I

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.780 
dip now I obviously have some salt so I
immediately<00:03:34.109> mixed<00:03:34.769> in<00:03:34.890> some<00:03:35.130> salt<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.609> got

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
immediately mixed in some salt and got

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.580 
immediately mixed in some salt and got
the<00:03:35.970> salinity<00:03:36.600> back<00:03:36.930> up<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.290> where<00:03:37.410> it<00:03:37.470> was

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
the salinity back up to where it was

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.420 
the salinity back up to where it was
supposed<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:38.010> be<00:03:38.250> but<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:40.650> corals<00:03:41.010> have<00:03:41.160> still

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
supposed to be but the corals have still

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.420 
supposed to be but the corals have still
pretty<00:03:41.730> much<00:03:41.880> withdrawn<00:03:42.680> no<00:03:43.680> damage<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.160> the

pretty much withdrawn no damage to the

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.349 
pretty much withdrawn no damage to the

a<00:04:00.720> little<00:04:00.930> bit<00:04:01.079> of<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:01.260> dip<00:04:01.470> here<00:04:01.739> these<00:04:02.519> guys

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
a little bit of a dip here these guys

over<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.350> top<00:04:10.530> of<00:04:10.560> them<00:04:10.799> but<00:04:10.920> they<00:04:11.069> were

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
over the top of them but they were

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.200 
over the top of them but they were
opened<00:04:11.579> up<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.730> little

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
opened up a little

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.900 
opened up a little
a<00:04:12.480> few<00:04:13.050> minutes<00:04:13.290> ago<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.430> can<00:04:14.550> see<00:04:14.670> the

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
a few minutes ago and you can see the

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.760 
a few minutes ago and you can see the
fish<00:04:15.090> screwing<00:04:15.480> around<00:04:15.600> with<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:16.020> Zoe's<00:04:16.410> here

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770

those<00:04:17.160> guys<00:04:17.190> were<00:04:17.550> opened<00:04:18.150> up<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:19.650> Greenstar

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
those guys were opened up the Greenstar

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.520 
those guys were opened up the Greenstar
polyps<00:04:20.670> started<00:04:21.660> kind<00:04:21.840> of<00:04:21.870> opening<00:04:22.230> up<00:04:22.380> up

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
polyps started kind of opening up up

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.030 
polyps started kind of opening up up
there<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:24.230> the<00:04:25.230> rest<00:04:25.440> of<00:04:25.590> them<00:04:25.770> are<00:04:25.830> still

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
there and the rest of them are still

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.460 
there and the rest of them are still
pretty<00:04:26.250> much<00:04:26.430> withdrawn<00:04:27.200> they<00:04:28.200> should

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
pretty much withdrawn they should

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.640 
pretty much withdrawn they should
recover<00:04:28.800> though<00:04:29.570> when<00:04:30.570> I<00:04:30.600> get<00:04:30.870> corals<00:04:31.230> I<00:04:31.410> dip

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
recover though when I get corals I dip

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.310 
recover though when I get corals I dip
them<00:04:31.770> anyway<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.630> usually<00:04:33.630> they<00:04:33.780> stay<00:04:34.020> closed

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
them anyway and usually they stay closed

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.650 
them anyway and usually they stay closed
for<00:04:34.350> maybe<00:04:35.070> like<00:04:35.220> up<00:04:35.580> to<00:04:35.610> two<00:04:35.940> days<00:04:36.150> or<00:04:36.450> so

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
for maybe like up to two days or so

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.870 
for maybe like up to two days or so
maybe<00:04:37.140> three<00:04:37.530> days<00:04:37.710> even<00:04:38.040> before<00:04:38.340> they<00:04:38.640> kind

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
maybe three days even before they kind

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.320 
maybe three days even before they kind
of<00:04:39.000> recover<00:04:39.720> from<00:04:40.020> their<00:04:40.230> shock<00:04:41.300> which<00:04:42.300> is

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
of recover from their shock which is

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.730 
of recover from their shock which is
what<00:04:42.630> I'm<00:04:42.720> hoping<00:04:42.840> will<00:04:43.140> happen<00:04:43.290> with<00:04:43.590> the

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
what I'm hoping will happen with the

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.340 
what I'm hoping will happen with the
rest<00:04:43.920> of<00:04:44.070> them<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:45.000> only<00:04:45.210> one<00:04:45.360> I'm<00:04:45.540> not<00:04:46.080> sure

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
rest of them the only one I'm not sure

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.860 
rest of them the only one I'm not sure
about<00:04:46.500> is<00:04:46.860> this<00:04:47.070> chalice<00:04:48.030> called<00:04:48.330> Coral<00:04:48.750> up

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
about is this chalice called Coral up
