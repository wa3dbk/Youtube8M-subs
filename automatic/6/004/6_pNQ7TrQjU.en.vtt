animation<00:00:17.220> effects<00:00:20.480> this<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> three<00:00:22.050> step

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
animation effects this is a three step

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.040 
animation effects this is a three step
process<00:00:22.789> the<00:00:23.789> first<00:00:24.060> step<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.570> make<00:00:24.869> an

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
process the first step is to make an

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.380 
process the first step is to make an
overlay<00:00:25.470> video<00:00:25.920> with<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> transparent<00:00:27.210> hole

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
overlay video with the transparent hole

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.290 
overlay video with the transparent hole
in<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.859> the<00:00:28.859> second<00:00:29.279> step<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.789> making<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
in it the second step is making the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.150 
in it the second step is making the
background<00:00:30.810> image<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.439> show<00:00:31.619> through<00:00:31.890> that

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
background image to show through that

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.389 
background image to show through that
hole<00:00:32.480> and<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.809> third<00:00:34.050> step<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.590> creating<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
hole and the third step is creating and

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.580 
hole and the third step is creating and
synchronizing<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> animations<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.260> those

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
synchronizing the animations on those

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.610 
synchronizing the animations on those
two<00:00:37.800> pieces<00:00:38.420> so<00:00:39.420> let's<00:00:39.660> get<00:00:39.870> started<00:00:40.290> first

drop the green blob on the next track

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.149 
drop the green blob on the next track
and<00:02:14.610> then<00:02:14.700> expand<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.510> match<00:02:18.920> later<00:02:19.920> on

this<00:02:20.370> green<00:02:20.700> image<00:02:20.970> will<00:02:21.329> be<00:02:21.480> made

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
this green image will be made

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.140 
this green image will be made
transparent<00:02:22.049> so<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.920> magnified<00:02:23.519> image<00:02:23.909> below

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
transparent so the magnified image below

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.710 
transparent so the magnified image below
shows<00:02:24.720> through<00:02:26.030> resizes<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:27.239> there's<00:02:27.450> room<00:02:27.689> to

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
shows through resizes so there's room to

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.670 
shows through resizes so there's room to
put<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.140> magnifier<00:02:28.680> on<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.220> later<00:02:29.430> and

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
put the magnifier on it later and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.289 
put the magnifier on it later and
position<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.829> over<00:02:32.129> the<00:02:32.280> area<00:02:32.489> where<00:02:32.909> you<00:02:32.939> want

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
position it over the area where you want

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.259 
position it over the area where you want
to<00:02:33.390> start<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.810> effect<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.790> want<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.879> examine

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
to start the effect I want to examine

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.569 
to start the effect I want to examine
these<00:02:36.599> column<00:02:37.140> headings<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:37.980> I'll<00:02:38.189> put<00:02:38.430> it

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
these column headings so I'll put it

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:46.099 
these column headings so I'll put it
over<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.909> column<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:44.060> now<00:02:45.060> let's<00:02:45.359> zoom<00:02:45.659> in<00:02:45.900> on<00:02:46.079> a

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
track now I will zoom out the view so I

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.400 
track now I will zoom out the view so I
can<00:05:41.630> resize<00:05:42.050> the<00:05:42.320> background<00:05:43.870> it's<00:05:44.870> okay<00:05:45.350> to

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
can resize the background it's okay to

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.190 
can resize the background it's okay to
overlap<00:05:45.980> the<00:05:46.220> ends<00:05:47.560> and<00:05:49.780> position<00:05:50.780> the<00:05:50.960> sheet

overlap the ends and position the sheet

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.840 
overlap the ends and position the sheet
so<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:51.650> first<00:05:51.920> column<00:05:52.280> will<00:05:52.670> be
