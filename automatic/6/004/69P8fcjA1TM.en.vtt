 You talk people are very common when

 People are in university to find

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.950

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.860
 with note that the connected student 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.899
 The truth is most of us are just in the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.360

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.660

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.710

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:46.399
 and then it's over now 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:48.560
 almost finished series was true and not 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.170
 an increasingly famous time of the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:02:00.170
 entrepreneurship day is the social and 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:03.670

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.670
 yourself behind 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.120
 It's already half past ten at night. 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.490
 We spend the end of the time but we will not 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:18.680
 stay here we see next week 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:24.860
 in Hungary and the tourist student who 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:26.569
 sign I was very much I can there I am 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.750
 Much ends in class and reached 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:40.270
 Expected is what 's called so let's go 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:40.270
 but the call today come is amanda 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.530
 anderson 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:03:03.390
 breno cerilo accurate shot cerilo choose 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.740
 for example I'm probably you should 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.930
 have identified with some of these 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.480
 types of students and that in fact 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.430
 it's not that way we'll end up 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.960
 identifying or reproducing some 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.480
 these characters throughout our 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.190
 school or at university 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.740
 if you are going through some challenge 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.900
 within your school or university 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.810
 which is an alloy to be able to approach 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.650
 a teacher or create a connection with him 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.690
 positively here it goes 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.240
 every time you have the name of 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.790
 salary and teacher to maintain contact 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.560
 visual with you, you were sitting there 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.959
 is also in class and suddenly looks 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.709
 for you quickly or for a break 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:43.020
 You talk like that with your head and then when 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:48.090
 comes again another visual contact but 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:50.070
 reinforces this type of behavior 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.530
 unconsciously generating what people 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.810
 called a comfort zone in the person who 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.760
 You're talking, then it's like you 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.739
 would have consciously told him 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.300
 I'm enjoying your class, I'm 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.400
 validating what you are talking about and that is 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.080
 very important and he understands 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.670
 unconsciously that something cool that is 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.590
 cool, he's paying attention to the 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.570
 my class and it is this type of student that 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.730
 usually teachers like 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.690
 you can always validate with language 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.160
 not verbal 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.700
 this way whenever there is contact 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.900
 visual for sure you will realize that 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.239
 You'll start getting more attention. 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.260
 the teacher during class and neither will 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.260
 realize for was 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:42.289
 the group either leads to this will enter the 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:51.020
 I'm half right now, it 's good to be good. 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:53.499
 If you are going to speak with a personal dayana only today 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:05:05.590
 I did not have what she's going to pass the pen. 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:05:05.590
 quickie but the quota in a year 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:14.560
 he said so I said you know 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:14.560
 Same side this is ok, thanks guys 

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:27.710

 performing the student's homework on the floor 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.800
 cool, do you want high school? 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.750

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.819

 part of the room and run for 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.879
 zero kilometer car plus it is 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.110
 important to stress that throughout the 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:46.569
 ecosystem of the event 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.770
 but to be raffled scholarships in colleges 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:52.129

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.110

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:56.240

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.789
