doesn't have a home screen which kind of

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.069 
doesn't have a home screen which kind of
sucks<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.180> means<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.420> can't<00:00:45.629> really<00:00:45.960> add

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
sucks so that means you can't really add

any widgets or anything like that so

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.010 
any widgets or anything like that so
yeah<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.930> does<00:00:49.140> kind<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.559> suck<00:00:50.750> so<00:00:51.750> anyway

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
yeah that does kind of suck so anyway

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.049
