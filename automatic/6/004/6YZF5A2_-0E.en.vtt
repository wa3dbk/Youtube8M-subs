00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.960 
didn't really form so I'm going to do is
take<00:01:59.479> the<00:02:00.440> awl<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:01.040> kind<00:02:01.399> of<00:02:01.460> just<00:02:01.640> get<00:02:01.820> in

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
take the awl and kind of just get in

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:10.359 
take the awl and kind of just get in
there<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:03.140> force<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:04.039> open<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:09.190> couple<00:02:10.190> spots

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
there and force it open a couple spots

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.850 
there and force it open a couple spots
that<00:02:10.670> go<00:02:10.820> down<00:02:11.000> pretty<00:02:11.209> deep<00:02:11.510> here<00:02:14.680> there<00:02:15.680> you

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
that go down pretty deep here there you

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.970 
that go down pretty deep here there you
go<00:02:16.540> there's<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.569> little<00:02:17.780> knot<00:02:18.319> or<00:02:18.500> something<00:02:18.530> in

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
go there's a little knot or something in

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:27.720 
go there's a little knot or something in
there

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:46.119 

blow<00:02:28.730> out<00:02:28.939> all<00:02:29.329> the<00:02:30.250> material<00:02:44.859> next<00:02:45.859> we're

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
blow out all the material next we're

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.860 
blow out all the material next we're
going<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.310> put<00:02:46.549> up<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.909> little<00:02:47.269> mixing<00:02:47.629> spud<00:02:49.870> so

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
going to put up a little mixing spud so

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.149 
going to put up a little mixing spud so
there's<00:02:51.049> a<00:02:51.079> couple<00:02:51.200> different<00:02:51.620> options<00:02:51.709> then

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
there's a couple different options then

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.039 
there's a couple different options then
of<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.430> glue<00:02:52.639> that<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:52.970> can<00:02:53.180> use<00:02:53.359> I<00:02:53.629> like<00:02:53.930> to

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
of the glue that you can use I like to

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.089 
of the glue that you can use I like to
use<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.349> five-minute<00:02:54.799> epoxy<00:02:56.500> I've<00:02:57.500> also<00:02:57.769> seen

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
use the five-minute epoxy I've also seen

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.159 
use the five-minute epoxy I've also seen
guys<00:02:58.400> use<00:02:59.349> superglue<00:03:00.349> I<00:03:01.420> prefer<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.569> epoxy<00:03:03.139> I

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:03.169 
guys use superglue I prefer the epoxy I

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:05.559 
guys use superglue I prefer the epoxy I
think<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.620> dries<00:03:03.859> a<00:03:03.889> little<00:03:04.010> bit<00:03:04.220> harder<00:03:04.579> more

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
think it dries a little bit harder more

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.050 
think it dries a little bit harder more
solid<00:03:06.049> if<00:03:06.200> you<00:03:06.290> got<00:03:06.439> some<00:03:06.680> gaps<00:03:07.060> essentially

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
solid if you got some gaps essentially

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.089 
solid if you got some gaps essentially
what<00:03:08.150> you're<00:03:08.299> going<00:03:08.419> to<00:03:08.480> do<00:03:08.659> is<00:03:09.650> take<00:03:09.889> your

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
what you're going to do is take your

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.670 
what you're going to do is take your
turquoise<00:03:10.810> whatever<00:03:11.810> in<00:03:11.959> limit<00:03:12.290> we<00:03:12.439> are<00:03:12.560> going

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
turquoise whatever in limit we are going

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:22.119 
turquoise whatever in limit we are going
to<00:03:12.739> use<00:03:19.090> dump<00:03:20.090> some<00:03:20.299> out<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:21.590> can<00:03:21.739> make<00:03:21.769> little

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
to use dump some out you can make little

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:29.199 
to use dump some out you can make little
batches<00:03:22.519> here<00:03:22.639> to<00:03:22.790> fill<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.120> holes

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.569 

use<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.239> toothpick<00:03:30.510> or<00:03:31.140> random<00:03:31.769> piece<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:32.129> wood

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:53.390 

just<00:03:35.579> begin<00:03:35.909> by<00:03:35.939> mixing<00:03:36.870> this<00:03:37.109> all<00:03:37.319> together

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.339 

so<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.489> consistency<00:03:54.849> you're<00:03:55.390> looking<00:03:55.750> for<00:03:56.049> is

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
so the consistency you're looking for is

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:02.390 
so the consistency you're looking for is
solid<00:03:57.010> not<00:03:57.519> too<00:03:57.760> loose

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.589 

it's<00:04:02.790> kind<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.180> feel<00:04:04.880> this<00:04:05.880> feels<00:04:06.270> about

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
it's kind of a feel this feels about

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.850 
it's kind of a feel this feels about
right<00:04:06.660> if<00:04:07.110> it's<00:04:07.260> too<00:04:07.470> dry<00:04:07.800> not<00:04:09.050> really<00:04:10.050> liking

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
right if it's too dry not really liking

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:18.920 
right if it's too dry not really liking
to<00:04:11.310> dry

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.449 

so<00:04:19.470> what<00:04:19.590> you're<00:04:19.680> gonna<00:04:19.739> do<00:04:19.889> is<00:04:20.009> just<00:04:20.040> take

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
so what you're gonna do is just take

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.300 
so what you're gonna do is just take
this<00:04:20.669> stuff<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.810> start<00:04:22.049> forcing<00:04:22.680> it<00:04:22.979> down<00:04:23.009> the

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
this stuff and start forcing it down the

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:51.420 
this stuff and start forcing it down the
holes<00:04:23.550> so<00:04:24.389> got<00:04:24.570> my<00:04:24.690> toothpick

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.520 

and<00:04:52.430> you<00:04:52.550> want<00:04:52.790> it<00:04:52.880> to<00:04:52.940> just<00:04:53.360> kind<00:04:53.690> of<00:04:53.780> build<00:04:54.290> on

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
and you want it to just kind of build on

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:24.570 
and you want it to just kind of build on
the<00:04:54.680> outside<00:04:55.450> on<00:04:56.450> the<00:04:56.630> top<00:04:56.900> not<00:04:57.320> too<00:04:57.530> much

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.540 

I'm<00:05:25.169> kind<00:05:26.169> of<00:05:26.259> breaking<00:05:26.740> this<00:05:27.099> up<00:05:27.310> make<00:05:27.520> sure

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
I'm kind of breaking this up make sure

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:34.210 
I'm kind of breaking this up make sure
there's<00:05:27.849> no<00:05:28.000> air<00:05:28.180> bubbles

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:46.900 

so<00:05:34.700> we'll<00:05:34.850> move<00:05:34.970> to<00:05:35.030> the<00:05:35.210> other<00:05:35.300> side<00:05:35.720> here<00:05:45.910> you

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
so we'll move to the other side here you

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.210 
so we'll move to the other side here you
just<00:05:47.060> continue<00:05:47.510> to<00:05:47.660> work<00:05:47.750> the<00:05:48.350> material<00:05:48.920> under

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
just continue to work the material under

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.029 
just continue to work the material under
the<00:05:49.250> crack

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:06:06.919 

make<00:05:53.639> sure<00:05:53.819> there's<00:05:53.969> no<00:05:54.089> air<00:05:54.569> bubbles

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:06.929 

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:09.749 

so<00:06:07.929> at<00:06:08.019> this<00:06:08.139> point<00:06:08.409> that<00:06:08.679> poxy<00:06:08.979> is<00:06:09.339> just

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 
so at this point that poxy is just

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:11.609 
so at this point that poxy is just
getting<00:06:10.089> a<00:06:10.179> little<00:06:10.599> bit<00:06:10.929> rough<00:06:11.139> you<00:06:11.469> don't

00:06:11.609 --> 00:06:11.619 
getting a little bit rough you don't

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:20.180 
getting a little bit rough you don't
keep<00:06:11.769> working<00:06:12.249> it

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.970 

it's<00:06:20.730> okay<00:06:21.090> over<00:06:21.390> here

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:25.980 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:49.649 

for<00:06:26.790> sit<00:06:27.030> down<00:06:27.210> over<00:06:27.420> here<00:06:27.810> too

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:49.659 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:53.679 

so<00:06:50.659> now<00:06:50.779> this<00:06:50.929> is<00:06:50.990> really<00:06:51.529> getting<00:06:52.069> sticky<00:06:52.689> so

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:53.689 
so now this is really getting sticky so

00:06:53.689 --> 00:07:00.279 
so now this is really getting sticky so
it's<00:06:53.869> starting<00:06:54.110> to<00:06:54.319> dry<00:06:58.539> so<00:06:59.539> we'll<00:06:59.689> do<00:06:59.929> is<00:07:00.080> let

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.289 
it's starting to dry so we'll do is let

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:03.790 
it's starting to dry so we'll do is let
this<00:07:00.409> dry<00:07:00.740> we'll<00:07:01.039> come<00:07:01.249> back<00:07:02.529> and<00:07:03.529> we'll<00:07:03.679> then

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 
this dry we'll come back and we'll then

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.980 
this dry we'll come back and we'll then
sand<00:07:04.159> this<00:07:04.279> off<00:07:04.550> for<00:07:05.149> even<00:07:05.449> though<00:07:05.689> this<00:07:05.839> is

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
sand this off for even though this is

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.139 
sand this off for even though this is
five<00:07:06.229> minute<00:07:06.469> epoxy<00:07:06.499> I'll<00:07:07.129> let<00:07:07.309> this<00:07:07.459> dry<00:07:07.759> for

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:08.149 
five minute epoxy I'll let this dry for

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:11.980 
five minute epoxy I'll let this dry for
24<00:07:08.539> hours<00:07:09.050> before<00:07:09.979> I<00:07:10.249> touch<00:07:10.520> it<00:07:10.789> because<00:07:11.719> the

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:11.990 
24 hours before I touch it because the

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.889 
24 hours before I touch it because the
deeper<00:07:12.439> the<00:07:13.309> glue<00:07:13.550> is<00:07:13.699> in<00:07:13.849> the<00:07:13.969> crack<00:07:14.270> the<00:07:14.659> much

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:14.899 
deeper the glue is in the crack the much
