00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.290
 hello everyone here jojo and remember 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.690
 one of my last videos you 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.490
 introduce an emulator of nintendo ds 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.129
 for your ios device 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.300
 jacques lighter and precisely this 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.009
 solution also existed for 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.630
 devices not already lighter but the 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.859
 problem is that this solution has been 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.480
 blocked by apple 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.060
 so I did not introduce you precisely 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.320
 this solution but a little trick 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.329
 circulate on the net 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.189
 and you did it to me 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.909
 share on twitter and on facebook and 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.400
 on Youtube 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:34.940
 so just bah I'll go to you 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.790
 share 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.410
 in addition to that I proposed to you all 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.060
 emulators that you can install 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.620
 on devices not from the brick and 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.420
 so you have game emulators 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.270
 boy advance precisely there I play with 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.340
 you also have an emulator to play 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.470
 to the game boy an emulator to play 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.200
 so to the nintendo ds an emulator for 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.120
 to play sega at the nes et cetera and 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.590
 so 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.390
 most games running on its 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.670
 emulators we can that is practical 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.590
 is that you have the same sound for 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.789
 precisely the emulator of nintendo ds 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.590
 while the one I had you 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:08.719
 presented it did not work there was no 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.159
 not the sound of course for some games 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.749
 who use it at least there will be 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.399
 maybe small lakes and that's 

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:15.469
 sure in any case what to do 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.960
 it's first and foremost in the 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:18.499
 settings and change the date of your 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.600
 apparatus 

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:22.490
 we will put any date before 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.170
 July 16 because July 16 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.920
 this is the date when apple to block 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.530
 Installation 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.749
 so I put 15 July and there we go 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.700
 go to the site moved strong to ios for a 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:33.859
 web lille.com and there you have the list 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.539
 of all the emulators that you can 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.100
 install on devices not from the 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.319
 brick and you're all full 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.189
 back to the text by installing 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:43.520
 death for as 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.899
 I press install we accept and we go 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.729
 just wait until 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.959
 the installation ends against this 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.310
 which is really a shame is that when 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.619
 you will install another emulator 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.780
 on this website there he will delete 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.719
 the other emulator so I do not know if 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.670
 it's a lai bug is because I 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.100
 test it on this ipad 2 which is under the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.689
 sock or is it a site bug 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.100
 internet i do not know so this is 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.899
 really to test at home do it 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.300
 know me through 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.099
 comments open the application and 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.629
 we do not have a game so we need them 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.970
 download you can install them 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.280
 on the device or 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.810
 either on the computer and after you 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.070
 you can transfer them to your 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.230
 device I will explain to you how 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.760
 it works to download the roms you 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.110
 have several websites you have 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.820
 blow the rum that is not bad 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.510
 so here we will download by in full 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.000
 new super mario bros for nintendo ds on 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.580
 download it and then afterwards when 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 the installation is finished we will have to 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.090
 press open with the application 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.790
 ndez for ios or the emulator that you 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.710
 use and there the game will be added 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.760
 press it but the application will 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.350
 buggy so to gonna shut up and we're gonna 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.600
 just reopen it also goes to 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.050
 this level there is not a big bug 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.270
 problem 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.480
 we launch the game and the game starts 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.220
 properly good after that I play on 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.480
 ipad 2 there are laypeople it takes a 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.520
 little more time it's not like 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.800
 on the iphone 5 or it's much more 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.330
 quick in any case short I'm going to you 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.850
 explain how to install now 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.770
 games on your device directly 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.360
 with your pc like that you can 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.890
 download the games on your 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.400
 store them on your computer 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.220
 computer 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.150
 so how does it work already it takes 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.040
 know that its margin on all 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.720
 appliances not already lighter it does not have any 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.640
 problem at that level we will have to 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.970
 download transfer software from 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.010
 data 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.840
 so the one I advise you is to 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.380
 explore who is free for them what 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.720
 we want to do 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.700
 you will open it you will connect 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.459
 then your device on the computer 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.820
 you go to the application category 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.130
 and there you will choose simply 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.830
 the emulator so pretty nfor and death 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.840
 for ios and the tooth document you go 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.760
 drag the game you downloaded 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.209
 so there for example I had downloaded 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.500
 the zelda phantom hourglass which is great 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.830
 precisely because I'm a fan of 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.750
 zelda 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.730
 then you have slipped into document 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.760
 simply and the game is going to get 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.450
 transfer to your device quickly 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.700
 and easily 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.799
 we go back to our device we go 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.560
 launch the application and magic the game has 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.000
 been added successfully then there I 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.430
 think I offered you the 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.150
 best solution to have all the 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.430
 emulators that exists and imaginable 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.750
 for your devices not already lighter and 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.890
 what is convenient is that the site 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.360
 I spun you 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.280
 it's just a specialized site 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.410
 in the world of 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.520
 blatting for devices ios so soon 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.160
 that he will have a new one that will come out 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.690
 it will be added on the site that 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.490
 I spent you I also thank you

 some of you who are going to share 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.660
 this trick is great because it 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.030
 shows that he has a desire to share 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.510
 in this little community on 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.340
 Internet 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.900
