00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
slider which I don't find it useful for

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.349 
slider which I don't find it useful for
me<00:02:41.500> we<00:02:42.010> probably<00:02:42.250> more<00:02:42.519> useful<00:02:42.700> for<00:02:43.060> runners

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
me we probably more useful for runners

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.869 
me we probably more useful for runners
and<00:02:43.599> stuff<00:02:43.810> like<00:02:43.989> that<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:44.379> there's<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.400> 1.2

ebay so their intention is base i'm

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.610 
ebay so their intention is base i'm
assuming<00:02:57.340> for<00:02:58.329> these<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.870> trying<00:02:59.379> to<00:02:59.439> see<00:02:59.530> how

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
assuming for these I trying to see how

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:11.380 
assuming for these I trying to see how
close<00:02:59.799> I<00:03:00.010> can<00:03:00.069> get

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.120 

all<00:03:11.900> right<00:03:11.990> there<00:03:12.230> we<00:03:12.260> go<00:03:12.410> i<00:03:12.440> think<00:03:12.920> that's<00:03:13.069> the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
all right there we go i think that's the

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.040 
all right there we go i think that's the
closest<00:03:13.430> i'm<00:03:13.550> going<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.760> get<00:03:13.910> so<00:03:14.780> there's<00:03:14.930> like

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
closest i'm going to get so there's like

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.630 
closest i'm going to get so there's like
a<00:03:15.110> bit<00:03:15.319> of<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:15.470> close-up<00:03:15.860> views<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.370> what<00:03:16.400> they

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
a bit of a close-up views of what they

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.150 
a bit of a close-up views of what they
look<00:03:16.790> like<00:03:16.850> and<00:03:17.620> let's<00:03:18.620> get<00:03:18.770> these<00:03:18.890> out<00:03:19.040> the

look like and let's get these out the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.600 
look like and let's get these out the
box<00:03:19.340> so<00:03:19.550> straight<00:03:19.910> away<00:03:20.950> her<00:03:21.950> out<00:03:22.250> there's<00:03:22.520> a

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
box so straight away her out there's a

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.910 
box so straight away her out there's a
top<00:03:22.880> at<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.300> top<00:03:23.600> here<00:03:23.930> a<00:03:24.200> tab<00:03:24.500> at<00:03:24.770> the<00:03:24.800> top

top at the top here a tab at the top

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.770 
top at the top here a tab at the top
there<00:03:25.670> you<00:03:25.760> just<00:03:25.850> don't<00:03:26.090> flick<00:03:26.330> like<00:03:26.540> that

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
there you just don't flick like that

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.120 
there you just don't flick like that
these<00:03:27.410> do<00:03:27.620> have<00:03:27.650> sellotape<00:03:28.310> like<00:03:29.200> their<00:03:30.200> cave

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
these do have sellotape like their cave

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.330 
these do have sellotape like their cave
and<00:03:31.310> see<00:03:31.550> basically<00:03:32.540> is<00:03:32.660> best<00:03:32.930> tape<00:03:33.530> there<00:03:33.920> and

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
and see basically is best tape there and

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.610 
and see basically is best tape there and
here<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:35.360> can<00:03:35.480> see<00:03:35.690> that<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.959> bit<00:03:36.200> just<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:36.590> bit
