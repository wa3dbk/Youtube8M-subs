00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.390
 hello guys I bring you a new video and 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.279
 good before you start with the video in 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.440
 seriously I want to say thank you very much 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.900
 we are all already 10,000 subscribers 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.420
 well I'm not going to roll now because 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.100
 I want to do the special but good 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.160
 I wanted shrillness anyway because 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.510
 well I was not going to make it look like I did not 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.100
 nothing had happened not so seriously 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.570
 thank you very much but I will tell you everything 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.970
 in the special 10,000 you are the best 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.260
 They really want to build us more in case 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.930
 someone is not interested in this topic so 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.400
 let's go with the topic of today's video 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.080
 what he prepares here is a system of 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.910
 alarm that good gave me the idea 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.500
 basically a subscriber the lord in the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.390
 I was there I did not know what to upload 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.300
 today and look I appeared and told me this 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.159
 Well look how good it came, great, good 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.739
 how does the weapon work 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.880
 we are like this at home, not how 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.760
 we make this is our house in a 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.350
 server if I decide on servers in 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.690
 a map me that I know anything I just 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.760
 I give the idea is in our house yes with 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.950
 patches and all good we do not want to go 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.900
 and we activate the alarm is worth the alarm is 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.600
 would activate with a password that in this 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.140
 case to activate it was still pressing 15 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.180
 and 9 alarm activated, you see that 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.640
 there starts to blink and now all 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.130
 entity that enters there will die will die and 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.229
 good apart it will give you the slowness and everything 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.200
 even if we enter then 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:42.430
 begins to blink it will be taught and to 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.229
 defuse it would be squeezing 234 vale 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.950
 this would deactivate the deactivated alarm 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.899
 it's safe to enter, let's make a 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.439
 low thing is this door open and 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:56.079
 I'm going to activate the alarm worth 159 have 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.119
 activated alarm is worth I'm going to put on 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.069
 change mode but imagine now that 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.350
 I'm an infiltrator but the alarm is not 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.270
 can detect in real life so much 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.440
 already detect people so I 've 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.020
 Failure to detect the player 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.340
 imagine how good I am here and I am going 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.440
 to try to steal this house but this 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.960
 activated alarm well we come here 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.670
 we go in and basically mantra kills me and 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.490
 there is an intruder the intruder is gone 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.140
 has died is good, what is the damage 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.510
 you can change it, you give me a 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.770
 little that kills me at once no no no 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.240
 I expected him to kill so fast but 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.090
 well you can change that 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.890
 to kill you so that it takes longer to kill 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.290
 so you can run away or whatever it is not 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.470
 let's see now how I've done this 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.510
 well now to activate it would be 2 3 4 and 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.910
 activated alarms sure enter now 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.170
 you know that I can enter the path of 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.890
 zero that will not do me absolutely 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.840
 nothing is good, let's see how I have 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.180
 done this we would have here a clock that 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.890
 I'm going to deactivate for the first of all 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.360
 we have two passwords of the two 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.130
 passwords is to activate the alarm 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.690
 and it 's to deactivate the is 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.180
 absolutely the same thing I'm going to 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.790
 teach a mechanism because it is the same 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.930
 so the mechanism would be what is going to 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.990
 do is going to be testing how do you 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.600
 we have in the selected item 0 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.750
 to see that I teach you that is the 0 1 2 3 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.340
 up to 80 east of here you see that no 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.330
 I have selected good I will activate 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.460
 the clock selected 0 and so 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.370
 see what it is worth moving the 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.600
 piston understands this leaves the block here 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.760
 because now when I come back I'll leave it 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.970
 here will override this torch now I put 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.220
 the 5 here is worth voided both this 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.690
 I work and I put 9 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.580
 this torch is already normal so 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.950
 so much what this has done basically 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.360
 is to cancel the three torches what do you want 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.490
 say this to see only with there being a 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.320
 torch on here will see signal 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.120
 if there is a signal, it means that they are here 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.380
 it is on, therefore it is off 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.030
 sorry I know that in sign means that 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.890
 you are canceling and it is turned off therefore 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.180
 here it does not give a signal at the moment it is 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.250
 the three off if you want to say that 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.660
 we have selected the three digits this 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.780
 from here it will turn on as you have 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.250
 seen now then he's going to come here he's going 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.380
 to give signal here to say alarm 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.820
 activated is going to come here is going to activate the 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.160
 watch is everything here what you are going to do 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.040
 give us the effects to all entities 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.540
 that are at a distance from the center of 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.950
 the house at a radius of 5 blocks is going to 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.590
 give 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.049
 the effect of instantaneous damage to the effect 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.150
 of instantaneous life the effect of blindness 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.829
 and the one of slowness because I have hurt and 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.470
 good life basically because the 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.960
 Skeleton zombies do not die with damage 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.250
 vice versa the damage cures them therefore 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.600
 I have put life but if you want this 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.780
 do only for players that you put 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.820
 only hurt and point is worth seeing what else 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.740
 we have here would make a watch worth 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.070
 that would come here and place set block 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.810
 in reston block and would also air 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.449
 this what I have done here basically 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.690
 to make the effect of blinking 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:48.720
 It's worth here, as you can see , the 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.280
 place and turn off the clock that is 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.650
 basically this effect with a tick of 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.449
 less this one has one of less u and that 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.550
 It was raining to see 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.279
 Now this one here has one more click 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.020
 that is why it makes the effect 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:03.360
 uncontrolled and good here we would have a 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.129
 text this here is what it detects if there 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.499
 someone or not worth is going to detect if there 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:10.529
 someone removing the items lorca the 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:12.389
 items do not count and if there is going to say there 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:14.159
 an intruder and when there is not going to 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.499
 say the intruder is gone or has died 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:19.600
 okay now let's go with what 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:21.940
 d would be the system 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.990
 this here is valid to deactivate 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.940
 alarm how to restart and we'll love this 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:32.620
 good when deactivating the alarm is 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:34.090
 restart, as you see, 234 reboots 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.060
 insurance deactivated alarm enter 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.560
 well this is very simple, this is 6 and 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.820
 what I do here is basically place 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.500
 air 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.510
 here it's worth where it should be 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.040
 the rest in block and here he placed the 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.110
 rest a block again in its position 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.700
 original as you can see when I 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.530
 re -activate the alarm is going to 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.240
 reset again but now this one 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.610
 here it's worth mary's you see it savolta 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.290
 reset by that in no case can 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.150
 be the alarm in neutral mode is 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:02.050
 always on or off is worth the 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.610
 system we would not have here and well this 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.020
 it would be the system I do not know if they have 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.850
 accelerated a lot explaining what I think 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.990
 that I have gone too slow I do not know if what 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.610
 you have understood well if you have not 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.590
 understood well you ask me in the 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.570
 comments I explain this would be the 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.760
 system and good the truth is that 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.980
 enough or maybe you give me a blindness 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.710
 and it's Monday, that's what you can change 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.230
 you and once we have gone then 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.900
 it takes everything away 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.160
 and well guys this is the system the 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.080
 it really is quite handsome me 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.910
 curré will see me what I do not work but I do not 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.760
 I expected these results less think 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.110
 that I would be more crappy and good 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.430
 let the video guys hope 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.220
 you liked it we will have commands in the 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:41.390
 description as always and nothing until 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.390
 another goodbye
