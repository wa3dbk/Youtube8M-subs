00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 today we will talk about the lazy bear 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.429
 there are some curiosities about this 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.309
 wonderful animal that will undoubtedly 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.710
 surprise first of all to say that 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.830
 they are constantly hung in the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.240
 trees are thrown all day without doing 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.000
 nothing sleep up to 20 hours a day and in 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.970
 the 4 hours that are awake 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.920
 move at a maximum speed of 02 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.369
 kilometers per hour 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.730
 it takes 30 seconds to do so with the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.730
 arm 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.580
 I'm not even going to put it in the video 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.240
 because it is a boredom it is a 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:51.210
 animal very very slow however when 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.580
 goes through a surface of water is 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.170
 quite faster and is able to be 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.780
 40 minutes containing the breath is 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.570
 say that he eats too little eats 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.250
 the best one a big sheet along 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.890
 of one month 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.520
 only get off the tree once for 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.460
 urinate and defecate when it comes down from the tree 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.470
 it's just creeping 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.900
 because it has no other way to go 6 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.780
 forward through a day 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.920
 can reach up to 40 meters 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.200
 the fastest is amazing to see how 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.300
 these animals have survived not and 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.660
 know above all that makes millions of 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.570
 years these lazy bears were much more 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:40.290
 great and much more powerful to day of 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.510
 today they are practically harmless they pass 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.700
 most of the day 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.280
 clinging to the treetops in 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.530
 inverted position have all the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.840
 organs attached to the rib cage as well 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.730
 that can be passed face down all the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.560
 day without any problem and can even 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:01.590
 sleep and good to tell you also that these 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.380
 animals are herbivores and, where appropriate, 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.900
 eat so slowly because they get very 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.360
 little energy is why some 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.000
 Lazy bears get to sleep up to 20 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.910
 hours a day and virtually no 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.280
 move do not move from the place is a 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.120
 very effective way to avoid the 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.130
 predators the so-called harpy eagles 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.130
 that in the case of seeing a lazy bear 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.790
 Well, you can perfectly kill him and 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.280
 serve you as food are animals as 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.020
 I said very curious to see you can see 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.060
 some videos on youtube there are many 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.920
 videos of lazy bears and today 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.830
 I just wanted to make known 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.030
 curiosities about this animal os 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.410
 you imagine an animal that in full sprint 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.210
 I can only go five times more 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.480
 fast than a snail 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.790
 well this is the animal so to speak 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.520
 of the slowest that exist in the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.680
 planet earth whose maximum speed is 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.680
 0.2 kilometers per hour
