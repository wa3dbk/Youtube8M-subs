00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.330 
how to activate it again I don't know
it<00:02:11.690> just<00:02:11.990> sort<00:02:12.140> of<00:02:12.260> happens<00:02:12.740> and<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.130> really

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
it just sort of happens and it really

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.890 
it just sort of happens and it really
boggles<00:02:13.580> my<00:02:13.940> mind<00:02:13.970> but<00:02:14.390> then<00:02:14.540> again<00:02:14.660> I<00:02:14.810> guess

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
boggles my mind but then again I guess

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.300 
boggles my mind but then again I guess
it's<00:02:15.290> some<00:02:15.910> okay<00:02:16.910> payback<00:02:17.860> since<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:19.100> ways

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
it's some okay payback since I ways

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.450 
it's some okay payback since I ways
wasted<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:20.180> much<00:02:20.330> time<00:02:20.650> waiting<00:02:21.650> for<00:02:21.860> stamina

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
wasted so much time waiting for stamina

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:29.440 
wasted so much time waiting for stamina
and<00:02:24.760> yeah<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:27.500> yeah<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.160> was<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.550> I'll<00:02:29.240> make<00:02:29.420> a

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
and yeah so yeah that was it I'll make a
