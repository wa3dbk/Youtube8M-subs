Goliath let's take a look at this elite

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.660 
Goliath let's take a look at this elite
MP<00:00:45.450> 11<00:00:45.870> stats<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.530> upgrades<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.190> damage<00:00:47.520> by

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
MP 11 stats it upgrades the damage by

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.459 
MP 11 stats it upgrades the damage by
three<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.180> lowers<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> handling<00:00:48.989> by<00:00:49.140> three

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
three and lowers the handling by three

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.350 
three and lowers the handling by three
which<00:00:49.559> i<00:00:49.680> think<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.980> obviously<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.910> huge

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360
