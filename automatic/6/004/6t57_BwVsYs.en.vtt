let's take a look at this thing see what
you<00:01:57.030> get<00:01:57.149> inside<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.960> little<00:01:58.170> clamshell

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
you get inside of the little clamshell

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.219 
you get inside of the little clamshell
there<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.700> we'll<00:02:00.180> go<00:02:00.329> from<00:02:00.509> there<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:00.689> let's

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
there and we'll go from there so let's

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.870 
there and we'll go from there so let's
take<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> look<00:02:01.890> bring<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.460> thing<00:02:02.610> close<00:02:02.850> to

take a look bring this thing close to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.160 
take a look bring this thing close to
the<00:02:03.060> camera<00:02:03.329> because<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.890> small<00:02:05.520> so

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
the camera because it is so small so

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.449 
the camera because it is so small so
that's<00:02:07.170> basically<00:02:07.560> what<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.950> get<00:02:08.069> there<00:02:08.310> it's

that's basically what you get there it's
a<00:02:08.580> little<00:02:08.700> clamshell<00:02:09.800> you<00:02:10.800> can<00:02:10.950> kind<00:02:11.190> of

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
a little clamshell you can kind of

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.720 
a little clamshell you can kind of
already<00:02:11.400> see<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
already see the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.680 
already see the
rc4<00:02:15.000> transponder<00:02:16.000> inside<00:02:16.360> there<00:02:16.480> with<00:02:16.659> a

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
rc4 transponder inside there with a

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.949 
rc4 transponder inside there with a
little<00:02:16.840> holder<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:18.069> let's<00:02:18.720> pop<00:02:19.720> this<00:02:19.900> thing

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
little holder and let's pop this thing

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.149 
little holder and let's pop this thing
open<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:22.709> hopefully<00:02:23.709> I<00:02:23.739> can<00:02:23.830> get<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.040> all<00:02:24.129> on

check out sizings hopefully I'll be able
to<00:03:49.859> show<00:03:50.859> the<00:03:51.040> sizings<00:03:51.519> here<00:03:52.889> since<00:03:53.889> the

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
to show the sizings here since the

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.979 
to show the sizings here since the
camera<00:03:54.430> seems<00:03:54.609> like<00:03:54.790> it's<00:03:54.970> so<00:03:55.120> far<00:03:55.419> away<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.870> if

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
camera seems like it's so far away so if

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.189 
pull this up to the camera here I really
thought<00:04:10.269> that<00:04:10.329> these<00:04:10.599> were<00:04:10.660> gonna<00:04:10.870> be<00:04:11.019> very

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:11.199 
thought that these were gonna be very

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.710 
thought that these were gonna be very
similar<00:04:11.500> in<00:04:11.769> size<00:04:11.949> well<00:04:12.370> there's<00:04:12.579> that<00:04:13.449> and

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
similar in size well there's that and

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.199 
similar in size well there's that and
there's<00:04:13.989> that<00:04:14.349> you<00:04:15.310> guys<00:04:15.430> can<00:04:15.669> see<00:04:15.849> those<00:04:16.030> two

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.479 
there's that you guys can see those two
things<00:04:16.500> SR<00:04:17.500> 300<00:04:19.650> very<00:04:20.650> much<00:04:21.039> smaller<00:04:21.219> I

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
things SR 300 very much smaller I

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.620 
things SR 300 very much smaller I

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
thought they were gonna be about the

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.840 
thought they were gonna be about the
same<00:04:22.780> size

penny there is the my lamps kind of

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.610 
penny there is the my lamps kind of
strange<00:04:35.680> anyways<00:04:36.660> that<00:04:37.660> is<00:04:37.690> my<00:04:38.200> official
