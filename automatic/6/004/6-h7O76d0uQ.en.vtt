00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.160
 stone bridge and the theater there is the 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.900

 at least 5 portions every day today what 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.399
 he prepared his staff for the magazine 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.960
 health today we have prepared one 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.390
 spaghetti with guitar of fresh pasta 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.760
 we do when the sea mollusks 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.140
 always prawns of sea water is 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.629
 a dish that will give us great 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.020
 satisfaction has had a great one 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.879
 customer reception and we are 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.539
 really happy to be able to serve him in 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.640
 every occasion 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.910
 from the nutritional point of view and has 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.100
 of the particularities that we recommend 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.809
 first of all they need very few along the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.850
 very few things because they are fruits of 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.270
 sea ​​already very sapid inside there is water 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.119
 of sea 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.159
 so salt is all there you know how 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.090
 we always recommend eating little 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.490
 salty 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.409
 you don't even need to salt the water from the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.049
 pasta because all the sauce from the moment 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.490
 which then come the pan-fried spaghetti 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.299
 and they all disappeared at the time 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.700
 because it is an egg pasta the sauce will be 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.710
 the one that gives the flavor of the rest of the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.150
 pasta what to advise advise 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.090
 always a purchase of mussels clams 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.970
 in sealed nets coming from 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.979
 authorized establishments and use them 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.570
 little like the seasoning than in this 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.600
 case starts from an aromatized oil 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.420
 to the garlic in which it does not need little and that 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.799
 in this recipe it is not brought 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.329
 not even at high temperatures because 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.070
 both the tomatoes are immediately placed 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.110
 what seafood they keep the 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.540
 low temperature just because there is one 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.340
 rich amount of water the prawn is 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.799
 the worthy crowning of this dish and 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.540
 is the last fish from the pot is that 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.939
 which needs a little more cooking 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.810
 compared to other seafood in 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.619
 alternative we have salad 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.880
 it is a salad that we have a little 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.099
 overhauled then our chef is a 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.720
 octopus salad with traditional 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.610
 cooking of the octopus in boiling water 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.290
 as the recipe prescribes that comes later 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.030
 practically accompanied by vegetables 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.860
 steamed together with 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.590
 raw salads this we do it 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.050
 always recommend with a spoon 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.620
 maximum of oil and a bit of lemon is enough 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.989
 cooked vegetables are very tasty 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.120
 steamed so they keep a lot of i 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.700
 their flavors and the octopus you see as the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.140
 polipo is normally the one on the market 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.670
 a little, everything is frozen so it's already 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.200
 flew to the already tender comes first 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.690
 lifted two three times from the water into 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.000
 by way of rich areas the tentacles the water is 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.239
 slightly acidulous because with a little 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.860
 of lemon you see so as to favor the 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.170
 protein degeneration and then having it 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.480
 usable but above all you see how 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.370
 the skin that is the part that was removed was removed 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.220
 contains more fat substances more 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.260
 cholesterol to long put that 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.030
 which instead is the true muscle structure 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.730
 and just the octopus that is just the 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.230
 white part is also the tastiest one 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.850
 obvious that besides these dishes there are 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.829
 of gluttony sins given by these 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.650
 beautiful desserts that they certainly call 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.870
 a red wine but for the fish such as wines 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.480
 we can match but we are always 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.359
 to promote our local wines of 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.840
 tasty and soave over possibly 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.799
 to the human or some other wine 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.359
 marching has not always our 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.459
 a primitive so we always stay 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.230
 on our areas but if a glass of 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.850
 wine is tolerated because these dishes it 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.850
 they call surely we always remember 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.519
 that to have a healthy life we ​​must 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.350
 do a lot of good movement gymnastics but 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.940
 especially consume a good amount 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.569
 water essential for ours 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.569
 body
