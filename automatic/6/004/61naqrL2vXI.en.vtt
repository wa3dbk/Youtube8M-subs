left<00:01:25.860> pretty<00:01:26.610> much<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:26.939> opposite<00:01:27.420> side<00:01:27.600> of

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
left pretty much on the opposite side of

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
left pretty much on the opposite side of
this<00:01:27.810> same<00:01:28.350> water<00:01:28.650> tower<00:01:28.860> there's<00:01:29.100> another

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
this same water tower there's another

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.219 
this same water tower there's another
tier<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:29.939> there's<00:01:30.090> pretty<00:01:30.240> much<00:01:30.270> two<00:01:30.360> so

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
tier one so there's pretty much two so

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.300 
tier one so there's pretty much two so
there's<00:01:31.409> another<00:01:31.560> one<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.829> opposite<00:01:32.159> side<00:01:32.280> of

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
there's another one the opposite side of

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.920 
there's another one the opposite side of
this<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.700> didn't<00:01:33.090> get<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.540> because<00:01:33.750> you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930

last year too so that's pretty much it
for<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> water<00:01:47.909> tower<00:01:48.060> out<00:01:48.299> there's<00:01:48.509> 60<00:01:49.020> or

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
for the water tower out there's 60 or

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.080 
for the water tower out there's 60 or
tues<00:01:49.259> in<00:01:49.380> total<00:01:49.649> future<00:01:50.369> ones<00:01:50.610> but<00:01:50.820> pretty

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
tues in total future ones but pretty

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.210 
tues in total future ones but pretty
much<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.570> got<00:01:52.020> pretty<00:01:52.290> nicely<00:01:52.619> stacked<00:01:52.979> as<00:01:53.159> you

the next round alright guys this is the
North<00:01:56.520> route<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.880> obviously<00:01:57.360> pretty<00:01:57.509> much

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
North route so obviously pretty much

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
just go north from corner got behind

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.139 
just go north from corner got behind
this<00:01:58.920> building<00:01:59.130> right<00:01:59.399> here<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.850> is<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> wrath

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
this building right here this is a wrath

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.580 
this building right here this is a wrath
of<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.329> lot<00:02:00.450> people<00:02:00.509> like<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.840> go<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.380> keep<00:02:01.530> in

well so you know it's maybe a little
risky<00:02:16.020> someone<00:02:16.230> gets<00:02:16.349> weapon<00:02:16.560> beforehand<00:02:16.950> but

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
risky someone gets weapon beforehand but

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.449 
risky someone gets weapon beforehand but
whatever<00:02:17.340> myzel<00:02:18.000> Yolo<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.450> go<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.110> here<00:02:19.459> grab

whatever myzel Yolo it go in here grab

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.920 
whatever myzel Yolo it go in here grab
another<00:02:20.640> second<00:02:21.090> tier<00:02:21.209> two<00:02:21.330> it's<00:02:21.630> Chester

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
another second tier two it's Chester

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.570 
another second tier two it's Chester
here<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:22.260> their<00:02:22.380> first<00:02:22.620> two<00:02:22.770> chests<00:02:23.130> or<00:02:23.190> tier<00:02:23.430> 2

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
here so their first two chests or tier 2

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.580 
here so their first two chests or tier 2
so<00:02:23.940> there's<00:02:24.599> also<00:02:24.750> like<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.020> tier<00:02:25.260> one<00:02:25.380> behind

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590
