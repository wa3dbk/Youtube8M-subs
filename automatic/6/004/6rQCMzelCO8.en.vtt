00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.640 
transmission and we set it in device
here<00:01:42.530> I'll<00:01:42.620> begin<00:01:42.800> to<00:01:43.160> drill<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.520> pilot<00:01:43.910> hole

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
here I'll begin to drill the pilot hole

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.140 
here I'll begin to drill the pilot hole
using<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:45.980> template<00:01:46.370> there<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.790> a<00:01:46.820> marked<00:01:47.150> X

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
using the template there is a marked X

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.400 
using the template there is a marked X
and<00:01:50.150> that's<00:01:50.480> where<00:01:50.660> you<00:01:50.720> begin<00:01:50.870> I<00:01:53.200> use<00:01:54.200> the

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
and that's where you begin I use the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.340 
and that's where you begin I use the
template<00:01:54.860> to<00:01:54.890> strike<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.550> pilot<00:01:56.090> divot<00:01:56.479> using<00:01:57.170> a

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
punch once the punch was made I was able

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.000 
punch once the punch was made I was able
to<00:02:00.650> remove<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.850> template<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:03.740> begin

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
to remove the template and the begin

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.270 
to remove the template and the begin
drilling<00:02:04.340> as<00:02:04.460> you<00:02:04.850> can<00:02:05.000> see<00:02:05.150> here<00:02:06.040> this<00:02:07.040> deal

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
drilling as you can see here this deal

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.070 
drilling as you can see here this deal
is<00:02:07.369> pretty<00:02:07.490> hard<00:02:07.790> so<00:02:08.420> just<00:02:08.540> take<00:02:08.720> your<00:02:08.750> time

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
is pretty hard so just take your time

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.710 
is pretty hard so just take your time
and<00:02:09.410> go<00:02:09.530> slow<00:02:09.580> with<00:02:10.580> your<00:02:10.760> drill<00:02:10.970> bit<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.450> if

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
and go slow with your drill bit and if

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.350 
and go slow with your drill bit and if
you'd<00:02:11.840> like<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:12.020> add<00:02:12.290> some<00:02:12.560> drill<00:02:13.550> lubrication

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
you'd like to add some drill lubrication

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.750 
you'd like to add some drill lubrication
you<00:02:14.510> certainly<00:02:14.870> can

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
you certainly can

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.270 
you certainly can
but<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.510> hardened<00:02:16.959> steel

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
but is hardened steel

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.130 
but is hardened steel
so<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.850> take<00:02:19.030> your<00:02:19.210> time<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.630> use<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.750> sharp

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
so to take your time and use a sharp

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.220 
so to take your time and use a sharp
drill<00:02:20.470> bit<00:02:21.270> with<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.420> clutch<00:02:22.660> arm<00:02:22.900> removed

you<00:02:23.410> can<00:02:23.440> see<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.890> hardware<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.310> we're

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
you can see the hardware that we're

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.070 
you can see the hardware that we're
going<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.640> be<00:02:24.760> concerned<00:02:25.090> with<00:02:25.330> for<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.780> next

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
going to be concerned with for the next

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.070 
going to be concerned with for the next
step<00:02:26.560> which<00:02:27.280> is<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.460> slave<00:02:27.790> adapter<00:02:28.480> we're

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
step which is the slave adapter we're

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.450 
step which is the slave adapter we're
going<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.260> be<00:02:29.320> using<00:02:29.440> these<00:02:29.650> two<00:02:29.860> bolts<00:02:30.220> here

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
going to be using these two bolts here

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.180 
going to be using these two bolts here
and<00:02:31.710> that's<00:02:32.710> where<00:02:32.860> it's<00:02:32.950> going<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.100> be

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
and that's where it's going to be

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.920 
and that's where it's going to be
mounted<00:02:33.490> now<00:02:34.240> you<00:02:34.330> can<00:02:34.450> see<00:02:34.570> we<00:02:34.690> got<00:02:34.780> these

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
mounted now you can see we got these

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.199 
mounted now you can see we got these
fancy<00:02:35.230> Ellyn<00:02:35.770> head<00:02:35.920> bolts<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.550> style<00:02:37.030> in

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
here inside the slave cylinder and as it

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.469 
here inside the slave cylinder and as it
goes<00:05:51.250> in<00:05:51.520> we<00:05:51.760> just<00:05:51.970> couldn't<00:05:52.120> you<00:05:52.450> just

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
goes in we just couldn't you just

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.300 
goes in we just couldn't you just
couldn't<00:05:52.870> bolt<00:05:53.290> this<00:05:53.440> all<00:05:53.650> the<00:05:53.770> way<00:05:53.860> on<00:05:54.040> and

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
couldn't bolt this all the way on and

couldn't bolt this all the way on and
then<00:05:55.120> get<00:05:55.330> this<00:05:55.479> arm<00:05:55.750> along<00:05:56.200> with<00:05:56.380> the<00:05:56.500> rod<00:05:56.650> in

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
then get this arm along with the rod in

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.350 
then get this arm along with the rod in
at<00:05:56.919> the<00:05:57.010> same<00:05:57.220> time<00:05:57.460> so<00:05:57.669> that's<00:05:57.760> basically<00:05:58.150> how

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
at the same time so that's basically how

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.940 
at the same time so that's basically how
you're<00:05:58.479> gonna<00:05:58.540> have<00:05:58.720> to<00:05:58.810> do<00:05:58.930> it<00:05:59.050> then<00:05:59.560> add<00:05:59.770> the

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950 
you're gonna have to do it then add the

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.620 
you're gonna have to do it then add the
other<00:05:59.979> nut<00:06:00.310> in<00:06:00.520> washer<00:06:00.940> or<00:06:01.150> the<00:06:01.240> other<00:06:01.360> bolt

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
other nut in washer or the other bolt

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.850 
other nut in washer or the other bolt
and<00:06:01.750> washer<00:06:02.100> to<00:06:03.100> the<00:06:03.160> other<00:06:03.370> side<00:06:03.750> and<00:06:04.860> that's

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
and washer to the other side and that's

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.300 
and washer to the other side and that's
pretty<00:06:06.160> much<00:06:06.310> it<00:06:06.580> this<00:06:06.820> is<00:06:07.030> the<00:06:07.270> end<00:06:07.300> of<00:06:07.630> it<00:06:07.750> so

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
pretty much it this is the end of it so

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.770 
pretty much it this is the end of it so
if<00:06:09.310> you<00:06:09.520> have<00:06:09.640> a<00:06:09.669> cable<00:06:09.880> transmission<00:06:10.540> and<00:06:10.720> you

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
if you have a cable transmission and you

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.810 
if you have a cable transmission and you
want<00:06:10.960> to<00:06:11.020> keep<00:06:11.140> your<00:06:11.260> cable<00:06:11.710> transmission<00:06:12.130> but

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
want to keep your cable transmission but

with it then this is one option that
we've<00:06:16.870> been<00:06:17.020> able<00:06:17.110> to<00:06:17.229> figure<00:06:17.530> out<00:06:17.650> um<00:06:18.150> you<00:06:19.150> can

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
we've been able to figure out um you can

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.730 
we've been able to figure out um you can
retain<00:06:19.720> your<00:06:19.840> transmission<00:06:20.350> say<00:06:20.440> if<00:06:20.500> you<00:06:20.590> have

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
retain your transmission say if you have

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.850 
retain your transmission say if you have
an<00:06:20.860> acura<00:06:21.250> integra<00:06:21.340> like<00:06:21.910> a<00:06:21.940> DA<00:06:22.270> style<00:06:22.660> and<00:06:23.110> you

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
an acura integra like a DA style and you

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.690 
an acura integra like a DA style and you
want<00:06:24.040> to<00:06:24.100> get<00:06:24.220> rid<00:06:24.370> of<00:06:24.400> the<00:06:24.970> clutch<00:06:25.180> cable<00:06:25.479> and

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
want to get rid of the clutch cable and

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.980 
want to get rid of the clutch cable and
but<00:06:27.700> you<00:06:27.789> still<00:06:27.970> want<00:06:28.090> to<00:06:28.120> go<00:06:28.210> hydro<00:06:28.599> this<00:06:28.840> is

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
but you still want to go hydro this is

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.330 
but you still want to go hydro this is
one<00:06:29.169> way<00:06:29.289> we<00:06:29.470> have<00:06:29.590> a<00:06:29.620> few<00:06:29.830> customers<00:06:30.190> out

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
one way we have a few customers out

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.860 
one way we have a few customers out
there<00:06:30.370> using<00:06:30.789> this<00:06:30.880> this<00:06:31.419> is<00:06:31.510> actually<00:06:31.840> a

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
there using this this is actually a

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.510 
there using this this is actually a
first<00:06:32.110> install<00:06:32.500> video<00:06:32.770> showing<00:06:33.039> you<00:06:33.130> how

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
first install video showing you how

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.610 
first install video showing you how
going<00:06:33.610> to<00:06:33.669> work<00:06:34.319> hospital<00:06:35.319> actually

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
going to work hospital actually

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.129 
going to work hospital actually
initially<00:06:36.009> designed<00:06:36.160> this<00:06:36.490> to<00:06:37.000> work<00:06:37.150> with<00:06:37.539> in

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
initially designed this to work with in

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.559 
initially designed this to work with in
an<00:06:38.379> eg<00:06:38.889> it<00:06:39.280> was<00:06:39.490> their<00:06:39.910> budget<00:06:40.300> build<00:06:40.449> you

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:40.569 
an eg it was their budget build you

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:41.730 
an eg it was their budget build you
could<00:06:40.720> put<00:06:40.840> like<00:06:40.870> a<00:06:40.990> cable<00:06:41.199> v-series

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
could put like a cable v-series

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:47.760 
could put like a cable v-series
transmission<00:06:42.310> in<00:06:42.819> your<00:06:43.300> eg<00:06:43.690> um<00:06:46.620> but<00:06:47.620> that's

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
transmission in your eg um but that's

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.110 
transmission in your eg um but that's
not<00:06:47.889> the<00:06:47.979> case<00:06:48.099> anymore<00:06:48.370> no<00:06:48.580> one<00:06:48.669> wants<00:06:48.849> cable

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
not the case anymore no one wants cable

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.879 
not the case anymore no one wants cable
transmission<00:06:49.479> everyone's<00:06:49.900> goal<00:06:50.080> hydro<00:06:50.500> but

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 
transmission everyone's goal hydro but

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:53.550 
transmission everyone's goal hydro but
some<00:06:51.129> people<00:06:51.370> are<00:06:51.460> diehard<00:06:51.810> cable<00:06:52.810> guys<00:06:52.990> cable

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
some people are diehard cable guys cable

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.779 
some people are diehard cable guys cable
transmissions<00:06:54.039> like<00:06:54.220> the<00:06:54.340> ys<00:06:54.610> one

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:54.789 
transmissions like the ys one

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.999 
transmissions like the ys one
transmissions<00:06:55.440> and<00:06:56.440> this<00:06:56.620> is<00:06:56.710> one<00:06:56.860> way<00:06:56.979> to

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:57.009 
transmissions and this is one way to

00:06:57.009 --> 00:06:59.520 
transmissions and this is one way to
retain<00:06:57.759> that<00:06:57.970> transmission<00:06:58.479> but<00:06:59.229> still

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
retain that transmission but still

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.529 
retain that transmission but still
upgrade<00:06:59.830> to<00:07:00.490> the<00:07:00.610> hydraulic<00:07:01.030> system<00:07:01.330> as<00:07:01.449> you

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:01.539 
upgrade to the hydraulic system as you

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:03.089 
upgrade to the hydraulic system as you
can<00:07:01.569> see<00:07:01.750> here<00:07:01.990> and<00:07:02.139> it's<00:07:02.560> pretty<00:07:02.680> trick<00:07:02.889> piece

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:03.099 
can see here and it's pretty trick piece

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:14.570 
can see here and it's pretty trick piece
if<00:07:03.970> I<00:07:04.330> do<00:07:04.389> say<00:07:04.659> so<00:07:04.720> myself

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:14.580 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.639
