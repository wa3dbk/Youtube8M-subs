00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.750
 a question 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.590
 I sometimes feel 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.590
 go back to your match 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.869
 so if the cash 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.990
 to see if I'm happy at the end of 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.610
 my match of my performance 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.000
 I set myself two objectives in one 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.669
 match the first not to influence the 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.059
 Match result 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:37.790
 not influenced his match final and 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:42.820
 protect the players do you experience from 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:47.960
 pleasure when you arbitrate the pleasure 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:50.839
 to make decisions to have to be 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.900
 an actor finally one of a show 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:58.519
 athletic here 's having one to hold a 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:02.000
 role that is a role to responsibility on 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.479
 lives our match we live in the 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.729
 bad moments 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:07.340
 sometimes we are angry too we are in 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.479
 anger and then sometimes we are we are 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.360
 damn well what so we show it 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.220
 me for me it's part of me 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.500
 find who has nothing worse that's my 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.500
 point of view yet there nothing worse on 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.870
 a football field to have 22 players 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.820
 as I said they live you 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.980
 stuff permanently you live from 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.530
 emotions in a split second the 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.910
 total happiness to despair the 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.980
 deeper in a split second 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.480
 and you live for 90 minutes full 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.680
 full of emotions line and then all the 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.420
 world sees it and in the middle we would like 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.650
 to have a boy who is linear to 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:48.110
 possible and we would pass for robots 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.060
 I tell our young referees here 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.820
 but show that you are happy 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.400
 to be on the ground and show that it 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.770
 I'm happy to be there show you 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.490
 did you like this sport then time in 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.940
 time show that it's not going to show that 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.940
 that's more possible 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.470
 show you will not accept this kind 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.200
 of things and then three minutes after 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.549
 show again you are happy 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.370
 we are not the stars like the 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.239
 match years 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.870
 it's the players the star at esta but 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.610
 we are we are withdrawn I 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.989
 think our role is to do 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.970
 so that put them in the 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.680
 best provisions 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.879
 the players so that they can 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.140
 propose the best show 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.440
 here it is that here it is 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.799
 how do I see my mission to arbitrate 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.239
 put them in the best 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.220
 provisions it's also tensions of 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.720
 time he is sanctioned for not that 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.030
 so that it stays within the framework of this 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.180
 who is allowed but that's but it's done 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.709
 part for me to put people in 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.370
 the best provisions so much 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.129
 sanction 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.739
 precisely the sanction she she must 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.900
 also help to make sure to have the 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.879
 best sports show it's like 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.040
 that I see there my mission but 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:02.400
 certainly not less as we look 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.870
 a case as we look at we look 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.349
 the players it is they who create the 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.739
 show 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:12.520
 you have already done referee 1.28 with 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:16.030
 the stake and you have a good match 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.740
 saw the pressure or felt not well 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.170
 this year but the year before I had 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.260
 had the chance to be nominated for 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.920
 referee the final of the Coupe de France 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.290
 between paris and lille it happens at 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.580
 Stade de France there was 80 thousand 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.920
 people the president of the republic 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.100
 and tv etc etc 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.340
 yes there was pressure and that makes 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.420
 1 1 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.500
 this volume 1 but every game how 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.910
 do you want to keep calm 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.740
 when players come screaming at you 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.310
 above 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:56.740
 the right question that's things 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:59.500
 we work when doing the 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.780
 course on Conflict Management 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.150
 things like that assume that 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.920
 when there is a conflict that is not it 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.060
 because at some point in the 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:13.360
 nobody or both people are are 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:16.560
 used put my sentence are hot 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.330
 boiling and there is a lot of emotion 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.950
 that we have trouble controlling and that's 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.270
 incidentally for that happens the clash 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.260
 what is it because at one point we 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.990
 may find more words for 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.640
 discuss then when there is when we have 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.500
 no longer have the words that come to the 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.060
 mouth and ben we use something else 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.340
 to make themselves understood and that's the 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.169
 gestures his intonations of the voice that 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.389
 mounted 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:42.639
 and control much more more 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:43.169
 there and six months in the middle to bring back the 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.330
 calm 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:49.180
 I have two solutions either I put myself 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.490
 then a level of excitement for 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:57.909
 try to enter the dialogue either 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:05:01.539
 I try 2.2 by the lowest I 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:04.719
 think the calm calm 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:09.219
 amen will inevitably bring calm in front 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:10.479
 of us and sometimes without words simply 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:12.550
 when you have someone who is 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:16.930
 upset as not possible and simply 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:22.389
 you look calmly and ben 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:24.400
 thermometer he dropped so often he 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:28.120
 do not say much simply 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.819
 stay calm and by cons 3 4 minutes 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.289
 after all, that's what I'm trying 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:34.839
 to do three four minutes hardly 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:38.020
 try to iron next to the player there 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:39.520
 the thermometer it will be down to me 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.870
 I would already think of the words that I 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.189
 will use to explain to him 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.050
 maybe what happened or how 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:49.029
 I saw the situation 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.949
 alas that moment we can return to 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:53.229
 communication but on the moment 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:55.360
 at the moment when his boils we can not 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:57.699
 do big thing I remember 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.439
 it was a match but a player who makes 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:02.349
 a huge tackle so thankfully they 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:05.020
 pass by the player but something 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:09.639
 butcher thing not he misses the 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.990
 player and there I tried to get in 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:14.259
 communication and I was hot boiling 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.270
 like him, we were 4 meters away and I 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:17.409
 said yes we calm down I want to see more 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.209
 it 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:23.769
 him he was not ready to listen to him he 

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:24.969
 send the sauce you did not talk 

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:26.379
 like that while I was using words 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:29.439
 which was very very simple but it was 

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:30.459
 cautious in good condition I understood everything from 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:33.669
 following that it was not necessary to discuss there 

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:35.019
 on the other hand 3 4 minutes after I got 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:37.599
 unscrambled to iron next to him 

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:39.129
 and well he the player he came to 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:40.779
 he told me without me anything 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:44.610
 to say yes excuse me even on a 

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:44.610
 referee I should not have been upset 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:49.599
 but I understood the message I will not do 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:51.149
 more me I tell him too I would have 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:53.439
 I did not get upset as I got upset 

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:55.829
 but it's not, and we've been in the 

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:58.929
 hand and the player and the player left 

00:06:55.829 --> 00:07:00.279
 but fits since after the person 

00:06:58.929 --> 00:07:01.569
 in front is created stronger and after 

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:04.269
 because we want to be heard 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:06.959
 so after that pile up beefy 1k 

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:06.959
 monday is exposing himself
