of course and okay um a little

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:38.009 
of course and okay um a little
demonstration<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:26.240> turn<00:00:27.240> them

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:51.120 

okay<00:00:40.930> 01

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:01:02.389 

three

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:22.060 

seven

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.300 

yes<00:01:22.730> five

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
yes five

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:32.010 
yes five
and<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:26.170> on<00:01:29.579> six<00:01:30.579> foot<00:01:30.820> means<00:01:31.119> 2<00:01:31.689> to<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.869> power

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
and so on six foot means 2 to the power

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.300 
and so on six foot means 2 to the power
6<00:01:32.649> numbers<00:01:33.539> because<00:01:34.539> zero<00:01:35.110> counts<00:01:35.649> the

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
6 numbers because zero counts the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:50.540 
6 numbers because zero counts the
highest<00:01:36.640> number<00:01:36.970> is<00:01:39.600> 63

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.790

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
and there it is it's an idol a time of

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.130 
and there it is it's an idol a time of
course<00:01:56.870> because<00:01:57.870> there's<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.320> huge<00:01:59.100> area<00:02:00.140> where

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
course because there's a huge area where

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.430 
course because there's a huge area where
the<00:02:01.260> power<00:02:01.530> must<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:02.930> transported<00:02:03.930> or<00:02:04.110> route
