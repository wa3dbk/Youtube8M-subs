really really stick on well so that's

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.229 
really really stick on well so that's
probably<00:02:34.620> can<00:02:34.769> be<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.190> positive<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.120> negative

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.140 
and I can eat and drink and it would be
perfect<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:10.680> only<00:03:11.220> problems<00:03:11.880> that<00:03:12.060> I've

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
perfect and the only problems that I've

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.220 
perfect and the only problems that I've
had<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.959> one<00:03:13.829> negative<00:03:14.579> about<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.510> entire

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
had and one negative about the entire

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.740 
had and one negative about the entire
collection<00:03:16.709> is<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.790> they<00:03:17.940> don't<00:03:18.239> smell<00:03:18.690> very

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
collection is that they don't smell very

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.840 
collection is that they don't smell very
nice<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:19.799> think<00:03:19.829> a<00:03:20.280> lot<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.459> people<00:03:20.760> have

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
nice and I think a lot of people have

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.509 
nice and I think a lot of people have
said<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.329> and<00:03:21.630> although<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.620> lipstick<00:03:22.980> okay

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
said this and although in lipstick okay

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.990 
said this and although in lipstick okay
you<00:03:23.670> don't<00:03:23.820> expect<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.359> to<00:03:24.420> smell<00:03:24.750> amazing<00:03:24.959> and

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
you don't expect it to smell amazing and

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.690 
you don't expect it to smell amazing and
but<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.209> doesn't<00:03:27.630> smell<00:03:28.049> very<00:03:28.440> very<00:03:29.130> nice<00:03:29.340> they

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
but it doesn't smell very very nice they

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.400 
but it doesn't smell very very nice they
smell<00:03:30.120> really<00:03:30.799> I've<00:03:32.209> really<00:03:33.209> got<00:03:33.510> chemically

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410

a<00:03:34.650> chemical<00:03:35.459> like<00:03:35.640> chemicals<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:36.329> think<00:03:36.630> that's

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
a chemical like chemicals I think that's

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.569 
a chemical like chemicals I think that's
what<00:03:37.530> they<00:03:37.650> smell<00:03:37.859> like<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:38.160> that<00:03:38.250> sounds

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.400 
what they smell like and that sounds
really<00:03:38.790> bad<00:03:38.910> why<00:03:39.420> do<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.810> use<00:03:39.989> it<00:03:40.019> if<00:03:40.260> it

really bad why do you use it if it

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.559 
really bad why do you use it if it
sounds<00:03:40.650> like<00:03:40.739> chemicals<00:03:41.130> but<00:03:41.359> it's<00:03:42.359> not<00:03:42.540> a

sounds like chemicals but it's not a

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.870 
sounds like chemicals but it's not a
really<00:03:43.019> really<00:03:43.380> really<00:03:43.620> bad<00:03:43.890> smell<00:03:44.160> it's<00:03:44.640> just

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
really really really bad smell it's just

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.050 
really really really bad smell it's just
not<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.090> very<00:03:45.390> nice<00:03:45.600> one<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:47.400> if<00:03:47.549> they<00:03:47.700> get<00:03:47.910> one

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
not a very nice one so if they get one

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.759 
not a very nice one so if they get one
recommendation<00:03:48.420> if<00:03:48.959> they<00:03:49.109> could<00:03:49.319> change<00:03:49.350> the

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
recommendation if they could change the

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.099 
recommendation if they could change the
smell<00:03:49.980> of<00:03:50.010> those<00:03:50.310> I'm<00:03:51.120> sure<00:03:51.420> more<00:03:51.750> people

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
smell of those I'm sure more people

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.729 
smell of those I'm sure more people
would<00:03:52.230> be<00:03:52.380> happier<00:03:52.859> with<00:03:53.040> them<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:54.590> some<00:03:55.590> of

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
would be happier with them and some of

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.879 
would be happier with them and some of
them<00:03:55.950> I<00:03:56.370> think<00:03:56.579> look<00:03:57.329> quite<00:03:57.630> similar<00:03:58.139> now<00:03:58.470> and

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
this one's more like a brick orange

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.910 
this one's more like a brick orange
rather<00:04:51.940> than<00:04:52.150> a<00:04:52.240> peach<00:04:52.510> on<00:04:52.810> me<00:04:53.440> anyway<00:04:53.710> I<00:04:53.740> think

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
rather than a peach on me anyway I think

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.010 
rather than a peach on me anyway I think
it's<00:04:54.070> because<00:04:54.400> I've<00:04:54.640> got<00:04:54.910> quite<00:04:55.540> pigmented

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
it's because I've got quite pigmented

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.260 
it's because I've got quite pigmented
lips<00:04:56.410> anyway<00:04:56.740> my<00:04:57.160> lips<00:04:57.340> are<00:04:57.460> quite<00:04:57.580> rosy<00:04:58.030> and

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
um this one cut it makes it look a bit

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.010 
um this one cut it makes it look a bit
darker<00:05:01.960> so<00:05:01.990> I<00:05:02.620> think<00:05:03.310> that's<00:05:03.730> probably<00:05:03.970> why<00:05:04.420> so

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
darker so I think that's probably why so

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.110 
darker so I think that's probably why so
it's<00:05:05.170> more<00:05:05.320> like<00:05:05.470> a<00:05:05.620> brick<00:05:05.920> red<00:05:06.370> for<00:05:06.640> me<00:05:06.760> brick

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.550 
and that right amount of coverage but
you<00:06:09.700> only<00:06:10.270> really<00:06:10.600> want<00:06:10.780> to<00:06:10.900> apply<00:06:11.140> it<00:06:11.200> once<00:06:11.350> or

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
you only really want to apply it once or

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.290 
you only really want to apply it once or
twice<00:06:11.590> you<00:06:12.190> don't<00:06:12.220> want<00:06:12.520> to<00:06:12.580> probably<00:06:13.000> pride

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
twice you don't want to probably pride

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.420 
twice you don't want to probably pride
this<00:06:13.510> about<00:06:13.690> four<00:06:14.020> times<00:06:14.350> to<00:06:14.800> get<00:06:14.950> it<00:06:15.010> to<00:06:15.190> look

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430

like this so maybe although the color is
beautiful<00:06:18.010> I<00:06:18.370> probably<00:06:18.700> wouldn't<00:06:19.060> recommend
