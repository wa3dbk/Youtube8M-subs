00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.490 
and sauerkraut
I<00:06:45.180> think<00:06:45.509> the<00:06:45.599> corn<00:06:45.870> adds<00:06:46.080> a<00:06:46.199> little<00:06:46.289> sweetness

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
I think the corn adds a little sweetness

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.640 
I think the corn adds a little sweetness
to<00:06:47.099> the<00:06:47.280> sourness<00:06:47.849> of<00:06:48.090> the<00:06:48.210> sauerkraut<00:06:48.539> and<00:06:48.810> I

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650 
to the sourness of the sauerkraut and I

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.800 
to the sourness of the sauerkraut and I
