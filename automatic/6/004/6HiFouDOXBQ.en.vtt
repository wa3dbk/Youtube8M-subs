yesterday<00:02:22.920> might<00:02:23.490> have<00:02:23.640> just<00:02:23.850> been<00:02:24.860> an

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
yesterday might have just been an

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:42.790 
yesterday might have just been an
unusual<00:02:26.400> event<00:02:29.209> for<00:02:30.209> all<00:02:30.360> we<00:02:30.570> know

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.800 

because<00:02:43.550> he's<00:02:43.730> not<00:02:43.910> standing<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.390> just<00:02:44.630> work

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
because he's not standing you just work

00:02:44.810 --> 00:03:01.350 
because he's not standing you just work
your<00:02:44.840> way<00:02:45.020> is<00:02:45.440> he

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.630 

we're<00:03:02.360> just<00:03:02.540> flailing<00:03:02.930> that<00:03:03.350> warm<00:03:04.190> around<00:03:04.520> a

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
we're just flailing that warm around a

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:13.160 
we're just flailing that warm around a
little<00:03:04.790> bit<00:03:05.030> see<00:03:05.390> if<00:03:05.480> anybody<00:03:05.840> notices<00:03:06.410> it

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.320 

it's<00:03:13.680> interesting<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.460> float<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:15.000> over

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
it's interesting that that float is over

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.240 
it's interesting that that float is over
there<00:03:15.510> by<00:03:15.780> brush<00:03:16.200> sticking<00:03:16.680> up<00:03:16.800> out<00:03:16.950> of<00:03:16.980> the

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
there by brush sticking up out of the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.880 
there by brush sticking up out of the
water

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
water

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.960 
water
suppose<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.040> fish<00:03:20.250> got<00:03:20.460> down<00:03:20.670> there<00:03:20.910> and

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
suppose the fish got down there and

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.230 
suppose the fish got down there and
tangled<00:03:21.420> himself<00:03:21.750> again<00:03:22.520> he<00:03:23.520> was<00:03:23.670> tangled<00:03:23.970> up

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
tangled himself again he was tangled up

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:47.200 
tangled himself again he was tangled up
in<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:24.570> brush<00:03:24.810> for<00:03:25.110> a<00:03:25.140> while<00:03:25.290> yesterday

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.420 

I<00:03:47.300> think<00:03:47.960> Steve<00:03:48.140> has<00:03:48.320> to<00:03:48.470> position<00:03:48.920> himself<00:03:49.070> so

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
I think Steve has to position himself so

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.020 
I think Steve has to position himself so
that<00:03:49.460> the<00:03:49.700> Sun<00:03:49.940> is<00:03:50.090> not<00:03:50.240> directly<00:03:50.630> in<00:03:50.840> his<00:03:51.020> eyes

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
that the Sun is not directly in his eyes

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.850 
that the Sun is not directly in his eyes
he<00:03:53.030> had<00:03:53.480> bought<00:03:53.690> his<00:03:53.840> boots<00:03:54.110> on<00:03:54.350> which<00:03:54.710> he

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
he had bought his boots on which he

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.110 
he had bought his boots on which he
could<00:03:55.070> have<00:03:55.210> he<00:03:56.210> could<00:03:56.360> step<00:03:56.600> into<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:56.990> water

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
could have he could step into the water

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.310 
could have he could step into the water
and<00:03:59.120> get<00:03:59.300> fully<00:03:59.600> in<00:03:59.780> the<00:03:59.900> shade<00:04:00.200> but<00:04:02.290> c'est<00:04:03.290> la
