wall<00:02:07.990> in<00:02:08.500> underneath<00:02:08.770> here<00:02:09.630> see<00:02:10.630> I<00:02:10.720> don't<00:02:11.230> want

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380

to finish the whole way down inside

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.880 
to finish the whole way down inside
because<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.870> homeowner<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.380> never<00:02:14.560> gonna<00:02:14.740> be

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
because the homeowner is never gonna be

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.890 
because the homeowner is never gonna be
able<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.130> crawl<00:02:15.430> way<00:02:15.670> back<00:02:15.940> down<00:02:16.180> inside<00:02:16.630> here

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
able to crawl way back down inside here

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.960 
able to crawl way back down inside here
so<00:02:17.110> some<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.040> is<00:02:18.220> still<00:02:18.250> gonna<00:02:18.849> be

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
so some of this is still gonna be

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.870 
so some of this is still gonna be
unfinished<00:02:19.709> but<00:02:20.709> about<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.130> this<00:02:21.310> step<00:02:21.670> right

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
unfinished but about it this step right

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.660 
unfinished but about it this step right
here<00:02:22.380> I'm<00:02:23.380> gonna<00:02:23.560> drop<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.830> knee<00:02:24.160> wall<00:02:24.400> down

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
here I'm gonna drop a knee wall down

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.050 
here I'm gonna drop a knee wall down
underneath<00:02:25.210> the<00:02:25.420> stairs<00:02:25.720> here

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
underneath the stairs here

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.990 
underneath the stairs here
all<00:02:26.989> right<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:28.099> can<00:02:28.250> see<00:02:28.459> if<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:28.610> can<00:02:28.730> see<00:02:28.880> my

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
all right you can see if you can see my

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.210 
all right you can see if you can see my
tape<00:02:29.239> there<00:02:29.540> it's<00:02:30.230> gonna<00:02:30.319> be<00:02:30.500> about<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.800> 46-inch

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
tape there it's gonna be about a 46-inch

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.309 
tape there it's gonna be about a 46-inch
new<00:02:31.940> wall<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.330> I'm<00:02:32.420> gonna<00:02:32.599> I'm<00:02:32.870> gonna<00:02:33.080> build

new wall that I'm gonna I'm gonna build
right<00:02:33.440> underneath<00:02:34.010> this<00:02:34.220> step<00:02:34.580> I<00:02:34.880> think

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
right underneath this step I think

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.510 
right underneath this step I think
that'll<00:02:35.569> close<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:36.319> section<00:02:37.040> off<00:02:37.250> down

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
that'll close that section off down

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.680 
that'll close that section off down
there<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:37.880> then<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.150> will<00:02:38.330> remain

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
there and then that will remain

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.910 
there and then that will remain
unfinished<00:02:39.230> down<00:02:39.560> in<00:02:39.770> there<00:02:39.980> but<00:02:40.730> from<00:02:41.060> here

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
unfinished down in there but from here

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.250 
unfinished down in there but from here
and<00:02:42.920> that's<00:02:43.099> the<00:02:43.250> area<00:02:43.640> in<00:02:43.700> here<00:02:43.940> on<00:02:44.180> in<00:02:44.450> this

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
and that's the area in here on in this

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.130 
and that's the area in here on in this
will<00:02:45.440> all<00:02:45.590> be<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.890> finished<00:02:46.250> space<00:02:46.810> so<00:02:47.810> let<00:02:48.080> me

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
will all be the finished space so let me

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.330 
will all be the finished space so let me
build<00:02:48.319> that<00:02:48.440> knee<00:02:48.620> wall<00:02:48.860> I'll<00:02:48.980> show<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:49.190> what
