00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.769
 my mother with global warming 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:09.450
 module in very good discrete shots 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:11.009
 How are we doing? 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.079
 I think we are very good we are in 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.030
 another video and this time I do not bring a video 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:17.130
 of fifa guys yes you have all the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.350
 relationship of the world with the channel because 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.510
 we have a new wall intro many of 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.000
 you know you were not around 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.730
 still other habits you will have given 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.240
 mind that I stopped using the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.270
 intro is worth I had an intro if he does 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.129
 time he put it and had some what 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.030
 you have seen others I will not put it 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.030
 what do you think 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.480
 how beautiful the intro 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.810
 wonderful they 're serious guys the intro 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.790
 I made it to a boy that was not his style 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.070
 to do intros and therefore therefore I 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.470
 did a little bit what he could and therefore 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.110
 I thank you very much in your 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.720
 day but I think you had to evolve 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.930
 you had to take a leap and you had to bring 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.680
 a good intro I do not know something more more 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.409
 professional type is something more more more than 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.439
 fucking mother so nothing then 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.530
 I arranged to contact a person 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:32.859
 of cult 'nz that you have below you have your 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.539
 channel go through there the fly version the 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:36.340
 intros he does and he is pretty dedicated 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.619
 make the theme of the intros and so on 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.390
 that you know how to go through there and take a 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.469
 look at what makes it amazing 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.420
 and we ask for an intro and look at the 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:49.179

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.500
