00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.820
 Great to have you with us on the day offer we spoke on a bonus offer 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.430
 Yesterday little about you on the masks 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.480
 Suggestion for this Kinda version 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.009
 At one point he was talking about moving the evacuated tube which is kind 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.280
 Like 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.869
 The tunnels that are used to convey the idea are that 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.390
 The transfer will be very fast and very safe The new idea is hyper 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.850
 Episodes 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.619
 Which would actually be a tube system instead of an underground 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.900
 A railway tunnel or it's just a tube system and that's these electromagnetic tubes 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.400
 go run 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.420
 Initially along the I-5 corridor so you can get it from San Francisco to Los Angeles 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.180
 Los really really quick 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.809
 Very very cool idea too much information on on 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.160
 On this subject online I do not want to go through the details and I think it was kinda 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.460
 I covered so much but what I want to talk about is something else 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.660
 And we have to be ready for major oil companies 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.300
 To press hard against the hyper ring 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.539
 We have given an example for some time now which is 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.010
 About when we talk about why we do not have the fastest trains in the United States 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.120
 Example 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.869
 Is that when I fly down from our present we have at least the next two weeks 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.540
 The headquarters of David's Pakman show in Massachusetts to the capital 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.950
 If I wanted to pay to the capital depending on the traffic but about seven to eight hours 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.490
 Disk 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.650
 I want to take the train as it's about seven and a half hours somewhere between 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.400
 7N eight hours by train 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.640
 I want to fly it for a journey of 50 minutes 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.970
 Nearly fifty to sixty minutes flying but I gotta drive 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.049
 40 mins to the airport I gotta be there an hour before the down in an hour and 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:34.829
 40 minutes 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.009
 Then I've been flying for 50 minutes so far and I'm on 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.619
 I know about the posts three hours then I gotta get the airport even 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:42.560
 On and so forth 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.509
 If we had trains faster the general right so get me there 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.700
 Instead there are seven or eight hours in something more like three and a half years in 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.460
 four 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.270
 Suddenly I'm not flying and I certainly will not consider driving 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.649
 Which I think now I would like to do if it was like something last minute I had to go 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:01.890
 To Washington, DC 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.320
 Airplane Flight 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.470
 Both the car lobby have 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.780
 Strong interest in lobbying against train travel faster 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.489
 This will be the same fact 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.599
 We are going to see the airlines pressure against those who fly in San Francisco to 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.050
 LA several times a day 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.360
 We're going to see cars though it's a nightmare to pay 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.599
 In this part of the country 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.670
 We will see cars press hard to go against this 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.000
 I think it's good to be aware that Lewis whenever we talk about any of the 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.910
 These new lobbying technologies are very powerful 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.150
 Now we have to remember to think they will become four against this 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.569
 Because in fact it will make a difference in how likely it is to happen 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.959
 Right this is really very bad of course these lobbyists will never 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.090
 Be able to get someone like Mike the mosque 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.540
 I knew they could get politicians to have to agree 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.769
 It was exactly these rails so we'll see you will not buy you the one you should put 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:00.530
 Possible 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.360
 But you are going to be able to buy politicians who will stand in the way 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.370
 Even obtaining approval permits and everything else would be necessary 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.080
 For this
