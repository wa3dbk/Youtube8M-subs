layer<00:05:55.699> is<00:05:55.880> enough<00:05:56.090> if<00:05:56.210> you<00:05:56.270> see<00:05:56.419> any<00:05:56.509> thick

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
layer is enough if you see any thick

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.629 
layer is enough if you see any thick
pieces<00:05:57.020> get<00:05:57.470> rid<00:05:57.620> of<00:05:57.650> them<00:05:57.770> because<00:05:58.220> the<00:05:58.430> thin

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
pieces get rid of them because the thin

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.499 
pieces get rid of them because the thin
ones<00:05:58.849> do<00:05:59.030> better<00:06:00.400> so<00:06:01.400> and<00:06:01.940> this<00:06:02.120> is<00:06:02.300> obviously

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
ones do better so and this is obviously

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:09.040 
ones do better so and this is obviously
cooled<00:06:03.229> down<00:06:03.409> enough<00:06:03.470> so<00:06:03.979> I<00:06:04.009> can<00:06:04.130> handle<00:06:04.819> it<00:06:08.050> we

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
cooled down enough so I can handle it we

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.749 
cooled down enough so I can handle it we
