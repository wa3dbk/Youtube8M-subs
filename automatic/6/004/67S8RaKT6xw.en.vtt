00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.480
 your home welcome to reviews tj 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.010
 we are in the world something concrete 2015 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.300
 from Barcelona and many of you already 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.460
 you know that the French manufacturer 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.960
 alcatel has gotten into the territory of 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.940
 the smart watch with an operating system 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.179
 own today we tell you everything about your 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.179
 watch 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.730
 and we're going to start with the section on 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.470
 design of this alcatel widget and we 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.390
 we have brought a very pleasant surprise 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.130
 when we have realized that 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.840
 brothers feel very, very good 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.250
 that said let's talk a little bit about 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.870
 the most important thing as it is has a 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.790
 round design much more similar what 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.230
 It is a traditional transfer and we have 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.520
 Unlike other watches we have some 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.500
 small marquistas of formats in 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.410
 store with traditional format when 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.430
 we have the clock in off format for 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.530
 that the clock really when I 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.239
 we logically ignite that is already finished 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.530
 that said we're going to focus on the 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.090
 next construction material that 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.229
 we found it on the strap in this case 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.420
 As you can see we have a black finish 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:55.190
 there are different versions some of 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.510
 they very funny and good a belt 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.339
 nylon that the truth that feels very 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.040
 well quite malleable and gives the feeling 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.790
 quite firmly close detail 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.140
 which is also usually quite 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.940
 important when we talk about any 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.280
 smartware and go from any watch 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.200
 traditional a metallic close pretty 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.700
 typical as the clock of a lifetime 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.380
 and we can also have 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.090
 put on the wrist without too many 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.530
 problems and there will be that easy to 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.630
 close it seems a foolishness of the balloon of 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.580
 fitz but it's not always usual 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.080
 other details that this watch has 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.920
 alcatel we find it in the part 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.840
 rear 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.100
 we quickly found the reader of 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.960
 heart rate 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.880
 we'll talk a little more in a finish 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.810
 black and eye because on the right edge 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.220
 we also find a 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.960
 particularity that many watches 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.940
 they incorporate we have a little button on 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.979
 which, as you can see, we will be able to wake up 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.630
 our bone following with the design 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.100
 there is a detail that can not be missed as 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.290
 we talk about a clock and that practically 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.149
 all incorporate and in the resistance to 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.560
 water and dust because in this case the 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.710
 French manufacturer has opted for the 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.210
 ip67 protection an important detail 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.280
 so that we want to shower ourselves 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.110
 we want to bathe we will not have any 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.250
 problem and it's your turn to put a 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.600
 little hand to the hardware now a 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.610
 little of the specifications that 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.229
 has this clock of French origin and 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.210
 let's start with the battery 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.560
 perhaps the most important when we speak 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.060
 of any kind of watch since 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.399
 we all know that it is perhaps one of the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.489
 touch stones most important battery 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.319
 of 210 thousand amps from the manufacturer 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.269
 will not be played practically two 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.860
 days of autonomy we will see how it is 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.870
 involves especially keep in mind that 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.880
 it has its own operating system but 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.200
 the most differential and possibly one of 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.870
 the things that we liked most about 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.299
 this clock is the method of loading anything 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.560
 It's a load and cables hanging but 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.750
 that at one end we have a 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.159
 usb connector which we will be able to 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.720
 connect a power outlet or 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.030
 our laptop and we will be able to 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.920
 easily load it without a doubt a factor 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.450
 differential other details that you should 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.060
 know what is this alcatel watch 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.650
 it is accelerometer gyroscope altimeter and 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.150
 heart rate sensor 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.099
 logically these are the parameters that 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.900
 is going to monitor 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.790
 be able to carry in addition to the management of 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.260
 notifications a little bit more the life 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.000
 healthy to be able to control what is 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.590
 our activity through steps and the 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.780
 distance that we have traveled even 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.250
 the calories that we have burned with a 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.019
 interface that really reminds us 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.120
 quite the playing pretty 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.230
 minimalist we will talk about the software 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.329
 but hey have some details that 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.430
 we liked quite other details 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.260
 we have nfc in this case on the strap 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.609
 because we want to match it with our 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.200
 smartphone and to create a 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.060
 file transfer of everything that 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.590
 have monitored much more 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.569
 quick besides this we have a 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.599
 vibrator and could not logically be missing 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.129
 bluetooth 4.0 we could not stop 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.750
 talk about the section of the screen maybe 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.310
 one of the most important when 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.750
 we talk about any smart watch in 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.829
 this case we have a screen a 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.750
 little bit smaller and it's something that 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.580
 thank you so you can 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.160
 more portable for any kind of 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.070
 public specifically one like 22 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.550
 inches with ips technology and a 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.170
 resolution of 240 x 204 especially not 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.150
 we know the attention of the interpretation 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.200
 of the colors and the level of brightness and 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.610
 now to go finishing we are going to 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.440
 focus on the software section 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.610
 perhaps the most important thing we are seeing 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.890
 here at the fair that many devices 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.450
 opt for android wear possibly the 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.520
 operating system that we like the most for 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.260
 smart watch but in this case manufacturer 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.970
 French has opted for proprietary software 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
 we will see that it has some details that 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.330
 we liked some who can 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.070
 have polished but generally not 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.270
 is not bad as we see we have a 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.670
 small interface based on different 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.810
 grids of different colors in the 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.760
 which we will see for example the 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.739
 information in this case what we have 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.930
 made hours of dream activity that we have 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.130
 finished if we give the button 6 we go to 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.140
 go back and for example the 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.970
 climatological information in a way 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.410
 very visual we will be able to see as if 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.970
 out of some widgets 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.250
 different different locations 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.750
 temperatures other examples so that 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.460
 see what it is capable of if we give the 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.169
 timer to the clock we will be able to 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.870
 activate another very simple way like 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.430
 You see the interface seems very minimalist 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.420
 very clean and to tell the truth 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.830
 liked quite 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.720
 there are other details as well as 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.700
 example we can make use of a compass 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.350
 simply because we have lost 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.540
 and we are rotating we will never lose the 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.160
 north to finish this walk through 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.690
 the alcatel website also tell you that 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.150
 we have the option of making a trigger 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.200
 of camera if we hit the button 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.030
 it will automatically synchronize with 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.340
 our device that we have 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.630
 matched only we're going to have to 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.460
 give the trigger and shape 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.620
 automatic our alcatel terminal 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.240
 is going to take the photograph there is some 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.160
 another detail also that we do not leave 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.840
 we want there is some other detail that does not 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.610
 we want to ignore as is that of the 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.170
 personalization and is that by the 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.850
 we will be able to change the watts 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.650
 you see is also in a very 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.480
 simple in the application we have told you 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.830
 we can change the background and from here 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.470
 we will choose if we want a format 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.270
 digital with the more traditional this has 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.130
 been the information and as you have seen 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.470
 Well, hey, it seems pretty curious, 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.090
 pretty successful design an interface and 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.710
 an operating system that is true that 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.540
 it's not our favorite that maybe we choose 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.370
 more a little bit for android war but 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.840
 good can meet the needs of 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.610
 many users we hope you have 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.350
 really liked this video remember to give it 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.350
 like and share it until later
