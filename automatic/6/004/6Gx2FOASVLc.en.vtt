 yes from another like the one from another computer 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.960
 Other thing I can not test itself 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.729
 This is why I can not use it on the 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.449
 my own computer so it will not 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.830
 to function 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.720
 but you can make your own 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.690
 cell phones can make the result that I 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.770
 have on your notebook that will run 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.310
 perfectly now there are some 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.870
 restrictions do you need an internet 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.320
 reasonably good thing I say 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.870
 reasonably good it is not 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.540
 and cindy the cloud will have to 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.810
 send images to another computer 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.910
 It's good, then at least 500 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.580
 Pilot jobs you can do 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.640
 simply a test there on speedy net 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.190

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.760

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.440

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.860

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.780
 Very heavy game, it's okay. 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.000
