00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
bumblebee in Legion class Cliffjumper I

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.439 
bumblebee in Legion class Cliffjumper I
mean<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.940> pretty<00:01:00.420> tiny<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:02.180> as<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.300> can

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
mean that is pretty tiny and as you can

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.899 
mean that is pretty tiny and as you can
see<00:01:03.600> yes<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.350> very<00:01:04.710> very<00:01:04.920> small<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.610> figure

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
see yes it is very very small the figure

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.320 
see yes it is very very small the figure
is<00:01:06.119> very<00:01:06.479> tiny<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:08.250> that's<00:01:08.700> okay

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
is very tiny but that's okay

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.190 
is very tiny but that's okay
so<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:10.049> was<00:01:10.439> right<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.159> my<00:01:11.340> assumption<00:01:11.880> that

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
so I was right in my assumption that

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.740 
so I was right in my assumption that
it's<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.860> very<00:01:13.979> similar<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:18.240> bots<00:01:18.630> are

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
it's it's very similar to the bots are

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.550 
it's it's very similar to the bots are
very<00:01:18.990> similar<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.590> battle<00:01:20.009> beasts<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:21.210> that

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
very similar to battle beasts in that

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.609
