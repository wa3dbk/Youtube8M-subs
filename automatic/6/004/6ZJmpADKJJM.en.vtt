00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.920
 maybe in excess they swam 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.940
 people who want 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.070
 what 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.070
 and he has worked all his life 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:14.579
 that always that state fighting more than anything will weigh you working 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:17.519
 because xinhua said you do not 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.980
 in business partners and fans in novels and 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.230
 I am not finished this world 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.929
 he thinks it's the acting and everything 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.849
 I am with my account 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.899
 what was my life 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.140
 the text of the thousand act 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.820
 and the agile the sung 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.020
 so 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.180
 Then I started thinking 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.570
 that to me to cristofer would like to close something later to take advantage of 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.330
 all this and growing as a person with all this and the baby 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.110
 learning a lot of things and I'm doing it 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.850
 for later in the future 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.230
 use it for good things 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.270
 and helped 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.970
 that's what I like or not 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.120
 it is reserved 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.920
 I think its genetic 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.330
 makes it be 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
 the genetic 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.220
 that the Nordic countries 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.730
 all this could possibly have 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.730
 that the people of the countries have 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.730
 however his heart is fire 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.970
 then he is in imbalance 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.970
 he's very young he's the youngest of all 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.810
 he is a professional 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.770
 In every sense of the word 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.770
 is energetic on stage without crisis 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.500
 it is very positive 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.180
 the thought 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.720
 a lot of eye with many interests in him 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.970
 and who cares about him 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.240
 for the social aspect 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.380
 and that seems very important to me 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.390
 because if they do boy their age 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.300
 it means that it can transform 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.300
 is going to be a transformator crisp clothes a transformer 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.040
 with growth 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.180
 obviously there are things that she 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.180
 do not miss the hero put them or other 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.199
 I did not have that tight then at school a high school seen 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.059
 you went out with 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:12.499
 with his girlfriend happy adoptive 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.499
 sylvinho lands 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.829
 his sin 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.169
 not everything is moments it was all 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.119
 tacuary atarfe all open crosses was the most 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:26.119
 a little more apart and was recording in the forums 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:29.049
 the great novelty in him 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.000
 we have fans to fire 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.829
 totally different 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.790
 and if its good for other alternatives to a restaurant and the date 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.790
 and not like you're eating grapes at the movies 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:41.989
 ap la paz macÃ­as 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.210
 to say that if we do it all together it's 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.059
 chicanas some things 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:47.019
 I congratulate that it's worth it
