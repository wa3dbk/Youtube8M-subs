cinematography<00:00:01.579> has<00:00:01.670> been<00:00:01.790> described<00:00:02.149> as<00:00:02.330> the

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:02.419 
cinematography has been described as the

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:04.900 
cinematography has been described as the
art<00:00:02.750> of<00:00:02.929> placing<00:00:03.469> shadows<00:00:03.919> and<00:00:04.279> if<00:00:04.640> you<00:00:04.730> think

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:04.910 
art of placing shadows and if you think

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.220 
art of placing shadows and if you think
about<00:00:04.970> it<00:00:05.150> that's<00:00:05.359> really<00:00:05.779> kind<00:00:05.990> of<00:00:06.080> true

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.230 
about it that's really kind of true

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.080 
about it that's really kind of true
let's<00:00:06.470> look<00:00:06.589> at<00:00:06.710> the<00:00:06.799> example<00:00:06.830> of<00:00:07.460> if<00:00:07.910> you're

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
let's look at the example of if you're

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.060 
let's look at the example of if you're
drawing<00:00:08.330> a<00:00:08.480> sketch<00:00:08.750> white<00:00:09.590> sheet<00:00:09.830> of<00:00:09.950> paper

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
drawing a sketch white sheet of paper

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.130 
drawing a sketch white sheet of paper
you<00:00:10.700> got<00:00:10.790> a<00:00:10.850> whole<00:00:11.090> bunch<00:00:11.300> of<00:00:11.540> light<00:00:11.810> there

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:12.140 
you got a whole bunch of light there

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.690 
you got a whole bunch of light there
right<00:00:12.410> and<00:00:12.650> what<00:00:13.190> do<00:00:13.280> you<00:00:13.310> do<00:00:13.430> with<00:00:13.550> your

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
right and what do you do with your

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.450 
right and what do you do with your
pencil<00:00:13.880> you<00:00:14.480> go<00:00:14.630> in<00:00:14.840> and<00:00:15.050> add<00:00:15.290> the<00:00:15.740> dark<00:00:15.980> you're

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
pencil you go in and add the dark you're

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.740 
pencil you go in and add the dark you're
adding<00:00:16.880> the<00:00:16.970> shadows<00:00:17.270> and<00:00:17.300> that's<00:00:17.510> what

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
adding the shadows and that's what

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.720 
adding the shadows and that's what
really<00:00:17.990> shapes<00:00:18.410> that<00:00:18.560> paper<00:00:18.950> into<00:00:19.370> looking

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
really shapes that paper into looking

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.580 
really shapes that paper into looking
like<00:00:19.850> the<00:00:19.970> image<00:00:20.270> you<00:00:20.300> want<00:00:20.510> lights<00:00:21.260> the<00:00:21.410> same

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
like the image you want lights the same

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.680 
like the image you want lights the same
way<00:00:21.770> you<00:00:22.430> have<00:00:22.550> a<00:00:22.580> brightly<00:00:23.060> lit<00:00:23.090> subject

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
way you have a brightly lit subject

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.930 
way you have a brightly lit subject
there's<00:00:23.840> no<00:00:23.960> definition<00:00:24.680> or<00:00:24.980> depth<00:00:25.250> it's<00:00:25.520> the

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
there's no definition or depth it's the

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.420 
there's no definition or depth it's the
shadows<00:00:26.450> that<00:00:26.480> bring<00:00:26.990> that<00:00:27.260> out<00:00:27.500> let's<00:00:28.250> go

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
shadows that bring that out let's go

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.010 
shadows that bring that out let's go
back<00:00:28.460> to<00:00:28.610> our<00:00:28.700> opening<00:00:29.000> sketch<00:00:29.240> where<00:00:29.780> we<00:00:29.900> had

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
back to our opening sketch where we had

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.570 
back to our opening sketch where we had
that<00:00:30.170> shot<00:00:30.410> where<00:00:30.650> we<00:00:30.740> showed<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.160> monster

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
that shot where we showed the monster

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.360 
that shot where we showed the monster
and<00:00:31.789> it<00:00:31.880> was<00:00:32.000> brightly<00:00:32.329> lit<00:00:32.599> up<00:00:32.780> no<00:00:33.500> shadows<00:00:33.890> no

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
and it was brightly lit up no shadows no

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.080 
and it was brightly lit up no shadows no
artistry<00:00:34.820> no<00:00:35.450> mood<00:00:35.600> no<00:00:36.470> good<00:00:36.739> right<00:00:37.520> but<00:00:38.000> the

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
artistry no mood no good right but the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.270 
artistry no mood no good right but the
second<00:00:38.480> shot<00:00:38.600> we<00:00:38.750> showed<00:00:38.960> we<00:00:39.170> placed<00:00:39.680> a<00:00:39.860> lot<00:00:40.100> of

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
second shot we showed we placed a lot of

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.979 
second shot we showed we placed a lot of
shadows<00:00:40.670> there's<00:00:41.120> a<00:00:41.210> lot<00:00:41.270> of<00:00:41.480> mystery<00:00:41.960> in

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
shadows there's a lot of mystery in

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.540 
shadows there's a lot of mystery in
there<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:42.410> that<00:00:42.800> really<00:00:42.950> brought<00:00:43.190> home<00:00:43.370> the

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
there and that really brought home the

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.639 
there and that really brought home the
effect<00:00:43.790> that's<00:00:44.540> what<00:00:44.809> a<00:00:44.840> lot<00:00:45.079> of<00:00:45.140> lighting<00:00:45.559> is

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
effect that's what a lot of lighting is

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.560 
effect that's what a lot of lighting is
about<00:00:45.890> if<00:00:46.130> that's<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:46.489> kind<00:00:46.730> of<00:00:46.850> image<00:00:47.030> that

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
about if that's the kind of image that

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.060 
about if that's the kind of image that
you're<00:00:47.720> looking<00:00:47.930> for<00:00:48.140> you<00:00:48.470> need<00:00:48.649> to<00:00:48.770> know<00:00:48.890> how

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
you're looking for you need to know how

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.040 
you're looking for you need to know how
to<00:00:49.100> place<00:00:49.399> the<00:00:49.550> shadows<00:00:49.880> how<00:00:50.210> many<00:00:50.540> shadows<00:00:50.840> to

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
to place the shadows how many shadows to

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.110 
to place the shadows how many shadows to
place<00:00:51.230> and<00:00:51.440> where<00:00:51.770> to<00:00:51.920> place<00:00:52.130> them<00:00:52.340> to<00:00:52.760> get<00:00:52.940> the

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
place and where to place them to get the

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.670 
place and where to place them to get the
image<00:00:53.480> to<00:00:53.630> convey<00:00:53.899> the<00:00:54.050> mood<00:00:54.170> you're<00:00:54.380> looking

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
image to convey the mood you're looking

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.000 
image to convey the mood you're looking
for<00:00:55.630> because<00:00:56.630> when<00:00:56.870> you<00:00:56.930> cut<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.320> iris<00:00:57.800> in

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
for because when you cut the iris in

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.660 
for because when you cut the iris in
half<00:00:58.690> it's<00:00:59.690> actually<00:01:00.140> only<00:01:00.290> allowing<00:01:00.829> in<00:01:01.100> one

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
half it's actually only allowing in one

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.069 
half it's actually only allowing in one
fourth<00:01:01.940> as<00:01:02.059> much<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.360> same<00:01:02.540> reason<00:01:02.930> as<00:01:02.989> the

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
fourth as much the same reason as the

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.139 
fourth as much the same reason as the
inverse<00:01:03.260> square<00:01:03.379> rule<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.309> if<00:01:04.549> you<00:01:04.819> want<00:01:05.030> to

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
inverse square rule so if you want to

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.629 
inverse square rule so if you want to
cut<00:01:05.299> the<00:01:05.420> Irish<00:01:05.659> down<00:01:05.810> by<00:01:05.990> one<00:01:06.259> stop<00:01:06.649> you<00:01:07.399> want

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:07.639 
cut the Irish down by one stop you want

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:10.330 
cut the Irish down by one stop you want
to<00:01:07.729> make<00:01:07.850> it<00:01:07.999> forty<00:01:08.509> percent<00:01:08.899> smaller<00:01:09.499> so

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
to make it forty percent smaller so

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.370 
to make it forty percent smaller so
that's<00:01:10.789> why<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.090> first<00:01:11.479> number<00:01:11.780> on<00:01:12.049> your<00:01:12.200> lens

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
that's why the first number on your lens

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.139 
that's why the first number on your lens
if<00:01:12.679> you<00:01:12.979> have<00:01:13.100> a<00:01:13.130> really<00:01:13.429> fast<00:01:13.670> lens<00:01:13.909> it<00:01:14.030> might

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
if you have a really fast lens it might

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.319 
if you have a really fast lens it might
be<00:01:14.299> f1<00:01:14.539> and<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.619> next<00:01:15.829> number<00:01:15.920> is<00:01:16.100> f<00:01:16.219> 1.4<00:01:16.909> and

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:17.329 
be f1 and the next number is f 1.4 and

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:19.149 
be f1 and the next number is f 1.4 and
then<00:01:17.990> what's<00:01:18.170> forty<00:01:18.409> percent<00:01:18.679> more<00:01:18.889> than<00:01:19.039> f

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
then what's forty percent more than f

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.469 
then what's forty percent more than f
1.4<00:01:19.579> mm<00:01:20.299> F<00:01:20.509> to<00:01:21.009> 1.4<00:01:22.009> x<00:01:22.249> 1.4<00:01:22.700> is<00:01:22.850> too<00:01:23.029> so<00:01:23.299> now<00:01:23.420> we

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
1.4 mm F to 1.4 x 1.4 is too so now we

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.599 
1.4 mm F to 1.4 x 1.4 is too so now we
have<00:01:23.600> f<00:01:23.810> two<00:01:24.049> and<00:01:24.259> forty<00:01:25.219> percent<00:01:25.459> hordak<00:01:26.469> 2.8

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:27.609 
have f two and forty percent hordak 2.8

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:31.839 
have f two and forty percent hordak 2.8
2<00:01:28.609> point<00:01:28.849> 0<00:01:28.939> x<00:01:29.270> 1<00:01:29.420> point<00:01:29.689> 4<00:01:29.840> 2.8<00:01:30.409> every<00:01:31.249> f-stop

00:01:31.839 --> 00:01:31.849 
2 point 0 x 1 point 4 2.8 every f-stop

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:34.649 
2 point 0 x 1 point 4 2.8 every f-stop
is<00:01:32.119> forty<00:01:32.929> percent<00:01:33.229> more<00:01:33.469> progression

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
is forty percent more progression

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.599 
is forty percent more progression
there's<00:01:35.659> levels<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:36.560> levels<00:01:36.889> you<00:01:37.279> can<00:01:37.310> go

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
there's levels and levels you can go

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.609 
there's levels and levels you can go
into<00:01:37.909> a<00:01:38.119> professional<00:01:38.840> waveform<00:01:39.170> honor<00:01:39.319> we're

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
into a professional waveform honor we're

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.349 
into a professional waveform honor we're
only<00:01:39.770> going<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.039> go<00:01:40.159> across<00:01:40.459> the<00:01:40.819> surface<00:01:41.090> of

only going to go across the surface of
it<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:41.659> talk<00:01:41.869> about<00:01:41.899> basically<00:01:42.740> how<00:01:43.219> you<00:01:43.249> use

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:43.669 
it and talk about basically how you use

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:46.389 
it and talk about basically how you use
it<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.999> judge<00:01:44.479> exposure<00:01:44.929> to<00:01:45.380> know<00:01:45.590> what<00:01:46.189> you're

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
it to judge exposure to know what you're

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:47.889 
it to judge exposure to know what you're
getting<00:01:46.579> a<00:01:46.939> lot<00:01:47.299> of<00:01:47.359> people<00:01:47.630> may<00:01:47.749> be<00:01:47.810> familiar

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
getting a lot of people may be familiar

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.260 
getting a lot of people may be familiar
with<00:01:48.229> a<00:01:48.380> histogram<00:01:48.770> a<00:01:49.130> waveform<00:01:49.759> monitor<00:01:50.090> is

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
with a histogram a waveform monitor is

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.109 
with a histogram a waveform monitor is
pretty<00:01:50.749> much<00:01:50.840> nothing<00:01:51.109> like<00:01:51.409> a<00:01:51.439> histogram

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
pretty much nothing like a histogram

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.719 
pretty much nothing like a histogram
histogram<00:01:53.119> is<00:01:53.329> a<00:01:54.049> snapshot<00:01:54.439> of<00:01:54.889> how

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
histogram is a snapshot of how

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.300 
histogram is a snapshot of how
brightness<00:01:56.299> is<00:01:56.419> distributed<00:01:57.139> over<00:01:57.349> an<00:01:58.130> entire

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
brightness is distributed over an entire

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.429 
brightness is distributed over an entire
image<00:01:58.819> if<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.389> histogram<00:01:59.749> is<00:01:59.779> all<00:01:59.959> bunched<00:02:00.319> up

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
image if the histogram is all bunched up

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.260 
image if the histogram is all bunched up
over<00:02:00.799> on<00:02:00.919> the<00:02:01.039> right<00:02:01.189> side<00:02:01.459> maybe<00:02:01.849> you<00:02:02.029> got<00:02:02.149> an

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
over on the right side maybe you got an

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.639 
over on the right side maybe you got an
image<00:02:02.389> that's<00:02:02.509> too<00:02:02.899> bright<00:02:03.169> and<00:02:03.200> if<00:02:03.499> it's

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
image that's too bright and if it's

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:04.749 
image that's too bright and if it's
bunched<00:02:03.950> up<00:02:04.039> over<00:02:04.249> on<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.399> left<00:02:04.579> side<00:02:04.669> it's

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
bunched up over on the left side it's

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.279 
bunched up over on the left side it's
too<00:02:04.939> dark<00:02:05.149> right<00:02:05.359> but<00:02:05.929> that's<00:02:06.049> like

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
too dark right but that's like

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.400 
too dark right but that's like
referencing<00:02:06.739> your<00:02:06.859> entire<00:02:07.279> image<00:02:07.669> all<00:02:08.180> at<00:02:09.050> one

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
referencing your entire image all at one

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.530 
referencing your entire image all at one
little<00:02:09.710> clump<00:02:10.100> a<00:02:10.340> wafer<00:02:10.910> monitor<00:02:11.150> doesn't<00:02:11.360> do

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
little clump a wafer monitor doesn't do

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.910 
little clump a wafer monitor doesn't do
that<00:02:11.660> at<00:02:11.870> all<00:02:11.990> because<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.470> waveform<00:02:12.770> honor

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
that at all because the waveform honor

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.750 
that at all because the waveform honor
tells<00:02:13.250> you

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
tells you

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.509 
tells you
at<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.090> glance<00:02:14.360> first<00:02:15.349> of<00:02:15.500> all<00:02:15.620> on<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.099> left<00:02:16.340> to

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
at a glance first of all on the left to

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.390 
at a glance first of all on the left to
right<00:02:16.730> it's<00:02:17.390> actually<00:02:17.689> a<00:02:18.230> representation<00:02:19.010> of

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
right it's actually a representation of

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.069 
right it's actually a representation of
what<00:02:19.549> your<00:02:19.700> image<00:02:19.970> is<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.390> as<00:02:20.629> you<00:02:20.900> see

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
what your image is so as you see

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.050 
what your image is so as you see
somebody<00:02:21.500> walk<00:02:21.829> through<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.430> image<00:02:22.670> you'll

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
somebody walk through the image you'll

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.429 
somebody walk through the image you'll
see<00:02:23.269> it<00:02:23.360> happen<00:02:23.720> on<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.930> way<00:02:24.019> form<00:02:24.260> under

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439 
see it happen on the way form under

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:25.690 
see it happen on the way form under
you'll<00:02:24.590> be<00:02:24.709> able<00:02:24.799> to<00:02:24.950> follow<00:02:25.129> what<00:02:25.549> that

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
you'll be able to follow what that

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.520 
you'll be able to follow what that
object<00:02:25.879> is<00:02:26.239> because<00:02:26.599> you<00:02:26.720> can<00:02:26.870> see<00:02:27.140> it<00:02:27.260> play

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
object is because you can see it play

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.080 
object is because you can see it play
out<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.980> looks<00:02:28.189> like<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.340> display<00:02:28.790> from<00:02:29.000> the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
out it looks like a display from the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.699 
out it looks like a display from the
matrix<00:02:29.269> or<00:02:29.629> something<00:02:29.870> like<00:02:29.989> that<00:02:30.049> but<00:02:30.500> you

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
matrix or something like that but you

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.800 
matrix or something like that but you
pretty<00:02:31.519> soon<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:31.909> get<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.150> learn<00:02:32.269> how<00:02:32.329> to<00:02:32.569> read

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
pretty soon you get to learn how to read

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.049 
pretty soon you get to learn how to read
that
