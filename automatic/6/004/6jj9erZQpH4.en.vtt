00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.950 
can see the inner workings of the guitar
and<00:02:22.050> see<00:02:22.230> how<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.490> Oasis<00:02:23.490> humidifier<00:02:24.150> sits

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
and see how the Oasis humidifier sits

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.340 
and see how the Oasis humidifier sits
within<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.470> guitar<00:02:26.000> we<00:02:27.000> do<00:02:27.270> have<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.870> strings

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
within the guitar we do have the strings

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.900 
within the guitar we do have the strings
on<00:02:28.710> this<00:02:29.040> 12<00:02:29.790> string<00:02:30.180> demo<00:02:30.540> model<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:31.910> loosened

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
on this 12 string demo model I loosened

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.570 
on this 12 string demo model I loosened
and<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.690> humidifier<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.710> sitting<00:02:35.430> on

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
and so the humidifier is sitting on

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.900 
and so the humidifier is sitting on
there<00:02:35.850> fairly<00:02:36.210> easily<00:02:36.710> with<00:02:37.710> a<00:02:37.920> regular<00:02:38.580> 12

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
there fairly easily with a regular 12

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.060 
there fairly easily with a regular 12
string<00:02:39.240> guitar<00:02:39.270> that<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:40.050> tuned<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.350> pitch<00:02:40.710> it

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
string guitar that is tuned to pitch it

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.850 
string guitar that is tuned to pitch it
will<00:02:41.400> be<00:02:41.670> more<00:02:42.330> difficult<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:43.050> get<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.260> Oasis

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
will be more difficult to get the Oasis

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.670 
will be more difficult to get the Oasis
humidifier<00:02:44.430> inside<00:02:45.090> there<00:02:45.480> however<00:02:46.050> with<00:02:46.650> a

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
humidifier inside there however with a

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.830 
humidifier inside there however with a
sixth<00:02:47.130> string<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.670> should<00:02:48.240> be<00:02:48.390> relatively

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
sixth string it should be relatively

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.140 
sixth string it should be relatively
easy
