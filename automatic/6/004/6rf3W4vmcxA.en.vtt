00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.120 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.100 

so<00:00:31.900> after<00:00:32.680> I<00:00:32.710> added<00:00:32.950> weave<00:00:33.340> and<00:00:33.640> dyed<00:00:33.820> her<00:00:34.120> red

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.590 
did add the blonde weave to make it
longer<00:02:03.680> as<00:02:04.040> is<00:02:04.340> because<00:02:04.760> I<00:02:04.790> knew<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.120> was<00:02:05.420> going

long it's down to the waist for some

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.090

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
right now that's those are my hairstyles

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.210 
right now that's those are my hairstyles
at<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.150> moment<00:03:28.510> so<00:03:29.140> all<00:03:29.350> in<00:03:29.530> all<00:03:29.650> she<00:03:29.950> does

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
at the moment so all in all she does

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.800 
at the moment so all in all she does
have<00:03:30.490> two<00:03:30.760> bags<00:03:31.090> of<00:03:31.540> hair<00:03:31.840> and<00:03:31.990> her<00:03:33.180> not<00:03:34.180> too

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
have two bags of hair and her not too

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.940 
have two bags of hair and her not too
heavy<00:03:35.140> not<00:03:35.500> too<00:03:35.560> thin<00:03:37.080> it's<00:03:38.080> sort<00:03:38.620> of<00:03:38.710> the

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
heavy not too thin it's sort of the

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.030 
heavy not too thin it's sort of the
density<00:03:39.430> that<00:03:39.580> I'm<00:03:39.730> more<00:03:40.060> comfortable<00:03:40.300> with

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
density that I'm more comfortable with

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.850 
density that I'm more comfortable with
but<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.100> do<00:03:42.250> like<00:03:42.640> that<00:03:42.820> it's<00:03:43.000> longer<00:03:43.270> and<00:03:43.860> the

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
but I do like that it's longer and the

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.660 
but I do like that it's longer and the
ends<00:03:45.280> are<00:03:45.460> a<00:03:45.490> little<00:03:45.760> bit<00:03:46.000> wispy<00:03:47.430> which<00:03:48.430> I<00:03:48.610> do

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
ends are a little bit wispy which I do

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.080 
ends are a little bit wispy which I do
like

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
like

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.630 
like
I<00:03:49.300> don't<00:03:49.750> like<00:03:49.990> super<00:03:50.470> blunt<00:03:50.770> thick<00:03:51.160> ends

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
I don't like super blunt thick ends

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.450 
I don't like super blunt thick ends
because<00:03:52.480> when<00:03:52.690> you<00:03:52.840> have<00:03:53.050> long<00:03:53.740> natural<00:03:54.160> hair

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
because when you have long natural hair

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.970 
because when you have long natural hair
the<00:03:55.300> ends<00:03:55.660> are<00:03:55.750> going<00:03:56.110> to<00:03:56.320> be<00:03:56.380> slightly

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
the ends are going to be slightly

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.640 
the ends are going to be slightly
thinner<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.240> more<00:03:58.480> wispier<00:03:59.020> than<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.440> rest

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
thinner and more wispier than the rest

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.060 
thinner and more wispier than the rest
of<00:03:59.800> the<00:03:59.920> hair<00:04:00.600> that's<00:04:01.600> part<00:04:02.260> of<00:04:02.410> having<00:04:02.620> long

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
of the hair that's part of having long

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.280 
of the hair that's part of having long
hair<00:04:03.100> and<00:04:03.730> actually<00:04:04.360> I<00:04:04.390> believe<00:04:04.570> that<00:04:04.960> makes

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
hair and actually I believe that makes

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:14.690 
hair and actually I believe that makes
it<00:04:05.440> look<00:04:05.590> more<00:04:05.800> natural<00:04:07.260> so<00:04:08.260> this<00:04:08.470> is<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.650> back

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:33.020 

so<00:04:15.700> it<00:04:15.880> is<00:04:16.030> quite<00:04:16.330> long

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.790
