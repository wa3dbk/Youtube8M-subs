this I wonder if my camera autofocus is
let's<00:00:40.200> see<00:00:40.379> if<00:00:40.469> doing<00:00:40.649> something<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
let's see if doing something on the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.540 
let's see if doing something on the
camera<00:00:41.550> will<00:00:41.730> help<00:00:42.590> no<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.860> will<00:00:44.010> not

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
camera will help no it will not

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.590 
camera will help no it will not
it's<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.390> automatic<00:00:46.820> so<00:00:47.820> there<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.450> it

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
it's on automatic so there you have it

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.220 
it's on automatic so there you have it
you<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.770> looks<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.640> glue<00:00:51.110> kind<00:00:52.110> of

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
you can see this looks like glue kind of

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.010 
you can see this looks like glue kind of
strained<00:00:52.590> from<00:00:52.920> one<00:00:53.730> layer<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.420> other<00:00:54.570> and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
strained from one layer to the other and

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.639 
strained from one layer to the other and
you<00:00:55.100> see<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.430> whole<00:00:56.670> layer<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.840> uh<00:00:57.899> there's

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
you see this whole layer this uh there's

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.040 
you see this whole layer this uh there's
this<00:00:58.859> packet<00:00:59.340> or<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.760> actual<00:01:00.420> battery<00:01:00.809> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
this packet or the actual battery is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.440 
this packet or the actual battery is
really<00:01:01.949> swollen<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:04.430> this<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.610> basically<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
really swollen and this is basically the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.289 
really swollen and this is basically the
danger<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.409> could<00:01:07.619> get<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.369> sight<00:01:09.090> from

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
danger that you could get a sight from

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.390 
danger that you could get a sight from
it<00:01:09.450> actually<00:01:09.570> opening<00:01:10.260> up<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.680> hurting

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it actually opening up and hurting

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.910 
it actually opening up and hurting
somebody<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:12.900> happen<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.830> can

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
somebody this can happen and it can

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.560 
somebody this can happen and it can
break<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> lot<00:01:14.490> more<00:01:14.700> than<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.210> battery

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
break a lot more than just the battery

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.289 
break a lot more than just the battery
in<00:01:15.840> your<00:01:16.080> computer<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.820> this<00:01:17.820> isn't<00:01:18.000> just

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
in your computer and this isn't just

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.570 
in your computer and this isn't just

see<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> lot<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.310> cases<00:01:23.670> where<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.630> battery's<00:01:25.049> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
see a lot of cases where the battery's a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.780 
see a lot of cases where the battery's a
little<00:01:25.350> bit<00:01:25.439> swollen<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.130> more<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.520> charge

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
little bit swollen the more you charge

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.390 
little bit swollen the more you charge
it<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.330> worse<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.689> outcome<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:28.140> gonna<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.400> now

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
it the worse the outcome is gonna be now

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.539 
it the worse the outcome is gonna be now
you<00:01:29.460> see<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:30.450> with<00:01:31.200> Mac<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.770> lasted<00:01:32.340> for

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
you see with with Mac this lasted for

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.929 
you see with with Mac this lasted for
years<00:01:33.140> a<00:01:34.140> full<00:01:34.650> four<00:01:34.890> years<00:01:35.130> that's<00:01:35.400> exactly

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
years a full four years that's exactly

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.200 
years a full four years that's exactly
what<00:01:36.180> Apple<00:01:36.750> intended<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:38.189> battery<00:01:38.610> life<00:01:38.939> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
what Apple intended the battery life to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.550 
what Apple intended the battery life to
being<00:01:39.390> made<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.229> was<00:01:40.350> written

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
being made that it was written

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.469 
being made that it was written
everywhere<00:01:40.979> for<00:01:41.430> years<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:42.030> should<00:01:42.210> replace

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
everywhere for years you should replace

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.210 
everywhere for years you should replace
it<00:01:42.600> because<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:44.280> happens<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.810> I'm<00:01:46.770> actually

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
it because this happens so I'm actually

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.010 
it because this happens so I'm actually
while<00:01:47.610> I'm<00:01:47.729> talking<00:01:47.970> I'm<00:01:48.360> gonna<00:01:48.509> put<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.840> some

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
while I'm talking I'm gonna put in some

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.700 
while I'm talking I'm gonna put in some
pictures<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.729> really<00:01:50.729> close<00:01:50.939> images<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.750> you

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
pictures of really close images and you

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.160 
pictures of really close images and you
could<00:01:52.860> see<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.579> glue<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:54.960> said

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
could see the glue just like I said

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.139 
could see the glue just like I said
