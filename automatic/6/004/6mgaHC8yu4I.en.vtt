 pleased to be over there is a real 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.420
 it gave me a seal I saw you 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.740
 it was in your down under and yes but 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.880
 there I will have because new 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.280
 generation of consoles I told myself we 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.540
 will take full eyes yes we have 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.090
 many things to show you the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.559
 aisles follow me this is a new 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.030
 generation of consoles which he knows that 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.110
 if we assume you're ripped off 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.500
 to do something that 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.500
 visually 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.190
 no 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.320
 wilfred we started our revolution 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.330
 by the work on the faces we have 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.489
 started by lebron james have ace cannes 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.989
 and thanks to a new technology that 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.699
 allows us to restore the least 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.890
 physical details but also the 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.030
 emotions of the athletes 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.770
 and when we saw the result we got 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.760
 understood that it was necessary to redo the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.760
 faces of all players 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.659
 part of our team scoured the 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.280
 united states she went in all 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.479
 the franchises ea scan the most of 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.130
 possible players through this work 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.459
 titanic state of mind of the players 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.990
 is perceptible because now it changes 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:36.069
 mood according to the physiognomy of 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.140
 matches when you see a player in 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.829
 anger you know he's going to behave 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.329
 differently 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.329
 exactly like in real life 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.409
 what we love in a ball and 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.940
 crates and details also there are 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.800
 everywhere you went still far 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.619
 this time every detail has been modeled 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.020
 carefully as I tell you we have 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.240
 started with the faces the work of 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.860
 beards for example and it was so 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.929
 realistically that we owed everything 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.970
 resume from scratch to get a 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.950
 consistent result 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.780
 jersey fabrics shine 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.310
 seams the crowd the halls lighting 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.060
 for example if you take a look at the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.880
 brand table 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.140
 there is a phone well there is no 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.140
 reproduces a fingerprint 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:37.970
 on the basket we all reproduced the 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:39.590
 camera the cables it's crazy thanks to 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.110
 eco motion our new game engine 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.310
 the gameplay are also evolving in this 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.260
 new generation bouquet 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.350
 the supports are preponderant just as 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.420
 ball physics its rotation when 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.680
 dribbling for example during robots 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.040
 well also things that will do 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.040
 pleasure to the fans 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.820
 yes for example want the first thing 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.620
 that you see when starting the game in nba 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.030
 today 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.240
 these are the highlights of the matches that 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.310
 have just ended 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.320
 at the end of every game the 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.170
 statistics and the various notes of 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.760
 players is updating all that for that 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.890
 you are always closer to your 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:22.940
 hero of the envied to go make a game 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.670
 hyper full wait is not finished our 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.260
 fans like to vary the pleasures by 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.440
 example they want to manage franchises 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.790
 we redesigned the jm my way there now 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.450
 you have to look after relationships with 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.960
 the players 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.620
 your boss 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.690
 but your staff when you give 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.160
 minutes of play to someone you take them away 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.230
 to another one must do with 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.690
 if your post asks you to save 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.820
 money and you will spend 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.870
 not long fire 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.430
 and then there are those who like to control 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.800
 just a single player that also uses the 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.870
 to do yes we found that the mode my 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.450
 player would be subway created a personal 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.210
 is played now there is a scenario 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.700
 staging you have friends 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.019
 dn 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.400
 and see you do your own movie played 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.400
 Czech queen 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.109
 you create your character I give it 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.959
 the appearance you want then you live 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:25.610
 the story of this player it's really 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.110
 very immersive but it's really huge 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.760
 you really did the game for them 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.250
 basketball fans have it for all 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.930
 likes 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.060
 thank you fred as you can see the 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.700
 game content is well supplied one is 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.360
 from scratch it is superb and well 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.360
 sure realistic 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.380
 but sometimes in basketball you just have 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.940
 want to go hit the ball with your 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:03.030
 buddies this is our other novelty the 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.140
 park a place with seven grounds that 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.910
 can accommodate a hundred 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.890
 people and that allows you to go 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.500
 to have fun with your friends 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.390
 in five against five and three 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.840
 against three like when you were backpacking 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.640
 or even now you dress like 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.140
 do you want to go to the park and play like 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.310
 you hear it 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:24.830
 this is one of the most fun modes that 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.830
 I have never seen perfect 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.880
 the language
