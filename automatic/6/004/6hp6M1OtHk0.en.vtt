00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
and I heard some weird noise I look

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.340 
and I heard some weird noise I look
behind<00:01:57.180> me<00:01:57.509> because<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> garbage

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
behind me because I have a garbage

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.929 
behind me because I have a garbage
disposal<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.829> my<00:01:58.920> house<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.640> thought<00:01:59.790> it

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
disposal in my house and I thought it

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.670 
disposal in my house and I thought it
turned<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.270> I'm<00:02:00.899> like<00:02:01.140> what<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.320> hell<00:02:01.409> was

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
turned on I'm like what the hell was

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.440 
turned on I'm like what the hell was
that<00:02:01.710> noise<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.310> then<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.759> replayed<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.119> video

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
that noise and then I replayed the video

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.600 
that noise and then I replayed the video
and<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.869> can<00:02:04.020> clearly<00:02:04.200> hear<00:02:04.409> as<00:02:04.799> soon<00:02:05.399> as<00:02:05.520> he

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
and you can clearly hear as soon as he

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.670 
and you can clearly hear as soon as he
put<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.850> disc<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.750> immediately<00:02:07.409> as

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.339 
take it back to walmart gamestop
wherever<00:03:11.879> you<00:03:11.970> got<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.150> from<00:03:12.269> get<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:12.989> refund

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
wherever you got it from get a refund

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.539 
wherever you got it from get a refund
get<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.620> new<00:03:13.799> one<00:03:13.980> but<00:03:14.160> they<00:03:14.250> probably<00:03:14.400> don't

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
get a new one but they probably don't

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.849 
get a new one but they probably don't
even<00:03:14.700> have<00:03:15.019> more<00:03:16.019> than<00:03:16.230> what<00:03:16.379> you<00:03:16.410> already<00:03:16.590> got

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
even have more than what you already got

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.199 
even have more than what you already got
so<00:03:17.519> this<00:03:17.549> may<00:03:18.450> end<00:03:18.480> up<00:03:18.840> being<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:19.230> pretty<00:03:19.260> big

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
so this may end up being a pretty big

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.430 
so this may end up being a pretty big
