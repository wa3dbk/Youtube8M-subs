00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:11.740
 we start from the moment the apparatus 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:14.639
 fully assembled washed disinfectant 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:18.040
 clean water 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:25.630
 bins filled with a mixture of air tubes 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:28.390
 the set button is inserted we set it 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:33.570
 ice cream hardness on the screen here 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.570
 displayed this case costs 3 7 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.670
 maximum hardness 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.670
 on this machine seven 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.940
 comes to 7 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:52.719
 for in boot covers 832 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.059
 37 is the optimal starting value at 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:58.059
 which product will already be great 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.680
 consistency despite the fact that the maximum 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.410
 value 7 i.e. power margin 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.499
 apparatus is huge he is even capable 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:11.170
 work if he stands in the heat and on him 

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:14.679
 the direct rays of the sun are shining putting 37 we 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.670
 set the time time 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:21.490
 this time is simple from three 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.429
 minutes to 9 minutes we recommend the top five 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.829
 what does it mean if in five minutes we have 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:27.490
 there will be no sales after expiration 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.909
 five minutes 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.779
 the device will turn on hard current 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.429
 value will bring to given 37 and 

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:40.090
 the device will turn off again that is always 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.310
 maintains the product consistency already 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:47.770
 ready for sale 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:51.719
 setting 37 set we turn on the device on 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.719
 auto button production 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.689
 220 line voltage is now turned on 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.689
 electric motor 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.830
 just could hear turn on myself 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.750
 compressor went gone production 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.510
 ice cream 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:17.020
 After turning on the auto button, we turn it on 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.420
 push button air pump she 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.570
 displayed by the corresponding icon on 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.730
 On the screen it is enough to turn on the button 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.680
 once in the morning and then she will 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.730
 automatically turn on and off 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:34.210
 with all modes of the device throughout 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:38.250
 today also immediately we can enable 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:41.320
 the q button is cooling bins for 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.680
 the mixtures in which we have stored liquid 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.540
 mixture 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.830
 here we can basically see how 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.830
 running air pump 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.460
 enlightens the mixture by air 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:03.620
 turn on the q button lights up 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:07.220
 the corresponding icon on the screen and the mixture 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.220
 located bins
