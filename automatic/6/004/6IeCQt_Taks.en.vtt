hi<00:00:00.420> guys<00:00:00.599> in<00:00:00.750> this<00:00:00.840> video<00:00:01.050> I'm<00:00:01.920> going<00:00:02.100> to<00:00:02.220> show

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
hi guys in this video I'm going to show

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.450 
hi guys in this video I'm going to show
you<00:00:02.460> another<00:00:02.970> chord<00:00:03.510> progression<00:00:04.310> which<00:00:05.310> you

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
you another chord progression which you

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.089 
you another chord progression which you
can<00:00:05.609> practice<00:00:06.000> where<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.290> chords<00:00:07.649> you<00:00:07.710> are

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
can practice where the chords you are

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.120 
can practice where the chords you are
using<00:00:08.700> our<00:00:08.910> similar<00:00:09.750> some<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.800> them<00:00:10.920> are<00:00:11.040> the

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
using our similar some of them are the

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.640 
using our similar some of them are the
same<00:00:11.340> as<00:00:11.610> in<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.969> other<00:00:12.000> video<00:00:12.450> but<00:00:12.559> for<00:00:13.559> this

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
same as in the other video but for this

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.240 
same as in the other video but for this
one<00:00:13.969> it's<00:00:14.969> another<00:00:15.470> common<00:00:16.470> quad<00:00:16.710> regression

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
one it's another common quad regression

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.760 
one it's another common quad regression
with<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.420> uses<00:00:18.779> two<00:00:19.020> different<00:00:19.050> chords<00:00:19.650> and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
with that uses two different chords and

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.520 
with that uses two different chords and
these<00:00:20.160> chords<00:00:20.490> are<00:00:20.640> G<00:00:21.769> major

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:24.530 
these chords are G major

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.970 
these chords are G major
D<00:00:24.920> major

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.540 

see<00:00:29.980> major

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
see major

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.860 
see major
all<00:00:30.730> right<00:00:30.880> and<00:00:31.120> that<00:00:31.360> is<00:00:31.510> the<00:00:31.540> quad

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:31.870 
all right and that is the quad

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:39.710 
all right and that is the quad
regression<00:00:32.349> so<00:00:32.590> from

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.710 

okay<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.560> you<00:00:41.070> use<00:00:41.310> a<00:00:41.340> similar<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.450> use

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
okay and you use a similar and you use

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.960 
okay and you use a similar and you use
the<00:00:42.900> same<00:00:43.280> sort<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.630> quadruped<00:00:45.650> you<00:00:46.970> practice

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
the same sort of quadruped you practice

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.970 
the same sort of quadruped you practice
this<00:00:48.270> chord<00:00:48.600> progression<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.560> same<00:00:49.800> way

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
this chord progression in the same way

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.520 
this chord progression in the same way
as<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.970> explained<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.540> other<00:00:51.720> video<00:00:52.050> but<00:00:52.230> if

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
as I explained in the other video but if

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
as I explained in the other video but if
you<00:00:52.620> haven't<00:00:52.770> seen<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.130> other<00:00:53.250> video

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
you haven't seen the other video

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.690 
you haven't seen the other video
basically<00:00:53.940> what<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.240> said<00:00:54.960> was<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.550> stop<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
basically what I said was that stop the

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.090 
basically what I said was that stop the
progression<00:00:57.060> slow<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.810> you<00:00:58.680> practice

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
progression slow and you practice

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.370 
progression slow and you practice
practice<00:00:59.310> doing<00:01:00.090> strums<00:01:00.510> using<00:01:00.930> four<00:01:01.170> beats

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
practice doing strums using four beats

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.200 
practice doing strums using four beats
and<00:01:01.500> three<00:01:01.710> beats<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.220> I'll<00:01:02.489> show<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.730> why<00:01:02.940> in

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
and three beats and I'll show you why in

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.830 
and three beats and I'll show you why in
a<00:01:03.239> moment

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
a moment

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.340 
a moment
so<00:01:04.080> basically<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:06.000> practice<00:01:06.330> four<00:01:06.540> beats<00:01:06.750> you

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
so basically to practice four beats you

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:27.530 
so basically to practice four beats you
just<00:01:07.560> count<00:01:07.800> out<00:01:08.010> loud<00:01:25.940> and<00:01:26.940> you<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:27.240> build

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
just count out loud and you just build

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:47.360 
just count out loud and you just build
it<00:01:27.780> up<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.380> keep<00:01:28.530> adding<00:01:28.890> strum

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.950 

you<00:01:48.370> feel<00:01:48.550> confident<00:01:48.970> that<00:01:49.090> you<00:01:49.390> can<00:01:49.570> add<00:01:49.750> all

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
you feel confident that you can add all

00:01:49.960 --> 00:02:05.919 
you feel confident that you can add all
four<00:01:50.020> strums<00:01:50.830> where<00:01:51.100> you<00:01:51.190> go<00:01:51.370> one<00:01:52.000> two<00:01:52.210> three

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.050 

okay<00:02:06.929> if<00:02:07.770> you're<00:02:07.979> confident<00:02:08.429> off<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.759> can<00:02:08.910> go

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
okay if you're confident off you can go

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:21.840 
okay if you're confident off you can go
up<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.269> speed

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.220 

okay<00:02:22.850> so<00:02:22.910> that's<00:02:23.210> a<00:02:23.360> four<00:02:23.570> bit<00:02:23.720> pattern<00:02:24.080> which

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
okay so that's a four bit pattern which

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.930 
okay so that's a four bit pattern which
you<00:02:24.260> practice<00:02:24.770> another<00:02:25.280> one<00:02:25.550> would<00:02:25.700> be<00:02:25.820> the

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
you practice another one would be the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.420 
you practice another one would be the
three<00:02:26.210> beat<00:02:26.420> pattern<00:02:27.040> where<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.070> would<00:02:28.280> go

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
three beat pattern where you would go

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.290 
three beat pattern where you would go
you<00:02:28.700> would<00:02:28.730> come

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.690 

and<00:02:34.720> as<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.500> notice<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:36.040> is<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.250> bit<00:02:36.520> faster

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
and as you notice this is a bit faster

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.160 
and as you notice this is a bit faster
than<00:02:36.940> for<00:02:37.270> bit<00:02:37.420> more<00:02:37.660> because<00:02:37.990> you<00:02:38.140> have

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
than for bit more because you have

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.310 
than for bit more because you have
periods<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.040> it's<00:02:39.610> shorter<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.330> this<00:02:40.990> this

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
periods and it's shorter and this this

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.830 
periods and it's shorter and this this
will<00:02:41.620> this<00:02:42.550> might<00:02:42.760> be<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:42.940> little<00:02:43.330> bit<00:02:43.450> harder

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
will this might be a little bit harder

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.660 
will this might be a little bit harder
to<00:02:43.990> learn<00:02:44.110> because<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.680> rhythm<00:02:45.040> is<00:02:45.220> quite

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
to learn because the rhythm is quite

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.180 
to learn because the rhythm is quite
jarring<00:02:46.510> it's<00:02:46.840> not<00:02:47.110> it's<00:02:47.380> an<00:02:47.500> odd<00:02:47.680> number<00:02:48.010> not

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
jarring it's not it's an odd number not

00:02:48.190 --> 00:03:00.839 
jarring it's not it's an odd number not
an<00:02:48.310> even<00:02:48.520> number<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:48.940> you're<00:02:49.180> going

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.860 

and<00:03:01.840> from<00:03:02.079> here<00:03:02.260> try<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.680> add<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:03.659> second<00:03:04.659> strap

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
and from here try to add a second strap

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:18.290 
and from here try to add a second strap
on<00:03:05.049> the<00:03:05.230> third<00:03:05.560> be<00:03:05.829> where<00:03:06.189> you

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.040 

all<00:03:19.300> right<00:03:19.450> so<00:03:20.230> if<00:03:20.710> you<00:03:21.120> if<00:03:22.120> I'll<00:03:22.450> do<00:03:22.690> it<00:03:22.810> slowly

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
all right so if you if I'll do it slowly

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.390 
all right so if you if I'll do it slowly
for<00:03:23.350> you<00:03:23.380> so<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:23.680> get<00:03:23.800> the<00:03:23.920> rhythm<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:24.250> it's

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
for you so you get the rhythm so it's

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.330 
for you so you get the rhythm so it's
basically<00:03:24.670> down<00:03:25.000> stroke<00:03:25.360> low<00:03:25.960> speed<00:03:26.350> nothing

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
basically down stroke low speed nothing

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.860 
basically down stroke low speed nothing
on<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.730> second<00:03:28.150> then<00:03:28.330> on<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.690> third<00:03:28.990> one<00:03:30.870> and

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
on the second then on the third one and

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.580 
on the second then on the third one and
the<00:03:32.250> one<00:03:33.250> that's<00:03:33.640> on<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.240> on<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:35.050> next<00:03:35.350> call

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
the one that's on the on the next call

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:54.520 
the one that's on the on the next call
alright<00:03:35.920> so<00:03:43.680> change

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.900 

and<00:03:55.530> once<00:03:55.740> you're<00:03:55.860> confident<00:03:56.280> that<00:03:56.430> you<00:03:56.760> can

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
and once you're confident that you can

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.370 
and once you're confident that you can
do<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.360> can<00:03:57.510> start<00:03:57.750> doing<00:03:57.840> all<00:03:58.110> this<00:03:58.170> junk

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
do you can start doing all this junk

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:15.930 
do you can start doing all this junk
where<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.340> going

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.210 

all<00:04:16.720> right<00:04:16.870> so<00:04:17.050> I<00:04:17.080> recommend<00:04:17.560> starting<00:04:17.860> off

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
all right so I recommend starting off

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.270 
all right so I recommend starting off
slow<00:04:18.580> and<00:04:18.790> building<00:04:19.390> up<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.540> speed<00:04:19.959> and<00:04:20.170> as<00:04:21.100> I

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
slow and building up the speed and as I

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.670 
slow and building up the speed and as I
mentioned<00:04:21.640> in<00:04:21.700> the<00:04:21.790> other<00:04:21.820> video<00:04:22.090> as<00:04:22.360> well<00:04:22.680> you

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
mentioned in the other video as well you

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.130 
mentioned in the other video as well you
know<00:04:24.040> once<00:04:24.730> you're<00:04:24.940> used<00:04:24.970> to<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.450> 4b<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:25.990> the

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
know once you're used to the 4b and the

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.810 
know once you're used to the 4b and the
3b<00:04:26.530> or<00:04:26.860> you<00:04:26.950> can<00:04:27.130> do<00:04:27.250> is<00:04:27.370> you<00:04:27.460> can<00:04:27.610> start

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
3b or you can do is you can start

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.390 
3b or you can do is you can start
playing<00:04:28.090> in<00:04:28.300> multiples<00:04:28.900> of<00:04:29.110> those<00:04:29.740> beats<00:04:30.160> work

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
playing in multiples of those beats work

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.660 
playing in multiples of those beats work
so<00:04:30.610> so<00:04:30.820> for<00:04:31.510> structured<00:04:32.020> doing<00:04:32.400> 8:03<00:04:33.400> strokes

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
so so for structured doing 8:03 strokes

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.060 
so so for structured doing 8:03 strokes
you're<00:04:33.820> doing<00:04:34.030> six<00:04:34.300> so<00:04:34.870> for<00:04:35.170> example<00:04:35.590> if<00:04:35.770> let's

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
you're doing six so for example if let's

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.040 
you're doing six so for example if let's
say<00:04:36.250> for<00:04:36.520> though<00:04:36.700> for<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.600> three<00:04:37.810> beats

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
say for though for the three beats

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.820 
say for though for the three beats
instead<00:04:38.200> of<00:04:38.440> going<00:04:43.260> what<00:04:44.260> you'd<00:04:44.380> actually<00:04:44.470> do

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
instead of going what you'd actually do

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:51.679 
instead of going what you'd actually do
is

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:51.689 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:56.589 

what

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:02.519 

one<00:04:57.599> two<00:04:57.930> three

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:02.529 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:05.339 

all<00:05:03.369> right<00:05:03.519> so<00:05:03.909> that's<00:05:04.089> it's<00:05:04.869> more<00:05:04.989> pleasant

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
all right so that's it's more pleasant

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.109 
all right so that's it's more pleasant
it<00:05:05.739> doesn't<00:05:06.159> feel<00:05:06.309> as<00:05:06.369> rush<00:05:06.729> that's<00:05:06.909> just

00:05:07.109 --> 00:05:07.119 
it doesn't feel as rush that's just

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:10.420 
it doesn't feel as rush that's just
going

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.550 

and<00:05:11.210> you<00:05:11.300> find<00:05:11.570> that<00:05:11.690> in<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:11.840> love<00:05:12.020> songs<00:05:12.350> as
