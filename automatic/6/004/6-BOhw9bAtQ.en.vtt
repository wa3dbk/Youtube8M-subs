00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.040 

the<00:00:16.500> B<00:00:16.710> minor<00:00:16.980> triad<00:00:17.640> we<00:00:18.119> start<00:00:18.420> out<00:00:18.599> taking<00:00:18.990> a

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
the B minor triad we start out taking a

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.839 
the B minor triad we start out taking a
look<00:00:19.200> at<00:00:19.290> that<00:00:21.860> you<00:00:22.860> can<00:00:23.040> add<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.430> seventh

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
look at that you can add in the seventh

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:33.300 
look at that you can add in the seventh
right<00:00:24.090> behind<00:00:24.360> the<00:00:24.540> root

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.360 

and<00:00:34.600> we<00:00:35.600> can<00:00:35.750> do<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:35.989> same<00:00:36.200> here<00:00:36.710> with<00:00:37.130> the

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
and we can do the same here with the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.400 
and we can do the same here with the
first<00:00:37.760> inversion<00:00:38.180> arpeggio<00:00:40.900> you<00:00:41.900> can<00:00:42.050> add<00:00:42.230> in

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
first inversion arpeggio you can add in

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:53.850 
first inversion arpeggio you can add in
a<00:00:42.500> ninth<00:00:42.800> behind<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:43.820> third<00:00:44.059> of<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.300> chord

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.580 

and<00:00:54.850> here<00:00:55.090> for<00:00:55.270> the<00:00:55.360> second<00:00:55.780> inversion<00:00:56.050> shape

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
and here for the second inversion shape

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.490 
and here for the second inversion shape
we<00:00:57.160> can<00:00:57.370> add<00:00:57.610> in<00:00:57.880> the<00:00:58.360> seventh<00:00:58.750> again<00:00:59.080> right<00:00:59.350> in

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
we can add in the seventh again right in

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.350 
we can add in the seventh again right in
front<00:00:59.770> of<00:00:59.860> the<00:01:00.070> fifth<00:01:00.400> on<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.640> second<00:01:01.120> string

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
front of the fifth on the second string

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.070 
front of the fifth on the second string
so<00:01:02.110> if<00:01:02.200> we<00:01:02.290> have<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:02.680> shape
