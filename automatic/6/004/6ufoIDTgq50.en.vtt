00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:45.180

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.210

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:09.300
 I must not have talked about it 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.710
 they keep asking me for 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.330
 i do not believe in god, henry also knows 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.170
 believe in god 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.009
 that's why we will not do that to me 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.030
 what happens to it I believe 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:28.080
 since they give the number to you 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:36.480

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:41.250
 not on the but he does not 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:45.180
 I tell you what God has given me 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.730
 you miss a ball and delivered you 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.880
 I'm always here out there for you 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:55.350
 nothing feels if it's a jot otto 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.510

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.740
 who does not wait for you he gave her 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.280
 brother of no more than at all 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.280
 covers 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.479
 and that's just because you 're from the same woman 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.479
 should be broken 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.209
 the only thing that matters is that 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.209
 I am here and receive 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.720
 your brother has let you die 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.720
 so do the people 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.700
 fight more seriously then you die 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.700
 real quick 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:50.310
 It's over for you I know that 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.280
 whatever you think about me 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.280
 it is long gone 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.520
 mu 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.830
 out could counter 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.790
 Who does not want more dead first 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.790
 he threatened he is my brother 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.780
 that looks good, this man is her 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.349
 friend his brother brother he falls behind 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.500
 south far away from me 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:51.880
 I bring her to him 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.880
 your brother would have let you die 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.670
 that makes it clearer out there 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.310
 Do not end up as a fight then die 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.310
 you very fast 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.049
 not to think of a life that you 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.489
 have taken it is the price for it 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.030
 that made that I've had here 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.030
 everything under control 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.439
 what is he doing there he is not giving up 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.689
 finally unpacked by being so funny 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:36.689
 to upset about it and nowadays 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.130
 God does not want something to happen to me 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.780
 God does not feel that for you 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.360
 only thing that has relevance now is that 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.360
 I just he has not
