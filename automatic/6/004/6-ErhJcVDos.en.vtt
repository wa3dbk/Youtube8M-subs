this video for the knife link start by

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.169 
this video for the knife link start by
cutting<00:00:13.950> off<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.280> North<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.849> South

Poles<00:00:15.710> you<00:00:16.710> need<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.220> cut<00:00:17.430> deeply<00:00:18.090> enough<00:00:18.359> to

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
Poles you need to cut deeply enough to

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.340 
Poles you need to cut deeply enough to
expose<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.650> sections<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.430> your<00:00:20.689> citrus<00:00:21.689> if

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
expose the sections of your citrus if

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.320 
expose the sections of your citrus if
you<00:00:22.590> didn't<00:00:22.920> go<00:00:23.100> deep<00:00:23.369> enough<00:00:23.460> give<00:00:24.210> it

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
you didn't go deep enough give it

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.500 
you didn't go deep enough give it
another<00:00:24.600> go<00:00:24.840> until<00:00:25.650> both<00:00:26.010> sides<00:00:26.430> look<00:00:27.240> like<00:00:27.480> a

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
another go until both sides look like a

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.529 
another go until both sides look like a
flower<00:00:28.130> now<00:00:29.130> let's<00:00:29.490> cut<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.880> skin<00:00:30.150> off<00:00:30.210> in

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
flower now let's cut the skin off in

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.860 
flower now let's cut the skin off in
curvy<00:00:31.140> strips<00:00:31.769> we<00:00:32.550> need<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.910> go<00:00:33.059> deep<00:00:33.540> enough

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
curvy strips we need to go deep enough

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.130 
curvy strips we need to go deep enough
to<00:00:34.110> expose<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.100> sections<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.329> both<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.780> zest

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
to expose the sections so both the zest

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.060

and<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:38.340> white<00:00:38.550> path<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.780> come<00:00:39.989> off<00:00:40.140> it's

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
and the white path have to come off it's

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.549 
and the white path have to come off it's
important<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.180> curve<00:00:42.690> your<00:00:43.079> knife<00:00:43.260> to

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
section from the membrane and not to

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.289 
section from the membrane and not to
leave<00:01:43.229> any<00:01:43.530> good<00:01:43.920> part<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.670> membrane<00:01:45.060> of

leave any good part on the membrane of

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.560 
leave any good part on the membrane of
course<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.259> your<00:01:46.380> citrus<00:01:46.740> has<00:01:46.950> pits<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:48.299> might

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
course if your citrus has pits you might

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.060 
course if your citrus has pits you might
need<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.930> cut<00:01:49.170> down<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.740> then<00:01:50.250> down<00:01:50.729> again<00:01:52.070> see

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
need to cut down and then down again see

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.670 
need to cut down and then down again see
this<00:01:53.460> way<00:01:53.729> some<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.119> my<00:01:54.360> grapefruit<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:55.170> left

this way some of my grapefruit is left
on<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.340> membrane<00:01:56.689> but<00:01:57.689> if<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.960> happens<00:01:58.409> you

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
on the membrane but if that happens you

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.859 
on the membrane but if that happens you
can<00:01:58.829> always<00:01:59.040> pry<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.700> off<00:01:59.909> with<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.600> tip<00:02:00.840> of

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
can always pry it off with the tip of

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
sections out one by one until I get to

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.290 
sections out one by one until I get to
the<00:02:10.050> end
