00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
loop right one stop it around and

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.799 
loop right one stop it around and
there's<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.010> little<00:00:41.250> loop<00:00:41.910> here<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.570> you

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
there's this little loop here and you

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.840 
there's this little loop here and you

stick it through then you pull on both

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.840 
stick it through then you pull on both
loops<00:00:49.160> we<00:00:50.160> need<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.399> get<00:00:51.289> shortened<00:00:52.289> up<00:00:52.410> leads

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
loops we need to get shortened up leads

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.170 
loops we need to get shortened up leads
then<00:00:53.850> pull<00:00:54.719> these<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.280> it's<00:00:56.280> back<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
then pull these and it's back to the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.420 
then pull these and it's back to the
start<00:00:57.210> up<00:00:58.280> next

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
start up next

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.880

which affected with you cross if they

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.320 
which affected with you cross if they
see<00:02:38.500> another<00:02:38.680> starter<00:02:39.190> not<00:02:39.400> so<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.060> like<00:02:40.300> this

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
see another starter not so I like this

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.480 
see another starter not so I like this
but<00:02:43.330> I<00:02:43.390> put<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.050> landside<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:44.650> wouldn't<00:02:45.250> put

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
but I put the landside I wouldn't put

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.030 
but I put the landside I wouldn't put
the<00:02:45.610> right<00:02:45.760> hold<00:02:45.970> up<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.270> would<00:02:46.710> spin<00:02:47.710> anthis

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
the right hold up I would spin anthis

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.410 
the right hold up I would spin anthis
then<00:02:48.400> we<00:02:48.550> look<00:02:48.730> through<00:02:48.910> it<00:02:49.000> one<00:02:49.120> more<00:02:49.240> time<00:02:49.360> so

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
then we look through it one more time so

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.710 
then we look through it one more time so
this<00:02:49.690> one's<00:02:49.900> harder<00:02:50.290> than<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.640> Raven<00:02:51.640> up<00:02:51.760> but

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
this one's harder than the Raven up but

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.830 
this one's harder than the Raven up but
just<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:52.990> little<00:02:53.080> faster<00:02:53.560> certain<00:02:54.490> that<00:02:54.840> then

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
just a little faster certain that then

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:08.280 
just a little faster certain that then
he<00:02:55.960> go

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.560
