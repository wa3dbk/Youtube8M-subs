Wow well done things that I think is in
a<00:01:19.920> position<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.550> which<00:01:21.470> waves<00:01:22.470> been<00:01:22.860> pushing

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
a position in which waves been pushing

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.330 
a position in which waves been pushing
here<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.150> card<00:01:24.420> somewhere<00:01:25.100> yeah<00:01:26.100> they're

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
here is the card somewhere yeah they're

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.730 
here is the card somewhere yeah they're
pushing<00:01:26.910> down<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.080> picture<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.500> PIPA

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
pushing down on the picture the PIPA

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.710 
pushing down on the picture the PIPA
because<00:01:31.740> he<00:01:31.860> started<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.490> struggle<00:01:32.970> lanes

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
because he started the struggle lanes

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.080 
because he started the struggle lanes
but<00:01:34.590> then<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> wind<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.430> know<00:01:35.460> flying<00:01:35.910> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
but then the wind you know flying the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.820 
but then the wind you know flying the
kite<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.510> water<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:37.110> wind<00:01:37.260> pushing<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
kite in the water the wind pushing it

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.850 
kite in the water the wind pushing it
down<00:01:38.010> to<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> PIPA<00:01:38.580> and<00:01:38.930> now<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.200> he<00:01:40.440> can

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
down to the PIPA and now if he can

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:51.470 
down to the PIPA and now if he can
somehow<00:01:41.720> everything<00:01:49.820> sure<00:01:50.820> like<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.330> are

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
somehow everything sure like that are

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.980 
somehow everything sure like that are
watching<00:01:53.000> not<00:01:54.000> sure<00:01:54.270> what<00:01:54.510> they<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.780> do<00:01:54.900> in

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
watching not sure what they can do in

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.880 
watching not sure what they can do in
this<00:01:55.110> relations

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
this relations

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:05.120 
this relations
I<00:01:55.920> guess<00:01:56.220> they<00:01:56.370> get<00:01:56.520> all<00:02:03.530> bitchy<00:02:04.530> despairing

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
I guess they get all bitchy despairing

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.719 
I guess they get all bitchy despairing
back<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.550> or<00:02:05.820> each<00:02:06.150> trying<00:02:07.369> because<00:02:08.369> he<00:02:08.580> got

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
back in or each trying because he got

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.620 
back in or each trying because he got
munched<00:02:09.060> too

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.290 

I'm<00:03:36.170> doing<00:03:36.680> whatever<00:03:37.070> he<00:03:37.400> has<00:03:37.550> to<00:03:37.610> undo<00:03:38.060> there

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
I'm doing whatever he has to undo there

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.960 
I'm doing whatever he has to undo there
a<00:03:38.890> lot<00:03:39.890> of<00:03:39.920> things<00:03:40.640> I'd<00:03:40.940> say<00:03:40.990> and<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:43.430> board<00:03:43.760> is

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
a lot of things I'd say and the board is

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.250 
a lot of things I'd say and the board is
still<00:03:44.240> staying<00:03:44.540> there

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
still staying there

00:03:45.260 --> 00:04:12.640 
still staying there
the<00:03:45.770> miss<00:03:45.980> is<00:04:07.120> somehow<00:04:10.810> so<00:04:11.810> hard<00:04:12.020> to<00:04:12.170> find<00:04:12.350> in

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
the miss is somehow so hard to find in

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.160 
the miss is somehow so hard to find in
this<00:04:12.800> there<00:04:13.550> you<00:04:13.580> go

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
this there you go

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.750 
this there you go
and<00:04:15.170> Bishop<00:04:15.800> is<00:04:16.100> almost<00:04:16.370> there

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.120 

so<00:04:19.760> I<00:04:19.790> think<00:04:20.540> both<00:04:20.870> these<00:04:21.140> guys<00:04:21.410> will<00:04:21.710> go<00:04:21.920> can

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
so I think both these guys will go can

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.910 
so I think both these guys will go can
say<00:04:22.430> to<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.030> beach<00:04:23.260> there<00:04:24.260> is<00:04:24.440> a<00:04:24.470> good<00:04:24.680> thing

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
say to the beach there is a good thing

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.850 
say to the beach there is a good thing
