 of the video 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.890
 once the extraction is finished, no 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.049
 leave this folder we would have 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.340

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.780
 image made with our vision the moon 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.310
 tools if they do not have a job 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.200

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.900
 We solve the Spanish language in my 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.270
 case 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.740
 we see the next one we choose where 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.810
 we want it to be installed only from ccoo 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.440
 of fable or in the next one we stop 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.430
 this next following install and 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.440
 we wait until he finishes 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.730
 be installed once the 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.950
 installation is required to have 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.870
 updated these two programs and that 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.760
 the avengers are going to mark them and finish 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.740
 if I have both installed to 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.510
 markel cycle or end now 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.870
 let's go to create we go to the unit of 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.240
 cd we go to the folder profe and copy 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.590
 these two files 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.689
 now let's go local disk team c 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.869
 electronic arts program files 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:07.520
 how it started that network the reda 3 data 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.520
 and here we are going to paste it 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.690
 and we are going to replace the files 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.580
 and ready we execute it from that access 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.130
 live and we can play to perfection 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.990
 now let's try the commander game 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.420
 We bet several teams of 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.460
 recognition in the area we hope that 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.520
 their joint reports shed light on 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:31.010
 the intentions of the allies 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.030
 the advice of this but 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.030
 Sometimes it is so difficult 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.900
 had only dog ​​not killed all 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.070
 now that there seems to be nothing 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.510
 cast 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.709
 over here 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.780
 I guess the dark parts I do not see 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.780
 the enemies I think 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.010
 so is 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.849
 this closer sometimes perfect 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.400
 I think this is not the way to 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.400
 remove it 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.480
 Let's see 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.069
 Yes now 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.460
 if they are shooting us but do not take out 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.260
 a lot of life 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.520
 for working here I hope that 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.070
 enjoy the game and visit 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.430
