00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.930
 So their bad luck for the Edi Optimus Speed ​​decided the first device with a 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.680
 dual-core processor, we make the device ready to start together 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.809
 herewith the packaging 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.809
 Misha very briefly what is included 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.179
 yes of course a man the device itself a caught for the socket 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.689
 the data cable that goes with the late at the socket or PC 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.779
 on suitcases with 3 2 times five millimeter clinker that were in North Africa 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.470
 and manual of course, but they were only the device in the 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.620
 Sim-cards of the battery are already used in time that one of 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.570
 behind 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.270
 here once the cap I ever with the finger one 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.170
 not pressing this mystical place 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.690
 and now we see here 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.879
 the open device here is the sim card with the contact and sent it sooner 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:49.309
 on 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.329
 Put the battery over here then 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.330
 since hard to get out or clean 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.790
 then we have here 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.730
 Percent the entrance or the slot for the Migrol sd card this can be the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.110
 further extended up to 32 GB 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.009
 So that's it 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.729
 and then fold the battery cover nicely and start up the device 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.560
 Omit the grandma on the appearance and we wait together once per make 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.150
 the device ready to start 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.490
 confesses Luethi 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.650
 immediately a small introduction would have to come 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.300
 and now she starts 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.390
 First he has the opportunity to change the savers, we have to 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.840
 of course, do not do it now 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.719
 Inside it is already set in German 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.500
 then he has the opportunity to start the whole NaturTherme her 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.950
 and let's go 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.180
 that could set the time the date and so on and so on 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.200
 you have to start your own business now 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.570
 and I'll skip that one man to the next 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.040
 Then the idea here on it pointed out that they insert a good laugh 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.500
 is 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.210
 So the end of the registry by new or already an existing account 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.910
 Johnny Marr continues 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.690
 and age you can sign up now just do it together 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.340
 but never sign up because you enter your data 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.280
 if your data has entered Andreas Sander and it should have been 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.039
 just for a moment 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.319
 insert a google account 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.720
 so that brought up the case when you, for example, doctors download Volt 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.579
 Chargeable or free 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.289
 under then you have to be logged in with a google account 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.209
 now she is not connected to the w-lan 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.450
 then always press on it with w-lan connection can directly 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.610
 to adjust 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.080
 the WDR Zaya network is here a network shots I do that 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.649
 now also briefly 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:37.230
 if your data has entered thereby their offices and 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.299
 as well 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.500
 and there must be a short wait poem written that it springs 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:44.819
 Symbol that means they are connected 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.320
 Now you have to enter your normal password 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.430
 and then it starts we should now successfully connected here 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.909
 But complete meal 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.839
 now the possibility of their original come and so on 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:55.959
 synchronize 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.010
 the percent skip Hermann as well as Facebook Twitter MySpace 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.589
 I skip it too and now you can use the phone 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:08.049
 Let's go wait for the homescreen to load 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.959
 yes, our home screen endurance sees that a bit 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.329
 he is a bit overwhelmed now 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.229
 but we have here now almost finished devices I show you now 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:22.230
 close a few more shot 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.369
 when you press both 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:28.710
 then I could turn on the mobile network here, for example 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.709
 because the animals access points 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.579
 then goes to Mandalay New Year PN 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.519
 what is her opinion about arrests 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.439
 then you enter your data and Zarate GM I have on the Internet 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:42.610
 googled 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.769
 if you change another data hbz failure 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:46.629
 around 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.490
 The Napster operators then you have to contact them 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.540
 and request the access data 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.160
 which could be Streets SG Mode here just was and finds this determined 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:58.070
 also in march 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.070
 simply enter all the data once 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:07.409
 so that you have an animal I have given mine now took me to the portal 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.279
 enter the s80 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:10.250
 OK 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.300
 and now save here on context menu then offer the whole one 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.079
 House 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.229
 and you are connected to the mobile network 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.099
 Dennis work set of herbs would always be here on tones 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:26.060
 and look at the profile like value the possibility silently to states 

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:29.150
 about Zion the volume could change her 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.659
 Professors could stop here 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:34.689
 then had the ability to change any notification Stones 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:37.409
 fitting on that springs to one screen lock 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.639
 haptic feedback of the situation 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.639
 a find here certain settings make 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.779
 that's actually all the attitude he needs you are on the net now 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:51.059
 you are connected to this year in the google mail account what he saw 

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:53.409
 you could use it to go to the market 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:55.300
 Of course you have to accept that 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.129
 So the terms of use not once in a while as a free one 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:02.110
 Downloading games, for example, how often do you go for free? 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.400
 and since then he never has a description 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.940
 Screenshots I had comments here similar ERC and if first rounder 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.090
 Lambert return threw install and you have your heart that could 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.180
 Example Facebook Lions Peter Botz depend on Messenger Messenger and so on 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.770
 continue and download immediately 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.819
 Here you get a man overview of what this application can access 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:24.479
 you have to agree 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.919
 otherwise she herself does not need first documents so Interpreter Fourcade 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.550
 and you download the program both councils state ready 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.229
 You can now chat with the device while surfing and so on and so forth 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:37.919
 Receive emails 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.759
