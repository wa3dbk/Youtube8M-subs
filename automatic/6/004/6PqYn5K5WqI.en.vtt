00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 My name is around in Wendlingen 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.549
 welcome to another cinema 4d 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.589
 tutorial today's topic the extreme 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.719
 the absorbed that ekstrÃ¶ms object 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.550
 is under the point of generating 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.009
 then nerds and here we have 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.389
 according to that extreme object one 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.400
 another way to access it 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.140
 is where we are over here 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.640
 this icon should go then we should 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.260
 left mouse button on these marks 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.910
 pressed until this context menu 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.279
 appear and become accordingly 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.449
 making that extreme object out of easy 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.580
 We now turn the left mouse button again 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.460
 let go now we have one 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.260
 extreme object created but alone with 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.980
 we can still do this extreme object 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.800
 do nothing 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.730
 we need a profile the factory 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.700
 can study 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.010
 spline profiles on the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.250
 plans are also included 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.200
 then generate small and here we have 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.480
 everything blind and objects 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.800
 another option on displays 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.420
 to access it is 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.270
 we can go over an icon again 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.039
 To do this, we hold the left again 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.750
 mouse button on this mine is one 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.940
 pressed until again the context menu 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.890
 appears and have the choice here 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.020
 between different clans 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.750
 Here we have this idea 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.210
 once these clowns plan that assigns 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.070
 lions are splice whose course you are 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.830
 determine yourself 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.619
 these plauens plans interest plans the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.040
 we were already predefined 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.210
 can still change based on parameters 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.680
 Of course, I could now too 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.659
 draw own profile 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.790
 but I'm using a finished one here 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.329
 profile which I like very much 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.079
 this star 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.380
 now we see 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.420
 I have created this profile 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.060
 also appears in the editor what 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.649
 Now we will do that a little bit 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.310
 Scale something smaller 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.280
 We change the tool here 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.900
 I often install tool and do 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.170
 the whole thing a little smaller 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.160
 about what we have to do now is 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.240
 we have to change the plane 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.120
 To do this, we click once with the left 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.350
 mouse button on the object and under the 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.640
 menu item level 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:12.570
 we are now object mode im 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:16.050
 menu item level, we will not be the xy 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:19.130
 but sz and now has the whole 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.130
 already the right position 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.030
 we now have everything we need 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.290
 we have some object and we have 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.959
 a profile for further action 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.209
 it is very important it always gets 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.810
 the profile in the extruder object 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.780
 drawn 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.110
 we now hold the left mouse button 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.880
 here on the object took this profile 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.330
 pressed and pull the whole thing now 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.790
 above 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.740
 until just a vertical pillar shines 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.160
 Now we release the left mouse button 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.410
 and we see that we do not see 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.330
 but that sounds like the presentation of me 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.670
 Change this to a constant one 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.000
 shading and we see it already has 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.670
 something done 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.660
 For this we look and sexobject 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.269
 once more accurate 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.830
 what I did exactly here so we 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:14.459
 have a shift and the 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:17.160
 shift in the moment at the moment 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.150
 a shift in the direction that is 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.310
 Of course not right 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.600
 we would like to watch the tv psion direction 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.660
 So move up 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.730
 that 's xy and that's worth it 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.800
 so set the set value to zero 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.140
 the time value is always preset 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.690
 that's why we always have to 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.580
 change if we are not appropriately in 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:40.739
 want to explode the z direction 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:43.920
 and now here receives this y value or 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.110
 explode this whole now in y direction 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.120
 and we see we have exactly 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.880
 this effect we wanted to create 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.560
 we have exploded this profile now 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.600
 What else we can do we could 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.790
 let it work with a dvb on it 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.970
 always achieve very nice effects 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.770
 to create 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.680
 the formats the left mouse button on it 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.050
 pressed again is this context menu 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.700
 appears and choose accordingly 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.920
 this twist format is now 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.690
 this will already be this reformers of 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.690
 is described by this around cuboid 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.960
 I pull something up like that and what we do 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.260
 we have to do this 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.190
 Order formula 1 from dekra or the 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.610
 Order is very important 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:39.310
 first comes the profile and then comes the 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.220
 the form i order the fans 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.300
 below and we see it all fits 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.130
 Now that's not the case 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.160
 done but that's just because of that 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:52.510
 we do not give this the forma any direction 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.669
 have assigned and we see I know 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.970
 yes e mails a direction to 1 degree and 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.380
 the whole thing is already changing 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.240
 now here too ugly and 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.360
 overlaps but that is because 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.610
 that our extreme object is too few 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.669
 We have subdivisions to increase 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:13.620
 just the divisions and we see 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:16.840
 already that gives beautiful effects here 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.790
 so much for this object if you are more 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.919
 you want to know then write to me 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.930
 I'm glad about comments 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:27.060
 always and subscribe me with her 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.060
 the ongoing stays with robin until then
