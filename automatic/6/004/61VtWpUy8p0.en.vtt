00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.140
 a bit on the taste came 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.970
 I'm already back on 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.980

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.420
 Much will say let me know 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.910
 that's easy in the comments 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.890
 I have a template here 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.820
 picked out one extra not so 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.650
 difficult for me for the beginning though 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.210
 eva has explained that very well to me though 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.519
 I'll start with something like that first 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.689
 Simpler you are there again 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.400
 contain knots 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.279
 coming from the right to the right 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.430
 it continues to come from the left and after 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.350
 left on the normal to go I 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.680
 already knew 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:44.760
 which goes from right to right twice 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.309
 and the one who goes twice to the left 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.440
 where you go with the right band on the left 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.050
 band makes two knots and does it here 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.800
 you with the nimble band on the right 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.820
 tie two knots yes I will now 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.629
 give it a try 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.229
 I have a thread of length 120 for that 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:08.580
 cm in purple a thread of length 120 cm 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.580
 in yellow and two threads of length 120 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.439
 centimeter in black also adhesive tape 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.360
 I'll have that back at the table 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:21.960
 can fix and scissors me so 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.590
 take all bands together again and 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.259
 put them twice what they all end 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.850
 down here and one up here 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.299
 bend and here I do one again 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.299
 node 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.540
 I stick the knot with mine 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.360
 Tape your table firmly and then you can 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.920
 it starts immediately but I submit 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:56.420
 So I have a black band first 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.420
 then a long band 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.820
 then again a black one 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.000
 the two yellow ones 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:26.910
 again a black again a purple 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:30.510
 wet and a black I start here 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:36.510
 and do that with the purple ribbon 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:41.330
 black tied a knot back and 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:44.879
 a knot back to the right 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.879
 turn left to right here in 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:51.720
 the middle I do with the black 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:59.810
 tied on the yellow band first 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.810
 knot to the right and then to the left 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:14.459
 So exactly the opposite rates 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:17.370
 from the first date stays in here 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.040
 next, I'll do the black one 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:25.200
 tied to the next yellow band one 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:30.750
 knot to the left so again one 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:37.680
 turn knot and then a knot behind 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:39.989
 right and here I am already here 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:47.430
 I do one with the songs band 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:52.590
 knot first to the right and a knot 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:54.569
 back inside so the first row 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.669
 these were all the walls now knot 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.169
 even I'm here because this line 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:04.949
 I just have to do the normal ones now 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:07.620
 Knots make two knots with purple 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:11.430
 and black I'm doing very good now 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.699
 to the right with yellow and yellow I do 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:18.000
 the knot to the right and with purple and 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:20.359
 black I make the knot from the right 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.359
 to the left 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.070
 Now I have arrived here 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.170
 I open up with the black one now 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.190
 the black also after such a knot 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:49.970
 right then here the walls knot of 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.610
 left to left and here from right 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:57.370
 right with target with the black one 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.370
 on the black to the left 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.580
 so I already arrived here 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.070
 now I do with the black and 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.880
 the purple custom again the normal 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:25.280
 notes with the inner black and 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.110
 I wiener here on this left 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:36.010
 I have to do something completely normal 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:40.220
 also the knot twice 12 to the right 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:43.450
 then I do with the yellow here too 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.450
 knot this standard 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.840
 1 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.840
 2 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:03.949
 and here with the inner black and 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:13.689
 the lasers with the black on the 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:13.689
 two knots to the left and 2 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.960
 so now I have the first one 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.080
 round through 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:30.199
 I'm going to teach something so I have 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:34.370
 now here are the knot four that sing 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:38.539
 I have to lead in here and then 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:43.060
 here the black ones out there and in the 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:46.850
 In the middle one recognizes also the give point 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:52.490
 hiding something here and there 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:54.410
 that even the other money so that 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.300
 I am now continuing on my way 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.310
 I have the threads again like here 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:02.720
 at the beginning in the position outside black 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:06.199
 then purple black yellow here has become one 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.300
 a little bit twisted but the second 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:11.300
 there would also be here in the middle then 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.550
 comes again black purple black so 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:17.240
 I can easily from up here 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:20.510
 I'm ready to start again 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:23.900
 I stopped the room because I have 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:25.460
 noted purple is already relatively short 

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.139
 So the other horses have become 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.960
 still so long and purple has been here 

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:32.510
 so as a small tip to you if you 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:35.090
 but that makes bracelet imitate word 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:37.280
 dear reader something was so here I do 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:40.510
 now the usual conclusion i share 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:44.330
 the whole thing down here in two parts and 

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:46.729
 bad on one side so i am 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:50.229
 At the end I make a knot and on the 

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:50.229
 magnificently other side it just 

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:09.100
 Sun and served I cut again so 

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.100
