 Hi guys, how are you? What's up? 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:11.040
 It's Friday and it's the last day of the week. 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:14.160
 So I posted video every day and that's 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.470
 the last hair also this week and it is 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.830
 this hair that was much asked for is 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.289
 an afro hair then the first thing i 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.090
 I picked up a same black color and side pencil. 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.949
 of the statue and half of sketches and around 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.199
 from her head to the height where I 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.079
 I wanted to fulfill all yes 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.030
 probes around you to get an idea 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.579
 How is your hair going to look? 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.550
 do as much volume as you want 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.100
 I started to do it if those 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.710
 so randomly so 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.010
 It makes some loose around the middle there 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.550
 lost in the middle of all this hair and 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.500
 goes on doing several until you fill everything and 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.120
 soon afterwards I went with len 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.370
 see that as crayons that I used 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.699
 watermarked then the logical blender will 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.320
 dilute all that pigment that's there you 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.489
 there is no legend that one can use a 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.619
 another marker 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.610
 or even water if it was not from r 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.060
 Your role is to make everything 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.189
 this and mix together and then I saw how 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.070
 the black marker and did the same thing as 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.500
 I did with the colored pencil simply 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.890
 making several caches around 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.350
 all the hair so I caught it points one 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.570
 bit thicker than my marker 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.210
 have two points at the end a little higher 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.810
 or another one that they think is frosty and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.700
 bevelled tip I made several shadows 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.790
 so sleepy realize he has enough 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.700
 white in the middle then passing this 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.110
 bevelled tip it will leave less 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.460
 shine on the hair let him more 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.590
 bulky 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.409
 then my false pen or I saw 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.119
 the ends of the hair 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.729
 some separate ways just to leave 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.649
 slightly defined and the wires will not 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.110
 do not randomly land if you stay 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.600
 satisfied and then if you still want 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.820
 do something if you can do it 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.770
 some bunches with an order is white 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.890
 to give a little more volume but 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.440
 it's not like that either 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.400
 the extremely necessary good subject and 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.040
 so does this hair black power 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.660
