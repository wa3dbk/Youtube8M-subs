00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.490 
fans Hernandez had a lot of huge place
from<00:01:54.000> fullback<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.720> thought<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.320> was

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
from fullback so I thought that I was

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.929 
from fullback so I thought that I was
going<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.680> get<00:01:55.920> him<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.430> put<00:01:56.640> him<00:01:56.729> as<00:01:56.850> a

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
going to get him and put him as a

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.810 
going to get him and put him as a
fullback<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.509> be<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> very<00:01:57.960> good<00:01:58.020> fullback<00:01:58.820> but

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
fullback and be a very good fullback but

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.999 
fullback and be a very good fullback but
he<00:01:59.969> ends<00:02:00.060> up<00:02:00.149> not<00:02:00.329> being<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.780> good<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.290> rank

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
he ends up not being that good of rank
