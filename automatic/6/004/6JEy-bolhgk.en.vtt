this<00:00:00.840> story<00:00:01.429> is<00:00:02.429> about<00:00:03.380> my<00:00:04.380> training<00:00:04.980> as<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.160> an

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
this story is about my training as a an

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.650 
this story is about my training as a an
evolutionary<00:00:06.569> biologist<00:00:08.510> and<00:00:09.740> how<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:11.660> got

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
evolutionary biologist and how I got

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.509 
evolutionary biologist and how I got
really<00:00:12.900> interested<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.530> how<00:00:13.799> something<00:00:14.309> comes

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
really interested in how something comes

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.460 
really interested in how something comes
out<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.700> nothing<00:00:15.210> which<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> question<00:00:16.289> that

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
out of nothing which is a question that

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.689 
out of nothing which is a question that
almost<00:00:17.039> no<00:00:17.539> biologist<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:19.460> daring<00:00:20.460> enough<00:00:20.550> to

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
almost no biologist is daring enough to

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.040 
almost no biologist is daring enough to
explore<00:00:21.920> you<00:00:22.920> know<00:00:22.949> it's<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.820> like<00:00:24.359> getting

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
explore you know it's it's like getting

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.509 
explore you know it's it's like getting
a<00:00:25.230> really<00:00:25.470> beautiful<00:00:25.590> watch<00:00:26.480> and<00:00:27.480> then

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
a really beautiful watch and then

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.620 
a really beautiful watch and then
refusing<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.640> take<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.880> apart<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> figure<00:00:30.390> out

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
refusing to take it apart to figure out

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.220 
refusing to take it apart to figure out
how<00:00:31.099> it<00:00:32.099> works<00:00:34.579> anyway<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.880> think<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.050> quite

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
how it works anyway I think it's quite

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.060 
how it works anyway I think it's quite
simple<00:00:37.590> if<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.309> two<00:00:38.460> patterns<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.940> lines

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
simple if you have two patterns of lines

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.190 
simple if you have two patterns of lines
then<00:00:41.120> where<00:00:42.120> they<00:00:42.270> meet<00:00:42.450> there's<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.930> third

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
then where they meet there's a third

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.709 
then where they meet there's a third
pattern<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.770> middle<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.480> that's<00:00:45.480> all

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
pattern in the middle and that's all

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.330 
pattern in the middle and that's all
there<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.200> there's<00:00:46.559> no<00:00:46.649> real<00:00:46.860> mystery

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
there is to it there's no real mystery

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.819 
there is to it there's no real mystery
to<00:00:48.180> existence<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.899> don't<00:00:49.079> need<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> divine

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
to existence you don't need a divine

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.560 
to existence you don't need a divine

hand to explain that so this is my

hand to explain that so this is my
little<00:00:54.719> instrumental<00:00:55.289> ode<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.100> it's

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
little instrumental ode to that it's

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.979 
little instrumental ode to that it's
called<00:00:56.489> bait<00:00:56.760> waray<00:00:57.030> which<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.629> French<00:00:57.899> for
