you<00:01:08.180> can<00:01:08.360> see<00:01:08.540> straight<00:01:08.870> away<00:01:08.900> that<00:01:09.200> it's

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
you can see straight away that it's

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.230 
you can see straight away that it's
quite<00:01:09.860> different<00:01:10.160> to<00:01:10.580> a<00:01:10.610> conventional

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
the stand not the flash head you might

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.090 
the stand not the flash head you might
think<00:01:17.360> that<00:01:17.480> such<00:01:17.930> a<00:01:17.960> big<00:01:18.200> accessory<00:01:18.590> would<00:01:18.980> be

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
think that such a big accessory would be

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.370 
think that such a big accessory would be
difficult<00:01:19.340> to<00:01:19.670> assemble<00:01:20.240> but<00:01:20.750> just<00:01:21.020> look<00:01:21.200> at

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
difficult to assemble but just look at

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.520 
difficult to assemble but just look at
this<00:01:22.030> we<00:01:23.030> just<00:01:23.240> hold<00:01:23.480> the<00:01:23.600> ring<00:01:23.870> in<00:01:24.050> one<00:01:24.200> hand

case<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.740> light<00:02:07.070> transmitter<00:02:07.670> mounted<00:02:08.330> at<00:02:08.690> the

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
case a light transmitter mounted at the

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.719 
case a light transmitter mounted at the
optical<00:02:09.200> center<00:02:09.590> of<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.800> dish<00:02:09.979> giving<00:02:10.639> the

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
optical center of the dish giving the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.899 
optical center of the dish giving the
most<00:02:10.879> even<00:02:11.420> light<00:02:11.599> possible<00:02:12.129> the<00:02:13.129> mains<00:02:13.370> cable

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
most even light possible the mains cable

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.090 
most even light possible the mains cable
is<00:02:14.090> fed<00:02:14.359> through<00:02:14.389> a<00:02:14.689> slit<00:02:14.930> in<00:02:15.109> the<00:02:15.230> rear<00:02:15.409> and<00:02:15.650> if

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
is fed through a slit in the rear and if

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.190 
is fed through a slit in the rear and if
using<00:02:16.460> a<00:02:16.550> saintly<00:02:16.850> this<00:02:17.390> would<00:02:17.570> also<00:02:17.720> fit

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
using a saintly this would also fit

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.230 
using a saintly this would also fit
through<00:02:18.440> here<00:02:18.850> okay

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
through here okay

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.540 
through here okay
so<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.450> can<00:02:20.720> now<00:02:20.870> turn<00:02:20.930> my<00:02:21.320> unit<00:02:21.620> on<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.010> fit<00:02:22.460> the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
so I can now turn my unit on and fit the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.300 
so I can now turn my unit on and fit the
front<00:02:22.730> cover<00:02:23.080> if<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.230> took<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.440> flash<00:02:24.710> meter<00:02:24.980> and

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
front cover if I took a flash meter and

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.920 
front cover if I took a flash meter and
took<00:02:25.550> readings<00:02:26.000> from<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.330> center<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.900> the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
took readings from the center to the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.110 
took readings from the center to the
edge<00:02:27.170> I<00:02:27.410> will<00:02:27.890> find<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.280> optic<00:02:28.640> it's<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.910> most

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
edge I will find the optic it's the most

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.500

it<00:03:32.720> works<00:03:33.640> standing<00:03:34.640> here<00:03:34.880> you<00:03:35.210> can<00:03:35.420> see<00:03:35.630> that

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
it works standing here you can see that

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.450 
it works standing here you can see that
Claire's<00:03:36.110> head<00:03:36.350> is<00:03:36.470> right<00:03:36.740> in<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.100> center<00:03:37.430> of

and<00:03:40.400> behind<00:03:40.790> her<00:03:41.210> head<00:03:41.530> we<00:03:42.530> could<00:03:42.770> slide<00:03:43.100> it

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
and behind her head we could slide it

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.950 
and behind her head we could slide it
forwards<00:03:43.700> so<00:03:44.270> that<00:03:44.420> we<00:03:44.510> get<00:03:44.690> much<00:03:44.930> more

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
forwards so that we get much more

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.930 
forwards so that we get much more

as<00:04:03.590> well<00:04:03.740> as<00:04:03.920> our<00:04:04.070> subject<00:04:04.550> all<00:04:04.910> with<00:04:05.510> just<00:04:05.750> one

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
as well as our subject all with just one

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.960 
as well as our subject all with just one
light<00:04:07.660> as<00:04:08.660> we<00:04:09.050> have<00:04:09.260> about<00:04:09.530> 28<00:04:10.070> square<00:04:10.550> feet<00:04:10.790> of

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
light as we have about 28 square feet of

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.000 
light as we have about 28 square feet of
light<00:04:11.180> source<00:04:11.510> we<00:04:12.110> can<00:04:12.350> of<00:04:12.530> course<00:04:12.770> use<00:04:12.980> the

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
light source we can of course use the

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.850 
light source we can of course use the
octor<00:04:13.460> to<00:04:13.610> light<00:04:13.790> a<00:04:13.820> much<00:04:14.210> larger<00:04:14.690> area<00:04:14.900> say<00:04:15.830> a

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
octor to light a much larger area say a

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.250

group<00:04:18.470> of<00:04:18.650> people<00:04:19.040> and<00:04:19.280> because<00:04:20.060> it's<00:04:20.239> so<00:04:20.390> big

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
group of people and because it's so big

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.900 
group of people and because it's so big
we<00:04:20.930> still<00:04:21.200> have<00:04:21.350> a<00:04:21.380> great<00:04:21.620> soft<00:04:22.100> light<00:04:22.340> even

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
we still have a great soft light even

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.870 
we still have a great soft light even
when<00:04:23.060> we<00:04:23.180> back<00:04:23.390> it<00:04:23.540> off<00:04:23.660> from<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.990> subject

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
when we back it off from the subject

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.430 
when we back it off from the subject
there<00:04:25.880> are<00:04:26.030> two<00:04:26.270> more<00:04:26.510> ways<00:04:26.720> to<00:04:26.750> use<00:04:27.229> the

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
there are two more ways to use the

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.590 
there are two more ways to use the
elinchrom<00:04:27.740> octa<00:04:28.190> that<00:04:28.580> i<00:04:28.610> want<00:04:28.880> to<00:04:29.000> show<00:04:29.180> you

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
elinchrom octa that i want to show you

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.050 
elinchrom octa that i want to show you
so<00:04:30.080> make<00:04:30.260> sure<00:04:30.290> you<00:04:30.710> watch<00:04:30.920> the<00:04:31.190> octo<00:04:31.490> parts<00:04:31.850> 2

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
so make sure you watch the octo parts 2

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.750 
so make sure you watch the octo parts 2
