00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello hello good morning today we are 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:10.280
 doing a graphomotor exercise 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.469
 this is an activity to develop 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.860
 in the finest movements of the hand 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.110
 and prepare them for writing and want 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.419
 tell them where we got this from 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.669
 Exercise is a very simple exercise 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:27.200
 wants to show you the folder that 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:30.380
 we created today look you did it very 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.460
 you did all the exercises right 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.480
 the break 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.010
 if you want to do other things let's go to 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.880
 show the folder first 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.870
 grafomotricidad ok you think 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.450
 this is the folder I want to show you 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.540
 booklet for the development of the 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.060
 basic motor skills here has compiled 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.830
 materials that serve to develop 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.810
 the finest movements for the 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.810
 writing in this folder 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.390
 part of the material I have taken from this 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.570
 blog blog world special point 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.510
 blogspot.com visit that blog you 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.610
 they will find many materials 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.880
 the author herself gives him ideas of how 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.470
 to be able to work another page from where I've 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:26.300
 taken the graphomotor exercises 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.300
 There are several of this page 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.690
 to see and see if you look like that 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.840
 blogspot colors 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.080
 and another page from where you took the 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.220
 grafomotricity exercises to see here 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.220
 is at the foot is 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.190
 half a point with good the fastest 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.990
 that easier educates small educates little ones 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.080
 then these gas exercises 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.780
 grafomotricidad come from the most 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.830
 complexes from the simplest to 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.370
 the most complex 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.950
 we have the ones that are like the ones that shine 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.390
 has made you that they are only doing 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.229
 lines 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.620
 to these for example are more a little 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.040
 more complicated complicated because it's going 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.840
 in zigzag this is also simple is 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.260
 I also take it from another page now 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.130
 so I do not remember this is more creative 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.120
 because it has 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.099
 the drawing of a 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.099
 the turtles and it's the circular shape 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.310
 here we continue with 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.220
 on the initial page that I mentioned to you 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:44.319
 the blog of the special world because here 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.319
 it brings me to make vertical lines 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:52.290
 challenged in a very 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:56.459
 very very simple and here are the Xs 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.140
 or as it is called aspas then this 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.569
 It is a material 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.310
 Suitable for children who are just going to 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.370
 start writing to reinforce the 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.610
 truth and there's more now how is it 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.240
 We are working with brightness 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:17.190
 we have taken from the internet we have 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.770
 printed and this time we have laminated and 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.930
 we are ringing it we are 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.720
 activating in this folder that is going to be 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.460
 the graphomotor folder then 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.710
 every day that she has to make a 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.780
 activity we only get out of this 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.200
 folder we take out a sheet of this folder 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.790
 she does the exercise when she finishes 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.180
 do 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.799
 a wet cloth we erase the activity 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.200
 because as it is a plasticized material 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.710
 has that facility that can not be 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.490
 You can erase to use it again 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.490
 so 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.150
 that is today's idea for the 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.960
 graphomotor exercises for 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.410
 prepare the most stop 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.410
 Y 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.870
 I hope you like the video 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.910
 ballay
