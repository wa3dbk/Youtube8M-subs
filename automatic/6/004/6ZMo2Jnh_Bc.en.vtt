00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 good afternoon dear friends with you 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.899
 again perpetuum or alexander 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.450
 call it what you want so do you think 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.139
 how much time does an ordinary player need 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.360
 maykravt 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.370
 whether less experienced to build 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.490
 here is such a house with all 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.480
 necessary resources but at least minutes 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.090
 five ten and this mod is designed to simplify 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.640
 little construction of similar houses 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.859
 Now you can create a house to share 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.940
 seconds literally in one click in any 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.329
 minecraft point whether from the jungle 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.469
 desert or any other place without 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.320
 availability of required 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.710
 without the necessary mod resources 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.410
 allows you to propagate wood and stone 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.930
 when we make this little 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.899
 blog with one click on it with us 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.180
 jumps off here is such a house we can 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.920
 to take it apart from here 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.170
 houses we can build several 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.640
 such small squares then them 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.309
 multiply again and so on to infinity 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.589
 therefore modpaka cheating is considered 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.439
 because it requires too few resources 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.799
 to build a lot of resource-demanding 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.240
 buildings let me show you how it works 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.869
 in order to make this interesting 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.150
 Thing we need a workbench 1 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.630
 bake one torch 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:26.009
 three stone slabs and and three pieces of wood 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.420
 it turns out like this 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.090
 instant house 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.100
 let's see how it works here we are 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.460
 hold in your hand this pocket small 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.920
 house 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.100
 let's build a more accurate use 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.530
 click on the land of the OMON and lined up 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.619
 giant house we almost him not in it 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.750
 stuck now we have two such houses 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.810
 Of course this is without a doubt cheating 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.200
 and very seriously and not worth it 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.240
 blame 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.220
 players if they use this 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.320
 mod because for experienced players he 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.180
 can slightly diversify the game in 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.090
 Any mixture of you can deploy your 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.149
 camp house settle in it and 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.890
 wait out the night then just leave let's go 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.990
 let's see what we have in this house 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.750
 Immediately in the house we have two 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.979
 storage box 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.440
 here they are actually 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.629
 two torches to also 3 torches that will 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.659
 lighting this house glass which is also 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.849
 can be broken down and mined with 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:24.030
 picks with a light touch from the enchanted 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:27.030
 we have here immediately a furnace and 2 workbenches that 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.400
 is certainly superfluous, I highly recommend 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.250
 Although the author is unlikely but the English-language 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.420
 you are unlikely he will ever hear me 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.980
 make this house a little smaller 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.519
 because it's not going anywhere at all 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.360
 good 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.310
 you can just break these boards and 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.230
 build more of them like houses and so 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.569
 endlessly build a whole city 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.120
 so it is not very correct it 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.400
 cheating is undoubtedly cheating but mod 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.959
 good and guys i advise you it 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.629
 use if you go to 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.859
 distant travels with you were perpetuum 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.720
 or Alexander 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.579
 if you like subscribe 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.950
 put like if you do not like 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.950
 don't do this until new meetings yet
