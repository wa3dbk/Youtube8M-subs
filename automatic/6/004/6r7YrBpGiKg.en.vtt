are<00:01:21.780> summer<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:23.159> says<00:01:23.460> free<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.390> get<00:01:24.509> to

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
are summer but it says free you get to

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.539 
are summer but it says free you get to
99<00:01:25.110> percent<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.680> won't<00:01:25.860> let<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.040> download<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
99 percent it won't let you download the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.960 
99 percent it won't let you download the
rest<00:01:26.790> my<00:01:27.420> theory<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.380> fit<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.400> EES<00:01:29.700> bots

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
rest my theory is that fit the EES bots

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.640 
rest my theory is that fit the EES bots
have<00:01:30.119> done<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.450> purpose<00:01:30.530> that<00:01:31.530> they've

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
have done it on purpose that they've

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.969 
have done it on purpose that they've
actually<00:01:31.799> released<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.670> purpose<00:01:33.409> early<00:01:34.409> so

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
actually released it on purpose early so

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.700 
actually released it on purpose early so
that<00:01:35.009> everybody<00:01:35.520> gets<00:01:35.790> up<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.360> 99<00:01:36.990> percent<00:01:37.020> so

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
that everybody gets up to 99 percent so

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.319 
that everybody gets up to 99 percent so
when<00:01:37.860> they<00:01:37.979> actually<00:01:38.310> release<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:38.970> 100

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
when they actually release it for 100

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.260 
when they actually release it for 100
and<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:40.070> 1800<00:01:41.070> Microsoft<00:01:41.520> Points<00:01:41.700> you

really expected that many people to buy

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.850 
really expected that many people to buy
it<00:01:53.909> because<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.630> know<00:01:55.110> nine<00:01:55.350> people<00:01:55.619> are
