00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.350
 different workshops that allow 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.880
 just to better understand the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.549
 care 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.150
 that we do not necessarily have access to it 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.130
 discover new things 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.140
 of ourselves we would not have been brought 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.390

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.280
 professionals in the same place as it is 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.520
 herman concept 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.009

 this event because it allows them 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.980
 to relax I think that today 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.720
 all the women 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.280
