00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
can buses on the vehicle so we can see

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.330 
can buses on the vehicle so we can see
other<00:00:46.510> items<00:00:47.290> that<00:00:47.350> are<00:00:47.500> happening<00:00:47.920> on<00:00:48.190> the

other items that are happening on the
vehicle<00:00:48.670> and<00:00:48.790> we<00:00:48.940> also<00:00:49.090> have<00:00:49.330> a<00:00:49.360> secondary

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
vehicle and we also have a secondary

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.380 
vehicle and we also have a secondary
input<00:00:50.320> current<00:00:50.680> range<00:00:50.920> that's<00:00:51.700> available<00:00:52.210> so

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
input current range that's available so

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.700 
input current range that's available so
if<00:00:52.510> they<00:00:52.630> have<00:00:52.750> an<00:00:52.870> idea<00:00:53.020> where<00:00:53.380> they<00:00:53.500> have<00:00:53.680> a

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
if they have an idea where they have a

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.360 
if they have an idea where they have a
current<00:00:54.160> problem<00:00:54.520> we<00:00:55.150> can<00:00:55.330> check<00:00:56.260> that<00:00:56.530> all

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
current problem we can check that all

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.880 
current problem we can check that all
this<00:00:57.550> data<00:00:57.790> is<00:00:58.090> saved<00:00:58.510> on<00:00:58.750> an<00:00:58.870> SD<00:00:59.050> card<00:00:59.560> that

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
this data is saved on an SD card that

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.010 
this data is saved on an SD card that
goes<00:01:00.160> in<00:01:00.340> this<00:01:00.460> slot<00:01:00.700> right<00:01:00.730> here<00:01:00.970> and<00:01:01.720> we<00:01:01.900> then

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
goes in this slot right here and we then

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.229 
goes in this slot right here and we then
take<00:01:02.230> that<00:01:02.410> data<00:01:02.470> and<00:01:02.860> we<00:01:03.370> move<00:01:03.520> it<00:01:03.670> to<00:01:03.700> the<00:01:03.850> PC

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
take that data and we move it to the PC

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.590 
take that data and we move it to the PC
once<00:01:05.050> we<00:01:05.170> plug<00:01:05.350> into<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.830> PC<00:01:06.250> we<00:01:07.210> can<00:01:07.390> see

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
once we plug into the PC we can see

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.320 
once we plug into the PC we can see
overall<00:01:08.140> battery<00:01:08.740> voltage<00:01:09.250> overall<00:01:09.970> battery

overall battery voltage overall battery

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.080 
overall battery voltage overall battery
current<00:01:10.660> we<00:01:11.620> have<00:01:11.650> our<00:01:12.190> auxiliary<00:01:12.640> current

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
current we have our auxiliary current

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.270 
current we have our auxiliary current
channel<00:01:13.420> that's<00:01:13.570> actually<00:01:14.230> tied<00:01:14.470> on<00:01:14.680> we<00:01:15.100> see

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
channel that's actually tied on we see

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.370 
channel that's actually tied on we see
ant<00:01:15.580> power<00:01:15.820> so<00:01:16.180> how<00:01:16.360> much<00:01:16.570> current<00:01:17.080> is<00:01:17.200> going

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
ant power so how much current is going

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.650 
ant power so how much current is going
into<00:01:17.680> or<00:01:18.040> out<00:01:18.070> of<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.430> battery<00:01:18.850> and<00:01:19.150> then<00:01:19.540> we

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
into or out of the battery and then we

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.900 
into or out of the battery and then we
also<00:01:19.810> have<00:01:20.110> an<00:01:20.260> event<00:01:20.560> that<00:01:20.710> we<00:01:20.860> can<00:01:21.040> set<00:01:21.250> up<00:01:21.280> so

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
also have an event that we can set up so

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.430 
also have an event that we can set up so
we<00:01:22.030> can<00:01:22.150> actually<00:01:22.330> see<00:01:22.630> how<00:01:22.660> long<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.200> drive

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
we can actually see how long the drive

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.340 
we can actually see how long the drive
cycles<00:01:23.890> are<00:01:24.070> that<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.670> customer<00:01:25.090> had<00:01:25.300> we<00:01:26.110> see

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
cycles are that the customer had we see

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.490 
cycles are that the customer had we see
a<00:01:26.620> total<00:01:27.310> of<00:01:27.460> 35<00:01:28.180> hours<00:01:28.600> worth<00:01:28.810> of<00:01:28.960> data<00:01:29.110> on<00:01:29.350> the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
a total of 35 hours worth of data on the

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.399 
a total of 35 hours worth of data on the
screen<00:01:29.650> right<00:01:30.010> now

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
screen right now

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.859 
screen right now
and<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.310> actually<00:01:32.700> tie<00:01:33.000> our<00:01:33.329> cursor<00:01:33.689> to

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
and we can actually tie our cursor to

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.109 
and we can actually tie our cursor to
this<00:01:34.020> information<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.070> we<00:01:35.189> can<00:01:35.369> see<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> exact

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
this information so we can see the exact

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.789 
this information so we can see the exact
time<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.840> certain<00:01:37.229> events<00:01:37.350> actually

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
time that certain events actually

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.889 
time that certain events actually
happened<00:01:38.009> as<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.850> move<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.240> cursor<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
happened as I move the cursor on the

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.710 
happened as I move the cursor on the
screen<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:41.039> clock<00:01:41.280> will<00:01:41.490> adjust<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:42.060> well<00:01:42.509> as

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
screen the clock will adjust as well as

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.190 
screen the clock will adjust as well as
all<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.409> readings<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.369> are<00:01:44.729> happening

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
all of the readings that are happening

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.319 
all of the readings that are happening
this<00:01:46.200> customer<00:01:46.590> had<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> problem<00:01:47.179> where<00:01:48.179> they

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
this customer had a problem where they

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.999 
this customer had a problem where they
actually<00:01:48.539> started<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.200> vehicle<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.860> see

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
actually started the vehicle you can see

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.919 
actually started the vehicle you can see
where<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> vehicle<00:01:50.700> started<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.360> then

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
where the vehicle started and then

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.340 
where the vehicle started and then
stopped<00:01:53.299> but<00:01:54.299> when<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.600> vehicle<00:01:54.960> was<00:01:55.079> turned

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
stopped but when the vehicle was turned

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.279 
stopped but when the vehicle was turned
off<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.220> secondary<00:01:56.700> current<00:01:56.970> stayed<00:01:57.390> on<00:01:57.630> and

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
off the secondary current stayed on and

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.410 
off the secondary current stayed on and
we<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.649> see<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.979> by<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.189> cursor<00:01:59.640> that<00:02:00.270> they

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
we can see that by the cursor that they

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.539 
we can see that by the cursor that they
were<00:02:00.479> pulling<00:02:00.810> 900<00:02:01.500> milliamps<00:02:01.979> worth<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.310> burn
