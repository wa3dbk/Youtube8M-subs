00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
double double action it's a case that

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.009 
double double action it's a case that
nice<00:03:42.690> case<00:03:43.079> life<00:03:43.730> there<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:44.819> go<00:03:44.940> took<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.600> tap

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
nice case life there you go took the tap

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:52.069 
nice case life there you go took the tap
the<00:03:46.170> top<00:03:46.319> blocks<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:50.420> there<00:03:51.420> we<00:03:51.690> go<00:03:51.840> that's

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
the top blocks and there we go that's

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.050 
the top blocks and there we go that's
how<00:03:52.230> you're<00:03:52.380> supposed<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.650> get<00:03:52.829> over<00:03:52.920> there<00:03:53.190> it

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
how you're supposed to get over there it

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.220 
how you're supposed to get over there it
still<00:03:54.269> casing<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:54.690> little<00:03:54.930> bit<00:03:55.019> but<00:03:55.139> that's

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
still casing a little bit but that's

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.710 
still casing a little bit but that's
okay<00:03:55.609> that's<00:03:56.609> not<00:03:56.700> I'm<00:03:56.880> probably<00:03:57.030> wrong<00:03:57.450> get

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
okay that's not I'm probably wrong get

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.270 
okay that's not I'm probably wrong get
more<00:03:57.840> lap<00:03:58.049> so<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:58.349> gotta<00:03:58.530> get<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:58.739> drift

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
more lap so you gotta get that drift

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.550 
more lap so you gotta get that drift
into<00:03:59.519> this<00:03:59.639> back<00:04:00.090> corner<00:04:00.120> just<00:04:00.810> right<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.470> get

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
into this back corner just right to get

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.020 
into this back corner just right to get
through<00:04:01.709> there<00:04:01.799> quickly<00:04:02.040> just<00:04:02.250> triple

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
through there quickly just triple

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.020 
through there quickly just triple
through<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.299> roofs<00:04:04.669> are<00:04:05.669> you<00:04:05.790> hitting<00:04:05.940> the

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
through the roofs are you hitting the

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.610 
through the roofs are you hitting the
loops<00:04:06.269> like<00:04:06.359> it's<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.569> rhythm<00:04:06.810> section<00:04:07.139> or<00:04:07.260> is

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
loops like it's a rhythm section or is

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.900 
loops like it's a rhythm section or is
that<00:04:07.739> tough<00:04:07.950> block<00:04:08.160> not<00:04:08.370> getting<00:04:08.639> out<00:04:08.730> that's

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
that tough block not getting out that's

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.309 
that tough block not getting out that's
a<00:04:09.000> really<00:04:09.329> tough<00:04:09.510> tough<00:04:09.720> luck<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:10.049> doesn't<00:04:10.260> get

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
a really tough tough luck it doesn't get

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.309 
a really tough tough luck it doesn't get
out<00:04:10.440> of<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.560> way<00:04:10.680> like<00:04:10.859> that<00:04:11.959> double<00:04:12.959> double

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
out of the way like that double double

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.870 
out of the way like that double double
thank<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.579> please<00:04:15.530> and<00:04:16.530> its<00:04:17.159> power<00:04:17.430> through

here tap the clutch get back into slide

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.779 
here tap the clutch get back into slide
there<00:04:21.870> we<00:04:22.019> go<00:04:22.229> and<00:04:22.590> hopefully<00:04:22.890> actually<00:04:23.370> my

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
there we go and hopefully actually my

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.540 
there we go and hopefully actually my
way<00:04:23.909> over<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.210> double<00:04:24.810> almost<00:04:25.770> it's<00:04:26.250> a<00:04:26.310> very

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
way over the double almost it's a very

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.070 
way over the double almost it's a very
tricky<00:04:27.030> little<00:04:27.270> thing<00:04:27.360> I<00:04:27.539> did<00:04:27.690> actually<00:04:27.780> make

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
tricky little thing I did actually make

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.430 
tricky little thing I did actually make
that<00:04:28.610> slide<00:04:29.610> just<00:04:30.120> right<00:04:30.450> into<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.200> loop

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
that slide just right into the loop

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.140 
that slide just right into the loop
sounds<00:04:31.979> pretty<00:04:32.280> good<00:04:32.400> turn<00:04:32.640> right<00:04:32.820> there<00:04:33.120> I

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
sounds pretty good turn right there I

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.860 
sounds pretty good turn right there I
think<00:04:33.539> for<00:04:33.870> me<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.409> quad<00:04:34.620> at<00:04:34.770> least<00:04:35.870> double

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
think for me and a quad at least double

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.600 
think for me and a quad at least double

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
end out again just kind of easily just

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:45.440 
end out again just kind of easily just
kicks<00:04:44.280> out<00:04:44.430> there<00:04:44.550> any<00:04:44.640> tap<00:04:44.880> as<00:04:45.030> much<00:04:45.240> like

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
kicks out there any tap as much like

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.170 
kicks out there any tap as much like
that

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
that

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.290 
that
and<00:04:47.539> I'll<00:04:48.440> probably<00:04:48.860> close<00:04:49.190> out<00:04:49.400> like<00:04:49.970> two

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
and I'll probably close out like two

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.300 
and I'll probably close out like two
more<00:04:50.479> laps<00:04:50.660> here<00:04:50.930> but<00:04:51.139> I<00:04:51.650> don't<00:04:52.039> know<00:04:52.190> I'm

hopefully<00:04:57.139> we<00:04:57.229> see<00:04:57.259> more<00:04:57.500> quadroons<00:04:57.919> out<00:04:58.039> of

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
hopefully we see more quadroons out of
