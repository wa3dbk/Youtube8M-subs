the finest components on the market this
is<00:00:30.429> a<00:00:30.460> chassis<00:00:30.999> that<00:00:31.029> we<00:00:31.300> designed<00:00:31.659> and<00:00:32.910> it

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
is a chassis that we designed and it

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.970 
is a chassis that we designed and it
actually<00:00:34.420> has<00:00:34.719> some<00:00:34.989> unique<00:00:35.379> features<00:00:35.530> about

it so this thing all the way around this
is<00:00:38.199> very<00:00:38.530> clean<00:00:38.800> looking<00:00:38.949> because<00:00:39.219> I<00:00:39.370> mean<00:00:39.550> all

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
is very clean looking because I mean all

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.889 
is very clean looking because I mean all
your<00:00:39.789> cabling<00:00:40.120> everything<00:00:40.480> is<00:00:40.600> sheltered

backside mystical peak back here and
it's<00:00:43.960> perfectly<00:00:44.289> flat<00:00:44.530> you<00:00:44.859> know<00:00:44.980> so<00:00:45.280> this

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
it's perfectly flat you know so this

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.270 
it's perfectly flat you know so this
thing<00:00:46.030> looks<00:00:46.510> like<00:00:46.750> just<00:00:47.260> a<00:00:47.469> box<00:00:47.829> came<00:00:48.129> in<00:00:48.219> a

Sun not the decibel writing but the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.620 
Sun not the decibel writing but the
basically<00:03:22.550> that<00:03:22.910> pitch<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.270> annoyance

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
basically that pitch the annoyance

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.330 
basically that pitch the annoyance
factor<00:03:23.810> so<00:03:24.560> as<00:03:24.770> I<00:03:24.800> put<00:03:25.100> this<00:03:25.250> on<00:03:25.430> here<00:03:27.340> it's

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.160
