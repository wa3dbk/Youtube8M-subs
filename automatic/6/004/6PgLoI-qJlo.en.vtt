00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 I started rugby at the age of 5 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.910
 because I had my father and my 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.559
 uncle who plays rugby so I'm 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.889
 automatically fall in love with this 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.680
 sport by its values 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.050
 this notion of family of friends is that 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.810
 who made me come 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.359
 still a little more towards rugby so 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.170
 here I am always bathed in this sport 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.170
 there and not another 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.600
 it is this final lost with blagnac 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.370
 know we've lost the ufolep and against 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.930
 tarbes and I think that's what has 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.690
 who has made me react and who has 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.220
 made you want to leave from blagnac and 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.960
 come to the Toulouse stadium so I think 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.879
 that it was a memory is difficult 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.520
 because we lost but that's what 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.590
 made me leave and that made me come 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.280
 here and that's the whole route I've 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.320
 could perform 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.309
 I think it's on this decision 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.309
 that I left 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.090
 when I signed 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.070
 pro at 18 years old I have the chance to be able to 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.290
 buy an apartment I started to 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.090
 interest me taxes the decor and it's 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.470
 true that I was going out the ball problem 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.770
 trotec and I wanted to go on other 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.830
 thing 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.229
 so I took drawing classes but 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.550
 good after that I had to stop 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.590
 because I wanted to give myself thoroughly 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.250
 to try to participate in the cup of 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.410
 world 2011 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.470
 so it's true that I put a lot of 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.390
 to trap them the drawing of side I 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.330
 continue a little at home to see me I 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.200
 not do not want to define myself as 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:41.320
 a painter or a sculptor or an artist 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.850
 I'm far from it just like 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.850
 lets play rugby 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.189
 disposable 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.630
 French and it's not a 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.759
 candle a big kick that's 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.829
 just a little kick just 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.450
 behind defense to try to 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.310
 recover but that's my cute sin and 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.810
 I was forbidden to do it because 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.119
 it's a kick that pretty 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.539
 dangerous because we can lose fast 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.870
 it's one chance out of two so for 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.370
 for me the team is not necessarily 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.790
 my thing to do a little game a lot 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.790
 good 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.990
 we think or for them for records where 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.690
 whatever it is I remain for others my 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.280
 pleasure is to play to be hot 1 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.320
 after yes I scored maybe the most 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.110
 let the fastest of top 14 against 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.640
 la rochelle but for me it's not 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.640
 it's not what's more important 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.010
 m 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.900
 hunk of the team no I think 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.400
 that there are other teams that are more 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:54.390
 those who are lower than me so 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.910
 90 I'm lucky to be able to do two 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.890
 time the calendar was for blast 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.240
 and for an association must that it was 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:06.000
 nice to do it but hey it's not 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.890
 for me it's for others I'm going 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.960
 not to advance me from nan but it's not 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.460
 finally it's not me it's not bad handsome 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.460
 cloakroom kid 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.680
 more than seven months now that I am 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.100
 injured 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.530
 finally it's 7 dead the operation ben that 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.830
 go it's for soon but ya not 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.960
 necessarily precise date for that I think 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.420
 that they want to wait another little 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.070
 little for my resumption of opposition the 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.710
 Wednesday we do against the hopes 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.910
 in general that's what there is a little 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.540
 dictated at the resumption of the competition 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:47.590
 so for the moment it's enough I 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.030
 train with zeba traorÃ© and then I 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.650
 do I try to train a little and 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.690
 the team when it is reasoning that 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.080
 not too close to contact so here but 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.080
 coming soon
