00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.210
 technology enthusiast company 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.820
 facebook is not a company of 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.979
 technological gaming facebook has a 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.890
 story of just worrying about the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.990
 build to increase its users and 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.210
 nothing else in the construction of the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.500
 numbers of users the people who have 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.170
 made games for platforms 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.210
 facebook have worked before are the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.610
 games for a while 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.560

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.060
 sorry when facebook then changed 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.850

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.979
 of the platform that they were trying to 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.740
 build do not get me wrong the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.690
 Virtual reality is not bad for the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.610
 social development in fact I think that 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.720
 socially, virtual reality can 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.610
 become one of the biggest 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.760
 applications that may exist 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.060
 sit capable of a virtual room by 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.800
 example in a movie theater and be in 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.990
