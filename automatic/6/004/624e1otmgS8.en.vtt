00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
gonna test properly you have to have

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.749 
gonna test properly you have to have
them<00:01:50.549> grounded<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:52.070> actually<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.310> passenger

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
side tail light is the master ground if

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.889 
side tail light is the master ground if
you<00:01:56.009> don't<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.280> line<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.600> headlights

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
there you for going to test them now

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.709 
there you for going to test them now
coming<00:02:05.040> back<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.759> dark<00:02:06.000> into<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.540> garage

here<00:02:07.580> these<00:02:08.580> only<00:02:08.910> slip-ons<00:02:09.360> one<00:02:09.660> way<00:02:09.899> these

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
here these only slip-ons one way these

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.619 
here these only slip-ons one way these
lights<00:02:10.770> drop<00:02:11.129> in<00:02:11.340> like<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:12.120> cannot<00:02:12.390> put

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
lights drop in like this you cannot put

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.640 
lights drop in like this you cannot put
them<00:02:12.780> up<00:02:12.840> through<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.050> bottom<00:02:13.170> as<00:02:13.379> you<00:02:13.470> see

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
them up through the bottom as you see

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.680 
them up through the bottom as you see
that<00:02:13.830> these<00:02:14.160> rails<00:02:14.459> right<00:02:14.610> here<00:02:14.910> are<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.480> lot

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
that these rails right here are a lot

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.650 
that these rails right here are a lot
closer<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.560> light<00:02:16.790> all<00:02:17.790> right<00:02:17.910> lot<00:02:18.360> closer

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
closer to the light all right lot closer

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.780 
closer to the light all right lot closer
to<00:02:18.930> yeah<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.200> lot<00:02:19.410> closer<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.860> light<00:02:20.040> then

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
to yeah a lot closer to the light then

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.699 
to yeah a lot closer to the light then
on<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.360> top<00:02:21.599> is<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.140> feeds<00:02:22.379> through<00:02:22.590> the

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
on the top is so it feeds through the

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.170 
on the top is so it feeds through the
top<00:02:22.920> then<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.430> got<00:02:23.550> future<00:02:23.730> wire<00:02:23.940> through<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
top then you got future wire through the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.430 
top then you got future wire through the
hole<00:02:24.239> it's<00:02:24.599> right<00:02:24.930> about<00:02:25.260> here<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:28.200> can't

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
hole it's right about here and you can't

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.619 
hole it's right about here and you can't
see<00:02:28.560> it's<00:02:28.950> somewhere<00:02:29.730> right<00:02:29.910> around<00:02:30.030> here<00:02:30.180> it

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
see it's somewhere right around here it

now<00:02:49.860> for<00:02:50.040> me<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.550> driver<00:02:51.180> side<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.540> Jeep<00:02:51.720> that

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
now for me the driver side to Jeep that

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.869 
now for me the driver side to Jeep that
the<00:02:52.590> wire<00:02:52.800> for<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.129> I<00:02:53.160> was<00:02:53.310> able<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.489> pull<00:02:53.670> all

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
the wire for that I was able to pull all

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:54.890 
the wire for that I was able to pull all
the<00:02:53.970> way<00:02:54.000> where<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.330> clip<00:02:54.569> was<00:02:54.599> on<00:02:54.840> the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
the way where the clip was on the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.390 
the way where the clip was on the
outside<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.410> G<00:02:55.530> throws<00:02:55.739> a<00:02:55.830> lot<00:02:56.010> easier<00:02:56.220> to

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
outside the G throws a lot easier to

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.580 
outside the G throws a lot easier to
maneuver<00:02:57.300> while<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:57.720> passenger<00:02:58.110> side<00:02:58.319> one

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
maneuver while the passenger side one

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.520 
maneuver while the passenger side one

says so you might have to dig into your
extra<00:04:29.890> bolts<00:04:30.190> then<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:30.550> stuff<00:04:30.730> and<00:04:30.880> find<00:04:31.060> one

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
to bust out the tap and die set and make

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.400 
to bust out the tap and die set and make
it<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.670> right<00:04:36.820> size<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.450> have<00:04:38.020> to<00:04:38.080> do<00:04:38.170> that<00:04:38.260> for

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
it the right size I have to do that for

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.200 
it the right size I have to do that for
a<00:04:38.470> couple<00:04:38.500> of<00:04:38.710> mine<00:04:38.920> because<00:04:39.580> you<00:04:39.940> tighten

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
a couple of mine because you tighten

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.880 
a couple of mine because you tighten
those<00:04:40.300> things<00:04:40.660> too<00:04:40.900> tight<00:04:41.110> you<00:04:41.530> hear<00:04:41.680> click

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
those things too tight you hear click

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.770 
those things too tight you hear click
and<00:04:42.420> you<00:04:43.420> messed<00:04:44.020> up<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.170> threads<00:04:44.850> so<00:04:45.850> be<00:04:46.570> wary

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
and you messed up the threads so be wary

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.140 
and you messed up the threads so be wary
of<00:04:46.960> that<00:04:47.520> probably<00:04:48.520> should<00:04:48.670> just<00:04:48.700> read<00:04:48.970> tap

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
of that probably should just read tap

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.540 
of that probably should just read tap
them<00:04:49.300> all<00:04:49.390> and<00:04:49.480> put<00:04:49.570> better<00:04:49.920> bolts<00:04:50.920> and<00:04:51.100> screws

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
them all and put better bolts and screws

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.900 
them all and put better bolts and screws
in<00:04:51.790> there<00:04:51.880> anyway<00:04:52.210> but<00:04:53.220> whatever<00:04:54.220> so<00:04:54.640> I<00:04:54.670> think

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
in there anyway but whatever so I think

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.310 
in there anyway but whatever so I think
you<00:04:55.120> got<00:04:55.240> a<00:04:55.300> pretty<00:04:55.630> good<00:04:55.780> understanding<00:04:55.840> how

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
you got a pretty good understanding how

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.710 
you got a pretty good understanding how
to<00:04:56.350> put<00:04:56.590> them<00:04:56.650> in<00:04:56.770> there<00:04:56.920> if<00:04:57.460> you<00:04:58.420> guys<00:04:58.600> have

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
to put them in there if you guys have
