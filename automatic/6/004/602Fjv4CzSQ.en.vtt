00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.040
 ah 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.000
 bulletproof without remorse and 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.670
 almost always armed to the teeth 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.520
 they are there to kick ass and to 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.240
 drop lapidary phrases when you get 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.310
 to hell tell them that command are the 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.020
 most difficult characters to kill the 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.210
 history of video games because 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:42.790
 behind all great saga of action there 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:44.920
 a hard guy what it takes to be 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.109
 one of them especially feel little 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.149
 appreciation for human life are people who 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.039
 kill without blinking that you never 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.570
 Repent of what he does are also 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.280
 characters that are willing to 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.710
 fit a beating from time to 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.920
 when and if they are a little gulfs better than 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.920
 best 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.449
 we do not care if they wear armor or if 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.670
 they fight bare-chested like the 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.350
 legendary rambo we do not care if they go in 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.480
 motorcycle as the protagonist of food for 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.000
 hotel or if they are part of the peloton more 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.340
 destroyer of the warhammer universe 40,000 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.560
 to choose our favorites to the 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.480
 toughest of the place we have stuck to 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.220
 those who have shown the most value to the 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.320
 who get their goals cost what 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.680
 cost and the least afraid of 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.960
 die 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.910
 because you know sometimes you need to have 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.780
 a couple to stand up to villains 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.780
 that sound like this 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.460
 well you know everything you have to 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.410
 know about who is a tough guy and 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.690
 who is not in video games like that 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.200
 What do we leave out of preambles and 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.200
 we started 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.680
 and where to start what's up for some 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.550
 sunglasses a pair of muscular arms 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:07.020
 a tacky hairstyle and an exact cigar 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.090
 diurnal that we could not give the banderazo 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.100
 of exit to a special on types 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.050
 hard and its presence because it is one of 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.510
 the most veteran and loved the 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.190
 brothers are for manny while 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.050
 agreement that his latest release does not 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.060
 was the best of the series precisely 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.220
 nevertheless this pimp has given us 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.050
 so many memorable moments in your fight 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.280
 against the extraterrestrials that there are 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.280
 remember him always 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.330
 but he's not the smartest guy in the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.040
 world for example we have 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.870
 our preferences in regards to that 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.670
 clear and among our favorites it 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.380
 count those who are tough guys and 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.120
 prepared for combat but that 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.170
 they also have charisma or worry 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.170
 for their loved ones 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.670
 we talked about clear joel that was part 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.500
 of a wonderful tandem with the little 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.239
 he and they have opted that they have always 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.069
 imported a lot the characters and their 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.500
 developments but we have rarely seen 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.030
 something as careful as his perfect 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.830
 balance between animal nature 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.959
 what it takes to survive in your 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.060
 cruel world and his protective instinct and 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.709
 paternal with the young make it 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.720
 one of the most complex heroes and 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.720
 three-dimensional of all time 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.829
 very different are the men who 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.640
 make up the platoon of the tate girls of 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.840
 war 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.430
 maybe they have spent with the 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.349
 anabolic but you will have to 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.480
 recognize that you can think of few people 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.219
 better than marcus phoenix and company for 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.560
 plant face these aliens that 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:29.209
 emerged from the subsoil, it may not 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.889
 be the most talkative men but 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.840
 they always knew what to say to debate 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.260
 on dietary habits of the 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.260
 locust 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.280
 without moving away from space we have to 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.900
 remember the commander shepard he has 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.510
 been such a tough guy who has kept 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.250
 Almost dangerous alien races 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.129
 so we forgive him for not being the 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.689
 best dancer in the galaxy in function 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.030
 of our choices could be a 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:58.340
 authentic good-looking or the most tanned guy 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.620
 and without scruples of the universe a whole 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.239
 decision but is that to us always 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.239
 the dark side has thrown us a lot 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.050
 more earthly was max alcoholic payne 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.900
 addicted to antidepressants and trigger 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.790
 easy the ideal son-in-law he is the tragedy 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.590
 personified but with a weapon in 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.420
 hands and a reason to kill there's no 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.580
 who coughs the saga started it 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.470
 Remedy and have followed her rockstar but 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.330
 sure if we start with the hard guys 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.190
 created by the houser brothers and the 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.190
 rest of the big r we do not finish 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.440
 in fact the creators of gta have 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.510
 specialized in embroidering people who already 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.340
 is on either side of the law 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.710
 they are characterized by not being squeamish 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.450
 if we had to stay with only one 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.700
 of his creations we would have it clear 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.010
 we admit that john marston brings us back 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.110
 crazy its history in the far west of 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.880
 red dead redemption is counted among the 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.100
 favorite video games of the generation 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.930
 for a lot of people and the reasons have 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.490
 to see not only with how much fun it was 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.930
 the title but also with the 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.150
 overwhelming personality of his 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.600
 protagonist an avenger of the old 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.600
 time 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.800
 clear that if we talk about protagonists 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.080
 of revenge we can not let ourselves be 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.390
 data a spartan able to snack on 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.190
 the 300 of the movie and that make you thirsty 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.960
 of blood to order after the dessert 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.120
 along the way he has killed men 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.950
 creatures and monsters in a story of 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.260
 never ending seeding the Olympus of 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.790
 cadavers an uncle in short that no 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.790
 lower your guard or with the girls 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.940
 but women have a role every 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.280
 more important time in video games and 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.680
 luckily they are no longer mere objects that 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.479
 tell it to face the acrobatic heroine 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.520
 is an example of resistance in a 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.919
 oppressive and futuristic society against 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.500
 that struggles but the hardest girl is without 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.900
 doubt lara croft in fact takes almost 20 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.789
 years fighting against everything and against everyone 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.680
 already from the beginning they began to 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.330
 profile your personality as a 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.400
 combative and hardened heroine with 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.289
 experience in a thousand battles but in the 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.539
 recent times we have explored his 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:59.219
 youth taking it to the limit in some 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:02.620
 of his most dangerous adventures 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:04.599
 yes we know we have left many 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.129
 tough guys but sure you're 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:08.710
 aware that in a special video 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:10.539
 do not fit all these are just some of 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.729
 our favorites but surely the 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:14.199
 Yours are many others do not hesitate 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.690
 share them with the rest of the 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:18.789
 3dgame community because in the end and 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.889
 out of boasting and bad 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:23.060
 arts of these tough guys we enjoy 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:26.729
 all or not 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:29.150
 and has a will 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:32.150
 I do not 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.150
 do not
