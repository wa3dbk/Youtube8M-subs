00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.340
 and this one if you want to know how I did it 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.759
 then stay and then I'll leave 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.759
 to say 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.820
 to the number of lots that you 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.360
 want us here we are going to do 15 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.830
 lots and they will leave us from 8 to 10 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:36.080
 scooters we are going to occupy cream 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.890
 this is grated cheese 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:43.879
 this is margarine or butter and lemon 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.680
 guacamaya chile powder sauce this 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.059
 it can be pajín we buy this 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.600
 because it 's on offer they were two 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:54.260
 one and this mayonnaise we're also going to 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.960
 occupy lemons to taste and we will occupy 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.239
 these little glasses we are going to do it be these 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.980
 Unicel cups because they are thermal and 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.350
 It does not heat up so much to give to the 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.140
 children, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.040
 remove the granites from the corn to this 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.040
 flame chasms 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.580
 I already said without more 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.040
 let's start more or less than half 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.090
 from the corn to the bottom so that we 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.429
 make it easier 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.649
 trying to take out the whole granites 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.289
 since we get the granites from this side 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:32.179
 we turn around and let's get them out of the 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.179
 another side like this is easier 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.600
 since we finished taking all the 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.630
 granites from the cenotes we put them in 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.310
 We are going to cook a pot 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.310
 I'm going to put 3 liters of water 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.009
 let's put them to cook in the burner 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.619
 when it starts to boil they rise up 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.719
 over as answered with a little 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.719
 of trash what are elote crimes 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.219
 Y 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.060
 of the granites and also some 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.060
 kernels of corn kernels 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.420
 we are going to perfectly take out all that 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.420
 foam that rises up 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.670
 we are going to use a colander to make us 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.299
 make it easier and we see that you're welcome 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.299
 blunt 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.300
 since we remove the foam we are going to 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.970
 put a spoonful of salt 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.820
 and we are going to put 6 tablespoons of 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.580
 butter or margarine if you put 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.580
 a bar would be a bar of 90 grams 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.549
 let's regulate a little to help 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.970
 melt the butter though not 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.629
 stir a lot melts alone we go to 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.159
 cover the case and we're going to let it boil 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.049
 about an hour and a half since 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.190
 they grabbed the granites of others 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.020
 we get out of the fire 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.170
 now we are going to prepare the esquites 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.080
 let's put the granites until the 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.390
 half of the glass 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.390
 let's put a spoonful of cream 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.750
 a spoonful of cheese 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.810
 and mayonnaise we will put it to your liking if 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.000
 really like mayonnaise you put a 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.129
 spoonful and if you do not like it so much 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.349
 they put half a teaspoon this is to taste 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.060
 of each one 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.690
 let's put a few teaspoons of 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.690
 cali nito 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.819
 and we're going to finish filling the glass with 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.819
 a piece of lópez 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.640
 now let's put it back a little 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:01.060
 more than cream 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.950
 we put a little more cheese and 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.260
 mayonnaise we will not put it because 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.840
 I put him on and I do not like him very much 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.340
 much older but as I told you and it's 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.800
 your decision if they have to put you 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.709
 I'm going to put more powder on this 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.709
 after pajín to a little boy in dust 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.410
 I'm going to put a few drops of sauce 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.440
 macaw if you do not have these alesanco you 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.910
 they put the sauce that you have 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.100
 let's put a lot of chimbo field today 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.760
 and at the end we're going to put the lemon 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.760
 taste 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.000
 but I think it's fine 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.039
 forward when we met him and now 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.039
