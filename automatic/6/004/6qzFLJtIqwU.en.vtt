00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello people and welcome to 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.370
 explosion a judo whatever I am 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.260
 I've got you a whole new bed like you see 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.090
 can 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:18.750
 and this time it is that that 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.980
 that deck de weck and that's what i find 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.590
 that's actually pretty cool 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.289
 The monsters here are all bandaged 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.439
 So the principle of the day is when 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.519
 it will work 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:34.189
 if I give you a good idea 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.189
 procuring can procure 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.140
 the names are controlled where the card as 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.140
 Patchen of a Summon 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.940
 no not at first 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:53.989
 now another is extremely under 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:58.160
 Summon with a 63 deck though that 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:01.039
 tens of thousands of collector rows are like that 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.440
 the card namely the cover 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:09.220
 yes I'll do it and now have both 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.220
 cards once linked like that 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.500
 I hope I win this time people 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:20.060
 I have lost several consequences 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.300
 but in the heart cards 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:28.260
 give me everything possible be so tacke 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:36.450
 my band shining i will be there 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:39.710
 not out of your ass but I have 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.710
 I just imagined that 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:48.050
 Imagine someone who's his ass 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.390
 shows and so it looks and bends 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.390
 behind it stands this monster and 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.390
 assistant 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:02.630
 Do not think that's what I do 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.929
 What makes the ten marks like 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:18.500
 looks good then I still have opportunities 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:20.780
 with you so if I should you now me 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.629
 that does not make any braker age what 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.840
 I think then after saying once 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:31.040
 We also set braker and mirror power 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.610
 times and after the attack people completely 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.250
 important to attack first and the nice 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.709
 deduct opposing life points 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.709
 once twice 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:51.090
 place and a professional yukio 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.210
 later that would make people like that 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.660
 activate breakers effects and its 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:00.240
 destroy his card 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.710
 and now we can go on like this 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.710
 when you're ready italy 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.600
 but I believe that ultimately 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:15.100
 Caritas in Karachi or something 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.380
 once per turn during the game 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:26.310
 his fellow player and i say oh land 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:26.310
 old man hanging moment 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.580
 You can have two hoses text amore 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.230
 monsters from a cemetery banish 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.540
 an open monster on the field too 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.190
 choose returns the granted tian 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.330
 that one open six warm and with 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.630
 a different name 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.260
 control them around 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.700
 quit 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:55.920

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:57.900

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.550
