today<00:00:04.250> we<00:00:04.520> are<00:00:04.580> going<00:00:04.819> to<00:00:04.939> demonstrate<00:00:05.630> how<00:00:05.840> to

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:05.870 
today we are going to demonstrate how to

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.100 
today we are going to demonstrate how to
start<00:00:06.410> your<00:00:06.560> portable<00:00:07.040> generator

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.690 

first<00:00:11.110> and<00:00:11.469> most<00:00:11.650> important<00:00:12.309> move<00:00:12.549> your

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:12.700 
first and most important move your

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.609 
first and most important move your
generator<00:00:13.179> outside<00:00:13.750> to<00:00:13.990> provide<00:00:14.289> proper

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:14.619 
generator outside to provide proper

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:16.679 
generator outside to provide proper
ventilation<00:00:15.160> of<00:00:15.639> the<00:00:15.760> carbon<00:00:16.150> monoxide

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:16.689 
ventilation of the carbon monoxide

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.319 
ventilation of the carbon monoxide
exhaust<00:00:17.110> from<00:00:17.439> the<00:00:17.500> engine<00:00:17.590> this<00:00:18.580> exhaust<00:00:19.029> can

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:19.329 
exhaust from the engine this exhaust can

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.359 
exhaust from the engine this exhaust can
be<00:00:19.419> extremely<00:00:19.869> dangerous<00:00:20.169> your<00:00:20.860> generator

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
be extremely dangerous your generator

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.460 
be extremely dangerous your generator
should<00:00:21.669> also<00:00:21.820> be<00:00:22.090> placed<00:00:22.360> away<00:00:22.660> from<00:00:22.810> windows

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
should also be placed away from windows

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.780 
should also be placed away from windows
and<00:00:23.500> doors

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.790 

next<00:00:28.790> check<00:00:29.180> the<00:00:29.240> fuel<00:00:29.630> level<00:00:29.900> if<00:00:30.350> you<00:00:30.560> think

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
next check the fuel level if you think

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.589 
next check the fuel level if you think
that<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.130> gasoline<00:00:31.670> in<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:31.940> generator<00:00:32.390> is

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
that the gasoline in the generator is

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.480 
that the gasoline in the generator is
more<00:00:32.840> than<00:00:32.960> six<00:00:33.320> months<00:00:33.500> old<00:00:33.800> that<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.250> fuel

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:34.490 
more than six months old that the fuel

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.090 
more than six months old that the fuel
needs<00:00:34.760> to<00:00:34.940> be<00:00:35.030> removed<00:00:35.360> from<00:00:35.810> the<00:00:35.960> tank<00:00:36.260> you

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
needs to be removed from the tank you

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.860 
needs to be removed from the tank you
can<00:00:37.340> do<00:00:37.460> this<00:00:37.610> by<00:00:37.790> draining<00:00:38.240> the<00:00:38.360> fuel<00:00:38.630> out

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
can do this by draining the fuel out

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.570 
can do this by draining the fuel out
with<00:00:39.200> the<00:00:39.290> draining<00:00:39.650> plug<00:00:39.860> on<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:40.160> bottom<00:00:40.490> of

weather conditions the choke may have to

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.750 
weather conditions the choke may have to
be<00:02:39.100> adjusted<00:02:39.190> until<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:40.360> engine<00:02:40.750> warms<00:02:41.110> up

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
be adjusted until the engine warms up

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.040 
be adjusted until the engine warms up
now<00:02:42.760> it's<00:02:43.000> time<00:02:43.270> to<00:02:43.300> plug<00:02:43.720> in<00:02:43.870> your<00:02:43.900> power

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
now it's time to plug in your power

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.350 
now it's time to plug in your power
cords<00:02:44.740> and<00:02:44.950> connect<00:02:45.370> those<00:02:45.459> appliances<00:02:46.120> you

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
cords and connect those appliances you

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.110 
cords and connect those appliances you
wish<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.750> run

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.760 

this<00:02:54.120> Honeywell<00:02:54.510> generator<00:02:55.110> is<00:02:55.320> really<00:02:55.590> nice

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
this Honeywell generator is really nice

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.100 
this Honeywell generator is really nice
because<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.190> provides<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:57.000> Smart<00:02:57.420> Start<00:02:57.630> card

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
because it provides the Smart Start card

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.870 
because it provides the Smart Start card
which<00:02:58.320> walks<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.830> through<00:02:58.860> each<00:02:59.220> step<00:02:59.670> of

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
which walks you through each step of

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.640 
which walks you through each step of
starting<00:03:00.030> your<00:03:00.330> generator

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.470 

what's<00:03:05.650> also<00:03:05.830> really<00:03:06.159> cool<00:03:06.459> this<00:03:07.000> generator
