00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
it let the owner have a look at it and

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.929 
it let the owner have a look at it and
see<00:01:19.860> what<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.070> looks<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.460> he's<00:01:20.759> actually

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
see what it looks like he's actually

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.929 
see what it looks like he's actually
really<00:01:21.299> quite<00:01:21.540> happy<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.820> he's<00:01:23.820> how

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
really quite happy with it so he's how

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.730 
really quite happy with it so he's how
to<00:01:24.000> look<00:01:24.180> at<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.420> he<00:01:24.689> said<00:01:24.930> his<00:01:25.049> hands<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.530> it

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
to look at it he said his hands on it

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.190 
to look at it he said his hands on it
and<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:26.100> both<00:01:26.280> agreed<00:01:28.189> that<00:01:29.960> it<00:01:30.960> would

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
and we both agreed that it would

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.249 
and we both agreed that it would
probably<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.770> wise<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.610> put<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.329> super<00:01:33.750> high

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
probably be wise not to put a super high

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.420 
probably be wise not to put a super high
gloss<00:01:35.509> sheen<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.020> body<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.280> reason

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
gloss sheen on this body and the reason

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.100 
gloss sheen on this body and the reason
for<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:40.820> obviously<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.060> neck<00:01:42.329> if

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
for that is that obviously the neck if

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.240 
for that is that obviously the neck if
we<00:01:43.820> we<00:01:44.820> look<00:01:44.970> at<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.149> headstock<00:01:45.720> we<00:01:46.140> know<00:01:46.320> from

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
here and there and everywhere so we

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.780 
here and there and everywhere so we
decided<00:02:02.570> between<00:02:03.570> he<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.520> or<00:02:05.520> rather<00:02:05.640> I

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
decided between he and I or rather I

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.900 
decided between he and I or rather I
decided<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.540> plug<00:02:06.780> him<00:02:06.960> into<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:08.640> we

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
decided and plug him into it that we

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.900 
decided and plug him into it that we
would<00:02:09.179> oh<00:02:09.569> there's<00:02:09.929> one<00:02:10.110> right<00:02:10.349> there

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
would oh there's one right there

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.860 
would oh there's one right there
just<00:02:11.910> something<00:02:12.300> we

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
just something we

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.100 
just something we
weird<00:02:13.290> happen<00:02:13.650> in<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:13.890> clear<00:02:14.780> it's<00:02:15.780> hard<00:02:15.989> to

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
weird happen in the clear it's hard to

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.520 
weird happen in the clear it's hard to
see<00:02:16.319> but<00:02:16.590> it's<00:02:16.769> like<00:02:20.150> anyway<00:02:21.150> it's<00:02:21.780> super<00:02:22.230> flat

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
see but it's like anyway it's super flat

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.100 
see but it's like anyway it's super flat
and<00:02:22.739> smooth<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.730> we<00:02:23.849> decided<00:02:24.299> auto<00:02:24.659> rather

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
and smooth so we decided auto rather

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.500 
and smooth so we decided auto rather
like<00:02:25.379> I<00:02:25.409> said<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:25.920> decided<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:26.970> go<00:02:27.090> with<00:02:27.239> a<00:02:27.269> more

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
like I said I decided to go with a more

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.220 
like I said I decided to go with a more

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
but anyway it's the same material just

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.930 
but anyway it's the same material just
coming<00:04:07.470> out<00:04:07.530> of<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.709> different<00:04:08.010> source<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.849> I

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
coming out of a different source and I

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.949 
coming out of a different source and I
do<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:09.419> do<00:04:09.590> recognize<00:04:10.590> that<00:04:11.660> spraying<00:04:12.660> lacquer

is<00:04:13.819> quite<00:04:14.819> different<00:04:15.030> from<00:04:15.680> coming<00:04:16.680> out<00:04:16.769> of<00:04:16.889> a

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
is quite different from coming out of a

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.140
