spread of wool and why give us on the

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.429 
spread of wool and why give us on the
inside<00:03:10.579> I<00:03:10.760> used<00:03:11.060> Oakwood<00:03:11.840> stairs<00:03:12.140> just

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 
inside I used Oakwood stairs just

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:14.849 
inside I used Oakwood stairs just
sounded<00:03:12.769> different<00:03:13.040> types<00:03:13.219> of<00:03:13.310> stairs<00:03:13.549> on<00:03:13.790> the

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
sounded different types of stairs on the

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.819 
sounded different types of stairs on the
middle<00:03:15.859> section<00:03:16.069> like<00:03:17.030> where<00:03:17.629> and<00:03:17.870> that<00:03:18.680> is

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
middle section like where and that is

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.559 
middle section like where and that is
pretty<00:03:19.099> much<00:03:19.189> it<00:03:19.430> from<00:03:19.489> a<00:03:19.609> tutorial<00:03:19.969> you<00:03:20.359> could

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
pretty much it from a tutorial you could

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:21.759 
pretty much it from a tutorial you could
if<00:03:20.689> you<00:03:20.750> wanted<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.049> on<00:03:21.079> each<00:03:21.260> of<00:03:21.379> these<00:03:21.500> side

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
if you wanted to on each of these side

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.670 
if you wanted to on each of these side
parts<00:03:22.129> but<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:23.420> stair<00:03:23.689> on<00:03:23.870> these<00:03:24.049> here<00:03:24.379> so<00:03:24.560> you

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
parts but the stair on these here so you

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.640 
parts but the stair on these here so you
actually<00:03:25.010> walk<00:03:25.159> around<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:26.840> get<00:03:27.019> up<00:03:27.200> here<00:03:27.469> so

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
actually walk around to get up here so

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.050 
actually walk around to get up here so
now<00:03:28.189> that<00:03:28.250> we're<00:03:28.430> done<00:03:28.459> with<00:03:28.639> the<00:03:28.700> build<00:03:28.939> if

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
now that we're done with the build if

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.399 
now that we're done with the build if
you<00:03:29.150> do<00:03:29.420> want<00:03:29.569> to<00:03:29.599> do<00:03:29.689> counterparts<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.290> way

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
you do want to do counterparts the way

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.470 
you do want to do counterparts the way
the<00:03:30.530> idea<00:03:30.889> like<00:03:31.159> on<00:03:31.370> this<00:03:31.730> one<00:03:31.790> here<00:03:32.269> which<00:03:32.450> is

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
the idea like on this one here which is

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.020 
the idea like on this one here which is
just<00:03:32.629> a<00:03:32.900> slight<00:03:33.170> amount<00:03:33.290> CalFire<00:03:33.889> it's<00:03:34.700> just

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
just a slight amount CalFire it's just

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.940 
just a slight amount CalFire it's just
to<00:03:35.150> knock<00:03:35.299> out<00:03:35.510> some<00:03:35.930> random<00:03:36.079> blocks<00:03:36.590> I

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
to knock out some random blocks I

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.210 
to knock out some random blocks I
replace<00:03:37.909> the<00:03:38.060> Librium<00:03:38.389> wool<00:03:39.069> and<00:03:40.069> that's

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
replace the Librium wool and that's

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.089 
replace the Librium wool and that's
pretty<00:03:40.459> much<00:03:40.609> more<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.180> can<00:03:41.530> do<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:42.709> recreate

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
pretty much more you can do to recreate

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.949 
pretty much more you can do to recreate
the<00:03:43.340> effect

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
the effect

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.979 
the effect
it's<00:03:44.959> just<00:03:45.169> switch<00:03:45.349> now<00:03:45.560> a<00:03:45.590> couple<00:03:45.889> of<00:03:46.069> blocks

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
it's just switch now a couple of blocks

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.030 
it's just switch now a couple of blocks
but<00:03:47.989> because<00:03:48.260> you've<00:03:48.379> got<00:03:48.500> so<00:03:48.680> much<00:03:48.769> of<00:03:48.829> the

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
but because you've got so much of the

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.429 
but because you've got so much of the
spruce<00:03:49.939> wood<00:03:50.120> because<00:03:50.329> quite<00:03:50.900> small<00:03:51.169> craft

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:51.439 
spruce wood because quite small craft

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.729 
spruce wood because quite small craft
it's<00:03:51.590> quite<00:03:51.739> difficult<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.219> make<00:03:52.310> it<00:03:52.489> look

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
it's quite difficult to make it look

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.890 
it's quite difficult to make it look
correct<00:03:55.030> there<00:03:56.030> you<00:03:56.090> go<00:03:56.209> guys<00:03:56.389> hopefully<00:03:56.750> you
