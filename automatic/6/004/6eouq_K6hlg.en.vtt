00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
I've talked about this before a lot of

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.840 
I've talked about this before a lot of

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
times when there's a weapon in the game

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.640 
times when there's a weapon in the game
that<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.090> don't<00:00:24.180> absolutely<00:00:24.480> love<00:00:24.840> but<00:00:25.350> isn't

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
necessarily bad such as the Galil I'll

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.169 
necessarily bad such as the Galil I'll
start<00:00:28.590> using<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:29.099> I'll<00:00:29.250> find<00:00:29.429> success<00:00:29.820> with<00:00:29.880> it

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
start using it I'll find success with it

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.720 
start using it I'll find success with it
and<00:00:30.359> then<00:00:30.480> I'll<00:00:30.599> use<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.590> know<00:00:31.700> 10<00:00:32.700> or

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
and then I'll use it like you know 10 or

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.569 
and then I'll use it like you know 10 or
15<00:00:33.469> gameplays<00:00:34.469> because<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.550> know

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
15 gameplays because I just you know

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.280 
15 gameplays because I just you know
attached<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.510> really<00:00:36.750> liked<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.140> and

attached to it and really liked it and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.200 
attached to it and really liked it and
that<00:00:37.649> goes<00:00:37.890> probably<00:00:38.340> for<00:00:38.700> guns<00:00:38.879> like<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
that goes probably for guns like the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
building with me he was by the building

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.280 
building with me he was by the building
to<00:01:23.159> my<00:01:23.310> right<00:01:23.640> which<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.570> main<00:01:24.810> way<00:01:25.049> that

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
to my right which is the main way that

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.870 
to my right which is the main way that
they<00:01:25.409> would<00:01:25.560> exit<00:01:25.979> from<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.400> little<00:01:26.580> spawn

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
they would exit from this little spawn

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.880 
they would exit from this little spawn
trap<00:01:27.119> area<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.689> then<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.259> second<00:01:28.650> way<00:01:28.740> that

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
trap area and then the second way that

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.350 
trap area and then the second way that
they<00:01:28.979> were<00:01:29.040> usually<00:01:29.220> exit<00:01:29.729> from<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.060> spawn

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
they were usually exit from the spawn

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.749 
they were usually exit from the spawn
trap<00:01:30.689> area<00:01:31.020> back<00:01:31.229> towards<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> flag<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.490> the

trap area back towards the a flag is the

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
don't know how to describe it the best

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.510 
don't know how to describe it the best
but<00:02:00.479> yeah<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.869> lot<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.290> people<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.310> to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
but yeah a lot of people I like to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.370 
but yeah a lot of people I like to
escape<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.240> little<00:02:03.540> swarm<00:02:03.780> trap<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.140> run<00:02:04.290> it

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
escape this little swarm trap I run it

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.840 
escape this little swarm trap I run it
that<00:02:04.530> way<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.950> unfortunately<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.549> couple

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
that way and unfortunately a couple

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.580 
that way and unfortunately a couple
people<00:02:05.969> were<00:02:06.090> able<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.390> make<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.719> there<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.140> I

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
people were able to make it there and I

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.290 
people were able to make it there and I
think<00:02:07.799> they<00:02:07.920> go<00:02:08.099> ahead<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.520> capture<00:02:08.640> C<00:02:08.970> pretty

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
think they go ahead and capture C pretty

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.270 
think they go ahead and capture C pretty
soon<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.810> we<00:02:09.869> capture<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.649> then<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.129> whole

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
soon and we capture a and then the whole

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.680 
soon and we capture a and then the whole
thing<00:02:11.310> switched<00:02:11.910> but<00:02:12.209> that's<00:02:12.360> all<00:02:12.540> right

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
thing switched but that's all right

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.690 
thing switched but that's all right
because<00:02:12.930> there's<00:02:13.470> an

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
because there's an

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.070 
because there's an
the<00:02:13.819> building<00:02:14.120> that's<00:02:14.300> really<00:02:14.540> important<00:02:14.900> for

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
the building that's really important for

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.420 
the building that's really important for
controlling<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.560> spawn<00:02:15.770> trap<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.099> other<00:02:16.190> two

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
controlling a spawn trap and other two

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.250 
controlling a spawn trap and other two
sets<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.879> buildings<00:02:17.209> that<00:02:17.900> are<00:02:17.959> really

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
sets of buildings that are really

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.990 
sets of buildings that are really
important<00:02:18.680> for<00:02:18.739> controlling<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.489> spawn<00:02:19.730> trap

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
important for controlling the spawn trap

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.839 
important for controlling the spawn trap
so<00:02:20.209> like<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:21.230> said<00:02:21.440> for<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:21.860> side<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.670> side

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
so like I said for this side the side

you<00:02:53.150> will<00:02:53.390> be<00:02:53.599> able<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.840> keep<00:02:53.989> them<00:02:54.140> trapped<00:02:54.470> at

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
you will be able to keep them trapped at

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.530 
you will be able to keep them trapped at
sea<00:02:54.980> now<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.519> other<00:02:55.819> main<00:02:56.120> way<00:02:56.299> that<00:02:56.329> they're

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
sea now the other main way that they're

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.300 
sea now the other main way that they're
gonna<00:02:56.630> run<00:02:56.840> is<00:02:57.110> behind<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.680> bus<00:02:57.860> in<00:02:58.190> the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
gonna run is behind the bus in the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.380 
gonna run is behind the bus in the
building<00:02:58.610> all<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.819> way<00:02:58.910> towards<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.150> back<00:02:59.360> of

building all the way towards the back of
the<00:02:59.510> spawn<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.049> what<00:03:00.140> you're<00:03:00.260> gonna<00:03:00.349> notice<00:03:00.560> I

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
the spawn and what you're gonna notice I

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.860 
the spawn and what you're gonna notice I
believe<00:03:01.069> a<00:03:01.099> little<00:03:01.310> bit<00:03:01.430> later<00:03:01.579> on<00:03:01.819> in<00:03:02.599> this

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
believe a little bit later on in this

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.009 
believe a little bit later on in this
match<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:04.069> ooo<00:03:04.459> guy<00:03:04.880> he<00:03:05.180> actually<00:03:05.299> goes<00:03:05.599> up<00:03:05.840> in

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
match the ooo guy he actually goes up in

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.660 
match the ooo guy he actually goes up in
that<00:03:06.140> building<00:03:06.349> and<00:03:06.709> he<00:03:07.010> controls<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:07.459> pretty

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
that building and he controls it pretty

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.759 
that building and he controls it pretty
well<00:03:07.849> and<00:03:08.120> stops<00:03:08.450> them<00:03:08.720> from<00:03:08.930> moving<00:03:09.110> up<00:03:09.410> into

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
well and stops them from moving up into

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.970 
well and stops them from moving up into
our<00:03:09.890> spawn<00:03:10.160> or<00:03:10.880> up<00:03:11.150> past<00:03:11.450> their<00:03:12.230> spawn<00:03:12.590> which

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
our spawn or up past their spawn which

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.069 
our spawn or up past their spawn which
is<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:14.030> main<00:03:14.209> spot<00:03:14.510> that<00:03:14.630> we<00:03:14.720> were<00:03:14.780> worried

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
is the main spot that we were worried

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.110 
is the main spot that we were worried
about<00:03:15.260> what<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:16.250> saw<00:03:16.400> her<00:03:16.519> just<00:03:16.730> right<00:03:16.880> there

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
about what you saw her just right there

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.090 
about what you saw her just right there
is<00:03:17.299> me<00:03:17.780> and<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:18.200> teammates<00:03:18.530> pushed<00:03:18.829> up<00:03:18.980> a

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
is me and the teammates pushed up a

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.979 
is me and the teammates pushed up a
little<00:03:19.340> bit<00:03:19.519> too<00:03:19.639> far<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:20.209> because<00:03:20.810> they

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
little bit too far and because they

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.660 
little bit too far and because they
hadn't<00:03:21.319> captured<00:03:21.470> C<00:03:21.920> yet<00:03:22.130> they<00:03:22.340> actually

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
hadn't captured C yet they actually

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.670 
hadn't captured C yet they actually
ended<00:03:22.940> up<00:03:23.060> spawning<00:03:23.450> over<00:03:23.810> here<00:03:23.989> on<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.350> left

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
ended up spawning over here on the left

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.920 
ended up spawning over here on the left
behind<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.340> building<00:03:25.700> behind<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.480> hotel

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
behind the building behind the hotel

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.330 
behind the building behind the hotel
building<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:27.680> that's<00:03:27.829> what<00:03:27.980> I'm<00:03:28.040> talking

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
building and that's what I'm talking

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.039 
building and that's what I'm talking
about<00:03:28.400> where<00:03:28.730> if<00:03:28.790> you<00:03:28.880> push<00:03:29.060> too<00:03:29.239> far<00:03:29.480> it'll

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
about where if you push too far it'll

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.020 
about where if you push too far it'll
mess<00:03:30.350> up<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.620> spawns<00:03:30.889> now<00:03:31.130> typically<00:03:31.670> as<00:03:31.910> long

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
mess up the spawns now typically as long

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.190 
mess up the spawns now typically as long
as<00:03:32.150> you're<00:03:32.299> towards<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.630> middle<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:32.989> map

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
as you're towards the middle of the map

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.020 
as you're towards the middle of the map
like<00:03:33.440> we<00:03:33.620> were<00:03:33.769> in<00:03:33.920> this<00:03:34.040> game<00:03:34.280> they<00:03:34.700> wouldn't

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
like we were in this game they wouldn't

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.699 
like we were in this game they wouldn't
respond<00:03:35.329> to<00:03:35.359> B<00:03:35.600> but<00:03:35.840> again<00:03:36.109> it<00:03:36.290> would<00:03:36.380> because

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
respond to B but again it would because

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.440 
respond to B but again it would because
the<00:03:36.829> fact<00:03:37.100> that<00:03:37.190> we<00:03:37.370> pushed<00:03:37.670> up<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:38.030> little<00:03:38.329> bit

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
the fact that we pushed up a little bit

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.789 
the fact that we pushed up a little bit
too<00:03:38.600> far<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.109> that's<00:03:39.290> something<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.650> don't

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
too far and that's something you don't

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.039 
too far and that's something you don't
want<00:03:40.010> to<00:03:40.040> do<00:03:40.190> so<00:03:40.790> right<00:03:41.000> now<00:03:41.150> we<00:03:41.209> get<00:03:41.510> a<00:03:41.540> three

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
want to do so right now we get a three

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.590 
want to do so right now we get a three
kept<00:03:42.260> going<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:42.859> then<00:03:42.920> just<00:03:43.430> a<00:03:43.639> race<00:03:44.150> to<00:03:44.389> see

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
kept going and then just a race to see

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.759 
kept going and then just a race to see
which<00:03:44.810> side<00:03:45.019> they're<00:03:45.170> gonna<00:03:45.290> spawn<00:03:45.560> on

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
which side they're gonna spawn on

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.229 
which side they're gonna spawn on
there's<00:03:46.220> definitely<00:03:46.670> some<00:03:46.850> guys<00:03:47.000> over<00:03:47.209> here

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
there's definitely some guys over here

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.000 
there's definitely some guys over here
at<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.569> that<00:03:47.810> I'm<00:03:47.900> killing<00:03:48.260> I<00:03:48.410> know<00:03:48.739> there's

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
at a that I'm killing I know there's

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.710 
at a that I'm killing I know there's
also<00:03:49.130> some<00:03:49.370> guys<00:03:49.549> everybody<00:03:50.030> I<00:03:50.209> can<00:03:50.420> see<00:03:50.600> on

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
also some guys everybody I can see on

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.160 
also some guys everybody I can see on
the<00:03:50.810> radar

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
the radar

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.720 
the radar
unfortunately<00:03:51.709> I<00:03:51.739> get<00:03:51.980> clammy<00:03:52.310> launcher

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
unfortunately I get clammy launcher

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.520 
unfortunately I get clammy launcher
right<00:03:52.880> there<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.329> spawns<00:03:53.930> me<00:03:54.049> and<00:03:54.139> C<00:03:54.260> so<00:03:54.500> I

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
right there it spawns me and C so I

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.170 
right there it spawns me and C so I
immediately<00:03:54.769> think<00:03:55.190> myself<00:03:55.430> that<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:55.940> swamp

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
immediately think myself that the swamp

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.940 
immediately think myself that the swamp
trap<00:03:56.389> is<00:03:56.540> going<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.900> move<00:03:57.079> permanently<00:03:57.680> back

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
trap is going to move permanently back

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.349 
trap is going to move permanently back
to<00:03:58.099> a<00:03:58.130> and<00:03:58.489> that's<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.790> way<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:59.000> rest<00:03:59.150> of<00:03:59.299> the

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
to a and that's the way the rest of the

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.259 
to a and that's the way the rest of the
game<00:03:59.510> is<00:03:59.599> gonna<00:03:59.720> go<00:03:59.900> but<00:04:00.769> because<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.430> ooo<00:04:01.790> is

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
game is gonna go but because the ooo is

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.599 
game is gonna go but because the ooo is
here<00:04:02.480> oh<00:04:02.510> whatever<00:04:03.139> guy<00:04:03.470> had<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:04.250> chopper

gunner up in the air it actually

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.129 
gunner up in the air it actually
switched<00:04:06.260> again<00:04:06.709> which<00:04:07.040> is<00:04:07.400> just<00:04:07.780> it's<00:04:08.780> just<00:04:08.930> a

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
switched again which is just it's just a

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.069 
switched again which is just it's just a
testament<00:04:09.440> to<00:04:09.620> how<00:04:10.389> frail<00:04:11.389> assess<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.959> right

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
testament to how frail assess the right

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
building that I was talking about

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.790 
building that I was talking about
earlier<00:04:29.010> in<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.310> back<00:04:29.460> there<00:04:29.670> Matt<00:04:30.590> if<00:04:31.590> they

earlier in the back there Matt if they
can't<00:04:32.130> make<00:04:32.310> it<00:04:32.340> through<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.640> bar<00:04:32.820> building

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
can't make it through the bar building

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.430 
can't make it through the bar building
which<00:04:33.420> is<00:04:33.450> right<00:04:33.780> in<00:04:33.870> front<00:04:33.900> of<00:04:34.140> me<00:04:34.230> right<00:04:34.410> now

I'm sure you guys are all familiar with
the<00:04:36.090> bar<00:04:36.300> on<00:04:37.020> this<00:04:37.200> map<00:04:37.410> in<00:04:37.650> that<00:04:37.920> little<00:04:38.460> area

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
the bar on this map in that little area

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.270 
the bar on this map in that little area
they're<00:04:39.750> going<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.140> run<00:04:40.380> towards<00:04:40.740> me<00:04:40.890> into

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
they're going to run towards me into

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.400 
they're going to run towards me into
this<00:04:41.430> building<00:04:41.820> or<00:04:42.030> like<00:04:42.690> I<00:04:42.780> said<00:04:42.840> earlier

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
this building or like I said earlier

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.410 
this building or like I said earlier
behind<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:43.890> bus<00:04:44.100> so<00:04:44.580> once<00:04:44.910> we<00:04:45.030> had<00:04:45.180> them<00:04:45.270> in

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
behind the bus so once we had them in

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.780 
behind the bus so once we had them in
this<00:04:45.480> little<00:04:45.630> spawn<00:04:45.930> trap<00:04:46.200> set<00:04:46.680> up<00:04:46.800> I<00:04:47.010> called

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
this little spawn trap set up I called

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.970 
this little spawn trap set up I called
in<00:04:47.940> my<00:04:48.150> chopper<00:04:48.690> gunner<00:04:48.990> unfortunately<00:04:49.710> a<00:04:49.740> lot

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
in my chopper gunner unfortunately a lot

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.050 
in my chopper gunner unfortunately a lot
of<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.130> guys<00:04:50.250> were<00:04:50.520> sitting<00:04:50.640> back<00:04:50.820> in<00:04:51.000> the

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
of the guys were sitting back in the

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.640 
of the guys were sitting back in the
building<00:04:51.390> this<00:04:51.510> but<00:04:51.690> I<00:04:51.840> didn't<00:04:52.290> really<00:04:52.500> mind

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
building this but I didn't really mind

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.440 
building this but I didn't really mind
that<00:04:52.770> much<00:04:52.980> because<00:04:53.250> I<00:04:53.520> knew<00:04:53.640> that<00:04:53.670> every

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
that much because I knew that every

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.910 
that much because I knew that every
second<00:04:55.110> that<00:04:55.200> I<00:04:55.260> was<00:04:55.380> still<00:04:55.560> up<00:04:55.710> in<00:04:55.830> that

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
second that I was still up in that

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.560 
second that I was still up in that
chopper<00:04:56.280> gunner<00:04:56.460> was<00:04:56.610> another<00:04:56.940> second<00:04:57.390> that

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
chopper gunner was another second that

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.570 
chopper gunner was another second that
you<00:04:57.810> know<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.290> the<00:04:58.860> tickets<00:04:59.160> were<00:04:59.280> counting

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
you know the the tickets were counting

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.510 
you know the the tickets were counting
up<00:04:59.700> for<00:04:59.910> us<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:00.330> not<00:05:01.080> for<00:05:01.140> them<00:05:01.560> one<00:05:02.310> thing<00:05:02.460> I

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
up for us and not for them one thing I

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.860 
up for us and not for them one thing I
thought<00:05:02.670> I'd<00:05:02.820> talk<00:05:03.090> about<00:05:03.120> something<00:05:03.690> that<00:05:03.720> is

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
thought I'd talk about something that is

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.830 
thought I'd talk about something that is
from<00:05:04.410> a<00:05:04.440> very<00:05:04.770> very<00:05:05.040> long<00:05:05.370> time<00:05:05.580> ago<00:05:05.640> that<00:05:05.910> I

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
from a very very long time ago that I

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.900 
from a very very long time ago that I
still<00:05:07.740> remember<00:05:08.160> hopefully<00:05:08.370> I<00:05:08.550> remembered

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
still remember hopefully I remembered

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.780 
still remember hopefully I remembered
accurately<00:05:09.570> if<00:05:10.350> you<00:05:10.530> are<00:05:10.650> ever<00:05:10.920> wondering<00:05:11.070> you

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
accurately if you are ever wondering you

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.010 
accurately if you are ever wondering you
know<00:05:11.820> how<00:05:11.880> many<00:05:12.150> points<00:05:12.510> you<00:05:12.570> can<00:05:12.630> get<00:05:12.870> in

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
know how many points you can get in

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.430 
know how many points you can get in
domination<00:05:13.470> pretty<00:05:14.190> much<00:05:14.340> each<00:05:15.180> flag<00:05:16.110> thing

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
domination pretty much each flag thing

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.530 
domination pretty much each flag thing
is<00:05:16.650> going<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:17.430> get<00:05:17.580> you<00:05:17.790> I<00:05:17.820> believe<00:05:18.120> it<00:05:18.210> is<00:05:18.330> one

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
is going to get you I believe it is one

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.710 
is going to get you I believe it is one
point<00:05:18.840> every<00:05:19.260> six<00:05:19.620> seconds<00:05:20.090> or<00:05:21.090> I<00:05:21.150> could<00:05:21.630> be

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
point every six seconds or I could be

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.120 
point every six seconds or I could be
wrong<00:05:21.840> enough<00:05:22.080> anyway<00:05:22.620> here's<00:05:22.830> the<00:05:22.950> way<00:05:23.040> it

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
wrong enough anyway here's the way it

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.820 
wrong enough anyway here's the way it
works<00:05:23.340> for<00:05:24.270> every<00:05:24.540> minute<00:05:24.840> that<00:05:25.170> you<00:05:25.380> are<00:05:25.590> to

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
works for every minute that you are to

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.070 
works for every minute that you are to
capping<00:05:26.280> the<00:05:26.370> enemy<00:05:26.640> they<00:05:27.210> are<00:05:27.240> going<00:05:27.630> to<00:05:27.900> get

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
capping the enemy they are going to get

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.080 
capping the enemy they are going to get
ten<00:05:28.320> points<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:28.890> you<00:05:29.250> are<00:05:29.490> going<00:05:29.670> to<00:05:29.820> get

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
ten points and you are going to get

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.660 
ten points and you are going to get
thirty<00:05:30.900> so<00:05:31.200> you're<00:05:31.380> going<00:05:31.680> to<00:05:31.710> gain<00:05:32.070> by<00:05:32.100> 20

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
thirty so you're going to gain by 20

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.460 
thirty so you're going to gain by 20
points<00:05:32.820> for<00:05:33.090> every<00:05:33.300> minute<00:05:33.720> that<00:05:34.050> you<00:05:34.170> are<00:05:34.290> to

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
points for every minute that you are to

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.950 
points for every minute that you are to
capping<00:05:34.860> a<00:05:34.890> team<00:05:35.100> so<00:05:35.580> for<00:05:35.760> example<00:05:36.180> if<00:05:36.360> you<00:05:36.540> are

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
capping a team so for example if you are

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.540 
capping a team so for example if you are
like<00:05:37.290> at<00:05:37.440> the<00:05:37.530> towards<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:37.920> very<00:05:38.040> end<00:05:38.190> of<00:05:38.430> the

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
like at the towards the very end of the

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.860 
like at the towards the very end of the
game<00:05:38.580> and<00:05:39.000> you<00:05:39.060> don't<00:05:39.090> think<00:05:39.390> you<00:05:39.480> can<00:05:39.690> you

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
game and you don't think you can you

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.810 
game and you don't think you can you
know<00:05:39.990> come<00:05:40.260> back<00:05:40.470> you<00:05:40.980> can<00:05:41.130> use<00:05:41.460> that<00:05:41.670> little

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
know come back you can use that little

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.460 
know come back you can use that little
table<00:05:42.090> to<00:05:42.420> you<00:05:42.600> know<00:05:42.690> figure<00:05:42.870> out<00:05:43.020> you<00:05:43.350> know<00:05:43.380> if

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
table to you know figure out you know if

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.290 
table to you know figure out you know if
they<00:05:43.770> get<00:05:43.950> 10<00:05:44.130> points<00:05:44.340> this<00:05:44.640> minute<00:05:44.940> and<00:05:45.060> I<00:05:45.150> get

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
they get 10 points this minute and I get

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.870

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730 
changed I don't think they did anything

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.130 
changed I don't think they did anything
change<00:06:08.820> into<00:06:09.210> how<00:06:09.330> many<00:06:09.480> points<00:06:09.750> you<00:06:09.810> get<00:06:09.930> or

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.620 
change into how many points you get or
how<00:06:10.230> fast<00:06:10.470> you<00:06:10.710> get<00:06:10.860> them<00:06:11.010> so<00:06:11.630> hopefully

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
how fast you get them so hopefully

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.540 
how fast you get them so hopefully
