00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.490
 His heartfelt welcome here too 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.980
 this little video to the five 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.200
 hide crooked take on the new 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.570
 wvw burn the fog 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.630
 these different skifans are diving 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.640
 not as usual in your success 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.039
 Survey under the hero menu 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.859
 but you only see her there when you 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.470
 you have completed successfully 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:28.080
 These are three successes that are pretty 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.019
 A success for these three successes 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.880
 and the success I personally around the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.010
 doctors think that most of them think so 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.320
 actually get inadvertently 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.420
 and indeed there is a deep with 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.170
 for being from the mep itself 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.050
 falls 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.059
 that is not in the official deep 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.280
 in it but he gets it first 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.110
 and he will not be visible until you do that 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.390
 first fallen down 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.440
 good proof here you can see now 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.629
 a bit about yourself but us 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.000
 go again here the leap 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.949
 Nebula means the done and the power 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.960
 her by her i would forest from the mep 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.570
 But there are other successes 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.920
 Collect success that means everything in a bucket 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.750
 and that consists of three individual successes 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.049
 and the first you see here the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.210
 is located near the desert fortress in 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.130
 you have to have a needle from this one 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.110
 small lead in this pot 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.880
 jump there draws the plug and 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.600
 then lands on top of this 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.850
 platform 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.250
 and then it says something out of something 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.540
 greater distance the same pot 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.759
 to meet again 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.500
 It would take a bit over 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.930
 look out the edge of the plate 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.780
 find the right position and then 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.759
 Just do not forget to jump down 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.049
 opel daughter putting glasses on her 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.979
 can do a little bit in between 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.420
 get involved 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.399
 I personally was on it first 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.840
 focuses the success paid jump 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.700
 complete here 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.369
 the same applies to the other two 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.399
 Teams first look at the stone 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.079
 There had been death there too 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.579
 you have to have a small container there 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.110
 also back in and the plug 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.090
 pull up 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.610
 Diving glasses put on the right one 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.390
 find a position and jump again 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.549
 master 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.350
 you will see the relatively many people 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.050
 in will already be successful these successes 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.970
 do 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.040
 I had to go in between 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.769
 in between, kindly a few times 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.849
 People just pick up this train 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.920
 died here 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.930
 So you will see you are not the ones 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.560
 the only ones looking for these done 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.170
 Finally, we have the part in 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.410
 the frost fortress there is in the fund 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.310
 or near the frost fortress in the tower 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.110
 There is also one of us there 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.459
 container here was the npc a bit 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.450
 annoying we just wanted to go with it 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.920
 to chatter me 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.720
 I did not think it was so funny 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.260
 That's why I tried him 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.879
 to ignore 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.519
 well here it goes again from a 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.030
 significantly increased height in the bucket 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.220
 jump 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.500
 and if you got that done 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.660
 her also the overall success of everything in the bucket 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.780
 That's another five successes 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.540
 points for these three hidden crooked 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.530
 - for these three jumps in the bucket 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.180
 and that should have been at this point 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.549
 be if the video helped you 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.709
 Data 2 goes to the laboratories 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.959
 news.de in our guide to the edge of 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.459
 fog or patch and we hear and 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.459
 See you again for the next video
