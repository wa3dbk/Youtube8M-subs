00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
and my only tip at the beginning here is

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.860 
and my only tip at the beginning here is
to<00:00:53.520> make<00:00:53.670> sure<00:00:53.910> like<00:00:54.180> your<00:00:54.329> fabric<00:00:54.719> will

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
to make sure like your fabric will

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.020 
to make sure like your fabric will
stretch<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.410> certain<00:00:55.710> direction<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.640> make

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
stretch in a certain direction so make

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.939 
stretch in a certain direction so make
sure<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.660> stretching<00:00:58.109> horizontally

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
sure you have it stretching horizontally

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.760 
sure you have it stretching horizontally
so<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.489> are<00:00:59.609> able<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.969> put<00:01:00.899> your<00:01:01.170> bandsaw

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
so that you are able to put your bandsaw

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.380 
so that you are able to put your bandsaw
on<00:01:01.949> once<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.340> done<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.879> would<00:01:03.120> suggest

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
on once it's done so I would suggest

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.329 
on once it's done so I would suggest
using<00:01:03.780> some<00:01:03.960> old<00:01:04.500> fabric<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.220> maybe

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
using some old fabric that you maybe

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.580 
using some old fabric that you maybe
aren't<00:01:05.610> using<00:01:05.760> anymore<00:01:06.119> or<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.930> an<00:01:07.200> old<00:01:07.380> piece

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
aren't using anymore or is an old piece

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.770 
aren't using anymore or is an old piece
of<00:01:07.619> clothing<00:01:08.010> because<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.180> way<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.600> mess

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
of clothing because that way if you mess

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.780

and<00:01:33.869> then<00:01:34.110> take<00:01:34.290> half<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.740> measurement

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
and then take half of that measurement

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.800 
and then take half of that measurement
and<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.430> will<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.210> measurement<00:01:36.600> for<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
and that will be the measurement for the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.359 
and that will be the measurement for the
top<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.259> bottom<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.680> trapezoid<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.310> if

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
top and bottom of the trapezoid and if

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.010 
top and bottom of the trapezoid and if
that<00:01:38.490> sounds<00:01:38.670> confusing<00:01:38.820> you'll<00:01:39.509> understand

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
that sounds confusing you'll understand

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.340 
that sounds confusing you'll understand
in<00:01:40.170> one<00:01:40.290> second<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.009> let's<00:01:41.700> get<00:01:42.030> started<00:01:42.509> all

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
in one second so let's get started all

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.499 
in one second so let's get started all
you're<00:01:43.950> gonna<00:01:44.040> need<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.430> elastic<00:01:45.030> scissors

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
you're gonna need is elastic scissors

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.920 
you're gonna need is elastic scissors
fabric<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.439> then<00:01:47.340> some<00:01:47.909> thread<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.509> suggest

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
fabric and then some thread I suggest

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.399 
fabric and then some thread I suggest
heavy-duty<00:01:49.470> thread<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:51.030> course<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.600> needle

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
heavy-duty thread and of course a needle

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.710 
heavy-duty thread and of course a needle
so<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.520> first<00:01:53.700> thing<00:01:53.850> I'm<00:01:53.939> doing<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.390> having

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
so the first thing I'm doing is having

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.569 
so the first thing I'm doing is having
my<00:01:54.990> two<00:01:55.049> layers<00:01:55.560> together<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:56.399> laying

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
my two layers together and then laying

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.249 
my two layers together and then laying
it<00:01:56.759> down<00:01:56.909> nice<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.180> flat<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.750> I'll<00:01:57.840> be<00:01:57.960> able<00:01:58.049> to

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
it down nice and flat so I'll be able to

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.520 
it down nice and flat so I'll be able to
cut<00:01:58.409> two<00:01:58.619> trapezoids<00:01:59.280> at<00:01:59.430> once<00:02:00.200> so<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> first

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
cut two trapezoids at once so the first

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.230 
cut two trapezoids at once so the first
measurement<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.460> going<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.729> 16

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
measurement is just going to be 16

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.850 
measurement is just going to be 16
inches<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.659> you're<00:02:04.079> just<00:02:04.229> gonna<00:02:04.350> want<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.680> cut

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
inches and you're just gonna want to cut

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.190 
inches and you're just gonna want to cut
your<00:02:05.070> square<00:02:05.579> or<00:02:05.880> rectangle<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.960> is

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
your square or rectangle so that it is

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.330 
your square or rectangle so that it is
16<00:02:07.740> inches<00:02:08.160> wide<00:02:09.080> so<00:02:10.080> now<00:02:10.259> my<00:02:10.440> chunk<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.890> 16

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
16 inches wide so now my chunk is 16

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.610 
16 inches wide so now my chunk is 16
inches<00:02:11.610> wide<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.120> I'm<00:02:12.330> going<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.510> be<00:02:12.629> cutting

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
inches wide and I'm going to be cutting

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.040 
inches wide and I'm going to be cutting
at<00:02:13.860> seven<00:02:14.760> inches<00:02:15.060> high<00:02:15.269> so<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.810> a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
at seven inches high so that is a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.170 
at seven inches high so that is a
sixteen<00:02:16.620> by<00:02:16.650> seven<00:02:17.340> inch<00:02:17.550> rectangle<00:02:19.970> so<00:02:20.970> I'm

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
sixteen by seven inch rectangle so I'm

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.210 
sixteen by seven inch rectangle so I'm
one<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.510> 16<00:02:21.930> inches<00:02:22.260> sides<00:02:22.530> I'm<00:02:22.920> gonna

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
one of the 16 inches sides I'm gonna

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.250 
one of the 16 inches sides I'm gonna
measure<00:02:23.430> two<00:02:23.760> inches<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:24.269> and<00:02:24.510> place<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> pin

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
measure two inches in and place a pin

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.110 
measure two inches in and place a pin
and<00:02:25.560> I'm<00:02:25.769> just<00:02:25.950> using<00:02:26.099> my<00:02:26.280> sister<00:02:26.760> Melanie's

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
and I'm just using my sister Melanie's

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.990 
and I'm just using my sister Melanie's
ruler<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.200> don't<00:02:28.560> tell<00:02:28.739> her<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:29.670> put<00:02:29.970> a

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
ruler so don't tell her and I just put a

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.250 
ruler so don't tell her and I just put a
pin<00:02:30.209> there<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.599> then<00:02:30.690> I'm<00:02:30.780> going<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.930> do<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
pin there and then I'm going to do the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.880 
pin there and then I'm going to do the
same<00:02:31.440> thing<00:02:31.769> on<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.190> other<00:02:32.220> side<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:33.239> it<00:02:34.170> so

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
same thing on the other side of it so

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.000 
same thing on the other side of it so
that<00:02:35.099> this<00:02:35.310> bottom<00:02:35.819> side<00:02:36.060> is<00:02:36.420> going<00:02:36.629> to<00:02:36.959> be<00:02:37.170> 12

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
that this bottom side is going to be 12

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.339 
that this bottom side is going to be 12
inches<00:02:38.310> whereas<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.120> other<00:02:39.269> side<00:02:39.569> is<00:02:39.810> 16

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
inches whereas the other side is 16

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.949 
inches whereas the other side is 16
inches<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.970> are<00:02:42.000> now<00:02:42.239> going<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.510> cut<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.690> nice

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
inches you are now going to cut a nice

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.140 
inches you are now going to cut a nice
diagonal<00:02:43.590> from<00:02:43.799> that<00:02:44.010> pin<00:02:44.280> up<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:44.970> other

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
diagonal from that pin up to the other

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.110 
diagonal from that pin up to the other
corner<00:02:45.510> creating<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.319> very<00:02:46.650> nice<00:02:46.980> diagonal<00:02:47.819> and

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
corner creating a very nice diagonal and

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.949 
corner creating a very nice diagonal and
this<00:02:49.110> diagonal<00:02:49.709> will<00:02:49.950> turn<00:02:50.430> your<00:02:50.910> fabric<00:02:51.180> into

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
this diagonal will turn your fabric into

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.100 
this diagonal will turn your fabric into
a<00:02:51.989> trapezoid<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.450> don't<00:02:54.450> worry<00:02:54.630> at<00:02:54.750> all<00:02:54.840> if<00:02:54.989> it

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
a trapezoid and don't worry at all if it

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.630 
a trapezoid and don't worry at all if it
is<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> bit<00:02:55.500> crooked<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:56.040> will<00:02:56.160> fix<00:02:56.400> that

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
is a bit crooked you will fix that

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.030 
is a bit crooked you will fix that
during<00:02:57.150> your<00:02:57.180> hemming<00:02:57.690> now<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.590> want<00:02:58.829> to<00:02:58.890> lie

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
during your hemming now you want to lie

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.680 
during your hemming now you want to lie
one<00:02:59.310> piece<00:02:59.519> of<00:02:59.700> fabric<00:02:59.849> down<00:03:00.180> with<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.510> pretty

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
one piece of fabric down with the pretty

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.210 
one piece of fabric down with the pretty
side<00:03:00.900> up<00:03:01.079> and<00:03:01.260> then<00:03:01.440> put<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.890> other<00:03:01.920> one

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
side up and then put the other one

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.039 
side up and then put the other one
pretty<00:03:02.459> side<00:03:02.730> down<00:03:02.940> right<00:03:03.120> on<00:03:03.390> top<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.840> so

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
pretty side down right on top of it so

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.410 
pretty side down right on top of it so
that<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.319> nice<00:03:04.500> sides<00:03:04.799> are<00:03:05.040> together<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.790> you

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
that the nice sides are together and you

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.699 
that the nice sides are together and you
just<00:03:06.569> want<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.750> even<00:03:07.079> those<00:03:07.200> out<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.650> then

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
just want to even those out and then

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.789 
just want to even those out and then
you're<00:03:07.950> gonna<00:03:08.040> pin<00:03:08.370> both<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.799> seven-inch

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
you're gonna pin both of the seven-inch

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.650 
you're gonna pin both of the seven-inch
sides<00:03:11.190> of<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.549> as<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:11.849> can<00:03:11.970> see<00:03:12.150> mine<00:03:12.480> is

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
sides of it as you can see mine is

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.809 
sides of it as you can see mine is
really<00:03:13.049> lopsided<00:03:13.890> because<00:03:14.010> my<00:03:14.280> fabric<00:03:14.640> kept

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
really lopsided because my fabric kept

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.940 
really lopsided because my fabric kept
moving<00:03:15.180> while<00:03:15.329> I<00:03:15.360> was<00:03:15.569> cutting<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:16.019> but<00:03:16.739> it

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
moving while I was cutting it but it

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.349 
moving while I was cutting it but it
actually<00:03:17.160> ended<00:03:17.519> up<00:03:17.730> working<00:03:17.940> out<00:03:18.090> fine<00:03:18.329> I

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
actually ended up working out fine I

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.120 
actually ended up working out fine I
just<00:03:18.540> took<00:03:18.900> off<00:03:19.079> more<00:03:19.350> when<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.560> was<00:03:19.739> having<00:03:19.859> the

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
just took off more when I was having the

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.819 
just took off more when I was having the
top<00:03:20.310> from<00:03:20.819> the<00:03:21.150> other<00:03:21.269> side<00:03:21.569> so<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:22.079> can<00:03:22.560> even

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
top from the other side so you can even

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.949 
top from the other side so you can even
that<00:03:22.980> out<00:03:23.010> so<00:03:23.940> I'm<00:03:24.030> taking<00:03:24.150> this<00:03:24.450> nice<00:03:24.630> thick

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
that out so I'm taking this nice thick

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.440 
that out so I'm taking this nice thick
hand<00:03:25.290> quilting<00:03:25.799> thread<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.430> I'm<00:03:26.850> going<00:03:27.239> to

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
hand quilting thread and I'm going to

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.960 
hand quilting thread and I'm going to
start<00:03:28.049> from<00:03:28.650> one<00:03:28.859> side<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.400> pull<00:03:29.609> through<00:03:29.849> to

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
start from one side and pull through to

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.370 
start from one side and pull through to
the<00:03:30.090> other<00:03:30.209> side<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.750> for<00:03:30.959> this<00:03:31.109> stitch

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
the other side and for this stitch

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.990 
the other side and for this stitch
instead<00:03:31.889> of<00:03:32.010> doing<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.310> running<00:03:32.489> stitch

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
instead of doing the running stitch

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.059 
instead of doing the running stitch
I<00:03:33.030> always<00:03:33.540> start<00:03:33.870> on<00:03:34.079> the<00:03:34.170> same<00:03:34.380> side<00:03:34.680> so<00:03:34.709> I

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
I always start on the same side so I

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.640 
I always start on the same side so I
just<00:03:35.340> keep<00:03:35.519> going<00:03:35.760> through<00:03:36.540> one<00:03:36.840> side<00:03:37.200> and

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
just keep going through one side and

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.259 
just keep going through one side and
wrapping<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.310> around<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:38.819> the<00:03:38.940> thread

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
wrapping it around so that the thread

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.420 
wrapping it around so that the thread
goes<00:03:39.510> over<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.170> seam<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:41.130> will<00:03:41.250> just

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
goes over the seam and that will just

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.759 
goes over the seam and that will just
make<00:03:41.579> your<00:03:41.730> seam<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.090> bit<00:03:42.419> stronger<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.230> you

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
make your seam a bit stronger and you

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.319 
make your seam a bit stronger and you
want<00:03:43.919> to<00:03:44.010> make<00:03:44.130> these<00:03:44.280> stitches<00:03:44.519> as<00:03:44.849> close

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
want to make these stitches as close

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.089 
want to make these stitches as close
together<00:03:45.569> as<00:03:45.750> possible<00:03:45.900> because<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:46.950> don't

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
together as possible because you don't

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.220 
together as possible because you don't
want<00:03:47.250> your<00:03:47.370> bando<00:03:47.790> gap<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.389> open<00:03:48.690> up<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.989> side

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
want your bando gap and open up the side

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.610 
want your bando gap and open up the side
because<00:03:49.739> that<00:03:49.980> just<00:03:50.519> wouldn't<00:03:50.760> be<00:03:50.880> cute<00:03:51.620> so

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
because that just wouldn't be cute so

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.349 
because that just wouldn't be cute so
now<00:03:52.769> you<00:03:52.859> can<00:03:53.099> turn<00:03:53.280> your<00:03:53.430> fabric<00:03:53.639> right<00:03:54.030> side

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
now you can turn your fabric right side

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.110 
now you can turn your fabric right side
out<00:03:54.569> again<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.109> then<00:03:56.040> this<00:03:56.370> is<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:56.700> most<00:03:56.849> fun

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
out again and then this is the most fun

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.699 
out again and then this is the most fun
part<00:03:57.389> you<00:03:57.720> can<00:03:57.870> be<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:57.989> little<00:03:58.290> bit<00:03:58.500> creative

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
part you can be a little bit creative

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.190 
part you can be a little bit creative
here<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.400> what<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.150> decided<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.810> do<00:04:01.049> was

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
here and what I decided to do was

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.319 
here and what I decided to do was
actually<00:04:01.230> instead<00:04:02.190> of<00:04:02.250> hemming<00:04:02.669> the<00:04:02.880> top<00:04:03.090> and

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
actually instead of hemming the top and

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.050 
actually instead of hemming the top and
bottom<00:04:03.690> both<00:04:03.900> I<00:04:04.200> only<00:04:04.680> hummed<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.400> bottom<00:04:05.819> and

bottom both I only hummed the bottom and

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.870 
bottom both I only hummed the bottom and

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:52.159 
the very top of my bands oh because I

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:53.559

sew<00:05:02.030> the<00:05:02.150> elastic<00:05:02.180> on<00:05:02.659> is<00:05:02.870> by<00:05:03.110> taking<00:05:03.530> a<00:05:03.680> piece

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
sew the elastic on is by taking a piece

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.249 
sew the elastic on is by taking a piece
of<00:05:04.099> thread<00:05:04.490> and<00:05:04.909> a<00:05:05.330> needle<00:05:05.360> and<00:05:05.780> just<00:05:06.050> going

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
of thread and a needle and just going

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.170 
of thread and a needle and just going
straight<00:05:06.560> through<00:05:07.069> all<00:05:07.340> that<00:05:07.580> ruching<00:05:07.849> and

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
straight through all that ruching and

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.209 
straight through all that ruching and
then<00:05:08.659> once<00:05:08.960> you<00:05:09.080> have<00:05:09.199> that<00:05:09.379> thread<00:05:09.740> on<00:05:09.979> there

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:10.219 
then once you have that thread on there

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:12.610 
then once you have that thread on there
you<00:05:10.460> can<00:05:10.610> move<00:05:10.819> the<00:05:11.030> folds<00:05:11.330> around<00:05:11.419> a<00:05:11.840> bit<00:05:11.990> so

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
you can move the folds around a bit so

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.649 
you can move the folds around a bit so
that<00:05:12.650> you<00:05:13.039> have<00:05:13.250> it<00:05:13.280> to<00:05:13.610> your<00:05:13.759> exact<00:05:14.240> desired

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:14.659

length<00:05:15.050> and<00:05:15.319> the<00:05:15.949> ruching<00:05:16.129> is<00:05:16.370> even

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
length and the ruching is even

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.110 
length and the ruching is even

ruching on to the elastic until I have

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:31.510 
ruching on to the elastic until I have
it<00:05:28.969> to<00:05:29.330> the<00:05:30.020> length<00:05:30.259> of<00:05:30.529> that<00:05:30.979> that<00:05:31.279> I<00:05:31.310> would
