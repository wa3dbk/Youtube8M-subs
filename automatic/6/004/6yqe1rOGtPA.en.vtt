00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:08.540 
is it very difficult to understand

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.700 
is it very difficult to understand
because<00:07:08.720> when<00:07:08.960> you<00:07:09.080> fight<00:07:09.290> now<00:07:09.470> amateur

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:09.710 
because when you fight now amateur

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.250 
because when you fight now amateur
boxing<00:07:10.100> and<00:07:10.430> you<00:07:10.640> knock<00:07:10.820> someone<00:07:11.150> down

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:11.260 
boxing and you knock someone down

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.690 
boxing and you knock someone down
counted<00:07:12.260> if<00:07:12.530> you<00:07:12.590> tap<00:07:13.280> them<00:07:13.460> on<00:07:13.580> the<00:07:13.640> shoulder

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:13.700 
counted if you tap them on the shoulder

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.760 
counted if you tap them on the shoulder
that's<00:07:14.390> right<00:07:14.540> it's<00:07:14.840> just<00:07:15.020> one<00:07:15.200> point<00:07:15.500> and

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
that's right it's just one point and

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.190 
that's right it's just one point and
really<00:07:15.980> it's<00:07:16.820> not<00:07:17.180> it<00:07:17.600> doesn't<00:07:17.630> count<00:07:17.960> for<00:07:18.050> a

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:18.200 
really it's not it doesn't count for a

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.380 
really it's not it doesn't count for a
big<00:07:18.350> margin<00:07:18.620> anything<00:07:19.310> and<00:07:19.700> that's<00:07:20.060> what's

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:20.390 
big margin anything and that's what's

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.260 
big margin anything and that's what's
unbelievably<00:07:21.320> funny<00:07:21.740> about<00:07:21.950> amateur<00:07:22.760> boxing
