00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:09.420
 program thermometer on a smartphone under 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.200
 running os android first program 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.550
 so apparently 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.140
 reflects the indoor temperature and 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.710
 outside temperature 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.710
 this program is not available outside 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.890
 is free and notes them then 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.240
 what in order to correct 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.309
 smerit indoor temperature 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.170
 it is necessary that a certain amount 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.270
 of time 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:41.120
 the device lay down without any activation 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.120
 in this program you can install 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.610
 Background color can be set 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.610
 such 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.340
 You can also here that offers us 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.960
 either in Celsius or Fahrenheit in 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.750
 world temperature is such a program, they 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:06.659
 all similar here's another one let's 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:11.880
 let's see a thermometer called in something 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:15.210
 she has another program we go out she has 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.030
 various backdrops ie not backs 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.710
 there are no different designs around this 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.930
 the program has no clearance but 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.930
 they see this temperature centigrade 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.570
 it's fahrenheit inside 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.280
 Well naturally outside I do not know what she is 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.799
 shows 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.590
 the site is inside but I just donâ€™t know 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.210
 who needs this temperature but here I am 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.280
 it seems somewhat confused if you 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.380
 see here celsius should be 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.810
 left half and here in fahrenheit 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.390
 right that is, and vice versa celsius 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.340
 here in fahrenheit here is such 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.940
 out so it inside program 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:58.330
 next program but we don't need 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:02.470
 no background of stars put the dermis 10 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:08.610
 styles 10 thermometer style we have 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:11.530
 Well, here is the battery and Fahrenheit 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.120
 here also outside but loaded 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.100
 see the inscription please wait 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.920
 style 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.010
 let's turn on this button 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:28.950
 written battery 29 Celsius I do not know what 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:36.329
 It's about the battery or the process but it does not matter 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.329
 the next look is so slightly tech 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.269
 such but I do not know who in principle 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.519
 such programs will need to 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:51.100
 know all the more not quite correct 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:53.290
 form any point whether 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.370
 batteries toli environment all this 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.930
 sufficiently inaccurate information 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.640
 it's better some other programs 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.019
 weather related 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.230
 use if 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:08.530
 regarding the weather outside and if 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.060
 inside then such a thermometer is not and 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.060
 naturally not quite accurate
