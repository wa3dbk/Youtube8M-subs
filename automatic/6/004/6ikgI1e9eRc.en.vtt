00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.899
 Hi guys, I'm going to film here and make a 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.070
 Video for you as a teaching exchange 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.650
 guitar strings guitar isabella luna 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.900
 so today I'll explain I took it here 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.910
 and watch the string already in the case of the guitar 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.820
 her the ropes are were old she is not 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.439
 in case I'm not rope no more then 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.949
 they started to get old you can 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.120
 see here what is a dot of de 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.100
 corrosion here it goes it goes rusting 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.129
 wake up and lose some sound 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.420
 she loses her temper in relation to 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.890
 the octaves 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.680
 Then there comes a time when you wake up. 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.239
 be changed even then the next 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.730
 Purchase the door 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.340
 in the case of isabella guitar I asked 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.739
 to buy the rope middle rope attention 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.899
 of nylon in medical attention 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.760
 then how does it work has 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.620
 six strings were attached to a set of 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.270
 six schools 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.000
 we have three strings that are the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.439
 Bones are the top forms of things 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.960
 more serious 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.880
 the bass notes here on the guitar are 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.380
 What do we call buttons? 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.840
 she is nylon but she has a 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.240
 steel coating so she 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.360
 difference in sonority because of 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.820
 they change in the case that way in this mark 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.500
 rope it is specified here O 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.890
 sixth string this one is thicker 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:36.420
 then this other one here, the fifth string 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.860
 come here also to mark another string 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:45.420
 here fourth string I have not got it wrong 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.970
 Good, then you'll do the following. 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.729
 take one door at a time take one thing 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.259
 for once we will not pick up children and 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.259
 this rope is going to put 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.440
 this roll she woke up was here 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.289
 I advise guarding her in this 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.000
 In case one more emergency you need 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.010
 of a rope does not burst 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.310
 Do you even have to be old by the time? 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.980
 The less you do not get out of here 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.440
 I do this part here is more malleable 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.440
 the rope some things are like that 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.470
 We'll use it to make the 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.330
 first in the first part here the 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.840
 No, no, no, no, no. 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:37.030
 She's the one who fucked this part here. 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.410
 fuse is not the easel the fuse 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.630
 punishment, here, the easel 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.090
 So we do the tip piece 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.650
 O here that tip of rope and places 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:52.459
 here in this part of the world here is 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.760
 The softer this is where I do 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:03:01.489
 the tie the knot will pass this part here 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:06.489
 so for this one here like this 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.489
 here I'll put it 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.360
 put it right here 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.440
 I will leave the evil alone and if that 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:26.060
 done this one is ready 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:28.880
 In this case, one just needs to be 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:36.370
 placed three knots here but over time 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:36.370
 I see you do not need is so O 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.830
 here already're okay is a little harder 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.910
 that part so it can not really 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.680
 leave it 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.930
 then you can cut it with scissors 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:06.540
 that this little piece here is not to stay 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:10.980
 So confused here, that way, he stretched. 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.230
 and it was right here for us here 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.630
 gives the rates 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.000
 some people already put it straight and 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:24.530
 They're spinning around and I'm going to learn. 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.530
 I'd rather give a new wine here than the knot. 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.390
 because she holds more will hold more 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:37.410
 the door will hold her situation more 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:41.130
 It's important, you always have to turn. 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.960
 the guitar fee rate you have to okay 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.940
 to tighten you have to spin always 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.830
 to the left 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.240
 You'll see the rope spinning in that 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.770
 feeling up down goes 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.390
 holding the door is in the right hand 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:05:01.710
 and it goes spinning rate spin spin spin spin 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:06.030
 Turning Enough Of What Saw And Song 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.650
 Everything but good arm you can buy 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.620
 one thing I bought a crank 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:16.700
 that you fit that way the rate and it spins 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:18.900
 she's easier, she even gets faster 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:23.960
 There I go spinning spinning 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.960
 rotating rotating rotating rotating 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.220
 the turn had 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.110
 It's important you're starting to 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.720
 play guitar learn to do it 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.580
 Why are you going to ask a simple teacher ? 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.200
 I'm going to teach you to change all the 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.240
 your guitar strings it will stay the 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.350
 half of the class by changing the 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.350
 guitar 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:52.020
 Then you lose your real time so it's 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.360
 nice to know to trade and even to burst 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:58.200
 a rope you will need to touch and 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.360
 You play guitar, do not you take it seriously. 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.370
 guitar I even learned to play it right 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.760
 You will see that you need to always change 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.760
 wake up 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:17.540
 then I'll laugh cool year here so the O 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:21.750
 which happens now from the super tune 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:23.490
 super out of tune I do as a civilian 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.860
 already tuned there are some 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.860
 ways you affirm her that you have 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.410
 An idea of ​​how this note will look 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.540
 this note that we know that note 6 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.550
 so the sound of it has to stay even though 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.020
 I 'll do it, I'll play a note 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.520
 me here on guitar 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:43.610
 this one here for example is a note me 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:46.500
 so I already know that staying approximately 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.960
 with that sound here the note né 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.610
 of course here is another octave is not 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.290
 joined even eighth than this rope 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.190
 I loose but I can already get this 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.600
 affirmation 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.600
 through this thousand note 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.070
 and such 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.789
 it's already telma 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.370
 It's a big difference from this ribbon string. 

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:22.099
 new to that other old kiyota rope 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.970
 the sound of it is different shines more 

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:26.330
 probe 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:29.569
 so that's there you do is you go 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:31.940
 this way in new york 

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:33.080
 this way you're going to make a change 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.810
 rope at a time 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:39.889
 kitten moon placed then put the 

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:41.360
 Another one is tuning and she's already 

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:44.319
 More or less it will get you more. 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.319
 after all enough 

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.350
 always ending with a tuner is 

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.930
 even better 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:53.270
 you will check out going on events is 

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:55.960
 well, after all only the staff 

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:58.550
 You can now know how to exchange all 

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.690
 so it's important to always be trading 

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.690
 thanks so
