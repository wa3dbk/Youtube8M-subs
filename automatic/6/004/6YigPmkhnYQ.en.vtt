you<00:00:53.760> want<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.030> build<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.329> speed<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.110> then

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
you want to build up speed and then

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.590 
you want to build up speed and then
we'll<00:00:55.530> go<00:00:55.649> back<00:00:55.829> after<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.550> we'll<00:00:57.149> build<00:00:57.420> up

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
we'll go back after and we'll build up

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.700 
we'll go back after and we'll build up
the<00:00:58.109> coordination<00:00:58.800> behind<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.239> so<00:01:00.710> that's

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the coordination behind it so that's

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.979 
the coordination behind it so that's
probably<00:01:01.920> that's<00:01:02.129> really<00:01:02.570> not<00:01:03.570> very<00:01:03.629> way<00:01:03.930> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
probably that's really not very way to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.450 
probably that's really not very way to
do<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.589> how<00:01:04.739> are<00:01:04.799> we<00:01:04.830> going<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.070> do<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.250> for

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
do it but how are we going to do it for

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.429

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
arpeggio down that are sending like lets

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:38.420 
arpeggio down that are sending like lets
me<00:01:29.560> pull<00:01:29.770> off<00:01:34.440> so<00:01:35.440> uh<00:01:35.470> working<00:01:36.280> that<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:38.170> nom

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
string so that I can do so we'll look at

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.540 
string so that I can do so we'll look at
a<00:05:06.070> position<00:05:06.430> change<00:05:07.320> your<00:05:08.320> sliding<00:05:08.620> up<00:05:08.830> while

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
touch upon in another lesson we get a

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.350 
touch upon in another lesson we get a
little<00:05:13.449> bit<00:05:13.630> more<00:05:13.720> in<00:05:13.840> depth<00:05:14.020> so<00:05:15.360> working

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
little bit more in depth so working
