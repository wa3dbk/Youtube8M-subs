00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.410
 in this opportunity although I do not have 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.580
 a paella for control options 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.349
 to use a paella of six servings 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.300
 previously and before pacho starts 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.460
 to cook we have washed it because it is 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.650
 important if there is any remainder of 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.660
 manufacturing remains of fat from the process 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.960
 although that is always well to ask 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.750
 clean it is important to wash clothes 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.120
 and dry it and well then ready to 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.610
 start cooking with her and then 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.620
 we will see the maintenance that the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.190
 with preservation once here we see 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.670
 we have finished the paella and we have 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.030
 run mister really rich shit we 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.100
 touch clean is what paella is for 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.039
 keep it for the next use 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.859
 well we had created a little bit 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.289
 but we see that right away it's like 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.650
 taking a bear color then how 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.940
 a grill is cleaned 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:13.810
 that we are going to use is a scrubber and a 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:21.240
 dishwasher and we put a little bit of 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:21.240
 dishwasher and wash in color 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.950
 and we remove the color of the oxide 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.180
 when they have the remains of rice 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.120
 stuck that usually have them sometimes 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.450
 because it burns a little down at all 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.610
 the Valencians 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.650
 sugar 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.610
 you have to put it with a little water to 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:49.640
 let's see now 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.640
 because it is released the clean well thoroughly 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.060
 let's see how it is coming out and well then 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.670
 nothing else that is clear what we 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.100
 it matters fundamentally in the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.990
 where we coordinate the back of the 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.179
 important have a little fat times 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.990
 the paella is used even the one that is in 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:07.990
 firewood games 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.210
 we want it to be fine 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.400
 preserved in the part whereby 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.269
 we cook 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.220
 As it is made of steel 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.110
 then I have so much with the air 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.849
 because it tends to oxidize everything is that what 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.430
 we do what we have to do is 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.430
 dry it well first 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:38.569
 kitchen paper 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.569
 first of all the water that is well dried 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.890
 ah 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.530
 and once dry it is dry 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.300
 we make sure it's okay that it's not 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.819
 have no water to be well 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.890
 conserved 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.890
 that we put on we put oil 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.860
 olive oil a little bit of oil 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.860
 olive 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.480
 Y 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.670
 We distribute them for a whole paella 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.040
 oil does is prevent 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.900
 the air is in contact with the steel 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.939
 and take care of us now keep 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.939
 exactly the same for the next 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.629
 we see how it is perfectly oiled 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.650
 with good olive oil so that the 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.980
 next time we're going to use it good 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.810
 the low we have to wash a little because 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.930
 there will be as surely in dust as of 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.110
 dirt but we will see them in perfect 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.110
 state 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.390
 to this the paella ready to save and 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.930
 forever thing 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.930
 one
