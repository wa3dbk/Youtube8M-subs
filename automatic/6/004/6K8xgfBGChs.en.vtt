00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.750

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.449
 Finally, a challenge of things 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.730

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.039

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.350

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.120
 kilometers of 13 just start over there 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.520
 by the doubts that it is seen that it is to kill and 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.590
 then get to that until the 35 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.530
