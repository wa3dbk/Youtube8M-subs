00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
you already dealt on the target so you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.600 
you already dealt on the target so you
probably<00:01:35.430> want<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.759> use<00:01:36.170> this<00:01:37.170> early<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.920> so

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
probably want to use this early on so

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.149 
probably want to use this early on so
you<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.790> build<00:01:39.509> up<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:40.439> damaged<00:01:40.829> stack

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
you can build up that that damaged stack

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.580 
you can build up that that damaged stack
and<00:01:41.430> then<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.329> explode<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> enemy<00:01:43.380> to

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
and then have it explode on the enemy to

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.920 
and then have it explode on the enemy to
either<00:01:43.740> finish<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.369> or<00:01:44.549> drop<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.659> enemy

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
either finish it or drop the enemy

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.740 
either finish it or drop the enemy
really<00:01:46.259> low<00:01:46.850> once<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.060> use<00:01:48.299> your<00:01:48.450> ultimate

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
really low once you use your ultimate

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.310 
really low once you use your ultimate
you<00:01:49.710> leave<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.149> living<00:01:51.149> shadow<00:01:51.540> behind<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.229> you

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
you leave a living shadow behind so you

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.710 
you leave a living shadow behind so you
can<00:01:52.560> actually<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:53.579> additional<00:01:54.270> burst<00:01:54.479> on

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
can actually have additional burst on

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.719 
can actually have additional burst on
top<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.590> pretty<00:01:55.740> much<00:01:55.829> grants<00:01:56.640> you

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
top of it so it pretty much grants you

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.700 
top of it so it pretty much grants you
another<00:01:57.000> living<00:01:57.270> shadow<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.439> use<00:01:58.590> your

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
another living shadow so if you use your

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.190 
another living shadow so if you use your
living<00:01:58.979> shadow<00:01:59.189> at<00:01:59.399> first<00:01:59.759> Dylan<00:02:00.570> your<00:02:00.750> damage

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
the top lane as well but this is just

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.920 
the top lane as well but this is just
all<00:02:46.260> what<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.560> think<00:02:46.980> um<00:02:47.580> my<00:02:48.120> opinion<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:48.780> think

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
all what I think um my opinion I think

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.260 
all what I think um my opinion I think
is<00:02:49.230> gonna<00:02:49.350> be<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.560> great<00:02:49.800> farmer<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.430> think<00:02:51.180> he

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
is gonna be a great farmer I think he

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.240 
is gonna be a great farmer I think he
can<00:02:51.420> harass<00:02:51.690> with<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.110> best<00:02:52.320> of<00:02:52.500> them<00:02:52.530> but<00:02:52.830> we

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
can harass with the best of them but we

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.400 
can harass with the best of them but we
will<00:02:53.400> find<00:02:53.430> out<00:02:53.850> when<00:02:54.060> he<00:02:54.240> goes<00:02:54.450> live<00:02:54.780> until

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
will find out when he goes live until

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.840 
will find out when he goes live until
