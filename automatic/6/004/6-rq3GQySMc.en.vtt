00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
surprisingly well so you can see you

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.610 
surprisingly well so you can see you
don't<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.629> put<00:00:54.719> too<00:00:54.870> much<00:00:54.989> pressure<00:00:55.199> and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
don't have to put too much pressure and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.260 
don't have to put too much pressure and
it<00:00:56.190> works<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.610> most<00:00:56.969> angles<00:00:57.449> as<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.140> see

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
it works in most angles as you can see

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.860 
it works in most angles as you can see
except<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.629> for<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.260> hold<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.559> too<00:01:01.800> um

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
except in that for if you hold it too um

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.539 
except in that for if you hold it too um
and<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.960> explain<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.350> at<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.559> very<00:01:04.769> low<00:01:05.010> angle<00:01:05.430> it

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
and I explain it at a very low angle it

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.760 
and I explain it at a very low angle it
does<00:01:05.729> not<00:01:05.880> work<00:01:06.090> too<00:01:06.420> well<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.500> know<00:01:07.590> if

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
does not work too well but you know if

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.510 
does not work too well but you know if
this<00:01:08.520> rubber<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.180> touching<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.189> screen<00:01:11.189> it

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
this rubber is touching the screen it

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.300 
this rubber is touching the screen it
will<00:01:12.060> definitely<00:01:12.689> work<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.280> really

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
will definitely work so that is really

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.640 
will definitely work so that is really
nice<00:01:14.760> thing<00:01:15.119> about<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.630> pen<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.259> if<00:01:16.560> you
