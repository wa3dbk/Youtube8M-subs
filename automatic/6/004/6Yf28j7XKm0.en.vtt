00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
it in the comments but here they've

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.530 
it in the comments but here they've
added<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.960> new<00:01:31.110> file<00:01:31.380> manager<00:01:31.860> app<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.479> you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
added a new file manager app so you

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.109 
added a new file manager app so you
don't<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.079> go<00:01:34.200> through<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.680> install

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
don't have to go through and install

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.240 
don't have to go through and install
something<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.240> maybe<00:01:36.390> astro<00:01:37.110> file<00:01:37.740> manager

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
something like maybe astro file manager

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.270 
something like maybe astro file manager
or<00:01:38.630> be<00:01:39.630> leave<00:01:39.780> ES<00:01:40.200> file<00:01:40.470> manager<00:01:40.920> things<00:01:41.130> like

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
or be leave ES file manager things like

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.690 
or be leave ES file manager things like
that

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
that

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.999 
that
right<00:01:42.540> here<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.470> app<00:01:43.649> allows<00:01:43.890> you

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
right here we have this app allows you

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.380 
right here we have this app allows you
explore<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> file<00:01:44.610> system<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.270> do

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
explore the file system and do

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.819 
explore the file system and do
operations<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:45.990> could<00:01:46.140> break<00:01:46.350> your<00:01:46.500> device

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
operations that could break your device

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.639 
operations that could break your device
so<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.399> believe<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.270> comes<00:01:48.570> with<00:01:48.810> abilities

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
so I believe this comes with abilities

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.149 
so I believe this comes with abilities
to<00:01:49.920> change<00:01:50.250> not<00:01:50.909> only<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.149> SD<00:01:51.979> possibly<00:01:52.979> more

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
to change not only the SD possibly more

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.670 
to change not only the SD possibly more
than<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.399> SD<00:01:53.729> card<00:01:53.970> though<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.840> haven't<00:01:55.350> used

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
than the SD card though I haven't used

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.620 
than the SD card though I haven't used

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
would be safe to say you can use this

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.140 
would be safe to say you can use this
you<00:03:55.570> know<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:55.780> stop<00:03:56.079> install<00:03:56.500> your<00:03:56.650> apks<00:03:57.160> maybe

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
you know to stop install your apks maybe

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.580 
you know to stop install your apks maybe
you'll<00:03:58.329> want<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.510> take<00:03:58.660> a<00:03:58.690> look<00:03:58.900> at<00:03:59.079> your<00:03:59.320> roms

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
you'll want to take a look at your roms

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.310 
you'll want to take a look at your roms
that<00:03:59.859> you<00:03:59.950> have<00:04:00.100> installed<00:04:00.519> if<00:04:01.359> you<00:04:01.930> download
