00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
stoop and you'd go inside the house and

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.059 
stoop and you'd go inside the house and
you<00:01:08.600> know<00:01:08.689> check<00:01:08.840> it<00:01:08.990> out<00:01:09.139> unfortunately<00:01:09.740> the

00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:10.069 
you know check it out unfortunately the

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.370 
you know check it out unfortunately the
the<00:01:10.100> doors<00:01:10.670> are<00:01:10.880> green<00:01:11.149> but<00:01:11.509> there<00:01:12.049> aren't<00:01:12.259> any

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
the doors are green but there aren't any

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.050 
the doors are green but there aren't any
green<00:01:12.740> doors<00:01:13.009> yet<00:01:13.159> so<00:01:13.280> that's<00:01:13.459> one<00:01:13.670> two<00:01:13.819> three

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
green doors yet so that's one two three

green doors yet so that's one two three
Sesame<00:01:14.420> Street<00:01:14.689> probably<00:01:15.469> add<00:01:15.590> some<00:01:15.619> stuff

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
Sesame Street probably add some stuff

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.160 
Sesame Street probably add some stuff
here<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.490> this<00:01:16.819> is<00:01:17.029> I<00:01:17.389> think<00:01:17.749> they<00:01:17.840> call<00:01:18.020> it

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
here and this is I think they call it

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.629 
here and this is I think they call it
the<00:01:18.350> Arbor<00:01:18.770> II<00:01:18.799> this<00:01:19.009> is<00:01:19.100> basically<00:01:19.429> that

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:19.639 
the Arbor II this is basically that

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:21.910 
the Arbor II this is basically that
corner<00:01:20.209> store<00:01:20.990> unfortunately<00:01:21.560> you<00:01:21.619> can't<00:01:21.829> do

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
corner store unfortunately you can't do

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.039 
corner store unfortunately you can't do
angles<00:01:22.310> very<00:01:22.549> well<00:01:22.789> with<00:01:23.389> buildings<00:01:23.840> and

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
angles very well with buildings and

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.099 
angles very well with buildings and
Minecraft<00:01:24.829> so<00:01:25.069> I<00:01:25.539> just<00:01:26.539> I<00:01:26.600> just<00:01:26.630> put<00:01:26.899> it<00:01:26.990> at<00:01:27.079> a

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109 
Minecraft so I just I just put it at a

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:29.529 
Minecraft so I just I just put it at a
at<00:01:27.439> sort<00:01:27.920> of<00:01:27.979> a<00:01:28.100> straight<00:01:28.850> angle<00:01:28.999> here<00:01:29.389> and

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
at sort of a straight angle here and

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.599 
at sort of a straight angle here and
then<00:01:29.659> it<00:01:29.779> turns<00:01:29.959> right<00:01:30.319> there<00:01:31.189> is<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.340> fence

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
then it turns right there is a fence

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.359 
then it turns right there is a fence
over<00:01:31.909> there<00:01:32.029> though<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:32.509> that<00:01:33.049> will<00:01:33.170> block<00:01:33.409> you

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
over there though so that will block you

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:35.949 
over there though so that will block you
know<00:01:34.459> people<00:01:34.759> from<00:01:34.819> walking<00:01:35.209> way<00:01:35.329> over<00:01:35.719> here

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:35.959 
know people from walking way over here

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.230 
know people from walking way over here
but<00:01:36.409> I<00:01:36.439> plan<00:01:36.679> on<00:01:36.709> adding<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:37.130> forest<00:01:37.639> and<00:01:37.909> in

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
but I plan on adding a forest and in

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.699 
but I plan on adding a forest and in
fact<00:01:38.420> it's<00:01:38.569> gonna<00:01:38.689> stretch<00:01:38.959> up<00:01:39.139> a<00:01:39.259> little<00:01:39.499> bit

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:39.709 
fact it's gonna stretch up a little bit

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:41.859 
fact it's gonna stretch up a little bit
further<00:01:39.950> up<00:01:40.039> there<00:01:40.399> so<00:01:40.759> this<00:01:41.450> is<00:01:41.599> pretty<00:01:41.779> much

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
further up there so this is pretty much

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.819 
further up there so this is pretty much
the<00:01:42.909> Arbor<00:01:43.939> well<00:01:44.359> this<00:01:44.599> is<00:01:44.719> a<00:01:44.749> garage<00:01:45.439> I<00:01:45.770> know

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
the Arbor well this is a garage I know

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:47.469 
the Arbor well this is a garage I know
there<00:01:46.189> was<00:01:46.369> it<00:01:46.609> was<00:01:46.700> actually<00:01:47.060> turning<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.450> I

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
there was it was actually turning to I

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.449 
there was it was actually turning to I
think<00:01:47.899> it<00:01:48.109> was<00:01:48.139> trying<00:01:48.289> to<00:01:48.409> like<00:01:48.529> a<00:01:48.560> a<00:01:48.950> vet

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
think it was trying to like a a vet

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.819 
think it was trying to like a a vet
place<00:01:49.939> or<00:01:50.179> something<00:01:50.450> like<00:01:50.539> that<00:01:50.779> but<00:01:51.469> I<00:01:51.529> want

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
place or something like that but I want

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.019 
place or something like that but I want
to<00:01:51.919> keep<00:01:52.009> it<00:01:52.130> as<00:01:52.219> a<00:01:52.249> garage<00:01:52.429> I<00:01:52.609> think<00:01:52.819> that'll

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:53.029 
to keep it as a garage I think that'll

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:54.909 
to keep it as a garage I think that'll
be<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.119> lot<00:01:53.270> more<00:01:53.479> fun<00:01:53.749> so<00:01:54.079> there's<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:54.619> garage
