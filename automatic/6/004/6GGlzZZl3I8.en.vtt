00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
is that I've been chaining three for a

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.800 
is that I've been chaining three for a
bigger<00:03:39.230> loop<00:03:39.650> e'er<00:03:40.060> maybe<00:03:41.060> even<00:03:41.390> frillier

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
bigger loop e'er maybe even frillier

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.630 
bigger loop e'er maybe even frillier
look<00:03:43.060> you<00:03:44.060> can<00:03:44.209> chain<00:03:44.450> five<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:45.550> then<00:03:46.550> the

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
look you can chain five and then the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:54.900 
look you can chain five and then the
rest<00:03:46.819> of<00:03:46.940> it<00:03:47.060> is<00:03:47.239> just<00:03:47.270> the<00:03:47.750> same

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.150 

you<00:03:55.780> can<00:03:55.900> see<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.140> difference<00:03:56.440> between<00:03:56.620> this

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
you can see the difference between this

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.950 
you can see the difference between this
is<00:03:57.280> all<00:03:57.400> very<00:03:57.580> bulky<00:03:57.880> of<00:03:58.090> course<00:03:58.300> you<00:03:58.690> can<00:03:58.840> see

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
is all very bulky of course you can see

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.630 
is all very bulky of course you can see
the<00:03:59.020> difference<00:03:59.290> between<00:03:59.440> chain<00:03:59.860> 3<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:00.400> chain

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
the difference between chain 3 and chain

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.540 
the difference between chain 3 and chain
5<00:04:00.910> you<00:04:01.150> have<00:04:01.240> a<00:04:01.300> much<00:04:01.510> bigger<00:04:01.750> picot<00:04:02.470> edge<00:04:03.390> now

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
5 you have a much bigger picot edge now

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.300 
5 you have a much bigger picot edge now
in<00:04:06.550> this<00:04:06.760> example<00:04:06.940> I<00:04:07.510> am<00:04:07.630> using<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:09.070> same

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
in this example I am using the same

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.400 
in this example I am using the same
weight<00:04:09.580> of<00:04:09.760> yarn<00:04:09.970> in<00:04:10.330> the<00:04:10.390> knitted<00:04:10.840> piece<00:04:11.110> and

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
weight of yarn in the knitted piece and

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.430 
weight of yarn in the knitted piece and
in<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.280> edging<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:12.910> I'm<00:04:13.540> using<00:04:13.780> a<00:04:13.960> crochet

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
in the edging and I'm using a crochet

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.949 
in the edging and I'm using a crochet
hook<00:04:14.470> that<00:04:14.950> is<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:15.280> same<00:04:15.520> size<00:04:15.820> as<00:04:16.269> the

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
hook that is the same size as the

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.170 
hook that is the same size as the
knitting<00:04:17.260> needle<00:04:17.560> I<00:04:17.650> use<00:04:17.680> to<00:04:18.130> knit<00:04:18.310> this<00:04:18.489> so

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
knitting needle I use to knit this so

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.030 
knitting needle I use to knit this so
the<00:04:19.299> gauge<00:04:19.510> works<00:04:19.959> out<00:04:20.230> well<00:04:20.530> for<00:04:20.560> this

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
the gauge works out well for this

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.160 
the gauge works out well for this
combination<00:04:21.280> if<00:04:21.940> you're<00:04:22.480> going<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.780> use<00:04:22.960> a

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
combination if you're going to use a

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.260 
combination if you're going to use a
lighter<00:04:23.470> yarn<00:04:23.860> or<00:04:24.130> a<00:04:24.160> heavier<00:04:24.550> yarn<00:04:24.880> or<00:04:25.240> a

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
lighter yarn or a heavier yarn or a

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.480 
lighter yarn or a heavier yarn or a
different<00:04:25.780> size<00:04:25.930> crochet<00:04:26.200> hook<00:04:26.530> your<00:04:27.220> gauge

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
different size crochet hook your gauge

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.310 
different size crochet hook your gauge
might<00:04:27.790> not<00:04:27.970> work<00:04:28.120> out<00:04:28.270> like<00:04:28.480> this<00:04:28.690> but<00:04:28.900> it's<00:04:29.080> so

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
might not work out like this but it's so

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.920 
might not work out like this but it's so
easy<00:04:29.620> to<00:04:29.800> figure<00:04:29.980> out<00:04:30.160> all<00:04:30.970> you<00:04:31.240> have<00:04:31.450> to<00:04:31.540> do<00:04:31.690> is

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
easy to figure out all you have to do is

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.140 
easy to figure out all you have to do is
work<00:04:32.230> up<00:04:32.440> a<00:04:32.560> few<00:04:32.770> stitches<00:04:33.040> like<00:04:33.340> I<00:04:33.520> have<00:04:33.760> here

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
work up a few stitches like I have here

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.420 
work up a few stitches like I have here
and<00:04:34.300> if<00:04:34.660> you<00:04:34.810> find<00:04:35.110> that<00:04:35.290> your<00:04:35.500> knitted<00:04:36.220> work

is bunching you're probably gonna need

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.920 
is bunching you're probably gonna need
to<00:04:38.770> spread<00:04:39.100> out<00:04:39.160> your<00:04:39.610> edging<00:04:40.150> a<00:04:40.210> bit<00:04:40.390> more<00:04:40.600> or

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
to spread out your edging a bit more or

to spread out your edging a bit more or

if you find that this is bunching you're

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.600 
if you find that this is bunching you're
going<00:04:43.630> well<00:04:44.320> I<00:04:44.560> just<00:04:44.800> get<00:04:45.010> that<00:04:45.130> backwards

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
if the knitted work is bunching you want

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.950 
if the knitted work is bunching you want

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
more and if this is bunching you want to

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.920 
more and if this is bunching you want to

spread their edging out a bit more
regardless<00:04:53.970> it's<00:04:54.970> so<00:04:55.270> easy<00:04:55.540> to<00:04:55.690> just<00:04:55.870> work<00:04:56.200> up

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
regardless it's so easy to just work up

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.380 
regardless it's so easy to just work up
a<00:04:56.470> little<00:04:56.620> bit<00:04:56.830> see<00:04:57.400> if<00:04:57.430> it's<00:04:57.640> lying<00:04:57.850> flat<00:04:57.940> if

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
a little bit see if it's lying flat if

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.840 
a little bit see if it's lying flat if
it's<00:04:58.600> not<00:04:58.780> look<00:04:59.650> at<00:04:59.770> how<00:04:59.860> easy<00:05:00.070> it<00:05:00.280> is<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:00.550> undo

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
it's not look at how easy it is to undo

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.450 
it's not look at how easy it is to undo
it<00:05:00.880> just<00:05:01.630> recover<00:05:01.990> one<00:05:02.290> loop<00:05:02.560> and<00:05:02.860> then

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
it just recover one loop and then

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.400 
it just recover one loop and then
instead<00:05:03.790> of<00:05:03.850> skipping<00:05:04.300> one<00:05:04.510> you<00:05:05.050> might<00:05:05.170> find

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
instead of skipping one you might find

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.460 
instead of skipping one you might find
it's<00:05:05.620> necessary<00:05:06.160> to<00:05:06.250> skip<00:05:06.760> two<00:05:07.120> to<00:05:07.990> spread<00:05:08.290> out

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
it's necessary to skip two to spread out

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.490 
it's necessary to skip two to spread out
the<00:05:08.800> edging<00:05:09.430> a<00:05:09.520> little<00:05:09.730> bit<00:05:09.880> etc<00:05:10.690> and<00:05:10.870> then

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
the edging a little bit etc and then

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.970 
the edging a little bit etc and then
also<00:05:12.690> these<00:05:13.690> crocheted<00:05:14.110> edgings<00:05:14.260> are<00:05:14.590> so<00:05:14.770> easy

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
also these crocheted edgings are so easy

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.620 
also these crocheted edgings are so easy
and<00:05:15.220> forgiving<00:05:15.610> with<00:05:15.730> just<00:05:16.000> one<00:05:16.180> loop<00:05:16.390> like

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
and forgiving with just one loop like

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.730 
and forgiving with just one loop like
that<00:05:16.890> because<00:05:17.890> you<00:05:18.070> can<00:05:19.140> you<00:05:20.140> might<00:05:20.320> find<00:05:20.530> that

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
that because you can you might find that

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.350 
that because you can you might find that
the<00:05:20.980> number<00:05:21.280> of<00:05:21.400> stitches<00:05:21.580> you<00:05:21.760> have<00:05:22.030> in<00:05:22.270> your

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
the number of stitches you have in your

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.630 
the number of stitches you have in your
knitted<00:05:22.690> work<00:05:22.870> doesn't<00:05:23.230> match<00:05:23.470> up<00:05:23.500> to<00:05:23.770> the

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
knitted work doesn't match up to the

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.090 
knitted work doesn't match up to the
multiple<00:05:25.210> of<00:05:25.390> the<00:05:25.690> edging<00:05:26.169> and<00:05:26.350> really<00:05:26.950> all

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
multiple of the edging and really all

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.830 
multiple of the edging and really all
that<00:05:27.310> takes<00:05:27.580> is<00:05:27.730> a<00:05:27.790> little<00:05:27.880> bit<00:05:28.240> of<00:05:28.330> fudging<00:05:28.660> to

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
that takes is a little bit of fudging to

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.170 
that takes is a little bit of fudging to
skip<00:05:29.110> an<00:05:29.260> extra<00:05:29.560> stitch<00:05:30.370> or<00:05:30.550> two<00:05:30.580> somewhere

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
skip an extra stitch or two somewhere

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.450 
skip an extra stitch or two somewhere
along<00:05:31.510> the<00:05:31.780> edge<00:05:31.900> to<00:05:32.710> get<00:05:32.860> it<00:05:32.980> so<00:05:33.220> that<00:05:33.250> it

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
along the edge to get it so that it

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.700 
along the edge to get it so that it
works<00:05:34.120> out<00:05:34.330> and<00:05:34.750> it<00:05:34.990> looks<00:05:35.169> even<00:05:35.290> when<00:05:35.590> it's

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
works out and it looks even when it's

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.650 
works out and it looks even when it's
done<00:05:35.890> now<00:05:36.460> no<00:05:36.730> one<00:05:36.880> else<00:05:37.030> in<00:05:37.180> the<00:05:37.270> world<00:05:37.450> would

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
done now no one else in the world would

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.480 
done now no one else in the world would
probably<00:05:37.780> notice<00:05:38.320> this<00:05:38.530> but<00:05:39.010> I<00:05:39.040> happen<00:05:39.460> to

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
probably notice this but I happen to

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.220 
probably notice this but I happen to
know<00:05:39.790> that<00:05:40.000> I<00:05:40.210> fudged<00:05:40.540> one<00:05:40.780> right<00:05:40.960> here<00:05:41.200> I

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 
know that I fudged one right here I

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.490 
know that I fudged one right here I
worked<00:05:41.590> an<00:05:41.740> extra<00:05:42.220> stitch<00:05:42.520> in<00:05:42.760> right<00:05:43.090> here<00:05:43.540> to

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
worked an extra stitch in right here to

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.620 
worked an extra stitch in right here to
make<00:05:44.650> it<00:05:44.800> so<00:05:44.830> that<00:05:45.010> my<00:05:45.460> count<00:05:45.910> was<00:05:46.060> right<00:05:46.270> going

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
make it so that my count was right going

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.500 
make it so that my count was right going
all<00:05:46.750> the<00:05:46.870> way<00:05:46.900> around<00:05:47.580> and<00:05:48.580> this<00:05:49.090> is<00:05:49.150> the<00:05:49.270> back

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
all the way around and this is the back

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.480 
all the way around and this is the back
of<00:05:49.690> the<00:05:49.750> picot<00:05:50.080> stitch<00:05:50.140> it's<00:05:50.890> also<00:05:51.220> very

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
of the picot stitch it's also very

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.920 
of the picot stitch it's also very
pretty<00:05:51.730> actually<00:05:52.060> kind<00:05:52.510> of<00:05:52.570> more<00:05:52.720> rugged

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
pretty actually kind of more rugged

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.860 
pretty actually kind of more rugged
looking<00:05:56.040> and<00:05:57.040> that's<00:05:57.460> it<00:05:57.669> a<00:05:57.760> simple<00:05:58.450> picot

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
looking and that's it a simple picot

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.719 
looking and that's it a simple picot
edging

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729

I'm working on next week's video right

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.959 
I'm working on next week's video right
now<00:06:05.979> and<00:06:06.189> you're<00:06:06.279> not<00:06:06.309> going<00:06:06.580> to<00:06:06.639> want<00:06:06.759> to<00:06:06.819> miss

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:06.969 
now and you're not going to want to miss

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:08.939 
now and you're not going to want to miss
it<00:06:07.180> you<00:06:07.629> should<00:06:07.809> probably<00:06:08.020> subscribe<00:06:08.349> to<00:06:08.800> make

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
it you should probably subscribe to make
