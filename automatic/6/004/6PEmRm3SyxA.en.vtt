00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the spinning mirrors basically there's

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.180 
the spinning mirrors basically there's
one<00:00:33.630> spinning<00:00:33.989> there<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.559> you're<00:00:34.710> looking<00:00:34.860> at

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
one spinning there and you're looking at

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.340 
one spinning there and you're looking at
it<00:00:35.400> and<00:00:35.640> spinning<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.510> double<00:00:36.900> sided<00:00:37.080> and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
it and spinning it's double sided and

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.200 
it and spinning it's double sided and
content<00:00:37.830> beer<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.489> way<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.700> get<00:00:38.910> twice<00:00:39.150> the

content beer that way you get twice the
dream<00:00:39.629> speech<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.800> spinning<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.610> get

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
dream speech and spinning so you get

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.479 
dream speech and spinning so you get
about<00:00:42.000> 30<00:00:42.239> frames<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.780> second<00:00:43.199> and<00:00:43.680> then<00:00:44.309> it

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
about 30 frames a second and then it

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.060 
about 30 frames a second and then it
makes<00:00:47.540> you<00:00:48.540> can<00:00:48.750> go<00:00:48.870> around<00:00:49.019> my<00:00:49.350> face<00:00:49.559> looks

the diagraph yeah it's working out

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.850 
the diagraph yeah it's working out
trying<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.539> lighten<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.899> hardware<00:01:48.289> I<00:01:48.530> mean

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
trying to lighten the hardware I mean

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.920 
trying to lighten the hardware I mean
you<00:01:49.280> need<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.550> 3d<00:01:50.000> display<00:01:50.390> like<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:50.780> one

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
you need a 3d display like the one

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.719 
you need a 3d display like the one
you're<00:01:51.050> staying<00:01:51.320> at<00:01:51.500> right<00:01:51.710> now<00:01:51.740> nor<00:01:52.160> diffuse

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
right and right now is this is quite

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.580 
right and right now is this is quite
good<00:01:55.820> enough<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.330> get<00:01:56.450> into<00:01:56.509> like<00:01:56.930> partial

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
good enough to get into like partial

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.290 
good enough to get into like partial
homes<00:01:57.830> or<00:01:58.070> commercial<00:01:58.460> businesses

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
so I mean by the way we'll get there

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.300 
so I mean by the way we'll get there
eventually<00:02:02.440> he'll<00:02:03.440> be<00:02:03.590> shittin<00:02:03.950> present

televisions<00:02:19.610> are<00:02:19.910> quite<00:02:20.420> fitting<00:02:20.990> I<00:02:21.200> mean<00:02:21.470> if

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
televisions are quite fitting I mean if

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.710 
televisions are quite fitting I mean if
you<00:02:21.770> move<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.880> can't<00:02:23.120> see<00:02:23.360> like<00:02:23.570> the

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
you move that you can't see like the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.300 
you move that you can't see like the
left<00:02:23.960> side<00:02:24.140> of<00:02:24.170> my<00:02:24.350> face<00:02:24.500> just<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.860> right<00:02:25.040> like

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
left side of my face just the right like

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.510 
left side of my face just the right like
the<00:02:25.460> person<00:02:25.820> to<00:02:25.970> your<00:02:26.000> right<00:02:26.150> now<00:02:26.980> my<00:02:27.980> face<00:02:28.220> I

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
the person to your right now my face I

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:37.120 
the person to your right now my face I
had<00:02:29.320> yeah<00:02:34.840> second<00:02:35.840> differences<00:02:36.560> some<00:02:36.830> like

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
had yeah second differences some like

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.780 
had yeah second differences some like
some<00:02:37.490> methods<00:02:37.850> of<00:02:37.970> 3d<00:02:38.240> their<00:02:39.310> lasers<00:02:40.310> bouncing

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
some methods of 3d their lasers bouncing

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.300 
some methods of 3d their lasers bouncing
into<00:02:40.940> fog<00:02:41.270> there's<00:02:41.840> some<00:02:42.500> kind<00:02:42.680> of<00:02:42.710> medium<00:02:43.130> in

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
into fog there's some kind of medium in

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.590 
into fog there's some kind of medium in
the<00:02:43.340> middle<00:02:43.640> in<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:43.910> case<00:02:44.120> it's<00:02:44.330> just<00:02:44.510> a

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
the middle in this case it's just a

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.300 
the middle in this case it's just a
spinning<00:02:44.990> near<00:02:45.230> there's<00:02:45.470> never<00:02:45.710> just<00:02:45.800> empty

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
spinning near there's never just empty

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.120 
spinning near there's never just empty
space<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:47.480> we're<00:02:47.660> trying<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:48.020> narrow<00:02:48.500> that

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
space so we're trying to narrow that

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.950 
space so we're trying to narrow that
