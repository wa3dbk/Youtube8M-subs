00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
circuits that await you inside you

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.470 
circuits that await you inside you
should<00:00:34.649> store<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.280> somewhere<00:00:35.610> safe<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:36.360> can

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
should store this somewhere safe you can

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.030 
should store this somewhere safe you can
always<00:00:36.630> put<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:36.930> back<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.500> play<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.890> later

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
always put it back in and play it later

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.160 
always put it back in and play it later
now<00:00:38.850> let's<00:00:38.879> move<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.629> external<00:00:40.050> hard

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
now let's move on to the external hard

now let's move on to the external hard
drive<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:41.100> simple<00:00:41.520> enclosure<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.090> had<00:00:42.360> only

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
drive this simple enclosure I had only

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.389 
drive this simple enclosure I had only
needed<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.140> couple<00:00:43.170> screws<00:00:43.770> removed<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.250> get

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
needed a couple screws removed to get

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.119 
needed a couple screws removed to get
inside<00:00:44.730> once<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.899> was<00:00:46.079> done<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.500> reveal<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
inside once that was done we reveal the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.610 
inside once that was done we reveal the
internals<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.570> simple<00:00:48.930> drive<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
internals just a simple drive and a

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.770 
internals just a simple drive and a
small<00:00:49.980> connector<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:51.329> should<00:00:51.510> fit<00:00:51.750> nicely

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
small connector this should fit nicely

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.470 
small connector this should fit nicely
inside<00:00:52.469> an<00:00:52.649> NES<00:00:52.980> cartridge<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.730> place<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
inside an NES cartridge I place the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.270 
inside an NES cartridge I place the
components<00:00:54.989> inside<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.530> get<00:00:55.649> an<00:00:55.739> idea<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.039> how

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
components inside to get an idea of how

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.459 
components inside to get an idea of how
to<00:00:56.309> best<00:00:56.670> fit<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.059> all<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> parts<00:00:57.719> at<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
to best fit in all the parts at the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.860 
to best fit in all the parts at the
moment<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.920> can't<00:00:59.309> quite<00:00:59.520> close<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> few

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
moment I can't quite close it so a few

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.630 
moment I can't quite close it so a few
unneeded<00:01:01.140> plastic<00:01:01.800> pieces<00:01:02.010> will<00:01:02.309> need<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.520> be

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
unneeded plastic pieces will need to be

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.969 
unneeded plastic pieces will need to be
cut<00:01:02.879> out<00:01:02.940> time<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.750> bust<00:01:03.960> out<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.229> rotary<00:01:04.710> tool

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
cut out time to bust out the rotary tool

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.039 
cut out time to bust out the rotary tool
with<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> grinder<00:01:05.700> attachment<00:01:05.840> let's<00:01:06.840> go<00:01:06.990> to

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
with a grinder attachment let's go to

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.140 
with a grinder attachment let's go to
work<00:01:07.290> there<00:01:08.250> were<00:01:08.340> only<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.580> couple<00:01:08.640> large

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
work there were only a couple large

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.850 
work there were only a couple large
pieces<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.840> needed<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.140> be<00:01:10.290> removed<00:01:10.619> and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
pieces that needed to be removed and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.850 
pieces that needed to be removed and
smoothed<00:01:11.580> down<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.210> suggest<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.320> recheck

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
smoothed down I suggest that you recheck

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.320 
smoothed down I suggest that you recheck
the<00:01:14.040> fitting<00:01:14.369> every<00:01:14.640> time<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.970> remove<00:01:15.240> a

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
the fitting every time you remove a

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.420 
the fitting every time you remove a
piece<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:16.500> need<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.740> do<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> little<00:01:17.189> light

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
piece I just need to do a little light

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.370 
piece I just need to do a little light
cleanup<00:01:17.880> work<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.330> then<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.960> moment<00:01:19.320> of

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
cleanup work and then the moment of
