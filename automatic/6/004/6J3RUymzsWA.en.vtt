00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
trip mines from underneath kind of like

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.200 
trip mines from underneath kind of like
mariel<00:00:43.890> blocks<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.399> they<00:00:44.460> will<00:00:44.610> explode

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
mariel blocks and they will explode

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.660 
mariel blocks and they will explode
causing<00:00:45.600> anything<00:00:45.989> around<00:00:46.500> them<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.950> die<00:00:47.340> and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
causing anything around them to die and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.310 
causing anything around them to die and
that<00:00:48.120> goes<00:00:48.300> for<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.480> ghost<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.870> if<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.170> are

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
that goes for the ghost so if you are

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.290 
that goes for the ghost so if you are
near<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> exploding<00:00:50.399> trip<00:00:50.670> mine<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> ghost

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
near a exploding trip mine as a ghost

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.060 
near a exploding trip mine as a ghost
you<00:00:51.899> will<00:00:52.020> blow<00:00:52.170> up<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.680> will<00:00:52.770> become<00:00:53.039> a

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
you will blow up and you will become a

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.830 
you will blow up and you will become a
flood<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> objective<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> ghost<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.629> to

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
flood so the objective as a ghost is to

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.360 
flood so the objective as a ghost is to
just<00:00:55.110> survive<00:00:55.410> as<00:00:55.680> long<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:55.890> possible<00:00:56.160> so

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
just survive as long as possible so

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.500 
just survive as long as possible so
we're<00:00:56.520> gonna<00:00:56.610> show<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.820> some<00:00:57.030> gameplay<00:00:57.149> here

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
we're gonna show you some gameplay here

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.540 
we're gonna show you some gameplay here
you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.140> see<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.590> starts<00:00:58.949> with<00:00:59.129> just<00:00:59.370> one

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
you can see that it starts with just one

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.490 
you can see that it starts with just one
flood<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.629> eventually<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.109> number<00:01:01.320> will

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
flood and eventually that number will

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.170 
flood and eventually that number will
grow<00:01:01.710> by<00:01:01.980> quite<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> bit<00:01:02.370> Abel<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.879> don't<00:01:03.120> know

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
grow by quite a bit Abel I don't know

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.850 
grow by quite a bit Abel I don't know
jump<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.719> 15<00:01:04.140> players<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.559> guess<00:01:04.710> if

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
jump up like 15 players I guess if

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.679 
jump up like 15 players I guess if
you're<00:01:04.949> playing<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.220> 16<00:01:05.519> or<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
you're playing with 16 or so but the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.420 
you're playing with 16 or so but the
objective<00:01:06.990> again<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.590> stay<00:01:07.799> alive<00:01:07.979> as

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
objective again is just to stay alive as

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.670 
objective again is just to stay alive as
a<00:01:08.460> ghost<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:09.060> long<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.390> possible<00:01:09.840> there's

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
a ghost for as long as possible there's

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
a ghost for as long as possible there's
a<00:01:10.710> couple<00:01:10.860> things<00:01:11.070> you're<00:01:11.130> gonna<00:01:11.250> watch<00:01:11.520> out

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
a couple things you're gonna watch out

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.010 
a couple things you're gonna watch out
for<00:01:11.850> obviously<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> tripmines<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:12.900> at<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
for obviously the tripmines but at the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
for obviously the tripmines but at the
same<00:01:13.140> time<00:01:13.290> you're<00:01:13.409> gonna<00:01:13.500> want<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.740> watch<00:01:13.860> out

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
same time you're gonna want to watch out

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.710 
same time you're gonna want to watch out
for<00:01:14.189> your<00:01:14.280> teammates<00:01:14.729> because<00:01:15.000> your

for your teammates because your

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.060 
for your teammates because your

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
way you can actually roll in the ghost

because of the trait zone or the gravity
zone<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.930> roll<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.439> wrong<00:01:22.619> way<00:01:22.860> you

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
zone and if you roll the wrong way you

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.469 
zone and if you roll the wrong way you
can<00:01:23.189> actually<00:01:23.340> get<00:01:23.549> infected<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:24.090> you'll<00:01:24.240> fall

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
can actually get infected as you'll fall

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.330 
can actually get infected as you'll fall
through<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> barrier<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.680> magic<00:01:26.159> wizard

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
through the barrier the magic wizard

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.490 
through the barrier the magic wizard
barrier<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.360> will<00:01:27.479> die<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.080> you'll

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
barrier and you will die and you'll

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.990 
barrier and you will die and you'll
become<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.770> flood<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.490> not<00:01:29.610> fun<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.850> do

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
become a flood so it's not fun to do

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.039 
become a flood so it's not fun to do
that<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.270> want<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.509> watch<00:01:30.600> out<00:01:30.840> for<00:01:30.869> your

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
that so you want to watch out for your

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.310 
that so you want to watch out for your
teammates<00:01:31.380> as<00:01:31.500> well<00:01:31.710> as<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.549> flood<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.720> play

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
teammates as well as the flood so play

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.420 
teammates as well as the flood so play
with<00:01:34.350> smart<00:01:34.740> teammates<00:01:35.040> maybe<00:01:35.220> pick<00:01:35.400> a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
with smart teammates maybe pick a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.950 
with smart teammates maybe pick a
partner<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.880> help<00:01:36.000> defend<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.570> one<00:01:36.689> another

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
partner to help defend the one another

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.390 
partner to help defend the one another
so<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.439> kind<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.650> block<00:01:37.890> other<00:01:38.130> ghosts

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
so you can kind of block other ghosts

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.590 
so you can kind of block other ghosts
from<00:01:38.520> smashing<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.000> Gigli<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.450> see

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
from smashing and Gigli you can see

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.109 
from smashing and Gigli you can see
these<00:01:39.750> buffoons<00:01:40.439> or<00:01:41.189> smashing<00:01:41.729> all<00:01:41.820> over<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
these buffoons or smashing all over the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.190 
these buffoons or smashing all over the
place<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.450> hitting<00:01:42.689> me<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.930> was<00:01:43.049> getting

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
place and hitting me and I was getting

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.780 
place and hitting me and I was getting
so<00:01:43.470> frustrated<00:01:43.649> because<00:01:44.070> look<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.430> almost<00:01:44.549> died

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
so frustrated because look I almost died

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.730 
so frustrated because look I almost died
there<00:01:44.970> but<00:01:45.509> my<00:01:45.659> ghost<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.110> decides<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.560> land

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
there but my ghost just decides to land

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.859 
there but my ghost just decides to land
just<00:01:46.829> perfectly<00:01:47.399> on<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> little<00:01:47.729> cloud<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.689> you

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
just perfectly on a little cloud but you

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:49.969 
just perfectly on a little cloud but you
got<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.140> watch<00:01:49.259> out<00:01:49.439> for<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.649> flood<00:01:49.799> because

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
got to watch out for the flood because

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.080 
got to watch out for the flood because
you<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.159> see<00:01:50.280> they're<00:01:50.399> increasing<00:01:50.759> by<00:01:50.850> quite

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
you can see they're increasing by quite

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.249 
you can see they're increasing by quite
a<00:01:51.119> bit<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.329> they<00:01:51.420> start<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.659> form<00:01:51.810> little<00:01:51.990> road

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
a bit and they start to form little road

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.740 
a bit and they start to form little road
blocks<00:01:52.590> until<00:01:53.430> they'll<00:01:53.670> jump<00:01:54.149> everybody<00:01:54.540> will

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
blocks until they'll jump everybody will

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.420 
blocks until they'll jump everybody will
wait<00:01:54.899> underneath<00:01:55.259> one<00:01:55.439> tripmine<00:01:55.920> or<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.219> and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
wait underneath one tripmine or so and

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.800 
wait underneath one tripmine or so and
soon<00:01:56.850> as<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.000> come<00:01:57.149> around<00:01:57.270> they<00:01:57.630> will

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
soon as you come around they will

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.050 
soon as you come around they will
explode<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:59.159> can't<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.549> sit<00:01:59.820> in<00:01:59.909> one

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
explode and you can't really sit in one

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.639 
explode and you can't really sit in one
place<00:02:00.299> too<00:02:00.570> long<00:02:00.600> because<00:02:01.110> what's<00:02:01.560> gonna

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
place too long because what's gonna

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.679 
place too long because what's gonna
happen<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.640> blast<00:02:03.000> radius<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.570> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
happen is that the blast radius of the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.749 
happen is that the blast radius of the
trip<00:02:03.899> mines<00:02:04.079> are<00:02:04.619> actually<00:02:04.950> fairly<00:02:05.159> big<00:02:05.460> so

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
trip mines are actually fairly big so

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.550 
trip mines are actually fairly big so
there<00:02:06.030> isn't<00:02:06.180> really<00:02:06.299> anywhere<00:02:06.780> safe<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
there isn't really anywhere safe on the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.660 
there isn't really anywhere safe on the
map<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.920> can<00:02:07.979> sit<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.399> can<00:02:08.520> see<00:02:08.640> I

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
map that you can sit in you can see I

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.190 
map that you can sit in you can see I
got<00:02:08.879> infected<00:02:09.209> there<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.020> see<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
got infected there so you can see the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.780 
got infected there so you can see the
idea<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.530> just<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.979> jump<00:02:11.190> up<00:02:11.340> make<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.610> mines

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
idea is just to jump up make the mines

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.080 
idea is just to jump up make the mines
explode<00:02:12.270> make<00:02:12.750> sure<00:02:12.870> you're

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
explode make sure you're

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.339 
explode make sure you're
underneath<00:02:13.480> them<00:02:13.629> and<00:02:13.750> normally<00:02:14.110> you'll<00:02:14.230> get

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
underneath them and normally you'll get

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.809 
underneath them and normally you'll get
some<00:02:14.470> kills<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.950> can<00:02:15.069> see<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.220> got<00:02:15.459> one<00:02:15.610> there

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
some kills you can see I got one there

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.640 
some kills you can see I got one there
maybe<00:02:16.360> get<00:02:16.569> another<00:02:16.690> one<00:02:16.840> here<00:02:16.930> nope<00:02:17.140> I'm

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
maybe get another one here nope I'm

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.020 
maybe get another one here nope I'm
moving<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.040> little<00:02:18.129> forward<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.670> can<00:02:18.790> jump

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
moving a little forward you can jump

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.610 
moving a little forward you can jump
keep<00:02:19.269> jumping<00:02:19.450> on<00:02:19.660> them<00:02:19.780> I<00:02:19.959> mean<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.319> can<00:02:20.440> sit

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
keep jumping on them I mean you can sit

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.869 
keep jumping on them I mean you can sit
underneath<00:02:20.860> one<00:02:21.129> because<00:02:21.280> they<00:02:21.370> spawn<00:02:21.580> almost

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
underneath one because they spawn almost

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.150 
underneath one because they spawn almost
instantly<00:02:22.269> again<00:02:23.019> though<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.440> blasts<00:02:23.769> reuse

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
instantly again though the blasts reuse

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.500 
instantly again though the blasts reuse
of<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.370> trip<00:02:24.550> mine<00:02:24.670> is<00:02:24.849> pretty<00:02:25.000> big<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:25.209> if<00:02:25.420> you

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
of the trip mine is pretty big so if you

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.119 
of the trip mine is pretty big so if you
think<00:02:25.720> you're<00:02:25.930> in<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.230> ghost<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.680> can<00:02:26.769> survive

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
think you're in a ghost you can survive

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.470 
think you're in a ghost you can survive
by<00:02:27.370> kind<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.640> avoiding<00:02:28.060> you're<00:02:28.180> sitting<00:02:28.420> in

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
by kind of avoiding you're sitting in

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.400 
by kind of avoiding you're sitting in
the<00:02:28.540> middle<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.840> bunch<00:02:29.050> of<00:02:29.140> them

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
the middle of a bunch of them

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.839 
the middle of a bunch of them
that<00:02:29.680> won't<00:02:29.830> work<00:02:29.950> because<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.489> can<00:02:30.670> actually

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
that won't work because you can actually

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.240 
that won't work because you can actually
the<00:02:31.420> blast<00:02:31.629> radius<00:02:31.780> again<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.410> pretty<00:02:32.890> big<00:02:33.040> so

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
the blast radius again is pretty big so

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.350 
the blast radius again is pretty big so
you<00:02:33.310> can<00:02:33.489> hit<00:02:33.610> people<00:02:33.790> there's<00:02:34.150> nowhere

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
you can hit people there's nowhere

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.000 
you can hit people there's nowhere
that's<00:02:34.540> really<00:02:34.720> safe<00:02:34.930> on<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.170> map<00:02:35.319> and<00:02:35.500> if

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
that's really safe on the map and if

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.229 
that's really safe on the map and if
you're<00:02:36.129> worried<00:02:36.370> about<00:02:36.400> flood<00:02:36.849> using<00:02:37.150> their

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
you're worried about flood using their

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:37.589 
you're worried about flood using their
lunge

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
lunge

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:38.910 
lunge
I<00:02:37.660> believe<00:02:37.840> they<00:02:37.930> don't<00:02:38.049> do<00:02:38.200> any<00:02:38.349> damage<00:02:38.590> with

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
I believe they don't do any damage with

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.160 
I believe they don't do any damage with
their<00:02:39.160> their<00:02:39.640> lunge<00:02:39.910> so<00:02:40.480> they<00:02:40.599> can't<00:02:40.780> actually

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
their their lunge so they can't actually

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.390 
their their lunge so they can't actually
infect<00:02:41.440> it<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.620> way<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.830> only<00:02:41.980> way<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:42.220> be

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
infect it that way the only way to be

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.789 
infect it that way the only way to be
infected<00:02:42.879> is<00:02:43.030> from<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.450> trip<00:02:43.750> mind<00:02:43.930> blast<00:02:44.170> so

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
infected is from the trip mind blast so

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.140 
infected is from the trip mind blast so
you<00:02:45.099> don't<00:02:45.250> want<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.430> pick<00:02:45.549> a<00:02:45.579> trip<00:02:45.790> my<00:02:45.910> Navy
