00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
in my if you have turntables if you have

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.680 
in my if you have turntables if you have
techniques<00:04:59.940> you<00:05:00.030> can<00:05:00.150> just<00:05:00.330> hit<00:05:00.389> the<00:05:00.539> on

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
techniques you can just hit the on

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.890 
techniques you can just hit the on
button<00:05:00.720> or<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.830> aqua<00:05:02.130> enemy<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.759> just<00:05:03.479> use

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
button or the aqua enemy and just use

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.020 
button or the aqua enemy and just use
you<00:05:04.380> don't<00:05:04.530> rolls<00:05:04.800> in<00:05:05.010> jibt<00:05:05.190> or<00:05:05.340> loops<00:05:05.729> I<00:05:05.880> mean

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
you don't rolls in jibt or loops I mean

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.969 
you don't rolls in jibt or loops I mean
and<00:05:06.210> just<00:05:06.389> keep<00:05:06.539> cutting<00:05:06.720> it<00:05:06.900> down<00:05:06.930> on<00:05:07.289> this

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
and just keep cutting it down on this

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.939 
and just keep cutting it down on this
controller<00:05:08.370> I<00:05:08.610> just<00:05:09.030> move<00:05:09.630> the<00:05:09.870> stop<00:05:10.169> all<00:05:10.440> the

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
controller I just move the stop all the

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.020 
controller I just move the stop all the
way<00:05:10.979> so<00:05:11.430> there's<00:05:11.610> gonna<00:05:11.729> be<00:05:11.820> a<00:05:11.909> super<00:05:12.240> slow

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
way so there's gonna be a super slow

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.730 
way so there's gonna be a super slow
very<00:05:15.030> very<00:05:15.360> slow<00:05:15.570> transition<00:05:15.930> if<00:05:16.289> you<00:05:16.440> just<00:05:16.620> do

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
very very slow transition if you just do

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.260 
very very slow transition if you just do
it<00:05:16.830> like<00:05:16.860> that<00:05:17.130> but<00:05:17.370> to<00:05:17.520> add<00:05:17.639> some<00:05:17.820> spice<00:05:18.060> to<00:05:18.090> it

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
it like that but to add some spice to it

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:26.570 
it like that but to add some spice to it
is<00:05:18.479> um<00:05:19.260> say<00:05:19.979> you're<00:05:20.159> playing<00:05:20.280> this<00:05:25.580> you're

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
is um say you're playing this you're

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.260 
is um say you're playing this you're
gonna<00:05:26.699> do<00:05:26.909> it

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
gonna do it

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:39.400 
gonna do it
stop<00:05:37.540> see<00:05:38.540> what<00:05:38.660> I<00:05:38.720> did<00:05:38.780> there<00:05:38.930> is<00:05:39.170> I<00:05:39.350> just

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
stop see what I did there is I just

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.500 
stop see what I did there is I just
can't<00:05:39.710> cutting<00:05:40.400> down<00:05:40.580> the<00:05:40.820> loop<00:05:41.000> rope<00:05:41.240> or<00:05:41.450> the

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
can't cutting down the loop rope or the

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.930 
can't cutting down the loop rope or the
loop<00:05:42.140> whatever<00:05:42.470> on<00:05:42.770> that<00:05:43.160> is<00:05:43.430> gonna<00:05:43.610> stop<00:05:43.790> us

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
loop whatever on that is gonna stop us

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.560 
loop whatever on that is gonna stop us
though<00:05:45.070> and<00:05:46.070> then<00:05:46.310> it<00:05:46.490> just<00:05:46.610> slow<00:05:46.730> down<00:05:46.940> if<00:05:47.450> you

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
though and then it just slow down if you

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.300 
though and then it just slow down if you
have<00:05:47.720> tables<00:05:48.140> and<00:05:48.260> you're<00:05:48.590> just<00:05:48.740> on<00:05:48.830> Cerato

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
have tables and you're just on Cerato

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.000 
have tables and you're just on Cerato
just<00:05:50.150> turn<00:05:50.300> off<00:05:50.420> your<00:05:50.450> tables<00:05:50.900> and<00:05:51.020> just<00:05:51.650> if

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
just turn off your tables and just if

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.320 
just turn off your tables and just if
you<00:05:52.220> don't<00:05:52.370> have<00:05:52.490> Luke<00:05:52.700> Rohl<00:05:52.910> more<00:05:53.120> like<00:05:53.300> a

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
you don't have Luke Rohl more like a

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.760 
you don't have Luke Rohl more like a
little<00:05:53.510> mini<00:05:53.690> controller<00:05:53.870> just<00:05:54.530> hit<00:05:54.650> the

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
little mini controller just hit the

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.610 
little mini controller just hit the

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
the values that's what it's going to be

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.430 
the values that's what it's going to be
one<00:06:19.610> through<00:06:19.910> five<00:06:20.120> so<00:06:20.630> you<00:06:20.720> can<00:06:20.930> see<00:06:21.080> it<00:06:21.170> so<00:06:21.320> if

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
one through five so you can see it so if

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.680 
one through five so you can see it so if
you<00:06:21.560> have<00:06:21.740> the<00:06:21.980> fifth<00:06:22.190> one<00:06:22.400> at<00:06:22.520> sixteen<00:06:22.910> number

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
you have the fifth one at sixteen number

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.240 
you have the fifth one at sixteen number
five<00:06:23.840> is<00:06:23.960> going<00:06:23.990> to<00:06:24.110> be<00:06:24.200> a<00:06:24.230> 16<00:06:24.620> bar<00:06:24.770> loop<00:06:24.980> if<00:06:25.130> you

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
five is going to be a 16 bar loop if you

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.550 
five is going to be a 16 bar loop if you
keep<00:06:25.430> cutting<00:06:25.700> it<00:06:25.790> down<00:06:26.000> then<00:06:26.660> you<00:06:27.170> know<00:06:27.320> if

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
keep cutting it down then you know if

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.010 
keep cutting it down then you know if
the<00:06:27.920> fifth<00:06:28.160> one<00:06:28.340> is<00:06:28.430> a<00:06:28.490> for<00:06:28.730> the<00:06:29.210> fizzling<00:06:29.630> to

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
the fifth one is a for the fizzling to

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.140 
the fifth one is a for the fizzling to
be<00:06:30.080> four<00:06:30.320> and<00:06:30.470> then<00:06:30.560> it<00:06:30.590> will<00:06:30.770> go<00:06:30.920> to<00:06:30.950> then<00:06:31.880> one

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
be four and then it will go to then one

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.140 
be four and then it will go to then one
and<00:06:32.450> a<00:06:32.510> half<00:06:32.690> and<00:06:33.050> like<00:06:33.350> 1/16<00:06:33.920> and<00:06:34.040> 1/32<00:06:34.580> so

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
and a half and like 1/16 and 1/32 so

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.380 
and a half and like 1/16 and 1/32 so
