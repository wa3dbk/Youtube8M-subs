thrusters turrets you know what these

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.270 
thrusters turrets you know what these
are<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:07.320> let's<00:01:08.320> try<00:01:08.680> something<00:01:08.890> real<00:01:09.100> simple

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
are now let's try something real simple

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.210 
are now let's try something real simple
wire<00:01:09.909> turret<00:01:10.680> doesn't<00:01:11.680> really<00:01:11.799> matter<00:01:12.009> what

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
wire turret doesn't really matter what

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.760 
wire turret doesn't really matter what
these<00:01:12.400> are<00:01:12.579> I<00:01:12.900> don't<00:01:13.900> care<00:01:14.049> if<00:01:14.110> it's<00:01:14.320> probably

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
these are I don't care if it's probably

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.380 
these are I don't care if it's probably
gonna<00:01:14.890> kill<00:01:15.159> me<00:01:16.590> there's<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.680> wire<00:01:17.890> turret<00:01:18.390> now

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
gonna kill me there's a wire turret now

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.859 
gonna kill me there's a wire turret now
let's<00:01:20.259> make<00:01:20.409> that<00:01:20.560> go<00:01:21.040> off<00:01:21.220> with<00:01:21.399> a<00:01:21.490> button<00:01:21.869> y

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
let's make that go off with a button y

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.820 
let's make that go off with a button y
ou<00:01:22.920> input<00:01:23.920> output<00:01:24.659> button

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.000 

they're<00:01:28.830> a<00:01:28.860> good<00:01:29.070> button<00:01:29.340> that's<00:01:29.670> fine

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
they're a good button that's fine

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.110 
they're a good button that's fine
value<00:01:31.970> on<00:01:32.710> could<00:01:33.710> be<00:01:33.830> one<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:34.820> don't<00:01:34.880> have<00:01:35.030> to

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
value on could be one you don't have to

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.230 
value on could be one you don't have to
adjust<00:01:35.390> these<00:01:35.570> I<00:01:35.750> just<00:01:35.780> Adam<00:01:36.200> change<00:01:37.060> one<00:01:38.060> and

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
adjust these I just Adam change one and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.340 
adjust these I just Adam change one and
zero<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:39.230> wire<00:01:39.680> mother's<00:01:40.010> is<00:01:40.160> ones<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:40.790> zeros

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
zero so wire mother's is ones and zeros

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.560 
zero so wire mother's is ones and zeros
one<00:01:42.350> is<00:01:42.500> on<00:01:42.650> zero<00:01:43.220> is<00:01:43.430> off<00:01:43.610> most<00:01:44.150> things<00:01:44.420> will

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
one is on zero is off most things will

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.090 
one is on zero is off most things will
respond<00:01:44.930> to<00:01:45.080> that<00:01:47.530> run<00:01:48.530> over<00:01:48.710> this<00:01:48.800> button

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
respond to that run over this button

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.360 
respond to that run over this button
here<00:01:49.450> now<00:01:50.450> we<00:01:51.170> go<00:01:51.320> down<00:01:51.500> to<00:01:51.680> our<00:01:51.710> wire<00:01:52.040> tool

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
here now we go down to our wire tool

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.890 
here now we go down to our wire tool
which<00:01:52.550> is<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:52.790> very<00:01:53.000> last<00:01:53.210> thing<00:01:53.420> in<00:01:53.870> your

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
which is the very last thing in your

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.770 
which is the very last thing in your
menu<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:55.990> we're<00:01:56.990> now<00:01:57.140> going<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.500> wire<00:01:57.890> this<00:01:58.190> up

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
menu and we're now going to wire this up

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.810 
menu and we're now going to wire this up
the<00:01:59.780> gun<00:01:59.990> has<00:02:00.230> only<00:02:00.590> one<00:02:00.890> option<00:02:01.070> you

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
the gun has only one option you

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.360 
the gun has only one option you
secondary<00:02:02.300> fire<00:02:02.540> if<00:02:02.810> you<00:02:02.900> hold<00:02:03.050> up<00:02:03.260> the<00:02:04.130> wire

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
secondary fire if you hold up the wire

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.390 
secondary fire if you hold up the wire
tool<00:02:04.700> over<00:02:04.970> an<00:02:05.090> object<00:02:05.510> a<00:02:05.690> wire<00:02:06.229> object<00:02:06.680> and<00:02:06.830> a

tool over an object a wire object and a

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.770 
tool over an object a wire object and a
little<00:02:07.640> box<00:02:07.820> pops<00:02:08.060> up<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:08.300> says<00:02:08.360> something

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
little box pops up and says something

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.170 
little box pops up and says something
like<00:02:08.929> fire<00:02:09.460> that<00:02:10.460> means<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.820> there<00:02:10.970> might<00:02:11.120> be

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
like fire that means that there might be

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.970 
like fire that means that there might be
something<00:02:11.540> else<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.960> secondary<00:02:12.470> fire<00:02:12.680> and

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
something else the secondary fire and

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.830 
something else the secondary fire and
that<00:02:13.610> doesn't<00:02:13.970> change<00:02:14.000> that's<00:02:14.390> all<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:14.660> have

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
that doesn't change that's all you have

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.050 
that doesn't change that's all you have
to<00:02:14.990> do<00:02:15.110> with<00:02:15.260> this<00:02:15.350> kurtis<00:02:15.710> fire<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:17.000> i'm

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
to do with this kurtis fire it so i'm

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.860 
to do with this kurtis fire it so i'm
gonna<00:02:17.150> click<00:02:17.320> span<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.670> button<00:02:19.880> and<00:02:20.210> we

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
gonna click span to the button and we

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.199 
gonna click span to the button and we
drew<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.080> wire<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.650> made<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.040> awfully<00:02:22.430> big<00:02:22.880> but

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
drew a wire I made it awfully big but

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.060 
drew a wire I made it awfully big but
that's<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.110> show<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.350> guys<00:02:24.590> now<00:02:24.830> if<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.010> click

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
signed chip now assigned chip or that'll

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.310 
signed chip now assigned chip or that'll
do<00:04:35.510> I'll<00:04:36.510> make<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:36.780> model<00:04:37.080> bigger<00:04:39.020> is<00:04:40.020> it'll

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
do I'll make the model bigger is it'll

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.040 
do I'll make the model bigger is it'll
take<00:04:40.440> anything<00:04:40.800> you<00:04:41.010> put<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.400> it<00:04:41.720> 45<00:04:42.720> or

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
take anything you put to it 45 or

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.230 
take anything you put to it 45 or
thousand<00:04:43.500> a<00:04:43.560> million<00:04:43.740> and<00:04:44.100> it'll<00:04:44.970> if<00:04:45.120> it's

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
thousand a million and it'll if it's

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.790 
thousand a million and it'll if it's
positive<00:04:45.450> it'll<00:04:45.900> make<00:04:46.080> it<00:04:46.200> one<00:04:46.410> if<00:04:46.680> it's

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
negative it'll make it negative 1 so

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.590 
negative it'll make it negative 1 so
this<00:04:48.930> should<00:04:49.140> do<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.290> job<00:04:49.410> right<00:04:49.620> here<00:04:50.600> and

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
this should do the job right here and

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.450 
this should do the job right here and
you<00:04:51.630> have<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:51.960> wire<00:04:52.140> backwards<00:04:52.710> by<00:04:52.920> the<00:04:52.980> way<00:04:53.160> so

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
you have to wire backwards by the way so

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.720 
you have to wire backwards by the way so
if<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:53.640> want<00:04:53.790> to<00:04:53.960> turret<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.170> fire<00:04:55.410> go<00:04:56.400> from

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
if you want to turret to fire go from

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.410 
if you want to turret to fire go from
the<00:04:56.850> turret<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.870> chip<00:04:58.140> and<00:04:58.520> then<00:04:59.520> only

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
the turret to the chip and then only

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.750 
the turret to the chip and then only
option<00:05:00.900> on<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.110> chip<00:05:01.320> is<00:05:01.560> a<00:05:01.830> so<00:05:01.890> from<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.490> chip

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
option on the chip is a so from the chip

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.500 
option on the chip is a so from the chip
to<00:05:03.320> the<00:05:04.320> Ranger<00:05:04.790> now<00:05:05.790> that's<00:05:06.000> why<00:05:06.210> it<00:05:06.270> if<00:05:06.420> I

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
to the Ranger now that's why it if I

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.460 
to the Ranger now that's why it if I
should<00:05:06.690> walk<00:05:06.810> in<00:05:06.960> front<00:05:07.080> of<00:05:07.170> this<00:05:07.230> and<00:05:07.380> get

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
should walk in front of this and get

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:15.580 
should walk in front of this and get
shot<00:05:07.710> in<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.830> face<00:05:13.100> that<00:05:14.100> works<00:05:14.370> splendidly

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
shot in the face that works splendidly

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.510 
shot in the face that works splendidly
where<00:05:16.590> am<00:05:16.680> I<00:05:16.830> all<00:05:17.280> right<00:05:17.430> good<00:05:19.100> so<00:05:20.100> that<00:05:20.280> is<00:05:20.430> the

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
where am I all right good so that is the

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.600 
where am I all right good so that is the
most<00:05:20.670> simple<00:05:21.390> wiring<00:05:22.140> I<00:05:22.620> can<00:05:22.890> think<00:05:23.190> of<00:05:23.370> at<00:05:23.580> the

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
most simple wiring I can think of at the

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.800 
most simple wiring I can think of at the
moment<00:05:23.760> now<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.420> button<00:05:26.600> isn't<00:05:27.600> wired

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
moment now the button isn't wired

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.980 
moment now the button isn't wired
anymore<00:05:28.290> perceive<00:05:28.880> gun<00:05:29.880> only<00:05:30.210> has<00:05:30.330> one<00:05:30.690> input

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
anymore perceive gun only has one input

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.500 
anymore perceive gun only has one input
fire<00:05:31.710> one<00:05:32.430> thing<00:05:32.670> is<00:05:32.700> going<00:05:32.940> to<00:05:33.030> tell<00:05:33.180> the<00:05:33.330> fire

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
fire one thing is going to tell the fire

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.320 
fire one thing is going to tell the fire
that<00:05:34.410> chip<00:05:34.820> when<00:05:35.820> I<00:05:35.910> found<00:05:36.180> it<00:05:36.360> crouched<00:05:36.600> out

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
that chip when I found it crouched out

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.920 
that chip when I found it crouched out
even<00:05:38.810> I<00:05:38.900> sang<00:05:39.580> 4030<00:05:40.580> whatever<00:05:40.939> says<00:05:41.210> this<00:05:41.689> says

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
even I sang 4030 whatever says this says

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.740 
even I sang 4030 whatever says this says
one<00:05:42.199> I<00:05:42.970> woke<00:05:43.970> out<00:05:44.060> of<00:05:44.120> the<00:05:44.270> way<00:05:44.360> it<00:05:44.539> says<00:05:44.720> zero

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
one I woke out of the way it says zero

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.279 
one I woke out of the way it says zero
gun<00:05:45.439> doesn't<00:05:45.680> fire<00:05:45.979> any<00:05:46.220> longer<00:05:47.139> so<00:05:48.139> that's

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
gun doesn't fire any longer so that's

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.900 
gun doesn't fire any longer so that's
the<00:05:48.409> most<00:05:48.590> basic<00:05:49.099> of<00:05:49.900> wire
