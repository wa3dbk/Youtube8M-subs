00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
this is you can save different settings

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.910 
this is you can save different settings
on<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:15.930> decide<00:01:16.259> if<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.500> want<00:01:16.799> it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
on it and you can decide if you want it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.920 
on it and you can decide if you want it
to<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.100> be<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.520> light<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.150> eventually

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
to just be a light that eventually

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.870 
to just be a light that eventually
slowly<00:01:19.259> fades<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:19.920> or<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.640> want<00:01:20.850> a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
slowly fades out or if you want a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.760 
slowly fades out or if you want a
program<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.659> only<00:01:21.869> get<00:01:22.080> two<00:01:22.259> hours<00:01:22.320> of

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
program so you only get two hours of

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.010 
program so you only get two hours of
light<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.310> then<00:01:23.820> after<00:01:24.180> two<00:01:24.330> hours<00:01:24.509> it's<00:01:24.810> gone

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
light and then after two hours it's gone

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.630 
light and then after two hours it's gone
so<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.770> two<00:01:25.979> hours<00:01:26.340> you'll<00:01:26.460> get<00:01:26.610> a

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
so for that two hours you'll get a

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.950 
so for that two hours you'll get a
brighter<00:01:26.939> light<00:01:27.060> than<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.600> would<00:01:27.780> if<00:01:27.930> you

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
brighter light than you would if you

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.810 
brighter light than you would if you
were<00:01:28.200> trying<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.530> let<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.829> thing<00:01:29.070> run<00:01:29.340> out

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
were trying to let this thing run out

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.190 
were trying to let this thing run out
for<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> 20<00:01:30.600> hour<00:01:30.750> period<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.799> time<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:33.200> that's

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
for a 20 hour period of time and that's

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.749 
for a 20 hour period of time and that's
kind<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.560> handy<00:01:34.860> especially<00:01:35.040> if<00:01:35.400> you're<00:01:35.490> doing

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759

an hour so well you know you might as

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.859 
an hour so well you know you might as
well<00:01:41.369> have<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.670> most<00:01:41.850> amount<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.270> light<00:01:42.450> you

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
well have the most amount of light you

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.170

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
can use some triple-a batteries as well

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.850 
can use some triple-a batteries as well
for<00:01:57.090> backup<00:01:57.479> but<00:01:57.659> because<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:58.380> rechargeable
