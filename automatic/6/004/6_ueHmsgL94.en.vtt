00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.940
 Today I wanted to talk about how to apply 

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:09.780
 the eye contour according to the problem 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.070
 what you want to correct is to say how 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.349
 you have to apply the outline if we have 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.590
 lines of expression or if what we want 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.300
 is to provide firmness or if we have a zone of 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.490
 inflammation with sachets is worth a 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.019
 bag in the eye applies different 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.179
 forms in this case is valid in the case of 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.150
 that we have a little bag or bag in 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.990
 general 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.849
 then I will use the starter 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.279
 repair today brown but I do not care 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.129
 contour that you use what we are going to 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.980
 to always do is take into account that the 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.620
 massage that we are going to give in the eye when 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.920
 have in general is something for bags 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.260
 worth the massage is always going to be in this 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.699
 meaning ok let's apply if the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.670
 outline as if we were doing here a 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.970
 sort of triangle is worth what 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.970
 we close 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.250
 and then what we are going to do is 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.300
 distribute it to taps is worth then 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.940
 pick up the outline 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.820
 we put a little bit above another 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.520
 little down 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.409
 and what we have to do is think with 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.120
 this what we get is to activate the 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.430
 circulation around the contour of 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.620
 eye why that's called outline it's worth not 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.820
 apply next to the tear and now you 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.280
 I explain with respect to the upper eyelid 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.979
 what you have to do then the message 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.740
 it would really be like that if what we want 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.440
 it is firmness in lines of expression and 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.420
 others especially to go in the 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.770
 The meaning of the lines is always valid in the 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.479
 face when we apply any type 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.130
 of treatment , yours is that we go 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.509
 always in the sense of how they are going to 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.360
 appear the line of expression or as 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.810
 we already have them, it is precisely for 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.810
 help lighten the so to speak 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.310
 it's better that they dim and then what we're going 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.710
 to do if we have for example lines 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.630
 around the contour or we want to avoid 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.330
 that they appear to us once we have already 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.070
 extended in our outline what 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.690
 apply to patches because the same 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.940
 we activate blood circulation and 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.250
 activate the circulation we promote 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.050
 that the blood carries more oxygen with 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.910
 which is going to see the eye much more 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.400
 even the most attenuated eye and other 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.130
 then always to touch 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.260
 extending this not only by the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.970
 circulation but really at 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.430
 access touches we are depositing the 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.290
 product just between the lines that 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.510
 we have or the future lines that 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.240
 let's have it, then what 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.840
 we apply it and here at the end with the 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.850
 massage 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.010
 we have also helped this area but if 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.610
 you have crow's feet that are a little 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.120
 more sections what we do is also 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.200
 we can even separate the contours and 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.900
 you have very marked lines you do not know 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.150
 then we would introduce the 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.590
 Eye contour or moisturizer 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.099
 We are using the contour panel 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.099
 between the lines 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.920
 tell you that this outline also more 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:54.290
 great even if you have a little 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.800
 marked the lines the outline of the 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.380
 lip 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.560
 what to do if instead of having lines and 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.030
 we apply it like this or touch and other 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.250
 what do we do if we have a bag in the eye 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.690
 the massage would be different if what 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.610
 we have is what we are 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.100
 accumulating is liquid or we have to 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.740
 the best a bit of fat that is usually 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.690
 the good bag actually if our 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.150
 bag is hereditary these that contain 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.650
 a little ball of fat is very complicated 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.120
 help him move he can always 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.370
 benefit the massage but it is complicated 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.400
 eliminate it but the bag by retention 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.320
 of liquids that are usually so when 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.580
 you notice a particular ball inside that 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.070
 it looks clearly but it is more 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.990
 inflamed the area that's by retention 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.480
 of liquids then always the system 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.490
 lymphatic goes through here over here has 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.990
 some points that go down all this 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.850
 It will help us to better drain the system 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.160
 lymphatic drains the fluid that we have 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.860
 in there retained then as what 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.780
 we would do it would be the other way as we have 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.000
 to expel around here so to speak 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.810
 to help it drain in what we're going to 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.460
 to do is gentle pressures not above 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.260
 just from the bag but in the area a 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.180
 little transition between 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.159
 between the bag and the cheek 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.829
 we make light pressures with the finger 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.209
 very gently in and through 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.549
 up if you have for example more 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.159
 inflamed the eye anything is worth 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.959
 you will also do this massage inwards 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.340
 to go towards these two points 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.850
 as I tell you that they go through the system 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.759
 lymphatic then it would be gently like 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.650
 slight pressures is worth more or less than 1 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.350
 10 the pressure would have to be a 2 or a 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.539
 3 very slight but we help precisely to 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.729
 drain everything is worth in this case would be 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.710
 obviously inward I am 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:36.400
 doing in one eye we could be like that 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.139
 therefore, for the whole world 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.289
 this is the massage when we want 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.479
 do it well 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.680
 then we tapped the 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.990
 product to ensure that it 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.599
 introduce along the contour of the 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.580
 eye and live and if we have lines here 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.050
 outside we also take care of them 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.300
 we separate a little if we have them very 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.399
 marked already touches that what we have is 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.069
 liquid protection bag we are going to 

00:04:56.399 --> 00:05:01.110
 drain if we have a bag already marked 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:02.669
 for a type of fat cyst per se 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.460
 say the typical little ball that looks 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.960
 good ball always helps also that you 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.939
 let's give a gentle massage is also not convenient 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.279
 that if we are working on a 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:12.719
 bag this guy we're feeling it or 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:15.330
 pressing a lot because it's going to 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:16.860
 inflame is also worth then the people 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.839
 that we have to already know that you have to 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.909
 drink a lot of water try to drink a little 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:22.139
 salt a lot of vegetables and others but on 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:24.330
 all the massage is always worth 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.469
 helped also as I told you before 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.669
 let's talk now about the eyelid 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:28.349
 superior because many times I 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.300
 you ask but in the eyelid there is 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:33.389
 put it there is no need to put it as it is 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.159
 I always recommend that in this area 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.629
 from here as much if we have it 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:39.539
 pretty dehydrated apply a 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:40.709
 once every two weeks because because if 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.370
 we are applying before a 

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:44.870
 product 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.180
 nutritious and so on what he's going to do to the 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.999
 long it is to fall the eyelid is worth it we are 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.680
 using so to speak then what 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:53.330
 what will in the long run always be the 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.729
 eyelid fall with which to avoid 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.749
 this we simply put the outline by 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:02.449
 above is valid to exercise this effect of 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:06.229
 firmness that's why I told you the massage is worth 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:07.310
 so it's not true here that a lot of people 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.509
 apply and if you have the outline 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.069
 Dehydrated and maximum on the eyelid 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:12.740
 superior and obviously you have to 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:14.509
 hydrate and others follow many lines of 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.650
 expression and so on would you 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:18.560
 taps just like we have done under 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.960
 very carefully, it's worth 1º we mark and 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.400
 then I would go to patches trying not to 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.569
 touch the eyelid a lot because if 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.150
 it does not always go inside, it's going to 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:28.550
 introduce into the product within the 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.499
 eye and in the end they end up more inflamed with 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.060
 which is worse but for this the truth 

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:33.800
 once every two weeks as 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.479
 very much even every three there is no such 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.800
 month and you have it well because if not the 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:39.080
 really long that what I would have noticed 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.599
 it is a loss of firmness despite 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.099
 create the lifting effect I do not care 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:44.900
 always the upper contour better by 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:47.449
 up or as high as you can be worth 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.280
 to get firm do not think it 's 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:51.220
 all 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.480
 in general so nothing but I hope 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.460
 that you have served these 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.960
 advice any doubt you have 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.760
 you can comment or in the 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.980
 comments of the video or on the blog 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.350
 or through social networks 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.750
 mediators of the email as you want 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.800
 and nothing else as I always tell you nothing 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.900
 like if you liked the video 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.940
 subscribe to my channel up and down where 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.350
 put subscribe and share it with 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.180
 those people whom you believe 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.620
 can be useful so nothing else 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.460
 see you in the next video a 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.460
 I kiss you until then 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:27.190
 and nothing else this would be all do not wait 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.420
 you wait but wait 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.420
 I forgot
