couldn't really be myself and the other
feet<00:02:21.860> but<00:02:22.280> then<00:02:22.490> with<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.700> runway<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.510> now<00:02:24.080> feel

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
feet but then with the runway I now feel

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.380

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.960 
do is push a button and slide my foot
depending<00:02:33.230> on<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:33.440> heel<00:02:33.620> height<00:02:33.830> so<00:02:34.520> it's

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
depending on the heel height so it's

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.290 
depending on the heel height so it's
just<00:02:35.180> it's<00:02:35.450> super<00:02:35.900> easy<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.350> use<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:37.180> with<00:02:38.180> the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
just it's super easy to use and with the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.020 
just it's super easy to use and with the
runway<00:02:38.540> -<00:02:38.900> literally<00:02:39.410> I<00:02:39.830> could<00:02:40.430> run<00:02:40.700> in<00:02:40.850> these

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
runway - literally I could run in these

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.790 
runway - literally I could run in these
like<00:02:41.540> they<00:02:41.660> have<00:02:41.750> enough<00:02:42.020> energy<00:02:42.260> returned

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
like they have enough energy returned

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.559 
like they have enough energy returned
that<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.069> could<00:02:43.310> be<00:02:43.400> in<00:02:43.490> heels<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.270> could<00:02:44.450> run

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
that I could be in heels and I could run

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.510 
that I could be in heels and I could run
in<00:02:44.720> these<00:02:44.840> if<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:45.140> had<00:02:45.319> to

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
in these if I had to

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.450 
in these if I had to
makes<00:02:47.330> you<00:02:47.600> feel<00:02:48.020> um<00:02:50.770> normal<00:02:51.770> if<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.070> will

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
makes you feel um normal if you will

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.250 
makes you feel um normal if you will
because<00:02:52.850> you're<00:02:53.180> not<00:02:53.300> focused<00:02:53.750> on<00:02:53.870> your<00:02:53.930> feet

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
because you're not focused on your feet

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.170 
because you're not focused on your feet
so<00:02:54.500> much<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.040> think<00:02:55.130> that's<00:02:55.580> what's<00:02:55.910> great

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
so much and I think that's what's great

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.850 
so much and I think that's what's great
when<00:02:56.360> you<00:02:56.450> get<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.690> when<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.350> can<00:02:57.500> get<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.770> the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
when you get to when you can get to the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.830 
when you get to when you can get to the
point<00:02:58.070> where<00:02:58.340> your<00:02:58.880> prosthetic<00:02:59.420> legs<00:02:59.630> are

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
point where your prosthetic legs are

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.930 
point where your prosthetic legs are
just<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.320> part<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.770> you<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.250> they're<00:03:01.820> not

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
just a part of you and they're not

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.400 
just a part of you and they're not
stopping<00:03:02.210> you<00:03:02.480> from<00:03:02.630> living<00:03:02.960> the<00:03:03.020> lifestyle

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
stopping you from living the lifestyle

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.760 
stopping you from living the lifestyle
you<00:03:03.530> want<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.770> live<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.220> that's<00:03:04.490> that's

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
you want to live and that's that's

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.970 
you want to live and that's that's
incredibly<00:03:06.770> important
