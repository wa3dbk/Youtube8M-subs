00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
but it was the music that creeped me out

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.410 
but it was the music that creeped me out
the<00:01:12.030> most

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
the most

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.300 
the most
it<00:01:12.990> sounded<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.409> gigas<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.950> seem<00:01:14.159> right

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
it sounded like gigas to seem right

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.999 
it sounded like gigas to seem right
after<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.729> beat<00:01:14.880> pokey<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.240> earthbound<00:01:15.630> I

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
after you beat pokey and earthbound I

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.380 
after you beat pokey and earthbound I
also<00:01:17.009> noticed<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.580> knuckles<00:01:17.970> looked<00:01:18.150> afraid

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
also noticed that knuckles looked afraid

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.350 
also noticed that knuckles looked afraid
just<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:18.810> tails<00:01:19.049> did<00:01:19.320> though<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:19.890> as<00:01:20.040> much

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
just like tails did though not as much

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.520 
just like tails did though not as much
more<00:01:21.360> rather<00:01:21.600> than<00:01:21.750> he<00:01:22.049> looked

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
more rather than he looked

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.800 
more rather than he looked
a<00:01:22.560> little<00:01:22.890> unnerved<00:01:23.280> he<00:01:24.240> broke<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> fourth

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
a little unnerved he broke the fourth

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.570 
a little unnerved he broke the fourth
wall<00:01:24.869> just<00:01:25.229> like<00:01:25.320> tails<00:01:25.619> did<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.130> looked<00:01:26.430> as

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
wall just like tails did and looked as

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.070 
wall just like tails did and looked as
if<00:01:26.729> he<00:01:26.880> wasn't<00:01:27.030> sure<00:01:27.330> about<00:01:27.540> what<00:01:27.780> was<00:01:27.900> going

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
if he wasn't sure about what was going

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.010 
if he wasn't sure about what was going
on<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.799> made<00:01:29.100> him<00:01:29.250> move<00:01:29.460> anyway

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
on but I made him move anyway

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.789 
he ran down the straight hallway in this
dark<00:01:32.759> level<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.420> as<00:01:33.689> he<00:01:33.840> did<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.470> screen

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
dark level and as he did the screen

dark level and as he did the screen
started<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.220> flicker<00:01:35.460> red<00:01:35.759> static<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.240> couple

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
started to flicker red static a couple

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.719 
started to flicker red static a couple
times<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.650> maddening<00:01:38.189> laugh<00:01:38.430> came

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
times and then that maddening laugh came

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.359 
times and then that maddening laugh came
again<00:01:39.439> then<00:01:40.439> after<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> few<00:01:40.950> seconds<00:01:41.280> of

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
again then after a few seconds of

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.429 
again then after a few seconds of
running<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.820> noticed<00:01:42.450> several<00:01:42.630> bloodstains<00:01:43.290> on

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
