00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
with the scrolling wheel it's got your

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.090 
with the scrolling wheel it's got your
two<00:00:42.390> side<00:00:42.629> buttons<00:00:42.899> here<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.500> those<00:00:44.070> are

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
two side buttons here and those are

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.610 
two side buttons here and those are
typically<00:00:44.670> used<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.690> browsing<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> web

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
typically used for browsing the web

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.889 
typically used for browsing the web
going<00:00:46.980> back<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.309> forth<00:00:47.520> between<00:00:47.640> pages<00:00:48.239> and

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
going back and forth between pages and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.069 
going back and forth between pages and
then<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.140> course<00:00:49.370> there<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.850> DPI<00:00:51.449> button

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
then of course there is the DPI button

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.830 
then of course there is the DPI button
now<00:00:52.559> when<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.520> first<00:00:53.730> got<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.510> was<00:00:54.780> very

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
now when I first got this I was very

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.110 
now when I first got this I was very
confused<00:00:55.199> by<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.680> DPI<00:00:56.070> button<00:00:56.430> had<00:00:56.579> no<00:00:56.789> idea

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
confused by the DPI button had no idea

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.979 
confused by the DPI button had no idea
what<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.270> did<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:59.120> upon<00:01:00.120> further<00:01:00.329> research<00:01:00.629> I

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
what it did and upon further research I

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.959 
what it did and upon further research I
discovered<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.739> DPI<00:01:02.100> button<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.699> used

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
discovered that this DPI button is used

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.160 
discovered that this DPI button is used
to<00:01:03.270> increase<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.140> sensitivity<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.700> mouse

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
to increase the sensitivity of the mouse

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.500 
to increase the sensitivity of the mouse
for<00:01:07.170> example<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.130> have<00:01:08.159> your<00:01:09.150> mouse

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
for example you can have your mouse

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.420 
for example you can have your mouse
speed<00:01:09.810> going<00:01:10.049> at<00:01:10.229> about<00:01:10.290> five<00:01:10.710> out<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:10.979> ten

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
speed going at about five out of ten

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.940 
speed going at about five out of ten
and<00:01:11.640> with<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.780> dpi<00:01:13.229> button<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.650> will<00:01:13.740> easily

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
and with this dpi button it will easily

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.120 
and with this dpi button it will easily
double<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.939> makes<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.420> lot<00:01:15.659> more

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
double it so that makes it a lot more

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.609 
double it so that makes it a lot more
usable<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.520> guess<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.850> could<00:01:18.000> say<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.930> doing

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
usable I guess you could say for doing

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.830 
usable I guess you could say for doing
any<00:01:19.740> sort<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.130> gaming<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.299> computer<00:01:21.720> if

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
any sort of gaming on the computer if

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.560 
any sort of gaming on the computer if
you're<00:01:21.990> used<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.890> higher<00:01:23.250> sensitivity<00:01:25.159> now

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
you're used to a higher sensitivity now

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.609 
you're used to a higher sensitivity now
unfortunately<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.049> battery-powered

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
unfortunately this is battery-powered

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.270 
unfortunately this is battery-powered
I'll<00:01:29.100> give<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> quick<00:01:30.119> look<00:01:30.240> underneath

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
I'll give you a quick look underneath

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.350 
I'll give you a quick look underneath
bag<00:01:32.280> power<00:01:32.549> takes<00:01:32.790> two<00:01:32.939> triple<00:01:33.270> A<00:01:33.329> batteries

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
bag power takes two triple A batteries

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.870 
bag power takes two triple A batteries
but<00:01:33.990> honestly<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:35.040> me<00:01:35.189> it's<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:35.490> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
but honestly it's to me it's just a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.640 
but honestly it's to me it's just a
small<00:01:36.299> minor<00:01:36.750> setback

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
small minor setback

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.170 
small minor setback
has<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.610> course<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.930> USB<00:01:39.930> receiver<00:01:40.820> that<00:01:41.820> does

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
has of course the USB receiver that does

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.800 
has of course the USB receiver that does
fit<00:01:42.600> snugly<00:01:44.479> into<00:01:46.970> this<00:01:47.970> compartment<00:01:48.479> right

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
fit snugly into this compartment right

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.270 
fit snugly into this compartment right
here

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
here

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.460 
here
so<00:01:51.030> at<00:01:51.180> least<00:01:51.300> it<00:01:51.510> does<00:01:51.660> make<00:01:51.900> it<00:01:51.930> easier<00:01:52.200> to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
so at least it does make it easier to

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.600 
so at least it does make it easier to
take<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:52.980> go<00:01:53.100> now<00:01:57.020> overall<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.460> would<00:01:59.460> say

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
take on the go now overall I would say

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.310 
take on the go now overall I would say
this<00:01:59.910> is<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.120> very<00:02:00.330> good<00:02:00.540> buy<00:02:00.660> I<00:02:00.690> spent<00:02:01.140> nine
