00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:02.440
 ball for all 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.120
 this course has the function of teaching you to be a winner in mathematics 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.120
 This is the captain. 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.899
 how far do you want to study you want to study at the average 

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:21.759
 difficult 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.949
 in many schools that sounded so far, so small here 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.329
 some better schools 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.519
 I'll give the best and most advanced 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.000
 if you want to pass the contest you will have to give 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.940
 much much much much more 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.860
 but if you want to be first in the contest you have to help more 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.220
 still 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.410
 if you want to be a 'teacher' preferably perceive the most 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.040
 is here 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.230
 It's where you're going to have to get if you want to work at NASA. 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.160
 I'm going to say here a little problem that uses the matter side start of teaching 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
 fundamentally only used this discharge. 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.360
 on a rainy day they lacked 2 500 of the boys and one third of the girls one cuba 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.540
 the whole class has 37 students 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.580
 how many students attended that day knowing that the puma has more 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.260
 what girls 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.229
 is to appear an easy problem 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.520
 that's why we can solve 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.940
 if we call the number of boys 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.450
 xx 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.900
 and the number of girls gy 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.730
 I know I've been more VIP or even equal to 37 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.760
 the class has in all 37 students good I need one more information 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.299
 the information missing that 2 500 boys from a third of the girls 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.549
 if we can solve this here by equation 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.920
 we would have to have a second and action but we do not have 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.430
 sosa missing information 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.430
 and what are you going to serve this information for? 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.180
 the information that we can take from here to the next 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.569
 if 2 500 two boys were missing 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.809
 this means that the number of boys 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:14.809
 is a multiple of five 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.370
 so I can have for example 5 10 and 15 20 25 boys have to be a number 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.489
 like this 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.389
 Similarly 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.599
 were missing here on that day with a third of the girls 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.709
 I can conclude 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.540
 that the number of girls is a multiple of 3 then this class may have 3 6 9 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.089
 twelve girls 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:44.089
 and so on 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:51.619
 So these are the information that we have 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:57.719
 the sum of these two numbers is 37 where one is a multiple of five in another 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.169
 multiple of 3 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:03.529
 and this is not quite an actuation system is a problem that mix the 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:04.849
 crew 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.849
 and it's kind of a game of numbers 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:14.179
 then what we have to do has an x ​​and y value contract that are 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:16.729
 number of boys and number of girls 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:21.329
 I think edis is a multiple of 5 so it's a multiple of 3 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.519
 is it + 20 is how much 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.610
 37 which is the total number 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.890
 of students in the class 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.650
 for example if we have five boys and three girls 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:36.079
 we're going to have a total of eight students but we do not want this we want 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.549
 these more than one is 37 let's go then princess notary pine with 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:42.590
 these probes 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.590
 the result is 37 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.599
 let's go work then 

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:06.429
 then fill in the entire table and we'll prove here how many 

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:08.139
 of these results 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.429
 I have this sum 37 

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:12.199
 we have a file 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:13.879
 they omit but some 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.199
 37 37 37 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.349
 37 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:20.299
 ready 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.490
 it is only these two possibilities 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.870
 so I can have sheen reached 25 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.419
 18 to 12 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.280
 your result 37 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.330
 or else I can have x equal to 10 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.750
 my impression is good news is that this also gives the result 37 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.039
 bce will be a correct result 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.809
 remember what was said here in the problem 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:46.809
 that the puma has more girls than boys 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:51.219
 teresa is very important this support has more boys than girls 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.780
 then this option is that it is not known that I would have only 12 girls and in 25 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.550
 boys 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.550
 so the correct answer is from here 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.900
 so we have in the class 27 girls 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.900
 and since girl that is the solution of the problem 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:12.739
 well then we met and that the number of boys and 10 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:16.809
 and that the number of girls is 27 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:22.120
 Beware of these pranks this is not the best solution to the problem 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.159
 Look, the problem is pending 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:27.520
 How many students did they live in? 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.740
 increase well 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.350
 he does not want to know how many boys are 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:34.719
 tax for this year 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:38.369
 now then let me bet that the missing boys are missing two 

00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:39.870
 fifth of boys 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.310
 so if we did the 2 500 did the inscription 4 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.389
 six students attended 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:51.379
 and we have that this betray me a third of the number of girls in the case 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:56.440
 on screen from 27 to 9 then how many girls attend on that day 18 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:01.759
 so high of the people stop it will be 18 girls what these boys 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.150
 the answer of the problem is here in 24 students attended 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.009
 this day
