00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:28.999
 in the state of 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:32.219
 too much effort Aviv 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.219
 wait with a small practical injury break 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:38.219
 before the man Dr 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.219

 with 2 5 so in the long run another point and it flies as before 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.649
 from 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.509
 at a distance of four points 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.849

 37 years old now 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.489
 the Polish Olympic champion of Atlanta 1996 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:35.809
 as already mentioned in Carinthia we only do 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:38.809
 with 6 2 1 could therefore decide for themselves 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:45.689
 nevertheless still pictures 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:47.849
 five second but now yes 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.619
 his opposite Dirk Pohlmann 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:51.799

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.719
 blue zone 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:55.669
 had set at the edge of the mat 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.459
 he could equalize the youth welfare result next six to one 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:04.249

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:20.949
 Montreal

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:28.029
 for the man in blue 

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:29.500
 for Barbara Philipp 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.669
 the flames beat applies 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.659
 so Heinz Bierbaum got two and a half team points for Luckenwalde 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:38.919
 with it stood 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.110
