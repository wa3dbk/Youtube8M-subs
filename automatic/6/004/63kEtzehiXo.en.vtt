00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
and because that will travel much

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.940 
and because that will travel much
further<00:01:20.310> into<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.820> wind<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.720> your<00:01:22.710> voice

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
further into the wind and your voice

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.800 
further into the wind and your voice
will<00:01:23.189> not<00:01:23.430> travel<00:01:23.670> through<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.180> through<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
will not travel through the through the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.469 
will not travel through the through the
air<00:01:24.960> for<00:01:25.350> such<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> long<00:01:25.770> distance

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
air for such a long distance

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.630 
air for such a long distance
when<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.229> dog<00:01:28.380> knows<00:01:28.620> left<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.130> right<00:01:29.340> and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
when the dog knows left and right and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.750 
when the dog knows left and right and
the<00:01:30.030> holes<00:01:30.240> look<00:01:30.450> nice<00:01:30.690> like<00:01:30.720> my<00:01:31.200> idols<00:01:31.530> now

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
the holes look nice like my idols now

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.070 
the holes look nice like my idols now
then<00:01:32.760> we<00:01:32.909> teach<00:01:33.120> your<00:01:33.300> dog<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> drive<00:01:33.900> them

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080
