00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.089 
reaction from the Shenmue fan base is

that which like I kept saying really

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.339 
that which like I kept saying really
wasn't<00:02:53.310> surprising<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:54.720> know<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.319> the

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
wasn't surprising you know like in the

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.750 
wasn't surprising you know like in the
two<00:02:55.530> videos<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:56.010> did<00:02:56.130> leading<00:02:56.400> up<00:02:56.549> to<00:02:56.579> this

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
two videos I did leading up to this

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.979 
two videos I did leading up to this
where<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:56.970> talked<00:02:57.180> about<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.450> conference<00:02:57.870> I

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
where I talked about the conference I

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.259 
where I talked about the conference I
did<00:02:58.620> say<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.220> was<00:02:59.310> really<00:02:59.640> unlikely<00:02:59.790> we

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
did say that it was really unlikely we

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.339 
did say that it was really unlikely we
were<00:03:00.390> gonna<00:03:00.480> get<00:03:00.629> any<00:03:00.780> kind<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:00.989> announcement

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
were gonna get any kind of announcement

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.350 
were gonna get any kind of announcement
although<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:02.010> did<00:03:02.519> think<00:03:02.760> there<00:03:02.849> was<00:03:03.000> some

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
although I did think there was some

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.569 
although I did think there was some
small<00:03:03.959> chance<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.470> Shenmue<00:03:04.890> HD<00:03:05.310> would<00:03:05.489> be

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
small chance that Shenmue HD would be

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:06.500 
small chance that Shenmue HD would be
announced<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.030> would<00:03:06.150> have<00:03:06.239> been<00:03:06.329> really

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
announced that would have been really

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.740 
announced that would have been really
nice<00:03:06.799> now<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:07.860> story<00:03:08.549> continues<00:03:08.640> after<00:03:09.480> that

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
nice now the story continues after that

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.289 
nice now the story continues after that

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
Kickstarter's not really a practical

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.690 
Kickstarter's not really a practical
option<00:04:23.440> I<00:04:23.950> mean<00:04:24.100> at<00:04:24.310> best<00:04:24.790> with<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.240> Kickstarter

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
option I mean at best with a Kickstarter

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.380 
option I mean at best with a Kickstarter
you'd<00:04:27.700> be<00:04:27.880> able<00:04:28.150> to<00:04:28.300> maybe<00:04:29.220> maybe<00:04:30.330> buy<00:04:31.330> the

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
you'd be able to maybe maybe buy the

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.420 
you'd be able to maybe maybe buy the
license<00:04:32.170> from<00:04:32.350> Sega<00:04:32.710> at<00:04:33.280> best<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.570> then<00:04:35.140> what

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
license from Sega at best and then what

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.160 
license from Sega at best and then what
do<00:04:36.430> we<00:04:36.460> all<00:04:36.640> just<00:04:36.850> collectively<00:04:37.450> agree<00:04:37.900> like

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
do we all just collectively agree like

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.570 
do we all just collectively agree like
let's<00:04:38.380> say<00:04:38.500> there's<00:04:38.680> a<00:04:38.770> Kickstarter<00:04:39.280> and<00:04:39.430> the

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
let's say there's a Kickstarter and the

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.360 
let's say there's a Kickstarter and the
goal<00:04:39.820> is<00:04:40.120> to<00:04:40.510> buy<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:40.870> license<00:04:41.620> from<00:04:41.980> Sega

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
goal is to buy the license from Sega

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.390 
goal is to buy the license from Sega
let's<00:04:43.030> presume<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:44.020> absurd<00:04:44.470> that<00:04:45.040> we<00:04:45.100> could

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
let's presume the absurd that we could

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.430 
let's presume the absurd that we could
actually<00:04:45.580> come<00:04:46.420> up<00:04:46.450> with<00:04:46.630> that<00:04:46.990> kind<00:04:47.230> of

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
actually come up with that kind of

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.190 
actually come up with that kind of
funding<00:04:48.120> then<00:04:49.120> what<00:04:49.360> do<00:04:49.480> we<00:04:49.570> all<00:04:49.660> just<00:04:49.840> agree

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
funding then what do we all just agree

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.340 
funding then what do we all just agree
that<00:04:50.700> our<00:04:51.700> share<00:04:52.270> of<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.630> purchase<00:04:53.050> goes

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
that our share of the purchase goes

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.780 
that our share of the purchase goes
directly<00:04:53.800> to<00:04:53.950> use<00:04:54.130> as<00:04:54.310> uki<00:04:55.170> and<00:04:56.170> then<00:04:56.950> what<00:04:57.130> you

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
directly to use as uki and then what you

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.160 
directly to use as uki and then what you
can't<00:04:57.970> make<00:04:58.150> the<00:04:58.270> game<00:04:58.450> at<00:04:58.630> that<00:04:58.720> point<00:04:58.780> at

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
can't make the game at that point at

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.320 
can't make the game at that point at
that<00:04:59.200> point<00:04:59.350> he<00:04:59.590> owns<00:04:59.860> a<00:05:00.070> franchise<00:05:00.610> with<00:05:01.090> no

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
that point he owns a franchise with no

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.690 
that point he owns a franchise with no
money<00:05:01.600> behind<00:05:01.810> it<00:05:02.080> you<00:05:02.560> still<00:05:02.860> have<00:05:03.160> the<00:05:03.370> exact

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
money behind it you still have the exact

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.550 
money behind it you still have the exact
same<00:05:03.730> problem<00:05:04.300> except<00:05:04.570> he<00:05:04.690> has<00:05:04.780> full<00:05:05.050> control

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
same problem except he has full control

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.040 
same problem except he has full control
of<00:05:05.590> it<00:05:05.860> that's<00:05:06.820> probably<00:05:07.180> a<00:05:07.480> better<00:05:07.690> situation

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
of it that's probably a better situation

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.770 
of it that's probably a better situation
slightly<00:05:08.800> because<00:05:09.700> then<00:05:10.000> he<00:05:10.090> can<00:05:10.240> go<00:05:10.330> to<00:05:10.360> Sony

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
slightly because then he can go to Sony

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.270 
slightly because then he can go to Sony
and<00:05:10.990> be<00:05:11.050> like<00:05:11.200> hey<00:05:11.410> I've<00:05:11.590> got<00:05:11.770> you<00:05:12.070> know<00:05:12.160> the

did a video on this whole Kickstarter
thing<00:05:23.920> last<00:05:24.280> year<00:05:24.490> while<00:05:25.270> I<00:05:25.300> have<00:05:25.480> not<00:05:25.660> watched

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
thing last year while I have not watched

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.290 
thing last year while I have not watched
it<00:05:26.290> in<00:05:26.440> quite<00:05:26.680> some<00:05:26.980> time<00:05:27.010> I<00:05:27.580> would<00:05:28.030> bet

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
it in quite some time I would bet

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.120 
it in quite some time I would bet
there's<00:05:28.600> not<00:05:28.870> much<00:05:29.170> that<00:05:29.440> has<00:05:29.560> changed<00:05:29.830> from

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
there's not much that has changed from

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.060 
there's not much that has changed from
that<00:05:30.510> basically<00:05:31.510> the<00:05:31.720> key<00:05:32.080> points<00:05:32.410> are<00:05:32.560> the

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
that basically the key points are the

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.470 
that basically the key points are the
Kickstarter<00:05:33.550> thing<00:05:33.760> has<00:05:33.940> been<00:05:34.060> blown<00:05:34.120> out<00:05:34.450> of

Kickstarter thing has been blown out of

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.990 
Kickstarter thing has been blown out of
proportion<00:05:35.220> it's<00:05:36.220> not<00:05:36.460> going<00:05:36.790> to<00:05:36.910> happen<00:05:37.120> and

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
proportion it's not going to happen and

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.690 
proportion it's not going to happen and
even<00:05:40.000> if<00:05:40.210> it<00:05:40.330> did<00:05:40.770> you<00:05:41.770> never<00:05:41.980> get<00:05:42.160> a<00:05:42.220> result<00:05:42.550> in

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
even if it did you never get a result in

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.330 
even if it did you never get a result in
anything<00:05:42.940> so<00:05:43.570> yeah<00:05:44.500> I'm<00:05:44.620> sorry<00:05:44.920> I<00:05:45.010> didn't<00:05:45.250> this

unless something like that happened I

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.030 
unless something like that happened I
don't<00:06:27.669> think

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
don't think

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.350

them for the rights etc which is why
I've<00:06:37.970> maintained<00:06:38.420> that<00:06:38.750> for<00:06:39.020> the<00:06:39.080> longest

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 
I've maintained that for the longest

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.620 
I've maintained that for the longest
time<00:06:39.530> now<00:06:39.890> that<00:06:40.160> Sony<00:06:40.700> is<00:06:40.820> the<00:06:41.180> single<00:06:41.600> most

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
time now that Sony is the single most

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.750 
time now that Sony is the single most
logical<00:06:42.410> route<00:06:42.560> not<00:06:43.040> necessarily<00:06:43.490> my<00:06:43.550> first

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:43.760 
logical route not necessarily my first

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.390 
logical route not necessarily my first
choice<00:06:44.030> but<00:06:44.960> kind<00:06:45.170> of<00:06:45.230> the<00:06:45.290> only<00:06:45.440> choice<00:06:45.890> it's

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
choice but kind of the only choice it's

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.150 
choice but kind of the only choice it's
the<00:06:46.490> only<00:06:46.670> one<00:06:46.850> that<00:06:46.910> makes<00:06:47.180> sense<00:06:47.450> so<00:06:48.410> yeah

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 
the only one that makes sense so yeah

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.090 
the only one that makes sense so yeah
that's<00:06:49.520> just<00:06:49.640> my<00:06:49.910> thoughts<00:06:50.180> the<00:06:50.780> GDC<00:06:51.140> was

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 
that's just my thoughts the GDC was

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.290 
that's just my thoughts the GDC was
pretty<00:06:52.310> much<00:06:52.400> what<00:06:52.550> I<00:06:52.580> expected<00:06:53.060> it<00:06:53.210> was

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.300 
pretty much what I expected it was

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.490 
pretty much what I expected it was
exactly<00:06:53.690> what<00:06:53.870> they<00:06:53.930> told<00:06:54.110> us<00:06:54.260> they<00:06:54.410> were

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
exactly what they told us they were

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.540 
exactly what they told us they were
gonna<00:06:54.590> give<00:06:54.800> us<00:06:54.980> that<00:06:55.160> doesn't<00:06:55.310> mean<00:06:55.460> it

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550

gotta say this is something else about

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.020 
gotta say this is something else about
the<00:07:44.450> game<00:07:44.480> is<00:07:44.930> there's<00:07:45.200> another<00:07:45.470> one<00:07:45.680> coming

that's so maybe if I watched it again
hindsight<00:07:48.620> it<00:07:48.710> would<00:07:48.800> be<00:07:48.920> more<00:07:49.190> interesting

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:49.610
