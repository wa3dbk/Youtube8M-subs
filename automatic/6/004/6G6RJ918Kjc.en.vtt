hello this is how I modify my

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.940 
hello this is how I modify my
transmitter<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:05.069> be<00:00:05.279> able<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:06.710> extend<00:00:07.710> the

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
transmitter to be able to extend the

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.640 
transmitter to be able to extend the
range<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:09.050> to<00:00:10.130> fix<00:00:11.130> dropout<00:00:11.780> ec1v<00:00:14.120> triple<00:00:15.120> to

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
range and to fix dropout ec1v triple to

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.140 
range and to fix dropout ec1v triple to
protocol<00:00:17.060> so<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.119> remove<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:19.039> cover<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.520> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
protocol so I remove this cover of the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.880 
protocol so I remove this cover of the
antenna<00:00:21.539> wire<00:00:22.160> for<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.340> purpose<00:00:23.820> i<00:00:24.560> move<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
antenna wire for that purpose i move the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:35.299 
antenna wire for that purpose i move the
screw<00:00:26.720> and<00:00:27.720> remove<00:00:31.250> this<00:00:32.250> kind<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.759> thing<00:00:34.309> so

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
screw and remove this kind of thing so

screw and remove this kind of thing so
this<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.760> thing<00:00:36.120> i<00:00:36.329> move<00:00:36.719> let<00:00:37.050> me<00:00:37.079> sugar

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
this is the thing i move let me sugar

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.920 
this is the thing i move let me sugar
just<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.170> same<00:00:40.440> thing<00:00:41.149> after<00:00:42.149> removing<00:00:42.510> this

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
just the same thing after removing this

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.850 
just the same thing after removing this
I<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> wire<00:00:45.680> coming<00:00:46.680> out<00:00:47.510> from<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.860> hole

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
I have a wire coming out from this hole

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.090 
I have a wire coming out from this hole
and<00:00:50.420> then<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.629> need<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.840> fix<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.710> which<00:00:52.890> would

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
and then I need to fix it so which would

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.549 
and then I need to fix it so which would
be<00:00:53.309> not<00:00:53.550> vertical<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.510> horizontal<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.350> it

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
be not vertical but horizontal like it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.360 
be not vertical but horizontal like it
tis<00:00:56.039> now<00:00:56.600> that<00:00:57.600> purpose<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.289> make<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.129> hole<00:01:00.000> on

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
tis now that purpose I make a hole on

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.990 
tis now that purpose I make a hole on
the<00:01:02.370> side<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:03.329> thing<00:01:03.500> for<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.670> to<00:01:05.670> do

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the side of this thing for that to do

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.770 
the side of this thing for that to do
that<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:07.310> first<00:01:08.310> heat<00:01:09.770> piece<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.979> wire<00:01:11.750> with<00:01:12.750> a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
that I first heat piece of wire with a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.789 
that I first heat piece of wire with a
match<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.100> then<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.090> inserted<00:01:15.540> here<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.350> there

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
match and then I inserted here so there

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.210 
match and then I inserted here so there
is<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> hole<00:01:17.340> after<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:19.110> until<00:01:19.950> this

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
is a hole after that I just until this

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.240 
is a hole after that I just until this
wire<00:01:20.549> there<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.159> have<00:01:25.250> 24

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
wire there and so that I have 24

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.170 
wire there and so that I have 24
separate<00:01:26.909> these<00:01:27.180> two<00:01:27.240> things<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:29.520> two<00:01:29.610> sides

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
separate these two things so two sides

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.830 
separate these two things so two sides
front<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.259> back<00:01:31.500> they<00:01:31.979> are<00:01:32.509> hold<00:01:33.509> by<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
front and back they are hold by the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.880 
front and back they are hold by the
screws<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:37.340> make<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:39.500> whole<00:01:40.500> new

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
screws so you can just make a whole new

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.569 
screws so you can just make a whole new
attitude<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:42.270> change<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.770> wire<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.460> you

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
attitude to change so this wire so you

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.740 
attitude to change so this wire so you
don't<00:01:44.790> need<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:47.250> bend<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.700> whites<00:01:48.060> Martha

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
don't need to to bend this whites Martha

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.300 
don't need to to bend this whites Martha
just<00:01:48.960> secure<00:01:49.490> this<00:01:50.490> front<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.630> back<00:01:52.310> covers

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
just secure this front and back covers

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.630 
just secure this front and back covers
this<00:01:53.790> way<00:01:54.090> that's<00:01:55.020> inserting<00:01:55.740> something

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
this way that's inserting something

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.300 
this way that's inserting something
showing<00:01:56.850> them<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:58.050> after<00:01:58.200> i<00:01:58.530> saw<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.280> wire<00:01:59.640> i

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
showing them so after i saw this wire i

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.370 
showing them so after i saw this wire i
release<00:02:02.310> them<00:02:02.840> again<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.409> now<00:02:04.650> fixed<00:02:06.380> this

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
release them again it is now fixed this

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.510 
release them again it is now fixed this
way<00:02:07.680> i<00:02:07.710> have<00:02:08.250> greater<00:02:08.880> range<00:02:10.340> actually<00:02:11.340> this

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
way i have greater range actually this

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.920 
way i have greater range actually this
is<00:02:11.730> not<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.900> triple<00:02:13.440> tree<00:02:13.740> transmitter<00:02:14.490> i<00:02:14.970> did

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
is not the triple tree transmitter i did

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.800 
is not the triple tree transmitter i did
the<00:02:16.080> same<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.830> tomb<00:02:17.610> i<00:02:17.790> will<00:02:18.090> triple<00:02:18.540> chair

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
the same to the tomb i will triple chair

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
the same to the tomb i will triple chair
and<00:02:19.140> v<00:02:19.410> nine<00:02:19.680> five<00:02:20.040> nine<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:21.230> i<00:02:22.230> have<00:02:22.470> wires

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
and v nine five nine and i have wires

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.500 
and v nine five nine and i have wires
going<00:02:23.820> from<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.390> side<00:02:25.130> but<00:02:26.180> some<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.330> them

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
going from the side but some of them

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.699 
going from the side but some of them
look<00:02:27.810> not<00:02:28.800> as<00:02:29.130> good<00:02:29.520> as<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:30.030> one<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.709> little

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
look not as good as this one a little

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.110 
look not as good as this one a little
bit<00:02:31.980> messy<00:02:32.489> when<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.850> could<00:02:33.420> remove<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:35.120> the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
bit messy when I could remove that the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.390 
bit messy when I could remove that the
screw<00:02:36.480> from<00:02:36.750> here<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.440> broke<00:02:37.769> this<00:02:38.070> thing

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
screw from here and I broke this thing

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.810 
screw from here and I broke this thing
they<00:02:39.060> had<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.540> fix<00:02:40.470> this<00:02:40.800> wine<00:02:41.130> with<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.550> glue

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
they had to fix this wine with the glue

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.050 
they had to fix this wine with the glue
that's<00:02:42.830> how<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:43.860> did<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.250> just<00:02:44.489> don't<00:02:44.700> want<00:02:44.970> to

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
that's how I did I just don't want to

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.840 
that's how I did I just don't want to
show<00:02:45.120> which<00:02:45.480> here<00:02:46.100> give<00:02:47.100> this<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.610> best

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
show which here give this it the best

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.259 
show which here give this it the best
way<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.450> can<00:02:48.690> look<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.410> if<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.820> change<00:02:51.150> your

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
way it can look and if you change your

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.320 
way it can look and if you change your
mind<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.870> decide<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.620> have<00:02:53.519> original<00:02:54.120> one

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
mind and decide to have original one

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.820 
mind and decide to have original one
just<00:02:54.780> like<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:56.269> puts<00:02:57.269> this<00:02:57.600> cover<00:02:58.440> back

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
just like that puts this cover back

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.250 
just like that puts this cover back
again
