00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.830

globally<00:01:17.729> because<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.180> not<00:01:18.330> all<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.689> them

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
globally because it's not all of them

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.920 
globally because it's not all of them
yet<00:01:19.080> but<00:01:19.799> certainly<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.939> lot<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.240> carriers<00:01:21.750> not

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
anything like that and have removed that

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.380 
anything like that and have removed that
capability<00:01:27.750> from<00:01:28.619> their<00:01:28.860> site<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.150> able<00:01:30.270> to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
capability from their site to be able to

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.289 
capability from their site to be able to
set<00:01:30.689> up<00:01:30.810> email<00:01:31.049> for<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.470> Blackberry<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
set up email for the Blackberry and the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.870 
set up email for the Blackberry and the
reason<00:01:33.659> why<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.900> because<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:35.189> customer

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
reason why is because the customer

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.420 
reason why is because the customer
service<00:01:36.270> calls<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:37.380> were<00:01:37.530> coming<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.159> and

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the carrier's being able to support

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.649 
the carrier's being able to support
those<00:01:40.439> customer<00:01:40.979> service<00:01:41.310> calls<00:01:41.630> was<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
those customer service calls was a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.050 
those customer service calls was a
challenge<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.470> say<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.649> least<00:01:43.950> now<00:01:44.250> when<00:01:44.970> we

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
challenge to say the least now when we

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.149
