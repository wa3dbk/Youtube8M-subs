00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.270
 the buyer but I think he 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.950
 he thinks but he had his computer you 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.570
 you have to use your antivirus to 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.340
 delete and service, or if the file 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.250

 I hope to open 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.560
 if I use the question how to take too much 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.780
 time 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.310

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:39.150
 stayed far away arriving at the end finalized 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.660
 There you go, you can see that the 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.510

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.260
 55 seconds 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.860

 there are still files from the memory here 

00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:53.049

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.509
 Knowing this also stay here to accelerate 

00:04:53.049 --> 00:04:57.309
 now it's ok, I'm not going to do this 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:58.569

 showing you here now we are 

00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:09.479
 here at the beginning was to update the 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:12.909
 Windows 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.939
 here it will begin to mirror if you can 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:17.709
 see that it is complete that this has been 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:20.829
 as light only of what I did 

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:24.309
 Okay, that was the first thing I did 11 

00:05:20.829 --> 00:05:26.229
 That priest, too, you will stay and 

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:29.519

 I already think the store needs this 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.160
 here business of watching games was a 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:10.729
