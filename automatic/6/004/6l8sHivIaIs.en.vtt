let's<00:01:34.229> start<00:01:34.530> with<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.799> water<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.250> lots<00:01:35.430> of

let's start with the water and lots of

let's start with the water and lots of

trapped air bubbles the mass density of
water<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.100> almost<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.610> thousand<00:01:39.030> times<00:01:39.210> greater

water is almost a thousand times greater
than<00:01:39.690> air<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.380> mass<00:01:40.560> density<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.250> column

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
than air so the mass density of a column

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.520

of<00:01:41.729> water<00:01:41.789> with<00:01:42.240> air<00:01:42.479> bubbles<00:01:42.840> comes<00:01:43.140> almost

entirely<00:01:43.950> from<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.310> water<00:01:44.580> but<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> water<00:01:45.750> is

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
entirely from the water but the water is

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.929 
entirely from the water but the water is
incompressible<00:01:46.259> while<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> air<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.430> easy<00:01:47.700> to

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
incompressible while the air is easy to

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.419 
incompressible while the air is easy to
compress<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> elastic<00:01:49.590> stiffness<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.250> due

the<00:01:53.039> speed<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.429> sound<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.850> slower<00:01:54.210> than<00:01:54.509> it

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
the speed of sound is slower than it

the speed of sound is slower than it
