 Karlsruhe Professor Götz Werner for new solutions 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.589
 he has ignited the discussion about the basic income 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:22.150

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.510

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.499
 must fear 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.550

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.989
 Free up to 1000 500 euros so every citizen unconditionally held 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.500
 a thought that seems realistic considering that in Germany at present 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.530
 around 685 billion will be spent on social benefits
