here's the thing that makes life so

here's the thing that makes life so
interesting<00:00:16.520> the<00:00:17.520> theory<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.000> evolution

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
interesting the theory of evolution

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
interesting the theory of evolution
claims<00:00:19.170> only<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> strong<00:00:19.830> shall<00:00:20.520> survive

maybe<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:22.740> maybe<00:00:23.270> so<00:00:25.340> but<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> theory<00:00:26.970> of

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
maybe so maybe so but the theory of

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the strong doesn't mean they can't get

but what the odds don't know is this
isn't<00:00:51.150> a<00:00:51.210> math<00:00:51.420> test<00:00:52.370> this<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.729> completely

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
isn't a math test this is a completely

different kind of test one where passion

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.530 
different kind of test one where passion
has<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> funny<00:00:59.699> way<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.970> trumping<00:01:00.600> logic

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
has a funny way of trumping logic

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.810 
has a funny way of trumping logic
so<00:01:03.140> before<00:01:03.290> you<00:01:03.500> step<00:01:03.890> up<00:01:04.100> to<00:01:04.160> the<00:01:04.309> starting

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
so before you step up to the starting

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.440 
so before you step up to the starting
line<00:01:05.770> before<00:01:06.770> the<00:01:07.100> whistle<00:01:07.310> blows<00:01:07.730> and<00:01:08.060> the

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
line before the whistle blows and the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.320 
line before the whistle blows and the
clock<00:01:08.660> starts<00:01:08.690> ticking<00:01:09.610> just<00:01:10.610> remember<00:01:11.150> out

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
clock starts ticking just remember out

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.520 
clock starts ticking just remember out
here<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.770> results<00:01:13.220> don't<00:01:13.370> always<00:01:13.790> add<00:01:13.970> up<00:01:17.530> no

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
here the results don't always add up no

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.530 
here the results don't always add up no
matter<00:01:18.740> what<00:01:18.980> the<00:01:19.160> stats<00:01:19.460> may<00:01:19.700> say<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.210> the

all<00:01:25.820> bets<00:01:26.330> are<00:01:26.630> off<00:01:27.520> don't<00:01:28.520> be<00:01:28.640> surprised<00:01:29.150> if
