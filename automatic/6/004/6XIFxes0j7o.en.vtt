00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:07.319
 and whether we will talk what you need 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:11.930
 angles to get on 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.260
 photos are good so let's start with 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.039
 portrait 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:20.150
 portrait photo is important for 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.150
 portrait shot 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.040
 angle should be a little bit 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.060
 a little bit above that is 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.390
 the photographed must be 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.230
 little taller than you when you 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.650
 taking pictures 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:42.360
 or if the subject is located with 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:46.750
 you are on the same level, then you are a little bit 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:51.390
 put your head down this is done for 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:54.700
 to hide her 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.630
 opening double chin asks 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:02.410
 portrait on the train stage or just a face 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:10.540
 Now we consider only the face of 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:13.540
 the train will be a little further so the most 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.610
 important it is a little bit this angle 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.250
 slightly above that is when you 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.930
 taking pictures taking pictures and can 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.230
 climb a little or you can 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:27.020
 a little drop is important that you 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.570
 watched a little frown at all 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:35.720
 a little bit and then there is no need to exaggerate 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:38.000
 and then in the frame will be beautifully seen 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:43.490
 your neckline and 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.800
 you will see a usually round face 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.540
 will look a little more 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:53.480
 stretched out and we just did in examples 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:56.990
 in the photos above it is visible on 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.840
 photos number 3 in the top row we 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.810
 see the girl covered her hair with hair 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.000
 face one more option if you have 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.200
 round face and 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.050
 then you can use hair to 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.740
 slightly hide this round covering 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.860
 hair 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.190
 if you have long hair then 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:25.610
 parts of the face will be in the shade and she will 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:28.670
 don't look the same way and yet 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.060
 the main view should be three 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.379
 quarters that is 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.220
 if you look at the fourth 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:40.799
 the photo in the top row is better there 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.430
 just shows the angle that suits Do 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:49.200
 people with a round face if you 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.659
 take a photo right then the face will 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.780
 too round it will be very very 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:57.150
 around to avoid it or you 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.140
 turns a little face in three 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.069
 quarters and 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.739
 and this is there and the perfect most suitable 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.500
 for you, the angle can of course 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.950
 be photographed and right if you are 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:16.010
 look at the bottom row 3 photo 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.010
 the girl looks straight but she closes 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.209
 face 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:25.230
 hair covers hair part of the face and 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:28.620
 then this option is also acceptable but 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.109
 the main points are taking pictures in 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.120
 three quarters a little 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:40.030
 we try to photograph 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:42.819
 and close close a little bit 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:49.330
 hair face if there is such 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:53.409
 able to write 7 is mine yet 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:58.120
 one option is for example this is 8 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:04:02.769
 The photograph is open in the shadow of the face 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.079
 here I am the shadow of the hair and so in general 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.769
 can use anything for the shadow 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:15.630
 that is, that part of the face was in the shadow and 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:19.900
 it will be too it will be too option 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:22.389
 suitable so we parsed 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:26.669
 basic perspective and if you have 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.669
 any questions then ask them
