fora<00:00:00.690> tv'<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:02.340> world<00:00:02.639> is<00:00:03.120> thinking

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.930 

now<00:00:08.360> what<00:00:08.540> I've<00:00:08.630> just<00:00:08.660> just<00:00:09.170> described<00:00:09.590> is<00:00:09.830> how

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:09.940 
now what I've just just described is how

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.789 
now what I've just just described is how
stars<00:00:10.940> that<00:00:11.270> are<00:00:11.360> born<00:00:11.600> with<00:00:11.780> less<00:00:12.080> than<00:00:12.500> eight

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
stars that are born with less than eight

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.590 
stars that are born with less than eight
times<00:00:13.129> the<00:00:13.400> mass<00:00:13.549> of<00:00:13.760> the<00:00:13.879> Sun<00:00:14.090> live<00:00:14.360> and<00:00:14.510> die

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:14.600 
times the mass of the Sun live and die

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.900 
times the mass of the Sun live and die
they<00:00:15.200> become<00:00:15.350> main-sequence<00:00:15.889> stars<00:00:16.280> and<00:00:16.640> then

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
they become main-sequence stars and then

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.180 
they become main-sequence stars and then
red<00:00:17.150> giants<00:00:17.570> and<00:00:17.720> finally<00:00:18.289> end<00:00:18.440> up<00:00:18.530> as<00:00:18.770> white

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.190 
red giants and finally end up as white

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.970 
red giants and finally end up as white
dwarfs<00:00:19.640> in<00:00:20.140> contrast<00:00:21.140> stars<00:00:21.470> that<00:00:21.710> are<00:00:21.800> born

dwarfs in contrast stars that are born

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.710 
dwarfs in contrast stars that are born
with<00:00:22.039> more<00:00:22.460> than<00:00:22.820> eight<00:00:22.940> times<00:00:23.119> the<00:00:23.359> mass<00:00:23.540> of

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
with more than eight times the mass of

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.410 
with more than eight times the mass of
the<00:00:23.780> Sun<00:00:24.080> they<00:00:24.830> go<00:00:24.980> out<00:00:25.100> with<00:00:25.250> a<00:00:25.280> bang<00:00:25.550> they

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
the Sun they go out with a bang they

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.330 
the Sun they go out with a bang they
start<00:00:26.660> life<00:00:26.870> as<00:00:27.080> bright<00:00:27.350> blue<00:00:27.680> main<00:00:27.920> sequence

stars<00:00:28.550> in<00:00:28.790> most<00:00:29.000> cases<00:00:29.240> they<00:00:29.480> expand<00:00:29.930> into

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
stars in most cases they expand into

yes<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:41.690> first<00:00:41.930> day<00:00:42.170> they<00:00:42.350> saw<00:00:42.590> it<00:00:42.650> it<00:00:42.890> was<00:00:43.130> the

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
yes the first day they saw it it was the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.069 
yes the first day they saw it it was the
4th<00:00:43.730> of<00:00:43.970> July

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
now as a massive star explodes the outer

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.950 
now as a massive star explodes the outer

star just ten or fifteen miles across

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.940 
star just ten or fifteen miles across
called<00:01:05.479> a<00:01:05.540> neutron<00:01:05.960> star<00:01:05.990> because<00:01:06.649> it's<00:01:06.770> made

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
called a neutron star because it's made

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.160 
called a neutron star because it's made
of<00:01:07.070> neutrons<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:07.670> one<00:01:08.060> young<00:01:08.329> B<00:01:08.570> stars<00:01:08.899> can

of neutrons and one young B stars can

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.440 
of neutrons and one young B stars can
spend<00:01:09.439> very<00:01:09.619> fast<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.310> emit<00:01:10.520> deadly

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
spend very fast and emit deadly

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.419 
spend very fast and emit deadly
radiation<00:01:11.780> in<00:01:12.170> a<00:01:12.259> beam<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:12.709> every<00:01:13.219> time<00:01:13.399> that

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
radiation in a beam and every time that

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:16.510 
radiation in a beam and every time that
beam<00:01:13.789> sweeps<00:01:14.149> by<00:01:14.359> earth<00:01:14.709> we<00:01:15.709> see<00:01:15.920> a<00:01:15.950> pulse<00:01:16.219> of

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
beam sweeps by earth we see a pulse of

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.830 
beam sweeps by earth we see a pulse of
radiation<00:01:16.549> so<00:01:17.119> we<00:01:17.209> call<00:01:17.359> these<00:01:17.479> objects

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
radiation so we call these objects

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.919 
radiation so we call these objects
pulsars<00:01:18.350> here<00:01:19.189> is<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.549> Pulsar<00:01:19.999> at<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.479> center

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
pulsars here is the Pulsar at the center

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:22.690 
pulsars here is the Pulsar at the center
of<00:01:20.959> the<00:01:21.229> Crab<00:01:21.409> Nebula<00:01:21.740> it's<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.069> pink<00:01:22.249> object

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
of the Crab Nebula it's the pink object

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.760 
of the Crab Nebula it's the pink object
in<00:01:22.789> the<00:01:22.909> center<00:01:23.149> of<00:01:23.209> this<00:01:23.329> image<00:01:23.569> this<00:01:24.380> is<00:01:24.560> the

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
in the center of this image this is the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.330 
in the center of this image this is the
star<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:25.159> was<00:01:25.490> born<00:01:25.789> in<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.539> explosion<00:01:27.079> of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
star that was born in the explosion of

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.029 
star that was born in the explosion of
1054<00:01:28.840> now<00:01:29.840> as<00:01:29.959> I<00:01:30.049> mentioned<00:01:30.439> these<00:01:30.529> objects

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
1054 now as I mentioned these objects

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.279 
1054 now as I mentioned these objects
are<00:01:31.130> just<00:01:31.159> 10<00:01:31.549> or<00:01:31.729> 15<00:01:32.060> miles<00:01:32.299> across<00:01:32.659> but<00:01:33.139> they

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
are just 10 or 15 miles across but they

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.169 
are just 10 or 15 miles across but they
have<00:01:33.499> more<00:01:33.829> mass<00:01:34.159> than<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.609> Sun<00:01:34.819> so<00:01:35.029> they're

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
have more mass than the Sun so they're

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:38.260 
have more mass than the Sun so they're
immensely<00:01:35.659> dense<00:01:36.139> and<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:37.159> gravity<00:01:37.429> of<00:01:38.090> their

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
immensely dense and the gravity of their

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.120 
immensely dense and the gravity of their
surface<00:01:38.479> is<00:01:38.810> enormous<00:01:39.349> if<00:01:39.529> you<00:01:39.619> were<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.920> drop

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
surface is enormous if you were to drop

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.699 
surface is enormous if you were to drop
a<00:01:40.189> pebble<00:01:40.549> from<00:01:40.939> a<00:01:40.969> height<00:01:41.179> of<00:01:41.209> 400<00:01:41.659> feet<00:01:41.869> above

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709 
a pebble from a height of 400 feet above

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:44.800 
a pebble from a height of 400 feet above
a<00:01:43.039> neutron<00:01:43.399> star<00:01:43.639> would<00:01:43.819> smash<00:01:44.119> into<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.599> star

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
a neutron star would smash into the star

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.910 
a neutron star would smash into the star
surface<00:01:45.229> at<00:01:45.380> five<00:01:45.679> million<00:01:46.189> miles<00:01:46.999> per<00:01:47.209> hour

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
surface at five million miles per hour

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.069 
surface at five million miles per hour
but<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:48.979> know<00:01:49.099> for<00:01:49.399> some<00:01:49.609> of<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:49.999> that's<00:01:50.899> just

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
but I know for some of you that's just

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.839

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
well I introduced you to the black hole

well I introduced you to the black hole
black<00:01:55.880> holes<00:01:56.149> are<00:01:56.299> something<00:01:56.539> else<00:01:56.630> that<00:01:56.929> a

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:56.959 
black holes are something else that a

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.260 
black holes are something else that a
massive<00:01:57.259> star<00:01:57.679> can<00:01:57.859> leave<00:01:58.039> behind<00:01:58.249> after<00:01:58.999> it

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
massive star can leave behind after it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.690

explode<00:01:59.689> the<00:01:59.929> black<00:02:00.109> hole<00:02:00.349> is<00:02:00.499> so<00:02:00.529> dense<00:02:01.099> with

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
explode the black hole is so dense with

explode the black hole is so dense with
so<00:02:01.969> much<00:02:02.090> gravity<00:02:02.329> that<00:02:02.630> nothing<00:02:03.229> can<00:02:03.469> escape

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
so much gravity that nothing can escape

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.159 
so much gravity that nothing can escape
