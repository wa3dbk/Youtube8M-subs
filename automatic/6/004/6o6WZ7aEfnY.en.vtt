00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
hi I'm Erin gasser 19 through some basic

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.170 
hi I'm Erin gasser 19 through some basic
offensive<00:00:16.920> hand<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.369> feet<00:00:17.550> combinations

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
offensive hand and feet combinations

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.849 
offensive hand and feet combinations
more<00:00:18.630> advanced<00:00:18.869> ones<00:00:19.170> will<00:00:19.320> be<00:00:19.350> covered<00:00:19.740> in

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
more advanced ones will be covered in

more advanced ones will be covered in
another<00:00:20.039> video<00:00:20.400> before<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.300> show<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
another video before I show you the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.689 
another video before I show you the
combinations<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.859> want<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.160> say<00:00:23.369> that

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
combinations I just want to say that

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.340 
combinations I just want to say that
some<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.029> them<00:00:24.150> might<00:00:24.480> not<00:00:24.510> work<00:00:24.810> for<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.140> if

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
some of them might not work for you if

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.589 
some of them might not work for you if
that's<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.189> case<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:26.699> don't<00:00:26.970> use<00:00:27.180> them<00:00:27.420> or

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
that's the case then don't use them or

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.200 
that's the case then don't use them or
vary<00:00:28.199> them<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.680> make<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.920> efficient<00:00:29.640> for<00:00:30.029> you

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
vary them to make it efficient for you

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.120 
vary them to make it efficient for you
we<00:00:30.779> are<00:00:30.810> demonstrating<00:00:31.470> without<00:00:31.800> general

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
we are demonstrating without general

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.620 
we are demonstrating without general
spiral<00:00:32.460> movements<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.300> see<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
spiral movements so you can see the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.170 
spiral movements so you can see the
technique<00:00:33.960> more<00:00:34.230> clearly<00:00:37.910> with<00:00:38.910> all<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
technique more clearly with all the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.060 
technique more clearly with all the
combinations<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:39.989> video<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.590> idea<00:00:40.920> is

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
combinations in this video the idea is

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.470 
combinations in this video the idea is
to<00:00:41.219> draw<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.460> guard<00:00:41.790> or<00:00:42.030> make<00:00:42.210> them<00:00:42.360> move

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
to draw the guard or make them move

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.360 
to draw the guard or make them move
their<00:00:42.660> body<00:00:42.870> with<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> first<00:00:43.530> technique<00:00:43.950> so

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
their body with the first technique so

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.500 
their body with the first technique so
they're<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> position<00:00:44.969> where<00:00:45.390> it's

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
they're in a position where it's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.880 
they're in a position where it's
difficult<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:46.050> them<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.230> stop<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.680> next

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
difficult for them to stop the next

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:57.410 
difficult for them to stop the next
technique<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.340> follows<00:00:55.760> you<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:56.910> finish<00:00:57.120> on

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
technique that follows you can finish on

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.970 
technique that follows you can finish on
a<00:00:57.480> straight-line<00:00:57.809> technique<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.649> keep<00:00:58.829> your

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
a straight-line technique to keep your

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.220 
a straight-line technique to keep your
opponent<00:00:59.340> away<00:00:59.430> or<00:00:59.820> help<00:01:00.120> set<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.600> longer<00:01:01.050> range

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
opponent away or help set a longer range

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:10.700 
opponent away or help set a longer range
technique<00:01:08.600> remember<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:09.869> all<00:01:09.900> combinations

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
technique remember with all combinations

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.620 
technique remember with all combinations
you<00:01:10.950> can<00:01:11.070> vary<00:01:11.340> quite<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.820> your<00:01:11.939> technique<00:01:12.330> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
you can vary quite of your technique to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:21.530 
you can vary quite of your technique to
strike<00:01:12.869> different<00:01:13.260> areas<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.920> are<00:01:14.100> open<00:01:20.540> you

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
strike different areas that are open you

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.270 
strike different areas that are open you
can<00:01:21.750> feint<00:01:22.020> order<00:01:22.409> me<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.590> draw<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:22.979> guard

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
can feint order me to draw the guard

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.100 
can feint order me to draw the guard
instead<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.880> actually<00:01:24.240> doing<00:01:24.270> each<00:01:24.810> technique

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.750 

have<00:01:32.110> you<00:01:32.230> got<00:01:32.440> ready<00:01:32.680> after<00:01:32.920> you<00:01:33.190> kick<00:01:33.400> so<00:01:33.730> you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
have you got ready after you kick so you

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:43.110 
have you got ready after you kick so you
are<00:01:33.940> ready<00:01:34.180> to<00:01:34.270> use<00:01:34.510> your<00:01:34.690> hands<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:42.729> can<00:01:42.910> vary

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
are ready to use your hands you can vary

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.880 
are ready to use your hands you can vary
the<00:01:43.300> enviar<00:01:43.570> combinations<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.440> give<00:01:44.590> you<00:01:44.710> more

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
the enviar combinations to give you more

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.950 
the enviar combinations to give you more
variety<00:01:45.400> and<00:01:45.610> make<00:01:45.910> you<00:01:46.000> less<00:01:46.180> predictable<00:01:46.750> in

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
variety and make you less predictable in

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.480 
variety and make you less predictable in
regards<00:01:47.500> to<00:01:47.560> what<00:01:47.800> you<00:01:47.920> will<00:01:48.070> do<00:01:48.250> after

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
regards to what you will do after

00:01:48.490 --> 00:02:08.820

throwing<00:01:49.060> your<00:01:49.240> first<00:01:49.479> technique<00:02:07.709> there<00:02:08.709> are

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
throwing your first technique there are

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.109 
throwing your first technique there are
a<00:02:08.860> lot<00:02:09.009> more<00:02:09.040> combinations<00:02:09.429> that<00:02:09.820> I<00:02:09.970> could

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
a lot more combinations that I could

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.699 
a lot more combinations that I could
show<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:10.390> but<00:02:10.750> I'm<00:02:10.869> sure<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:11.230> can<00:02:11.440> make<00:02:11.530> your

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
show you but I'm sure you can make your

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.440 
show you but I'm sure you can make your
own<00:02:11.739> ones<00:02:12.160> from<00:02:12.400> these<00:02:12.580> examples<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:13.360> have

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
own ones from these examples and have

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.180 
own ones from these examples and have
different<00:02:13.750> techniques<00:02:14.260> in<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.830> make<00:02:14.980> them

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
different techniques in to make them

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
to think of different combinations then

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.760 
to think of different combinations then
