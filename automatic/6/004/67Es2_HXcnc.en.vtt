00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.799
 [Music] 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:10.320
 hi defined them 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.969
 I recycle a nice rest to my 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.389
 children I was small and so 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.870
 generate decorated with pieces of tissue 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.870
 recycled 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.580
 that was the metal trash bin 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.849
 I used my tissues early August 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.269
 we are the small stone pin decisions and 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.040
 guns on the side 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.050
 so I have in full bands 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.469
 issues that I received an email 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.469
 derisory t-shirts sheets 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.370
 I made bands to use also 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.660
 Not long ago in companies 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.390
 are going to stay full there is so quickly rapido 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.860
 that's it but still practices not that 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.449
 here I am used mostly for metro or 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.120
 still the trash voualit on the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.430
 edge which includes oxidized rusty since the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.750
 common metal years they did I 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.979
 will stick it on it again so 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:13.040
 unconfirmed but to eat there as 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:18.750
 the name is born judged moody's 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:21.110
 our client targeted the parliament walls on 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.110
 resort 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:30.250
 I have the banks the abe home the 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.250
 novelties is won at 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.009
 and I showed a lot less for effect 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:47.899
 from the left we'll say for it to be 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:51.350
 that strings so a sentence dg - 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:55.039
 konÃ© unpinning back of Europeans from 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:01.670
 brake still in progress and after I did 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:03.979
 also the edge of the water and the mud after 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.479
 I took the names of the eighteen so 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.759
 you will fall on them if they are more 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.030
 thick we did it make it rattle spiral of 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.700
 group - big and I twisted like that 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:20.090
 you will first see a point of 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:25.930
 glue I knew the end of the band 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.930
 fabric or 3d is well known 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.579
 I took in front of haggling 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.390
 fabrics and I had the police and three 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.920
 are brought to simple chapuis to make 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.750
 spirals that I had a very 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.130
 Probable weight so the spirals 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:46.790
 vaudois it was easier when you are 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:51.200
 parties have like that that deprived of 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.120
 current coll here I stuck to the turn 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.419
 I made the spirals that lack the 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:03.169
 small veil in iran colors the 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:09.079
 colors the cracks good with a lot 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:11.799
 of patience and ben j to conclude I 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.799
 all done for that 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.469
 [Music] 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.800
 after when I tell you if lebron down and 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.570
 fled languages 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:41.380
 necessarily arms so tissues and 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:44.620
 then I was also but on a small 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:50.250
 supply chain and when the debate you 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.250
 will in the years make an accused 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:59.670
 denouncing without having dominated the big 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.670
 and the shops 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.210
 how I proceeded 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.799
 [Music] 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.849
 you see that's what I leave it 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.879
 pass the little ones so the principle of 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:58.759
 marc craffin madiot in here I have so 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:00.800
 looked for a lot of humans mavs in 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:02.900
 discovering that his daughter was all 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.560
 happy that your furniture edge 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:11.699
 so that was the cause 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.699
 [Music] 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.350
 [Music] 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:54.540
 so dangerous no fishermen 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:56.210
 network sheets between recycle 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.790
 royal 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:04.470
 a satire the safim runs n 100% 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:06.060
 recycled and after invested in small 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.880
 corners come in common between the 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:12.030
 July spirals live like that 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.480
 we see from France eliminated from the old 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.430
 buttons of a small stone so it's 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.310
 Argentina 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:22.470
 I filled yen always with 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:26.190
 patience I broke up because these little ones 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.960
 points the minimal weight in the center of the 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:34.950
 dispute 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:39.230
 and here it is a different trash 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.230
 origins - the possible 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:57.350
 I hope you turn on us 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:00.380
 have used our power tanks to 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:03.790
 shut up talking and I'm waiting for you 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.790
 the next video goodbye
