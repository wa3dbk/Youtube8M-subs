00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.289 

version<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.560> version<00:02:47.590> 3<00:02:48.280> apparently<00:02:48.760> and

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
version to version 3 apparently and

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.080 
version to version 3 apparently and
here's<00:02:52.299> the<00:02:52.480> card<00:02:52.690> list<00:02:53.549> this<00:02:54.549> is<00:02:54.730> pretty<00:02:54.910> much

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
here's the card list this is pretty much

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.449 
here's the card list this is pretty much
just<00:02:55.299> so<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.630> you<00:02:55.720> can<00:02:55.870> keep<00:02:56.019> track<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.459> your

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
just so that you can keep track of your

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.130 
just so that you can keep track of your
collection<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.359> actually<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.750> might<00:02:58.959> come

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
collection and actually that might come

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.680 
collection and actually that might come
in<00:02:59.230> handy<00:02:59.260> for<00:02:59.560> me<00:03:00.180> but<00:03:01.180> I've<00:03:01.269> already<00:03:01.420> got<00:03:01.600> to

opening<00:03:31.359> the<00:03:31.600> booster<00:03:31.989> boxes<00:03:32.440> eventually<00:03:33.480> and

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
opening the booster boxes eventually and

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.150 
opening the booster boxes eventually and
i<00:03:35.139> just<00:03:35.200> don't<00:03:35.530> know<00:03:35.590> when<00:03:35.799> that's<00:03:35.950> going<00:03:36.100> to

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
there then I'll come on one piece and

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.560 
there then I'll come on one piece and
you<00:05:53.270> got<00:05:53.419> a<00:05:53.449> counter<00:05:53.840> here<00:05:54.020> this<00:05:54.229> counter<00:05:54.680> is<00:05:54.710> a

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
you got a counter here this counter is a

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:01.020 
you got a counter here this counter is a
chancy<00:05:56.830> you<00:05:57.830> see<00:05:58.159> that

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:07.360 

and<00:06:02.030> of<00:06:02.150> course<00:06:03.039> packs<00:06:04.039> down<00:06:04.280> a<00:06:04.340> rule<00:06:04.699> book<00:06:06.370> so

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
and of course packs down a rule book so

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.869 
and of course packs down a rule book so
got<00:06:07.490> the<00:06:07.550> damage<00:06:07.819> counters<00:06:08.030> in<00:06:08.449> this<00:06:08.750> case<00:06:09.020> are

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:09.879 
got the damage counters in this case are

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:13.600 
got the damage counters in this case are
these<00:06:10.879> cardboard<00:06:11.330> counters<00:06:12.129> you<00:06:13.129> can<00:06:13.280> pop<00:06:13.490> out

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
these cardboard counters you can pop out

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.390 
these cardboard counters you can pop out
so<00:06:14.479> in<00:06:14.659> this<00:06:14.780> pack<00:06:15.020> you<00:06:15.199> get<00:06:15.379> a<00:06:15.409> holographic

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
so in this pack you get a holographic

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:23.499 
so in this pack you get a holographic
