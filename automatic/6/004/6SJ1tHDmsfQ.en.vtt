worst horrors I can imagine and that is

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.699 
worst horrors I can imagine and that is
not<00:02:34.579> something<00:02:34.819> on<00:02:35.090> my<00:02:35.180> to-do<00:02:35.450> list<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:36.560> is

not something on my to-do list it is

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.540

terrifying

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.870 
terrifying
and<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:39.390> would<00:02:40.050> probably<00:02:40.260> run<00:02:40.680> away<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.190> would

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
and I would probably run away I would

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.430 
and I would probably run away I would
like<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.240> say<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.570> I<00:02:42.600> would<00:02:42.840> actually<00:02:42.960> help

like to say that I would actually help

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.440 
like to say that I would actually help
and<00:02:43.770> of<00:02:44.250> course<00:02:44.340> I'd<00:02:44.700> run<00:02:44.880> away<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.120> get<00:02:45.240> help

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
and of course I'd run away and get help

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.360 
and of course I'd run away and get help
and<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:45.660> would<00:02:46.020> like<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.830> say<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.190> would

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
and I would like to say that I would

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.790 
and I would like to say that I would
actually<00:02:47.550> try<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.570> get<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.870> man<00:02:49.080> off<00:02:49.320> of<00:02:49.380> them

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
actually try to get the man off of them

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.780 
actually try to get the man off of them
but<00:02:50.010> frankly<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:50.970> am<00:02:51.320> only<00:02:52.320> 17<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.040> I'm<00:02:53.190> really

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
but frankly I am only 17 and I'm really

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.840 
but frankly I am only 17 and I'm really
not<00:02:53.940> looking<00:02:54.000> forward<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.660> having<00:02:55.320> someone

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
not looking forward to having someone

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.090 
not looking forward to having someone
like<00:02:56.850> having<00:02:57.600> me<00:02:57.690> for<00:02:57.870> seconds<00:02:58.350> because<00:02:58.710> that

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
like having me for seconds because that

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.120 
like having me for seconds because that
is<00:02:59.310> just<00:02:59.360> terrifying<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.600> even<00:03:00.690> think<00:03:01.020> about

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
is just terrifying to even think about

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.290

there right because they're just like
they<00:03:45.510> don't<00:03:45.660> have<00:03:45.690> any<00:03:45.959> sense<00:03:46.260> of<00:03:46.470> pain<00:03:47.040> so

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
they don't have any sense of pain so

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.610 
they don't have any sense of pain so
they<00:03:47.730> will<00:03:47.880> just<00:03:48.120> do<00:03:48.480> what<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:49.170> would<00:03:49.410> assume

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
they will just do what I would assume

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.340 
they will just do what I would assume
zombies<00:03:50.100> would<00:03:50.220> be<00:03:50.370> they<00:03:50.489> will<00:03:50.640> go<00:03:50.790> crazy<00:03:51.050> so<00:03:52.050> I

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
zombies would be they will go crazy so I

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.860 
zombies would be they will go crazy so I
really<00:03:53.160> don't<00:03:53.310> see<00:03:53.370> how<00:03:53.550> me<00:03:54.360> hitting<00:03:54.540> them

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
really don't see how me hitting them

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.729 
really don't see how me hitting them
would<00:03:55.470> actually<00:03:56.630> stop<00:03:57.630> them<00:03:57.900> so<00:03:58.080> i<00:03:58.110> would

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
would actually stop them so i would

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.550 
would actually stop them so i would
definitely<00:03:59.510> just<00:04:00.510> book<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:00.930> i<00:04:01.080> would<00:04:01.260> run<00:04:01.440> away

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
definitely just book it i would run away

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.170 
definitely just book it i would run away
because<00:04:01.830> this<00:04:02.130> is<00:04:02.250> just<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.489> terrifying<00:04:02.970> thing

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
because this is just a terrifying thing

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.880
