00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.440
 make a comparison is between two micro 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.180
 phones that are widely used are very 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:51.020
 used in studios 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:55.440
 I am speaking here of the microphone to have 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.680
 by 2020 the technical audio is a 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.989
 well versatile microphone from the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.940
 most used microphones is for guys 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.949
 that is producing home studio is a 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.060
 microphone of a a very cool price one 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.490
 price well in mind 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.140
 it costs an average of 700 reais you will 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.840
 find this microphone by that average 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.490
 price is not the other one I'm going to show 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.590
 for you a little more microphone 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:24.630
 Expensive, it's not a microphone. 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.580
 It's the c 214 You're going to tell me more then one. 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.729
 fair comparison, because it is 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.040
 practically two thousand reais is with the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.549
 high dollar and microphone is costing 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.549
 on average 1950 2,000 two thousand and one hundred 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.840
 is the average price of this microphone and 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.899
 a very good microphone, very cool 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.850
 microphone of kg you 214 but I could 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.259
 make a fair comparison is the price of 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:54.119
 of acarajé 214 can buy almost 3 of the 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:56.250
 a320 daud technique but suddenly its 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.770

 It was better than that, I want it. 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.760
 actually show a comparison between 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.860
 Both of you before I buy this one, I 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.920
 I went looking for many channels on youtube in 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.510
 every corner see if there was something 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.850
 compare between the two and did not find 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.260
 so I decided to make this video here 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.660

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.520

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.070
 goal that is worth showing 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.600
 result and you will say whether it 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.730
 pen or not 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.320

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.520
 We will test the technical download 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.709
 until 2020 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.020
 I will not use any processing of the 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.300
 channel of this microphone he will do 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.680
 a test an option as if it were a 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.080
 option I'll stick it straight in the 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.470
 the audio interface of a 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.570
 Dada interference will not focus raid 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.930
 to hit neither an equalizer plugin is 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.940
 a price nothing simply the sound without 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.459
 no processing are you analyzing 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.850
 as natural as possible
