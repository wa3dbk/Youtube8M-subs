blade disc blades as well and you can

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.929 
blade disc blades as well and you can
see<00:01:32.200> again<00:01:32.470> despite<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.130> wear<00:01:33.430> that<00:01:33.790> we're

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
see again despite the wear that we're

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.210 
see again despite the wear that we're
probably<00:01:34.180> cutting<00:01:34.930> in<00:01:35.079> three<00:01:35.439> or<00:01:35.530> four<00:01:35.770> inches

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
with this disc but the main idea is just

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.219 
with this disc but the main idea is just
to<00:01:40.390> bury<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:42.310> biomass<00:01:42.909> the<00:01:43.270> wheat<00:01:43.479> that<00:01:43.990> we've

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
to bury the biomass the wheat that we've

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.880 
to bury the biomass the wheat that we've
grown<00:01:45.219> through<00:01:45.579> the<00:01:45.640> springtime<00:01:46.060> and

grown through the springtime and

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.319 
grown through the springtime and
