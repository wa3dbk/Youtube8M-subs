00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
heater core and then what you got is the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.720 
heater core and then what you got is the
pulley<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.730> connected<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:49.520> the<00:00:50.520> water

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
pulley that is connected to the water

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
and after you take this pulley off then

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:47.470 
and after you take this pulley off then
you<00:01:40.440> will<00:01:40.650> see<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:42.720> water<00:01:42.900> pump<00:01:45.650> very<00:01:46.650> clear

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
you will see the water pump very clear

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.100 
you will see the water pump very clear
okay<00:01:48.480> what<00:01:48.660> I<00:01:48.690> did<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.470> just<00:01:50.430> tapped<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:51.840> pulley

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
okay what I did I just tapped the pulley

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.400 
okay what I did I just tapped the pulley
and<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:54.410> then<00:01:55.410> just<00:01:55.440> pry<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.960> what<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:57.990> did<00:01:58.380> I

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
and and then just pry it what I did I

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:07.760 
and and then just pry it what I did I
use<00:01:58.980> the<00:02:02.060> this<00:02:03.060> ratchet<00:02:04.130> retched<00:02:05.300> it<00:02:06.300> in<00:02:06.840> and

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
use the this ratchet retched it in and

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.790 
use the this ratchet retched it in and
then<00:02:08.930> stick<00:02:09.930> and<00:02:10.770> there<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.550> goes

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
then stick and there it goes

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.250 
then stick and there it goes
so<00:02:13.800> now<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.520> got<00:02:14.730> your<00:02:16.430> pulley<00:02:17.430> out<00:02:18.260> you

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
so now that you got your pulley out you

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:27.650 
so now that you got your pulley out you
can<00:02:19.530> see<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:22.880> water<00:02:23.880> pump<00:02:24.620> this<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:26.480> what<00:02:27.480> I'm

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
can see the water pump this is what I'm

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:37.340 
can see the water pump this is what I'm
trying<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.520> get<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.670> out<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:31.100> need<00:02:33.650> 13<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:36.350> try

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
trying to get it out you need 13 and try

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.010 
trying to get it out you need 13 and try
to<00:02:37.410> take<00:02:37.770> them
