00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.660
Today I will be making samosas.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.340
This is mouthwatering Indian appetizer.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.840
And I think everybody knows this already.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.860
The recipe I am going to make it’s a traditional North Indian recipe.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.640
And will make 8 samosas.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.620
For this I need 1/2 cup of all purpose flour.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.780
1 teaspoon of suji

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.650
You can get the suji from Indian grocery store.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.340
It’s also known as semolina flour.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.040
Pinch of salt

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.440
1 tablespoon of oil

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
Plus 1 teaspoon.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.840
Mix this together.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:19.160
Now I need 1/4 cup of lukewarm water.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.820
I have saved little bit water before so I am going to add it.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.680
And knead for about a minute.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.480
After making the dough it should be sitting for at least for 20 minutes.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.400
My dough is ready.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.020
And I will cover this and keep it one side.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.310
And mean time I will start my filling.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.280
For filling I need,

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.970
2 medium size red boiled potatoes

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.120
1/3 cup of green peas

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.540
2 tablespoons of oil

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.580
I like to use canola oil.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.220
1/2 teaspoon of cumin seeds

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.400
1 teaspoon of coriander powder

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.300
1/4 teaspoon of red chilli powder

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.520
1/2 teaspoon of garam masala

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.370
Garam masala is a blend of several species.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.530
And you can find this in Indian grocery store.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.110
1 teaspoon of amchoor powder

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.900
This is a dried mango powder

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.780
and that’s also available in Indian grocery store.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.220
2 medium size green chilli, seeded and chopped.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.540
I already have 2 potatoes

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.020
which I boiled and cubed them small.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.360
When you are boiling the potatoes

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.000
make sure they are not mushy.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.220
They are still firm and tender.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.000
Now I am going to heat the oil.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.740
My stove is on, medium high.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.080
Will put 2 tablespoons of oil.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.760
1/2 teaspoon of cumin seeds

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.540
Cumin seeds is cracking.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.480
It’s time to add the green peas.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.020
Stir it for a minute.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.120
Now we are going to add 1 teaspoon of coriander powder.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.080
1/2 teaspoon of garam masala

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.600
Green chillies

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.000
And again stir it.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.440
Add the potatoes.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.800
And 3 spoons of salt.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.400
It has to be stir fried for about 2 minutes.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.000
It has been about 2 minutes.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.820
And I am going to add amchoor (mango powder)

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.360
1 teaspoon.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.040
Mix it.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.340
Now this is the right time to taste your filling.

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.339
If it needs more salt or pepper.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.700
Because green chilli is very hard to say how hot it is going to be.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.180
Basically that is the reason I take out the seeds.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.070
And I have not added the red chilli powder.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.760
So I will see if I need more heat then I am going to add.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.280
It is good.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.660
But I think I need more salt.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.780
And I will put 1/2 teaspoon of chilli powder.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.580
It looks good.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.300
And it needs to cool off before we fill samosas.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.900
Dough has been resting for about 20 minutes.

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:04.119
I am going to knead just for few more second.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.940
And I have put it my filling in the plate.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.420
So it gets cool off little faster.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.810
And it’s cold and ready to be filled.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.030
I am going to divide the dough into 4 equal parts.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:35.040
And make balls and press them.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.100
It’s time to roll.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.340
You have to roll them about 6 inch in diameter.
