and<00:01:18.310> that<00:01:18.430> ties<00:01:18.670> into<00:01:18.939> our<00:01:19.479> Tommaso<00:01:20.289> carbon

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
and that ties into our Tommaso carbon

about<00:01:33.640> this<00:01:33.880> is<00:01:34.180> nice<00:01:34.479> what<00:01:34.810> they<00:01:34.930> call<00:01:35.109> 12k

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
about this is nice what they call 12k

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.980 
about this is nice what they call 12k
finish<00:01:36.490> on<00:01:36.729> it<00:01:36.759> with<00:01:37.420> different<00:01:37.630> carbon

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
finish on it with different carbon

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.319 
finish on it with different carbon
finishes<00:01:38.619> there's<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.430> hell<00:01:39.579> you<00:01:39.729> d<00:01:39.939> which<00:01:40.180> is

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
finishes there's the hell you d which is

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.249 
finishes there's the hell you d which is
kind<00:01:41.289> of<00:01:41.350> a<00:01:41.469> black<00:01:41.979> looking<00:01:43.020> three<00:01:44.020> came

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
kind of a black looking three came

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.980 
kind of a black looking three came
should<00:01:44.560> really<00:01:44.829> tiny<00:01:45.100> we<00:01:45.759> even<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.210> 12k<00:01:46.750> it's

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
should really tiny we even the 12k it's

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.690 
should really tiny we even the 12k it's
kind<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.229> a<00:01:47.320> bigger<00:01:47.560> block<00:01:47.890> with<00:01:48.219> you<00:01:48.340> which<00:01:48.549> I

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
kind of a bigger block with you which I

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.149 
kind of a bigger block with you which I
think<00:01:48.729> pops<00:01:49.479> really<00:01:49.840> nice<00:01:50.020> because<00:01:50.229> we<00:01:51.009> like

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
think pops really nice because we like

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.950 
think pops really nice because we like
the<00:01:51.310> bikes<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:51.670> kind<00:01:51.880> of<00:01:51.939> screen<00:01:52.299> performance

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
the bikes to kind of screen performance

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.260 
the bikes to kind of screen performance
but<00:01:53.259> not<00:01:53.469> overdo<00:01:54.009> it<00:01:54.039> and<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.670> think<00:01:54.909> we<00:01:55.000> hit<00:01:55.119> the

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
but not overdo it and I think we hit the

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.039 
but not overdo it and I think we hit the
target<00:01:55.689> of<00:01:55.810> this<00:01:55.990> one<00:01:56.229> so<00:01:57.039> I'm<00:01:57.159> a<00:01:57.189> 12k<00:01:57.850> frame<00:01:58.270> we

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
target of this one so I'm a 12k frame we

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.289 
target of this one so I'm a 12k frame we
saw<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.259> ad<00:01:59.469> will<00:01:59.679> pop<00:01:59.979> with<00:02:00.249> a<00:02:00.280> white<00:02:00.640> FSA

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
saw the ad will pop with a white FSA

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.560 
saw the ad will pop with a white FSA
crank<00:02:01.749> now<00:02:02.380> this<00:02:02.499> is<00:02:02.619> a<00:02:02.729> 5034<00:02:03.729> gossamer

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570
