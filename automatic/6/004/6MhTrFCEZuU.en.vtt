 very good here we will be commenting and 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.330
 will bring you a new video tutorial of 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.900
 how to install 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.800
 Customized aspects in the book flames 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.840
 well the first thing we're going to have to 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.789
 to do is to enter the link that I am going to 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.800
 give in the description 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.839
 which will be the link of the program that 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.699
 let's use to install it our 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:24.699
 corners we download it 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.940
 and once downloaded we pass it to 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.730
 desk 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.930
 Now what we have to do is 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.900
 we open it 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.329
 and we select everything good we create a 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:46.390
 new folder first 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:49.180
 with the name wait if you want 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.290
 and you pass everything to the folder 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.360
 bad hour 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.190
 As you can see here we have a handful of 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.550
 things we're going to go to the end below the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.750
 everything and you see skin installer ultimate the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.750
 what is an application what gray 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.690
 ok ok and we have this to me that is 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.920
 will charge 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:18.770
 and it will give us at the end 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.770
 100% I already have it in another folder 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.640
 with that 100% we're going to go now 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.460
 once you have already installed it 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.540
 you have used for the first time you will leave 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.190
 this takes nothing to open and it's worth looking 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.590
 here I have all the skis installed 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.940
 and what we are going to do now is go to 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.350
 a link that I will leave also the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.230
 description that you can also look 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.730
 here that will be the place where we will choose 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:53.480
 our custom skins 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.619
 we are going to go to the lic craft dotcom 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:00.710

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:04.710
 skins and for example let's catch 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:08.450
 the same when 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.450
 with respect to being less 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.860

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.880
 have triggered I do not already have it in a 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.300
 eye 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.300
 For example, this is 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.020
 We are going to download it and it will come out 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.540
 a folder with some numbers by name 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:37.510
 Now we have to do it, we open the 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.510
 program and we give files here 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.900
 and we look for our zip file that we 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.900
 we have downloaded 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.909
 ok then these things do not come out and 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:55.170
 Forfait exit voucher we give to ok and 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:57.990
 we add to data veis 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.060
 OK perfect 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.440
 and we have it here now that we have to 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.370
 do is select it and install it 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.340

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:14.360

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:19.280

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.730

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.190
 As you can see we have the aspect of being 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.830
 changed completely brown white 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.920

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.560

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.580
 we have downloaded 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.400
 for example let's try the first 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.240
 bomb attack as you see if the 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.240
 animations are the same 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.400
