00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
when we're cooking it talked a little

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.050 
when we're cooking it talked a little
bit<00:02:36.920> about<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.640> later

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
bit about that later

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.350 
bit about that later
um<00:02:38.299> but<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:39.319> can<00:02:39.440> also<00:02:39.590> split<00:02:40.280> this<00:02:40.489> recipe

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
um but you can also split this recipe

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.449 
um but you can also split this recipe
into<00:02:41.480> smaller<00:02:41.810> ramekins<00:02:42.319> if<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.739> if<00:02:43.099> you<00:02:43.250> like

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
into smaller ramekins if you if you like

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.670 
into smaller ramekins if you if you like
just<00:02:44.000> bear<00:02:44.239> in<00:02:44.330> mind<00:02:44.360> not<00:02:45.049> to<00:02:45.200> overfill

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
just bear in mind not to overfill

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.130 
just bear in mind not to overfill
because<00:02:46.099> it<00:02:46.250> does<00:02:46.519> rise<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.420> little<00:02:47.630> bit<00:02:47.840> and

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
because it does rise a little bit and

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.910 
because it does rise a little bit and
there<00:02:48.380> is<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.500> flipping<00:02:48.980> over<00:02:49.459> of<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.920> sort

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
there is a flipping over of the the sort

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.800 
there is a flipping over of the the sort
of<00:02:51.980> cake<00:02:52.160> mixture<00:02:52.519> so<00:02:53.299> that<00:02:53.420> you've<00:02:53.599> got<00:02:53.630> the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
of cake mixture so that you've got the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.020 
of cake mixture so that you've got the
sauce<00:02:53.989> on<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.230> bottom<00:02:54.549> so<00:02:55.549> we're<00:02:55.670> going<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.849> do

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
sauce on the bottom so we're going to do

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.080 
sauce on the bottom so we're going to do
is<00:02:56.239> grab<00:02:56.540> our<00:02:56.690> mixture<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.290> just<00:02:57.410> going<00:02:57.709> to

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
is grab our mixture and just going to

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.369 
is grab our mixture and just going to
evenly<00:02:59.090> spread<00:02:59.360> this<00:02:59.510> across<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.989> base<00:03:00.140> of

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
evenly spread this across the base of

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.720 
evenly spread this across the base of
our<00:03:00.620> cooking<00:03:01.220> dish<00:03:02.650> now<00:03:03.650> we<00:03:03.709> can<00:03:03.950> work<00:03:04.069> on<00:03:04.310> the
