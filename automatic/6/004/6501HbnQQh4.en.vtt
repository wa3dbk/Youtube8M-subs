00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.600
 hello I am virginian beautician to 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.480
 home 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.900
 I will explain how to apply 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.429
 a varnish step by step 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.640
 so for that you need everything 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.840
 first of a solvent ideally to 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:26.250
 pump like that it's a lot more 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:30.510
 easy to take the product without 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.440
 wasting then you need a 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.700
 corrector to allow removal 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.719
 the wernicke over you can 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.930
 put on the skins of toothpicks a 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.780
 over six hours of a color varnish and 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:52.020
 of a top coat ideally put your 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:56.640
 foot in height degrease with 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.879
 dissolvent without acetone ideally the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:08.280
 surface of your fingernail to allow 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:11.750
 a better adhesion of the varnish then 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:17.070
 now do you a spacer theil 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:20.130
 you take a pic poop a square where 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.520
 the folded triangle and then you 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.520
 long rolled 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:33.930
 you take your toes you spend 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:38.570
 first the tip down and a 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.520
 kick down up and down 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.650
 that's how you will not touch 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.410
 not when you put the varnish 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:50.490
 now lay the first layer of 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:53.070
 10 to 6 o'clock at the same time he will 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:58.200
 to protect the nail from 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:03.170
 pigments and allow better 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.170
 adhesion of varnish 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.500
 it's important to always have a 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.840
 point of support for laying the varnish as 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.360
 that it avoids you in the job on 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:24.540
 cuticles so this shot and well your 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.989
 varnish you can rub it between 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.120
 your fingers 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:33.120
 we think about valleau warm up for a 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:35.819
 best application then take out your 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.880
 brush or to avoid having too much 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.590
 products you make small 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.310
 circular motions by touching the 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:50.700
 edge to remove the excess and scrape 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:55.500
 just one side of the brush so take a 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.860
 support and delicately filed on 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.860
 the nail 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.680
 go to next 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.769
 and so on 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.049
 it is better to take your time 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:30.359
 because if you go too fast you go 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:33.049
 put it everywhere but at least you 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.049
 do it once 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.470
 once you do not have enough of 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.040
 products and you undertake and have 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.040
 keep on going 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.170
 if you ever have some varnish that 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:08.320
 overflowed on the skin take everything from 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:11.650
 after the corrector and remove 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.450
 immediately before it dries and 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.740
 it's in vermont otherwise after he 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.560
 will be much more difficult to the goal 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:21.820
 and I laid the first layer 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.310
 normally you alternate with each other 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.360
 foot 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.580
 that is, you put the 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.900
 hardener on this first foot always 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.560
 from the end 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.200
 finally on the outside side to prevent that 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.790
 you have better what you did 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.170
 you do the other foot after you 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.690
 come back and ask yourself the first layer of 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.090
 color makes you re the other and you 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.440
 can chained like that if you ever 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:49.210
 overwhelm a little bit about the critics 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:55.350
 hull take a little toothpick and 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:55.350
 you pass along the hull critic 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.070
 then apply the top coat so the 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.980
 top coat will allow to dry the 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.550
 polish a little faster and go 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:13.520
 allow to keep a shine 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.260
 for several days so this is a 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.610
 fairly fluid texture 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.830
 so that's why she dries 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:27.590
 much faster you touch 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:29.660
 the varnish not need two too much supported 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.460
 in fact like he's fluid enough he's going to get 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:36.010
 spread alone you touch 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.630
 roughly 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.160
 so that's the nail polish is over 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.410
 now more than waiting for that 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.030
 dry more you will wait more 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.889
 your polish will last it can last 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.460
 up to three weeks if it dries 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.460
 perfectly
