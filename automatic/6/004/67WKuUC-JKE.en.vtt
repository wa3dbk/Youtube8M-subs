there
and<00:01:47.180> make<00:01:48.180> another<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.780> work<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.259> know<00:01:49.680> we<00:01:49.860> look

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
and make another and work I know we look

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.800 
and make another and work I know we look
really<00:01:50.310> silly<00:01:50.490> right<00:01:50.729> now<00:01:50.759> but<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.299> gives
