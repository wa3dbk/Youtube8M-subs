volition by lily paratus this was

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.090

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.369 
absolutely amazing I did read her debut
novel<00:00:44.610> which<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.969> ignite<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.110> actually

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
novel which is ignite and I actually

novel which is ignite and I actually
really<00:00:47.190> liked<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.600> do<00:00:48.719> think<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.739> this

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
really liked it but I do think that this

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.350 
really liked it but I do think that this
book<00:00:50.460> it's<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:51.899> unique<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:53.239> don't<00:00:54.239> even

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
book it's just so unique I don't even

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.600 
book it's just so unique I don't even
know<00:00:54.510> how<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.719> describe<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.379> because<00:00:55.610> it's

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
know how to describe it because it's

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.069 
know how to describe it because it's
nothing<00:00:56.940> I've<00:00:57.030> ever<00:00:57.090> read<00:00:57.329> before<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.719> didn't

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
nothing I've ever read before I didn't

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.599 
nothing I've ever read before I didn't
really<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.469> any<00:00:58.680> idea<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.399> was<00:00:59.460> really

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
really have any idea what it was really

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.939 
really have any idea what it was really
about<00:00:59.760> because<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.870> synopsis<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:01.530> it

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
about because the synopsis for it

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.579 
about because the synopsis for it
doesn't<00:01:02.370> really<00:01:02.489> give<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.820> anything<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:04.229> get

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589

a<00:01:04.799> little<00:01:05.129> sense<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.090> character<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> main

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
a little sense of the character the main

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.679 
a little sense of the character the main
character<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.189> not<00:01:08.369> really<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:09.030> sense<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
character but not really a sense the
