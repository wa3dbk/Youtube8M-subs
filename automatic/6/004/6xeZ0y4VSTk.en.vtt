00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.799
 and today meinkravt 4 now wait i 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.510
 i did something wrong 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.750
 sat right now 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.540
 and today we have minecraft cheats 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.660
 Of course we can not install the knots 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.779
 and everyone knows for sure, as if reading 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.340
 a little outta everyone knows what that is 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.180
 in minecraft 12 1 survival yet 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.579
 enchantments 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.280
 and not very interesting to play a game of 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.860
 purge his desire than not changed here 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.750
 so I found a way to more precisely him myself 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.160
 guessed to do how is it all the same 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.100
 get charmed things in survival 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.170
 and so what we do is we want 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.700
 enchant an iron helmet or any 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.340
 at all 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:59.550
 go enchantment what is that forest what is Alek 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:02.760
 you stand a table of not changing and mind you 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.790
 spikes and then we donâ€™t pick it up 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.960
 immediately on the cross you see it falls 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.830
 we exit minecraft change to 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.960
 survival 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.630
 this world then here it is our hat 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.030
 enchanted see yes exactly the same 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.570
 can do with any things absolutely with 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.430
 mind him things though it blocks though not 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.920
 blocks 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.650
 so on till i show now 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.939
 a little bit different how is it 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.430
 enchant the ice to get blocks 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.170
 infinity of blocks yes we take a block 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:48.079
 any more had any village 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:50.250
 take the anvil and do so here 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:54.450
 you press how many times how many 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.360
 you need to push even quietly 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.759
 click and when that number is typed 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.509
 which you need for example 1 stack we 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:08.390
 throwing out 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:08.390
 we leave exactly the same survival and 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.920
 then here is our blog that is, we can 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.620
 put any cheats no effects 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.810

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.810
 So they do these blocks 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.250
 Well, the same can be done with the oven in well 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.930
 Basically, this is all I wanted to say on 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.000
 the strength to wear in this series is finally there 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.250
