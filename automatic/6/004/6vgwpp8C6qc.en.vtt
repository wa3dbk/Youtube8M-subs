00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.540 
it's definitely not going to be better

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.300

this video and this is a really good one

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.240 
this video and this is a really good one
as<00:00:33.110> well<00:00:33.290> I<00:00:33.320> didn't<00:00:33.590> actually<00:00:33.680> know<00:00:33.920> that<00:00:34.010> they

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
as well I didn't actually know that they

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.799 
as well I didn't actually know that they
could<00:00:34.430> fire<00:00:34.700> I<00:00:34.730> was<00:00:34.970> being<00:00:35.149> a<00:00:35.239> bit<00:00:35.360> of<00:00:35.450> an<00:00:35.510> idiot

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
could fire I was being a bit of an idiot

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.150 
could fire I was being a bit of an idiot
but<00:00:36.170> they<00:00:36.260> do<00:00:36.380> fire<00:00:36.710> and<00:00:36.890> they're<00:00:36.980> really

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
but they do fire and they're really

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.950 
but they do fire and they're really
effective<00:00:37.730> you<00:00:37.940> can<00:00:38.239> take<00:00:38.420> people<00:00:38.690> out<00:00:38.780> from

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
effective you can take people out from

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.479 
effective you can take people out from
quite<00:00:39.200> a<00:00:39.230> way<00:00:39.500> away<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:40.039> you<00:00:40.100> get<00:00:40.250> two<00:00:40.460> shots

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
quite a way away and you get two shots

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.910 
quite a way away and you get two shots
in<00:00:41.000> the<00:00:41.030> clip<00:00:41.359> for<00:00:41.510> this<00:00:41.660> rifle<00:00:42.140> to<00:00:42.500> kill<00:00:42.530> four

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
or five star enemies you're going to

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.119 
or five star enemies you're going to
need<00:00:44.480> to<00:00:44.629> get<00:00:44.780> headshots<00:00:45.289> but<00:00:45.739> this<00:00:45.829> is<00:00:45.980> really

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
need to get headshots but this is really

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.799 
need to get headshots but this is really
good<00:00:46.429> in<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:46.820> heat<00:00:46.969> at<00:00:47.089> the<00:00:47.149> moment<00:00:47.210> as<00:00:47.629> well

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
good in the heat at the moment as well

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:48.970 
good in the heat at the moment as well
it<00:00:47.929> can<00:00:48.050> actually<00:00:48.170> finish<00:00:48.649> off<00:00:48.829> your

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
it can actually finish off your

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.709 
it can actually finish off your
opponents<00:00:49.550> in<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.760> middle<00:00:50.000> of<00:00:50.059> a<00:00:50.149> melee<00:00:50.449> fight

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
opponents in the middle of a melee fight

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.360 
opponents in the middle of a melee fight
and<00:00:50.929> that's<00:00:51.050> another<00:00:51.320> good<00:00:51.589> use<00:00:51.769> for<00:00:51.800> it<00:00:52.160> and

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
and that's another good use for it and

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.009 
and that's another good use for it and
it's<00:00:52.519> also<00:00:52.640> really<00:00:52.820> good<00:00:53.300> as<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.539> melee<00:00:53.989> weapon

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
it's also really good as a melee weapon

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:55.779 
it's also really good as a melee weapon
as<00:00:54.469> well<00:00:54.649> I'm<00:00:54.829> pretty<00:00:54.980> sure<00:00:55.219> it<00:00:55.339> counts<00:00:55.670> as<00:00:55.760> a

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
as well I'm pretty sure it counts as a

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.790 
as well I'm pretty sure it counts as a
long<00:00:56.059> weapon<00:00:56.449> but<00:00:56.839> it's<00:00:56.989> really<00:00:57.260> deadly<00:00:57.499> in

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
long weapon but it's really deadly in

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.200 
long weapon but it's really deadly in
commbuys<00:00:58.249> I'm<00:00:58.519> going<00:00:58.640> to<00:00:58.730> show<00:00:58.850> you<00:00:58.909> in<00:00:59.120> a<00:00:59.179> bit

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
commbuys I'm going to show you in a bit

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.509 
commbuys I'm going to show you in a bit
you<00:00:59.899> can<00:01:00.109> actually<00:01:00.289> use<00:01:00.589> smoke<00:01:00.890> bombs<00:01:01.159> if<00:01:01.429> you

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
you can actually use smoke bombs if you

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:02.919 
you can actually use smoke bombs if you
want<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:01.730> increase<00:01:02.030> your<00:01:02.089> kill<00:01:02.449> streak<00:01:02.719> by<00:01:02.870> the

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
want to increase your kill streak by the

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.869 
want to increase your kill streak by the
way<00:01:03.109> I<00:01:03.140> kind<00:01:03.440> of<00:01:03.499> realized<00:01:03.859> that<00:01:03.980> obviously<00:01:04.820> if

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
way I kind of realized that obviously if

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.399 
way I kind of realized that obviously if
there's<00:01:05.030> ten<00:01:05.210> dudes<00:01:05.390> around<00:01:05.720> you<00:01:05.900> can't<00:01:06.200> take

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
there's ten dudes around you can't take

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:07.930 
there's ten dudes around you can't take
them<00:01:06.500> out<00:01:06.650> just<00:01:06.890> with<00:01:07.040> combat<00:01:07.430> so<00:01:07.640> if<00:01:07.730> you<00:01:07.820> use

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
them out just with combat so if you use

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.610 
them out just with combat so if you use
a<00:01:07.970> smoke<00:01:08.330> bomb<00:01:08.540> or<00:01:08.690> two<00:01:08.870> you're<00:01:09.350> going<00:01:09.440> to<00:01:09.500> be

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
a smoke bomb or two you're going to be

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.780 
a smoke bomb or two you're going to be
able<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:09.830> kill<00:01:09.980> a<00:01:10.010> lot<00:01:10.280> more<00:01:10.340> of<00:01:10.640> them

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790

keeps moving on the combat as we go
through<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.740> ages<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:22.310> I<00:01:22.340> guess<00:01:22.610> as<00:01:22.820> we<00:01:22.969> go<00:01:23.119> on

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
through the ages so I guess as we go on

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.819 
through the ages so I guess as we go on
and<00:01:23.479> on<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.810> weapons<00:01:24.140> will<00:01:24.259> get<00:01:24.380> more<00:01:24.649> and

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.499 
and on the weapons will get more and
more<00:01:24.890> advanced<00:01:25.549> unless<00:01:25.790> they<00:01:25.969> decide<00:01:26.090> to<00:01:26.390> go

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
more advanced unless they decide to go

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.600 
more advanced unless they decide to go
