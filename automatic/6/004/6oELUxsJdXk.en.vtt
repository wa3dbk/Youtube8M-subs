the<00:00:53.340> power<00:00:54.239> compact<00:00:54.750> night<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.170> used<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.410> be

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the power compact night that used to be

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.450 
the power compact night that used to be
here<00:00:55.559> now<00:00:56.309> what<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:56.699> did<00:00:56.910> was<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.949> put<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.190> heat

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
here now what we did was we put to heat

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.590 
here now what we did was we put to heat
sig<00:00:59.760> side<00:01:00.090> by<00:01:00.300> side<00:01:00.770> with<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> total<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.370> six<00:01:02.730> XP

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
sig side by side with a total of six XP

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.500 
sig side by side with a total of six XP
geez<00:01:06.170> some<00:01:07.170> flights<00:01:07.439> are<00:01:07.830> LEDs<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.939> then<00:01:09.210> we

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
geez some flights are LEDs and then we

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.840 
geez some flights are LEDs and then we
have<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.470> driver<00:01:10.979> that's<00:01:11.369> running<00:01:11.640> them

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
have the one driver that's running them

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.600 
have the one driver that's running them
all<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:14.010> worked<00:01:15.000> out<00:01:15.270> pretty<00:01:15.570> good<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.920> am

because you know I'm thinking XP geez
compared<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.720> some<00:01:28.500> power<00:01:28.680> contacts<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.490> are

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
compared to some power contacts that are

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.950 
compared to some power contacts that are
you<00:01:29.790> know

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.140 

600k<00:01:32.960> ain't<00:01:33.800> nothing<00:01:34.190> compared<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.520> these<00:01:34.580> xpg

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
600k ain't nothing compared to these xpg

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.820 
600k ain't nothing compared to these xpg
so<00:01:35.450> i<00:01:35.480> only<00:01:35.750> hooked<00:01:36.080> up<00:01:36.230> i<00:01:36.560> only<00:01:37.220> hooked<00:01:37.430> up

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
so i only hooked up i only hooked up

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.800 
so i only hooked up i only hooked up
four<00:01:39.830> of<00:01:40.160> the<00:01:40.310> six<00:01:40.610> I<00:01:40.940> left<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.420> middle<00:01:41.660> one

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
four of the six I left the middle one

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.960 
four of the six I left the middle one
off<00:01:41.990> as<00:01:42.320> you<00:01:42.830> can<00:01:42.920> see<00:01:43.130> right<00:01:43.160> there<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.580> metal

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
off as you can see right there the metal

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.740 
off as you can see right there the metal
ones<00:01:44.120> right<00:01:44.440> off<00:01:46.510> but<00:01:49.390> everything<00:01:50.390> went<00:01:50.630> fine

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
hopeful that they'll take care of some

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.400 
hopeful that they'll take care of some
of<00:01:56.540> that<00:01:56.800> but<00:01:57.800> it's<00:01:57.920> lying<00:01:58.190> or<00:01:58.370> cyano<00:01:58.790> in<00:01:59.030> there

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
of that but it's lying or cyano in there

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.860 
of that but it's lying or cyano in there
because<00:02:00.410> these<00:02:00.590> are<00:02:00.740> on<00:02:00.890> 24<00:02:01.460> hours<00:02:01.760> and<00:02:02.000> the

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
because these are on 24 hours and the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.810 
because these are on 24 hours and the
power<00:02:03.080> compact<00:02:03.590> lights<00:02:03.890> now<00:02:04.280> after<00:02:04.430> placing

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
power compact lights now after placing

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.340 
power compact lights now after placing
every<00:02:05.060> six<00:02:05.330> months<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:05.750> it's<00:02:05.960> been<00:02:06.020> nine

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
every six months and it's been nine

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.080 
every six months and it's been nine
victims<00:02:06.800> are<00:02:07.070> it's<00:02:07.220> been<00:02:07.250> 11<00:02:07.700> months<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:10.090> so

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
victims are it's been 11 months and so

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.850 
victims are it's been 11 months and so
hopefully<00:02:11.810> this<00:02:11.900> will<00:02:12.050> take<00:02:12.230> care<00:02:12.380> of<00:02:12.530> some<00:02:12.770> of

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
hopefully this will take care of some of

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.560 
hopefully this will take care of some of
the<00:02:12.950> red<00:02:13.160> slime<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:13.670> we<00:02:13.790> have<00:02:13.940> going<00:02:14.180> on<00:02:14.330> I

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
the red slime that we have going on I

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.170 
the red slime that we have going on I
also<00:02:15.470> learned<00:02:15.740> that<00:02:15.830> if<00:02:16.010> I<00:02:16.160> trim<00:02:16.850> back<00:02:17.150> the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
also learned that if I trim back the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.680 
also learned that if I trim back the
cheeto<00:02:17.870> once<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.800> week<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.310> allow<00:02:20.000> more<00:02:20.300> float

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
cheeto once a week and allow more float

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.820 
cheeto once a week and allow more float
to<00:02:21.260> come<00:02:21.440> over<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:22.610> top<00:02:22.850> here<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.900> won't

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
to come over the top here that I won't

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.690 
to come over the top here that I won't
get<00:02:24.950> as<00:02:25.070> much<00:02:25.220> cyano<00:02:25.610> which<00:02:26.420> so<00:02:27.490> we'll<00:02:28.490> see

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
get as much cyano which so we'll see

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.140 
get as much cyano which so we'll see

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
aerate the tank I'm a little bit worried

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.500 
aerate the tank I'm a little bit worried
that<00:05:51.830> I'm<00:05:51.919> going<00:05:52.010> to<00:05:52.100> get<00:05:52.190> over<00:05:52.340> you<00:05:53.090> know<00:05:53.210> 80

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
that I'm going to get over you know 80

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.120 
that I'm going to get over you know 80
degrees<00:05:54.080> on<00:05:54.290> this<00:05:54.470> so<00:05:55.220> I<00:05:55.250> haven't<00:05:55.580> done<00:05:55.669> it<00:05:55.820> yet

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
degrees on this so I haven't done it yet

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.620 
degrees on this so I haven't done it yet
but<00:05:58.130> that's<00:05:58.460> just<00:05:58.610> one<00:05:58.729> of<00:05:58.850> the<00:05:59.000> solutions<00:05:59.330> if

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
but that's just one of the solutions if

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.290 
but that's just one of the solutions if
you<00:05:59.720> live<00:05:59.870> in<00:05:59.900> a<00:06:00.050> colder<00:06:00.350> climate<00:06:00.380> to<00:06:01.250> do<00:06:01.460> that

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
you live in a colder climate to do that

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.670 
you live in a colder climate to do that
kind<00:06:02.539> of<00:06:02.660> thing

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.270 

so<00:06:06.680> that's<00:06:07.220> where<00:06:07.460> the<00:06:07.520> tank<00:06:07.760> sits<00:06:08.120> and

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
so that's where the tank sits and

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.960 
so that's where the tank sits and
everything<00:06:10.280> is<00:06:10.400> still<00:06:10.580> in<00:06:10.670> the<00:06:10.760> grow-out

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
everything is still in the grow-out

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:18.360 
everything is still in the grow-out
stage<00:06:11.420> I<00:06:15.550> have<00:06:16.550> a<00:06:16.610> question<00:06:16.820> for<00:06:17.030> everybody<00:06:17.810> is
