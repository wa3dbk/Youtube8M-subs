00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 a 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.740
 Welcome to the current video 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.600
 by handytarife today is not about 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.790
 the nexus four it's not about 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.100
 any usb cable but it works 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.810
 for this little thing 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.449
 this little box calls the good piece 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.490
 bluetooth pop is glorious and is 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.570
 already available for 27 euros and we 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.519
 Now just want to look like this 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.070
 thing works and if all that 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.480
 is good to look at the now first 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.539
 technical data from the device 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.329
 youtube or the little box has 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.240
 four watt output and covers the 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.610
 Frequency range from 20 to 80,000 heart 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.410
 again, that's about what each one of us 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.720
 should hear us should probably 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.280
 the device is as I said via bluetooth 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.210
 connected or in case somehow 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.740
 for some not found 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.220
 you should be able to work here 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.500
 micro jack plugging in the plant 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.850
 try over the jack cable too 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.280
 We will still be able to use the service 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.720
 would be about eight times three inches 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.400
 or if you like the whole thing 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.890
 Ballpoint pen moderately open and close 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.259
 come to about 5 cm in height 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.750
 This technology is called manufacturer boom 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.179
 by the way, from china comes pop in out 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.439
 mechanics and that should be the bass range 

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:13.749
 reinforce 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.929
 The whole thing wants to talk enough 

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:18.490
 to look at in practice 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.950
 The connection is made so easy 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.240
 bluetooth so then probably the crate so 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.460
 be found very quickly 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.960
 and because I have already heard that 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.170
 is that connected now let's hear 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.170
 purely 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.310
 because the crate is installed a lithium 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.810
 ion battery was a review of us so well 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.850
 four hours in the bluetooth area 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.799
 lasted and if you the whole per 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.679
 plug connection uses then come there so 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.450
 seven to eight hours to get out 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.540
 The device is in four different 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.459
 colors and costs said 27 euros yes 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.019
 that was a little to the video of 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.510
 handytarife.de just if you all 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.640
 liked to subscribe or subscribe 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.470
 I like something down here somewhere 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.430
 would have to be thankful for watching 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.430
 until next time
