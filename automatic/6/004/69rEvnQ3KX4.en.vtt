00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
combing it starts to get like that

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.170 
combing it starts to get like that
actually<00:02:39.390> gets<00:02:39.810> like<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:41.400> then<00:02:42.090> it

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
actually gets like that and then it

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.600 
actually gets like that and then it
turns<00:02:42.420> into<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.780> once<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.739> get<00:02:43.860> both<00:02:44.130> ends

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
turns into that once you get both ends

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.229 
turns into that once you get both ends
