just did a bit of basic basic doubles or
mixed<00:00:48.300> doubles<00:00:48.660> license<00:00:49.020> over<00:00:49.410> sort<00:00:49.860> of

mixed doubles license over sort of

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.590 
mixed doubles license over sort of
figured<00:00:50.219> out<00:00:50.309> which<00:00:50.550> size<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.090> they<00:00:51.120> need<00:00:51.420> to

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
figured out which size that they need to

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.840

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
we're highly aspirational yeah but not

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.590 
we're highly aspirational yeah but not
completely<00:01:29.130> motivated<00:01:29.400> know<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.420> weird

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
completely motivated know it's a weird

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.640 
completely motivated know it's a weird
mix<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.170> not<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.590> inspiration<00:01:33.140> I<00:01:34.140> think<00:01:34.590> we

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
mix and not that inspiration I think we

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.990 
mix and not that inspiration I think we
do<00:01:34.799> all<00:01:34.890> right<00:01:35.040> well<00:01:35.340> at<00:01:35.430> least<00:01:35.490> make<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.759> to

do all right well at least make it to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.240 
do all right well at least make it to
round<00:01:36.210> one<00:01:36.420> yeah<00:01:36.630> yeah<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:37.020> will<00:01:37.200> oh<00:01:37.470> it's

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
when a wild card and they've certainly

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.539 
when a wild card and they've certainly
got<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.880> level<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.390> may<00:01:46.140> make<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:47.189> second

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549

week<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.789> this<00:01:47.939> Shane<00:01:48.179> opened<00:01:48.539> frankly<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> was

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
week of this Shane opened frankly I was

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.709 
week of this Shane opened frankly I was
I<00:01:50.130> wasn't<00:01:50.490> surprised<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.119> we<00:01:51.210> were<00:01:51.270> superior

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
I wasn't surprised that we were superior

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.260 
I wasn't surprised that we were superior
to<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.590> two<00:01:53.009> former<00:01:53.369> Australian<00:01:53.819> champions

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
to the two former Australian champions

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.639 
to the two former Australian champions
however<00:01:54.929> they've<00:01:55.109> just<00:01:55.229> got<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> little<00:01:55.469> bit

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
however they've just got a little bit

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.289 
however they've just got a little bit
old<00:01:55.770> down<00:01:56.069> weird<00:01:56.369> it's<00:01:56.520> probably<00:01:56.850> our<00:01:57.030> prime

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
old down weird it's probably our prime

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.090 
old down weird it's probably our prime
to<00:01:57.539> take<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.929> the<00:01:58.049> yesterday<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.439> know<00:01:58.619> but<00:01:59.069> I

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
to take on the yesterday you know but I

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.279 
to take on the yesterday you know but I
reckon<00:01:59.459> if<00:01:59.520> we<00:01:59.700> keep<00:01:59.880> coaching<00:02:00.179> them<00:02:00.450> oricon

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
reckon if we keep coaching them oricon

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:02.749 
reckon if we keep coaching them oricon
they<00:02:01.380> could<00:02:01.560> get<00:02:01.709> there<00:02:01.920> how<00:02:02.280> do<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.429> choose

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
they could get there how do you choose

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.520 
they could get there how do you choose
with<00:02:02.909> his<00:02:03.030> backhand<00:02:03.479> but<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.899> just<00:02:04.049> soak<00:02:04.259> a

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
with his backhand but if you just soak a

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.319 
with his backhand but if you just soak a
little<00:02:04.799> still<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> should<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.759> okay<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.240> if

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
little still I should be okay and if

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.029 
little still I should be okay and if
Nick's<00:02:06.659> prepared<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.380> work<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.740> little<00:02:07.770> bit

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
Nick's prepared to work a little bit

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.979 
Nick's prepared to work a little bit
harder<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.610> reckon<00:02:09.209> we<00:02:09.299> can<00:02:09.390> get<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> match<00:02:09.810> yeah

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
harder I reckon we can get a match yeah

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.869 
harder I reckon we can get a match yeah
a<00:02:10.019> little<00:02:10.739> bit<00:02:10.799> like<00:02:11.009> they'll<00:02:11.190> make<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.610> wild

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
a little bit like they'll make the wild
