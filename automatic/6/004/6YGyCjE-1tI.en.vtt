 in front of a weekend of very long time 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.649
 complicated we could say in the greatest 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.030

 in fact, nowadays, look like the one in good 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.610
 part of the country that is like the day of

 he said we are announcing the situation going 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.580
 to be even more complicated about 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.320
 all during the second half of the day 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.390

 please be very careful the coasts of 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.160
 Cantabrian and waiting for that 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.290
 instability that adverse time of 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.730
 every morning most of the country that 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.030
 have a good afternoon see you this

 12 goodnight even more great 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.410
 part of the country but before we go to 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.510
 analyze those intense gusts of 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.220
 wind that have returned to reflect the 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.630
 today's situation in many areas of the 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.970
 Spanish geography efficiency in 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.560
 salamanca for example above the 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.210
 140 kilometers per hour we talk about 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.370
 hurricane wind gusts also in a 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.890
 Coruña or in Asturias in Segovia 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.630
 over 120 and also in Cantabria 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.550
 for tomorrow as we are already 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.970
 advancing complicating situation 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.950
 even more notice what panorama those ads 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.540
 especially activated by winds that 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.920
 will again be quite intense very 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.560
 strong over all decade the night the 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.300
 southern half peninsular even snowfall that 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.680
 they make copious again up to 20 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.750
 centimeters of thickness could be 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.910
 accumulate in the mountains of Madrid by 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.350
 example and that swell still caution and 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.500
 Aries the Cantabrian in the morning 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.240
 will continue to reach 7 meters of 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.160
 height what has happened on the day of 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.260
 today it has reflected in the middle you know 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.480
 that we have salt again that deep 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.160
 storm once again repeat the 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.990
 situation affecting the islands 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.970
 British with an associated front that 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.560
 has been crossing in fact 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.750
 the disturbance is the one that is 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.400
 letting that intense wind take a 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.890
 look at the medium we can appreciate by 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.769
 another part this cloud mass stay with 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.079
 because she is responsible for one of 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.330
 form a new disturbance the new 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.040
 scratch that is going to gestate very 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.600
 deep and very radius very violent and that 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.390
 is going to be the one in charge of complicating 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.890
 tomorrow the situation and a lot very much in 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.830
 good part of the country especially for the 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.760
 late and is that in the afternoon we wait 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.470
 precipitations that will be punctually 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.420
 very strong and intense in many 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.610
 Caucasus regions caution also 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.340
 towards the north of Cáceres and also in 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.930
 much of the peninsular northwest 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.580
 they will arrive practically all the country 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.230
 even at the end of the day it would be reinforced 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.660
 gas the interior of northeastern peninsular and 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.120
 It would also reach Balearic Islands caution 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.700
 with the wind it will be very intense on 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.710
 especially at night and be noticed mode 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.460
 very strong in areas of western 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.200
 Andalusia and also towards the coasts of 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.940
 Galicia in the Canary Islands, situation in the margin 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.380
 just for some more compact clouds 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.480
 towards the north the islands but at the end 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.160
 of the day and for tomorrow Sunday also 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.169
 temperatures in case it was little in 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.169
 decline in practically the whole country 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.750
 very complicated situation tomorrow 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.740
