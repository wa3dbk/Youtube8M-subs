00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.570
 It 's a main story, but Chigaki 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:17.980
 It is a niche of actor day news It is that the new issue of the store love just being serialized has just appeared in the camp 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:24.150
 I bought a response in Yes yes here is Nisekoi 13 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.150
 So I will introduce Ise Koi 13 this time 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:36.900
 Actually , the release date of this volume 13 was August 4th, but I went to buy it that day 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:42.960
 I did not sell it, but I tried to go to other stores 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:45.340
 If you learn to ask shop people, 62 in August will be released in the area where I live 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.190
 I bought it again 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:53.280
 Even in the case of this Nisekoi volume 12, I released it a little later in the area where I live, 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:58.680
 The little reason to say 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:02.670
 So it's a bit late, but I will introduce Nisekoi Vol. 13 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:09.869
 The cover of Nisekoi Vol. 13 looks like this 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:13.270
 I think that I said last time, but the cover of the recent Nisekoi book is very beautiful, isn't it? 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.570
 Nisekoi 13 vol. Cover is a different tooth to taste 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:22.840
 The spine of Nisekoi 13 is like this 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:29.679
 The character on the back cover of Volume 13 is Paula. It may be difficult to understand with the camera . 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.369
 You can see that the color part of the spine cover of 12 and 13 volumes is larger than 13 volumes 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.260
 Is it 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:39.650
 Is the part of the color where Nisekoi is written is 12 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:42.950
 Is yellow and 13 volumes are orange , and the cover of 3 volumes is Haru- Chan Paula Fu-chan 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:48.799
 I think I can come R- chan or maybe R-chan 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:56.929
 And it's the next day I 've been in trouble with Chitari Onodera that is open 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:02:00.170
 By the way, in the obi anime a dvd box Volume 6 will be released on Wednesday 27th January 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.970
 That's right I knew from before but 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.620
 Ise Koi at the PlayStation vita 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:11.760
 It seems that the game is decided, but I have vita in China. 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:16.980
 So I 'm planning to face it now 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:22.960
 Behind the a- 13 introductory note and band is like this 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:27.460
 Special edition tofu No. 2 in anime dvd ads and the following Nisekoi volume 14 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.910
 There seems to be, but special edition is Nisekoi volume 14 + 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:36.940
 It seems that a dvd containing Japanese stories will be attached 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:40.720
 Price seems to have been 3400 yen + tax-included Comics 7 58 or lost 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.950
 It seems to have animated Comics 8 volumes 64 maiden 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:49.459
 Yes behind Huh it was like this 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:55.520
 I will try to announce the impression of trying to read 13 volumes of medical care Yes The content of 13 volumes 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:03:01.640
 But the story of Haru-chan and Gree- chan are mostly in the main 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.330
 The story of Haru-chan was also quite interesting, but Lily-chan's main story is a little bit boring 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.970
 You 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:11.180
 Personally , I was a very favorite character of Haru-chan, and it was interesting with 13 volumes. 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.660
 I will try to rank the story 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.510
 First of all, third to third is here 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.659
 The third place is 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:27.450
 Descriptive volley This story is interesting to see the unexpected side of Nisekoi characters 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:31.409
 It was followed by the second second place here 109 is clumsy of 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:35.500
 By the way, it is a story that Haru stands out in this story 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:41.020
 Haru-chan was a bit naive and everybody cares about it 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:44.710
 First place first place is story of this 116 lunch box 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:51.700
 This is the worst part of this story, but it's the main story 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:55.270
 Say yes and it is a story that make cooking Good luck lunch hard for weak Sentoge is easy 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.520
 Why Nisekoi Vol. 13 was a funny story 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.380
 run 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:04.580
 Why not King was wearing Everyone experiences I bought two stingy Volume 13 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:07.970

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.890
 me 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.280
