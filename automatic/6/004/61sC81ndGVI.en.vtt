ones you've got progress on but it's not
complete

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
complete

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.020 
complete
these<00:01:26.170> I<00:01:26.649> tell<00:01:26.920> you<00:01:27.100> that<00:01:27.310> you<00:01:27.460> have<00:01:27.490> done<00:01:27.880> it

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
these I tell you that you have done it

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.580 
these I tell you that you have done it
and<00:01:28.179> they're<00:01:28.359> in<00:01:28.479> yellow<00:01:28.950> Josh<00:01:29.950> turn<00:01:30.399> that<00:01:30.490> off

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and they're in yellow Josh turn that off

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.370 
and they're in yellow Josh turn that off
so<00:01:32.590> we<00:01:32.649> go<00:01:32.770> down<00:01:32.979> here<00:01:33.399> and<00:01:34.229> whether<00:01:35.229> the

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
so we go down here and whether the

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.020 
so we go down here and whether the
Annihilator<00:01:35.890> you<00:01:36.069> need<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.340> do<00:01:36.490> all<00:01:36.670> three<00:01:36.939> of

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
Annihilator you need to do all three of

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.080 
Annihilator you need to do all three of
these<00:01:37.210> and<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:40.240> each<00:01:40.450> in<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.959> 1330<00:01:41.679> games<00:01:42.090> it

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
these and for each in the 1330 games it

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.749 
these and for each in the 1330 games it
only<00:01:43.329> counts<00:01:43.689> once<00:01:44.229> per<00:01:44.679> game<00:01:44.920> so<00:01:45.429> if<00:01:45.549> you<00:01:45.640> get

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
only counts once per game so if you get

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.980 
only counts once per game so if you get
three<00:01:46.060> combos<00:01:46.509> or<00:01:46.539> you<00:01:46.869> get<00:01:47.159> or<00:01:48.159> you<00:01:48.429> get<00:01:48.990> three

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
three combos or you get or you get three

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.010 
three combos or you get or you get three
kills<00:01:50.289> without<00:01:50.409> dying<00:01:50.590> it<00:01:51.549> counts<00:01:52.060> once<00:01:52.509> per

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
kills without dying it counts once per

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.469 
kills without dying it counts once per
game<00:01:53.229> so<00:01:53.530> if<00:01:53.649> you<00:01:53.709> get<00:01:53.859> three<00:01:54.340> kill<00:01:54.939> streaks<00:01:55.270> of

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
game so if you get three kill streaks of

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.959 
game so if you get three kill streaks of
three<00:01:56.140> kills<00:01:56.409> or<00:01:56.590> more<00:01:56.770> it<00:01:56.979> only<00:01:57.369> counts<00:01:57.579> once

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
three kills or more it only counts once

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.109 
three kills or more it only counts once
so<00:01:58.959> faster<00:01:59.379> gains<00:01:59.590> are<00:01:59.890> probably<00:02:00.729> more

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
so faster gains are probably more

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.800 
so faster gains are probably more
preferred<00:02:02.909> then<00:02:03.909> we<00:02:03.969> go<00:02:04.090> down<00:02:04.119> here<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.629> fire

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
preferred then we go down here the fire

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.020 
preferred then we go down here the fire
