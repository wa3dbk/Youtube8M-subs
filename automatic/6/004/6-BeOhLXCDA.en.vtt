00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.970
 in today's video I'm going to teach you how to do 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.769
 this painting with watercolor effect 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.769
 superlegal using crayons 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.440
 begins to choose an extension in the format 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.740
 preference, and then cut to the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.730
 around 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.730
 I chose a circus 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.920
 You will need a painting canvas. 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.810
 the line is already with the stains of my 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.360
 first attempt using only the 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.010
 long that did not work but I found 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.570
 another way that gave super right and 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.190
 It's very cool 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.590
 place the stent in place of your 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.600
 on the screen and after you have 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.670
 satisfied with the local start to skirt 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.120
 use it with pencil until you get around the drawing. 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.120
 all 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.020
 using wax chalk and dryer positions 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.730
 the days at the place you want to paint and 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.670
 using the hottest temperature of the 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.810
 dryer will melt chalk and using jet 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.810
 to guide ink 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.000
 put things of your own I 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.000
 I did my colorful good 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.940
 It's a bit of a mess then maybe 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.540
 is better understood than 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.540
 you force 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.500
 this was the result 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.030
 After you're done you'll cut the 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.269
 format is that you draw on 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.269
 screen 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:20.239
 then in that inner part of the frame 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.239
 both the length and the width 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.970
 then cut to the same extent a 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.330
 piece of cardboard the color of your 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.330
 preference 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.229
 pass the white glue across the inside of the 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.620
 then glue the paper 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.620
 top 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.170
 and that's it if you like the video 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.060
 I liked it 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.100
