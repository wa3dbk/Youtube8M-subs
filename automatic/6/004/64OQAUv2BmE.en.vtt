having to register it $55 to register it
I<00:00:54.010> think<00:00:54.070> it's<00:00:54.280> a<00:00:54.370> bit<00:00:54.550> of<00:00:54.640> a<00:00:54.699> con<00:00:54.969> really<00:00:55.390> but

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
I think it's a bit of a con really but

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.509 
I think it's a bit of a con really but
there<00:00:55.780> you<00:00:55.930> go<00:00:55.960> and<00:00:56.649> if<00:00:56.739> they<00:00:56.890> want<00:00:57.100> people<00:00:57.430> to

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
there you go and if they want people to

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.000 
there you go and if they want people to
come<00:00:57.640> over<00:00:58.000> here<00:00:58.239> to<00:00:58.449> spend<00:00:59.050> their<00:00:59.230> sterling

don't know if you know anything about
this<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.120> you<00:02:03.150> do<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.660> think<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.960> the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
this and you do you think that the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.200 
this and you do you think that the
artificial<00:02:04.740> pitch<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.160> going<00:02:05.400> to<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.670> an

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
artificial pitch is going to be an

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.020 
artificial pitch is going to be an
advantage<00:02:06.660> for<00:02:07.490> for<00:02:08.490> the<00:02:08.580> Russian<00:02:08.880> side

obviously<00:02:09.210> they've<00:02:09.690> been<00:02:09.720> practicing<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.619> it

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
obviously they've been practicing on it

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.190 
obviously they've been practicing on it
I've<00:02:11.610> heard<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.480> artificial<00:02:12.840> creatures

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
I've heard that on artificial creatures

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.960 
I've heard that on artificial creatures
and<00:02:13.680> if<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.010> can<00:02:14.220> play<00:02:14.370> football<00:02:14.820> you<00:02:14.850> can

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
and if you can play football you can

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.140 
and if you can play football you can
play<00:02:15.210> football<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:16.440> simple<00:02:16.920> as<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.070> so<00:02:17.550> just

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
play football so simple as that so just

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.500 
play football so simple as that so just
imagine<00:02:18.240> it's<00:02:18.750> halftime<00:02:19.350> Russia's<00:02:20.010> warm<00:02:20.220> meal

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
imagine it's halftime Russia's warm meal

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.140 
imagine it's halftime Russia's warm meal
it's<00:02:21.510> because<00:02:21.810> we're<00:02:21.960> playing<00:02:22.170> bad<00:02:25.910> very<00:02:26.910> hard

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
it's because we're playing bad very hard

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.060 
it's because we're playing bad very hard
to<00:02:27.300> imagine<00:02:27.390> what<00:02:27.930> everyone<00:02:28.230> England<00:02:28.710> we've

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
to imagine what everyone England we've

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.740 
to imagine what everyone England we've
got<00:02:29.250> some<00:02:29.430> artificial<00:02:29.790> pitches<00:02:30.150> back<00:02:30.480> in<00:02:30.660> the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
got some artificial pitches back in the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.510 
got some artificial pitches back in the
UK<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.170> England<00:02:31.470> have<00:02:31.590> been<00:02:31.740> practicing<00:02:31.950> had

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
UK and England have been practicing had

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.010 
UK and England have been practicing had
a<00:02:32.550> good<00:02:32.880> go<00:02:33.030> on<00:02:33.150> one<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.450> ones<00:02:33.600> there<00:02:33.810> but<00:02:33.960> I

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
a good go on one of the ones there but I

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.090 
a good go on one of the ones there but I
think<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.410> newer<00:02:34.590> one<00:02:34.770> than<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.070> one

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
think it's a newer one than the one

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.010 
think it's a newer one than the one
you've<00:02:35.370> got<00:02:35.520> here<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:35.850> Moscow<00:02:36.210> so<00:02:36.540> be

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
you've got here in Moscow so be

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.780 
you've got here in Moscow so be
interesting<00:02:37.560> but<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.740> think<00:02:37.980> feels<00:02:38.160> right<00:02:38.400> play

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
interesting but I think feels right play

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:47.650 
interesting but I think feels right play
