00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.800
The bouldering boom is just starting in Mexico

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.940
There is a curiosity to visit one of the birthplaces of this sport we are so passionate about

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.880
The plan is to meet up with two of Mexico's strongest climbers

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.320
Let's go, man

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.860
THE SEARCH - Fountainebleau, France. A Bouldering Series

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.440
Franz is really great at giving it his all in each movement

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.020
His motivation surprises me

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.360
It is contagious, and is really helpful

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.140
My name is Franz Weber. I am from Mexico, I am 24 years-old

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:25.620
I met Franz about 5 years ago. And he is one of the top 10 strongest climbers right now in Mexico

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.440
And he is a great person

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.800
The Virgin Saint of the Rock, she is going to help save us from this rain

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.980
"Virgin of the Rock..."

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.540
"Save us from this rain..."

00:01:36.568 --> 00:01:38.568
"Dry these stones for us..."

00:01:38.568 --> 00:01:40.508
"Help us in every dyno..."

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.780
"Sloper and crimp..."

00:01:44.864 --> 00:01:48.204
I forgot the prayer of the Virgin Saint. We'll start again.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.680
Franz is really important in the development of climbing in Mexico.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.900
Look I will show you

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.680
Not just with opening new climbing zones and exploring harder routes

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.180
But he is really motivated with developing guides for the climbing zones

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:14.300
A guide that shows you the zone, the routes/ problems, how to move around, how is the rock, where to sleep &amp; eat

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.360
This information is fundamental for climbers that are traveling the world climbing in new spots

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.240
There's nothing left to say

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.760
It is really interesting here, it is a huge forest

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.220
There are more than 10,000 boulders

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.640
It is a bouldering Mecca

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.860
For me it is really important to see because in Mexico we are just starting to discover boulder zones

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:46.220
Mexico is huge . I can see here how a boulder zone is that is really well-developed

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:55.060
This a project by Jacky Godoffe. It is called Fatman. A V14 he put up in 1993.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.220
And here is a V15, one the hardest problems in Font. It starts on the left side of this problem

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.180
It is like arriving to an amusement park where they give you your guide and its like "All right! Let's go!"

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.180
It is a little wet. But it will dry

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.060
I have some tic marks to try to do a Flash attempt.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.760
Flash is when you do the whole problem on the first try without falling

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.940
You only have one chance in your life to do a Flash of a boulder problem

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:38.580
So you have to try to imagine the movements, and strength necessary in each move

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.700
To execute the moves perfectly, or almost perfectly

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.960
Nice!

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.640
Yeah brother!

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.280
I met Franz when I first started climber about 3 years ago

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.400
I've always admired him, he is a great climber.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.720
And he has always has a super positive energy

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.640
We are arriving to La Merveille, one of the most classic problems of Fontainebleau

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.440
It is marked here as one of the problems we want to try. It is a V12 / 8a+

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.220
It is starting to rain

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.700
A little bit of rain to clean the holds no?!

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.380
Oh well, nothing to do about it

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:09.940
It has been great the process to climb with some one so strong and knowledgable

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.040
It motivates you a lot

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.700
And it helps you clear your mind of limits

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.200
One creates their own limits

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.900
But when you see someone who exceeds those limits it is easier to believe something is possible

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.900
Let's see if this rains stops

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.660
If the rain stops perhaps in an hour the rock will dry

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.800
It's cold, which helps with friction. But while it is wet...

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.400
It is really difficult

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.880
It is the kind of day...

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.060
It is the kind of day that makes you cry.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.140
Fontainebleau - style from what I have been told

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.500
We are in a refuge right now because in the middle of our climbing session it started to rain

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.860
And we have equipment and cameras... But we can't climb when the rock is moist

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.526
Wet

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.840
It rains then stops and rains then stops

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.940
The life of a climber in the nature

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.820
Under a rock that has a meter of space.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.440
How good would some tacos be right now

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.240
Cow tongue tacos

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.860
We found a problem called Salathe Wall

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.940
It seemed really hard to us

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.580
People ask me if I fall

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.860
Every time I climb I fall 300 times in a day

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.700
It will go, it will go
