00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.679 

I<00:00:03.920> truly<00:00:04.920> still<00:00:05.910> don't<00:00:06.180> know<00:00:06.330> where<00:00:06.569> the

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:06.689 
I truly still don't know where the

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:08.209 
I truly still don't know where the
boundary<00:00:07.049> is<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.379> this<00:00:07.500> snowmobile<00:00:07.799> and

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:08.219 
boundary is of this snowmobile and

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:10.340 
boundary is of this snowmobile and
that's<00:00:08.490> pretty<00:00:09.059> cool<00:00:09.270> to<00:00:09.389> say<00:00:09.600> and<00:00:09.809> that's<00:00:10.139> why

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.350 
that's pretty cool to say and that's why

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:20.950 
that's pretty cool to say and that's why
I<00:00:10.379> wake<00:00:10.740> up<00:00:10.920> every<00:00:11.130> morning<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.400> go<00:00:11.519> ride

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.909 

that's<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.079> one<00:00:22.200> of<00:00:22.290> the<00:00:22.349> funnest<00:00:22.680> things

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:22.919 
that's the one of the funnest things

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:24.229 
that's the one of the funnest things
about<00:00:23.160> these<00:00:23.369> sleds<00:00:23.579> you<00:00:23.849> can<00:00:23.939> go<00:00:24.059> explore

00:00:24.229 --> 00:00:24.239 
about these sleds you can go explore

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:26.359 
about these sleds you can go explore
basically<00:00:24.930> anywhere<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.380> want<00:00:25.559> to<00:00:25.649> go<00:00:25.800> that's

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
basically anywhere you want to go that's

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.859 
basically anywhere you want to go that's

is<00:00:39.179> crank<00:00:39.390> up<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> clickers<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.199> that's<00:00:40.350> how

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
is crank up the clickers and that's how

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.650 
is crank up the clickers and that's how
I<00:00:40.920> jump<00:00:41.249> it<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.120> tough<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.539> way

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
belongs on one ski I truly think I could

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.590 
belongs on one ski I truly think I could
ride<00:01:07.130> pretty<00:01:08.130> much<00:01:08.280> anywhere<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.850> one<00:01:09.120> ski<00:01:09.390> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
ride pretty much anywhere on one ski and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.780 
ride pretty much anywhere on one ski and
I<00:01:09.690> have<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.140> much<00:01:10.290> confidence<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:10.980> my<00:01:11.220> sled<00:01:11.520> and

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
I have so much confidence in my sled and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.060 
I have so much confidence in my sled and
and<00:01:12.000> every<00:01:12.750> time<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.200> pull<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> line<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.010> I

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
and every time I pull a line that I

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.250 
and every time I pull a line that I
didn't<00:01:14.280> think<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.430> could<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.840> it<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:16.020> gives<00:01:16.200> me

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
didn't think I could do it just gives me

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.690 
didn't think I could do it just gives me
more<00:01:16.320> confidence<00:01:17.010> in<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> machine<00:01:17.520> and

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700
