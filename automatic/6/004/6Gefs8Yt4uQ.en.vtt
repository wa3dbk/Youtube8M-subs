machines<00:00:43.219> just<00:00:44.219> models<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.030> efficiency

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
machines just models of efficiency

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.060 
machines just models of efficiency
they're<00:00:45.960> pretty<00:00:46.140> great<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.559> it's<00:00:46.680> pretty

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
they're pretty great and it's pretty

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.470 
they're pretty great and it's pretty
rare<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.460> get<00:00:47.520> attacked<00:00:47.820> by<00:00:47.969> sharks<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.390> you

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
rare to get attacked by sharks so you

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.610 
rare to get attacked by sharks so you
shouldn't<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:48.780> worried<00:00:49.079> like<00:00:49.260> swimming<00:00:49.559> in

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
shouldn't be worried like swimming in

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.229 
shouldn't be worried like swimming in
the<00:00:49.710> ocean<00:00:49.739> yes<00:00:50.430> like<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.910> think<00:00:51.090> your<00:00:51.180> chances

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
the ocean yes like I think your chances

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.180 
the ocean yes like I think your chances
of<00:00:51.600> getting<00:00:51.690> struck<00:00:51.989> by<00:00:52.079> lightning<00:00:52.199> or<00:00:52.680> ten

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
of getting struck by lightning or ten

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.860 
of getting struck by lightning or ten
times<00:00:53.370> greater<00:00:53.489> oh<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.180> more<00:00:54.570> than<00:00:54.600> that

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
times greater oh it's more than that

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.290 
times greater oh it's more than that
more<00:00:55.110> than<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.410> even<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.949> have<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> 1<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.969> like

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
more than that even you have a 1 in like

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.680 
more than that even you have a 1 in like
3.6<00:00:58.230> million<00:00:58.620> chance<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.820> dying<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.539> you

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
3.6 million chance of dying in you

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.660 
3.6 million chance of dying in you
lifetime<00:01:01.079> from<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> shark<00:01:01.620> attack<00:01:01.920> exactly

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
lifetime from the shark attack exactly

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.509 
lifetime from the shark attack exactly
so<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.300> say<00:01:03.480> all<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.080> say<00:01:04.710> hats<00:01:05.129> off<00:01:05.400> to

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
so we say all this to say hats off to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.850 
so we say all this to say hats off to
you<00:01:05.610> sharks<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.320> why<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.470> need<00:01:07.619> Chuck

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
you sharks and why do we need Chuck

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.289 
you sharks and why do we need Chuck
Awareness<00:01:08.220> Day<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.580> don't<00:01:08.880> think<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.090> should

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
Awareness Day I don't think we should

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.380 
Awareness Day I don't think we should
what<00:01:09.689> we<00:01:09.810> do<00:01:09.990> because<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.460> dorsal<00:01:12.060> fin

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
what we do because of this dorsal fin

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.850 
what we do because of this dorsal fin
right<00:01:12.570> here<00:01:12.810> yeah<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.170> greatest<00:01:13.380> threat<00:01:13.830> to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
right here yeah the greatest threat to

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.950 
right here yeah the greatest threat to
sharks<00:01:14.460> their<00:01:14.700> greatest<00:01:14.939> predator<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.750> guess

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
sharks their greatest predator I guess

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.170
