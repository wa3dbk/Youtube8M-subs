temperature of my macbook is and it'll
be<00:00:40.410> here<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.649> says<00:00:40.800> active<00:00:41.280> setting<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.820> this

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
be here it says active setting and this

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.360 
be here it says active setting and this
is<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.239> profile<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.750> have<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.440> right<00:00:44.219> now<00:00:44.340> I

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
is the profile you have so right now I

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.369 
is the profile you have so right now I
have<00:00:44.610> two<00:00:44.850> profiles<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.719> default<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
have two profiles I have default and

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.350 
have two profiles I have default and
higher<00:00:46.590> rpm<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.340> what<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.579> have<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> default

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
higher rpm so what I have on a default

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.420 
higher rpm so what I have on a default
basically<00:00:49.230> my<00:00:49.320> fans<00:00:49.590> are<00:00:49.739> gonna<00:00:49.800> operate<00:00:50.250> as

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
basically my fans are gonna operate as

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.100 
basically my fans are gonna operate as
normal<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:50.940> if<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.149> never<00:00:51.390> even<00:00:51.570> installed<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
normal as if I never even installed the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.779 
normal as if I never even installed the
application<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.860> when<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.430> put<00:00:53.610> them<00:00:53.730> on

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
application and when I put them on

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.569 
application and when I put them on
higher<00:00:54.059> rpm<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.230> max<00:00:55.710> out<00:00:55.949> my<00:00:55.980> fans

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
higher rpm it's going to max out my fans

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.510 
higher rpm it's going to max out my fans
to<00:00:57.180> 100%<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.960> Mike's<00:00:58.170> system<00:00:58.559> runs<00:00:58.770> as<00:00:58.920> cool<00:00:59.250> as

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
to 100% so Mike's system runs as cool as

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.610 
to 100% so Mike's system runs as cool as
possible<00:00:59.719> which<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.750> really<00:01:01.079> important<00:01:01.469> for

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
possible which is really important for

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.579 
possible which is really important for
hardware<00:01:02.160> life<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.609> things<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.000> so

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
hardware life and things like that so

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.570 
hardware life and things like that so
obviously<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.920> change<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.280> if<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.460> go

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
obviously you can change this if you go

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.859 
obviously you can change this if you go
into<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.850> Preferences<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.600> make<00:01:06.720> as

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
into the Preferences you can make as

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.929 
into the Preferences you can make as
many<00:01:07.220> profiles<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.430> would<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.880> you

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
many profiles as you would like so you

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.090 
many profiles as you would like so you
can<00:01:09.030> make<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.360> for<00:01:09.630> low<00:01:10.170> fans<00:01:10.439> medium<00:01:10.890> fans

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
can make one for low fans medium fans

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.190 
can make one for low fans medium fans
high<00:01:11.340> fans<00:01:11.670> but<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.420> me<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.689> just<00:01:12.990> need<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
high fans but for me I just need the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.050 
high fans but for me I just need the
basic<00:01:13.530> default<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.130> then<00:01:14.250> if<00:01:14.369> I'm<00:01:14.460> editing<00:01:14.850> or

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
basic default and then if I'm editing or

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.030 
basic default and then if I'm editing or
gaming<00:01:15.299> most<00:01:15.960> time<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.140> have<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.439> music<00:01:16.560> pumped

gaming most time I have the music pumped

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.679 
gaming most time I have the music pumped
up<00:01:17.130> really<00:01:17.460> loud<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.850> if<00:01:17.939> I'm<00:01:18.030> gaming<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.479> don't

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
up really loud so if I'm gaming I don't

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.330 
up really loud so if I'm gaming I don't
even<00:01:18.780> care<00:01:19.350> about<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.740> fan<00:01:19.890> noise<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.310> just

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
even care about the fan noise I just

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.980 
even care about the fan noise I just
turn<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.700> all<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.880> way<00:01:21.000> up<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.659> way<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.810> keep

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
turn it all the way up that way I keep

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.600 
turn it all the way up that way I keep
my<00:01:22.140> system<00:01:22.439> as<00:01:22.560> cool<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:22.860> possible<00:01:22.920> get<00:01:23.430> max

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
my system as cool as possible get max

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.840 
my system as cool as possible get max
performance<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.320> overall<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:26.189> application

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
performance and overall this application

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.120 
performance and overall this application
allows<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.540> do<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.140> if<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.920> go<00:01:29.040> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
allows you to do that so if I go and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.679 
allows you to do that so if I go and
click<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.430> higher<00:01:29.610> rpm<00:01:30.000> here<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.540> see

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
click on higher rpm here as you can see

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.050 
click on higher rpm here as you can see
it's<00:01:30.869> set<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.220> 6200<00:01:32.220> which<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.640> max<00:01:32.880> and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
it's set it's 6200 which is the max and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.190 
it's set it's 6200 which is the max and
I<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.210> go<00:01:33.270> ahead<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.420> turn<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.720> down<00:01:33.900> if<00:01:34.110> I'd

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
I can go ahead and turn this down if I'd

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.039 
I can go ahead and turn this down if I'd
like<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.530> 3400<00:01:35.340> all<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.150> way<00:01:36.240> down<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.479> 1800

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
like to 3400 all the way down to 1800

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.359 
like to 3400 all the way down to 1800
but<00:01:37.200> basically<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.770> said<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.070> allows

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
but basically like I said this allows

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.249 
but basically like I said this allows
you<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.729> adjust<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.060> fan<00:01:39.240> speed<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.140> also

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
you to adjust the fan speed you can also

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.140 
you to adjust the fan speed you can also
show<00:01:41.009> what<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.340> want<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.579> show<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.880> menu

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
show what you want to show in the menu

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.510 
show what you want to show in the menu
bar<00:01:42.180> whether<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.259> want<00:01:43.409> Celsius<00:01:43.890> or<00:01:44.189> degrees

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
Fahrenheit and all that good stuff but

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.660 
Fahrenheit and all that good stuff but
basically<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:46.950> set<00:01:47.220> what<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.369> want

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
basically you just set what you want
