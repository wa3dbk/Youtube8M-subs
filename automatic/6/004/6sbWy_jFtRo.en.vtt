muscle<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.650> need<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.979> develop<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.820> shooting

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
muscle I need to develop for shooting

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.569 
muscle I need to develop for shooting
range<00:01:39.450> well<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:41.040> as<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.250> play<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.549> a

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
range well just as you play on a

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.819 
range well just as you play on a
basketball<00:01:42.000> team<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> team<00:01:43.229> your

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
basketball team you have a team your

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.520 
basketball team you have a team your
muscles<00:01:44.220> also<00:01:44.610> act<00:01:45.119> as<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.420> team<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.079> they<00:01:46.380> all

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
muscles also act as a team so they all

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.069 
muscles also act as a team so they all
work<00:01:46.770> together<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.340> there's<00:01:47.729> not<00:01:47.850> one<00:01:48.079> main

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
work together so there's not one main

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.380 
work together so there's not one main
muscle<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.070> focus<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.790> would

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
muscle that you have to focus on I would

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.620 
muscle that you have to focus on I would
say<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.799> work<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:53.009> everything<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.360> main

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
say to work on everything but the main

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.630 
say to work on everything but the main
muscle<00:01:55.170> groups<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.890> should<00:01:56.159> work<00:01:56.399> on

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
muscle groups that you should work on

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.870 
muscle groups that you should work on
would<00:01:57.360> be<00:01:57.570> fingertip<00:01:58.350> strength<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.520> good

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
would be fingertip strength so a good

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.640 
would be fingertip strength so a good
exercise<00:02:00.149> for<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.869> is

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
exercise for that is

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.250 
exercise for that is
doing<00:02:01.980> push-ups<00:02:02.250> on<00:02:02.670> your<00:02:02.910> fingertips<00:02:03.390> you

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
doing push-ups on your fingertips you

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.140 
doing push-ups on your fingertips you
can<00:02:04.440> change<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.010> angle<00:02:05.160> so<00:02:05.640> if<00:02:05.760> you're<00:02:05.910> wide

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
can change the angle so if you're wide

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.380 
can change the angle so if you're wide
or<00:02:06.600> close<00:02:06.930> or<00:02:07.410> you<00:02:08.160> know<00:02:08.250> arms<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.820> arms<00:02:09.240> out

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
or close or you know arms in arms out

angle of them wherever you're at doing

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.070 
angle of them wherever you're at doing
your<00:02:11.760> push-ups<00:02:12.060> try<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.720> stay<00:02:12.900> on<00:02:12.930> your

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
your push-ups try to stay on your

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.570 
your push-ups try to stay on your
fingertips<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:13.710> you<00:02:13.980> can<00:02:14.100> strengthen

in your core everything is working

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.030 
in your core everything is working
together<00:03:03.270> so<00:03:04.230> you've<00:03:04.440> got<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.620> train<00:03:04.890> your

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
together so you've got to train your

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.060 
together so you've got to train your

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
body as a whole another area that you

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.370 
body as a whole another area that you
could<00:03:08.310> focus<00:03:08.489> on<00:03:08.820> will<00:03:09.600> be<00:03:09.690> your<00:03:09.810> leg<00:03:10.019> strength

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
could focus on will be your leg strength

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.560 
could focus on will be your leg strength
because<00:03:10.920> as<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.850> shoot<00:03:12.030> you're<00:03:12.269> not<00:03:12.390> just

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
because as you shoot you're not just

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.850 
because as you shoot you're not just
standing<00:03:12.750> there<00:03:12.959> your<00:03:13.230> legs<00:03:13.440> have<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.739> come

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
standing there your legs have to come

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.930 
standing there your legs have to come
into<00:03:14.010> power<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:14.580> need<00:03:14.790> that

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
into power so you need that

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.720 
into power so you need that
explosiveness<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:17.160> could<00:03:17.310> train<00:03:17.550> your

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
explosiveness I you could train your

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.270 
explosiveness I you could train your
body<00:03:17.850> by<00:03:18.660> during<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.260> great<00:03:19.440> exercise<00:03:19.950> as

down as well as all the way up and you

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.940

you want to change that to focus as you

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.720 
you want to change that to focus as you
play<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.480> game<00:03:39.630> your<00:03:40.500> body's<00:03:40.769> moving<00:03:40.920> in<00:03:41.370> all

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
play the game your body's moving in all

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.240 
play the game your body's moving in all
different<00:03:42.120> angles<00:03:42.269> shorts<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.470> short

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
different angles shorts the short

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.949 
different angles shorts the short
distance<00:03:44.610> long<00:03:44.850> distance<00:03:45.269> quickness

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
distance long distance quickness

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.380 
distance long distance quickness
slowness<00:03:46.709> so<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.549> really<00:03:47.760> got<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:47.970> train<00:03:48.239> your

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
slowness so you really got to train your

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.670 
slowness so you really got to train your
muscles<00:03:48.540> accordingly

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
muscles accordingly

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.770

so<00:03:49.799> when<00:03:49.980> you<00:03:50.070> do<00:03:50.190> your<00:03:50.310> lunge<00:03:50.580> go<00:03:50.970> down<00:03:51.390> slow

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
so when you do your lunge go down slow

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.199 
so when you do your lunge go down slow
explode<00:03:52.530> up<00:03:52.680> fast<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.519> then<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.790> can<00:03:53.940> reverse

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
explode up fast and then you can reverse

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.530 
explode up fast and then you can reverse
that<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:55.500> can<00:03:55.620> also<00:03:55.769> add<00:03:56.100> hops<00:03:56.519> from<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.390> one

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
that you can also add hops from the one

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.900 
that you can also add hops from the one
leg<00:03:57.720> being<00:03:57.930> up<00:03:58.110> on<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.620> bench<00:03:58.830> so<00:03:59.640> these<00:03:59.760> are

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
leg being up on a bench so these are

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.720 
leg being up on a bench so these are
some<00:04:00.060> different<00:04:00.180> ideas<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:01.489> you've<00:04:02.489> got<00:04:02.610> your

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
some different ideas so you've got your

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.520 
some different ideas so you've got your
forearm<00:04:03.060> strength<00:04:03.390> you<00:04:03.690> got<00:04:03.870> your<00:04:04.019> functional
