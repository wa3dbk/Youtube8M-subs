00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.730
 hello friends and let's learn a 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.530
 really simple recipe that is 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.929
 perfect for beginners in 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.089
 the kitchen or do not have much time 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:15.759
 try a ham omelet in the 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.410
 microwave I hope you like the 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.900
 ingredients for our tortilla al 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.490
 microwaves will be one or two eggs 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.970
 depending on the size we want 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.029
 sea is a bit of chopped york ham 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.519
 cut into very small pieces a little 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.560
 of transparent paper a little bit of salt 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.230
 and a little bit of virgin olive oil 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.530
 extra the first thing we have to do 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.130
 is to beat the egg (s) in a 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.130
 container 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.990
 we will fight to make our 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.570
 tortilla 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.820
 As you can see, we would have beaten the eggs 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.490
 in a deep container now what 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.040
 let's do is take the plate or mold 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.560
 that can be put in the microwave that 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.870
 let's use it to do it for 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.440
 we're going to take some oil and 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.780
 let's take a few brushstrokes in our 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.850
 dish or mold to prevent our 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.200
 tortilla stick 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.500
 the brushstroke very well 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.009
 by all parties that may touch the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.009
 tortilla 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.119
 once brushstroke what we are going to do 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.640
 is to add the amount of salt that 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.380
 we would add to our pan something that goes 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.600
 depending on a little bit of our taste of 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.039
 how salty we like the tortilla 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.039
 I'm going to add a little pin 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.980
 then we could already take 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.920
 our eggs beaten 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.980
 when we have added our egg 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.690
 let's add the ham of york chicken 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.130
 substitute york ham for any 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.090
 another ingredient that you like as 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.400
 chorizo or turkey ham serrano the one that more 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.200
 you like us we wanted it to be 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.770
 ham of york to make it a bit more 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.770
 long 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.009
 we will do it spreading the good for everything 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.500
 the mold so that the chubs are not left 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.500
 in one place of our tortilla 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.190
 finally once we have all the 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.880
 ingredients in our mold we are going to 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.990
 cover the mold or plate with a little 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.990
 transparent paper 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.910
 As you can see, I would be ready to put 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.410
 the microwave what we are going to do is 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.830
 put it to three quarters of power 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.140
 for about a minute and this 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.970
 would be the final result if it has 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.100
