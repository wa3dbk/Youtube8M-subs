00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:18.960 
we'll have to stay by the trucks and
that's<00:01:18.189> hard<00:01:18.399> to<00:01:18.520> do

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
that's hard to do

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.690

loophole that doctor Hawass is in charge

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.270 
loophole that doctor Hawass is in charge
of<00:01:55.869> all<00:01:55.959> the<00:01:56.080> antiquities<00:01:56.560> which<00:01:56.830> means<00:01:57.100> he

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
of all the antiquities which means he

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.760 
of all the antiquities which means he
controls<00:01:57.670> all<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.090> land<00:01:58.299> where<00:01:59.020> Egyptian
