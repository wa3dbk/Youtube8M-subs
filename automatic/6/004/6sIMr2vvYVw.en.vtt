00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
before I just can figure out how to get

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.990 
before I just can figure out how to get
this<00:01:46.470> okay<00:01:47.280> small<00:01:48.590> pieces<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.830> tape<00:01:50.190> here<00:01:50.640> on

and<00:02:10.000> there<00:02:11.000> we<00:02:11.270> have<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:17.590> get<00:02:18.590> out<00:02:18.800> of<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.100> way

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.070 

who<00:02:25.430> are<00:02:25.580> like<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.970> opening<00:02:26.450> mechanism<00:02:26.660> here

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
who are like the opening mechanism here

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.610 

maybe<00:02:38.209> we<00:02:38.450> should<00:02:38.660> take<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.110> look<00:02:39.350> at<00:02:39.470> that

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620
