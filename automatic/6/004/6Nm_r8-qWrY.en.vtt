00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
to be have I can unroll a type thing

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:17.759 
to be have I can unroll a type thing
over<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:11.110> keep<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.440> upright<00:02:16.470> there's<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.560> hole

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
over to keep it upright there's a hole

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.020 
over to keep it upright there's a hole
here<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:19.600> hole<00:02:19.630> here<00:02:20.320> so<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:21.550> cat<00:02:21.760> can't

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
so that's it

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.970
