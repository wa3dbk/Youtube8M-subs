cost<00:01:27.509> one<00:01:27.780> meter<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.350> game<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.220> allows

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
cost one meter in this game so it allows

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.039 
cost one meter in this game so it allows
you<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.610> do<00:01:29.700> crazy<00:01:30.000> stuff<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.450> could<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:30.659> risky

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
you to do crazy stuff you could be risky

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.450 
you to do crazy stuff you could be risky
as<00:01:31.140> hell<00:01:31.170> all<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.680> time<00:01:31.860> since<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.159> only<00:01:32.250> uses

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
as hell all the time since it only uses

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.490 
as hell all the time since it only uses
up<00:01:32.700> one<00:01:32.880> bar<00:01:33.150> now<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.930> makes<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> lot<00:01:34.439> of

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
up one bar now that makes for a lot of

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.590 
up one bar now that makes for a lot of
interesting<00:01:35.220> things<00:01:35.250> as<00:01:35.579> far<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:35.790> combo<00:01:36.270> and

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
interesting things as far as combo and

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.469 
interesting things as far as combo and
extending<00:01:37.350> combos<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.189> once<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.240> started

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
extending combos so once you started

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.730 
extending combos so once you started
showing<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.900> off<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.200> me<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.710> a

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
showing that off to me like this is a

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.710 
showing that off to me like this is a
lot<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.159> fun<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.700> then<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> juggling<00:01:42.360> system

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
lot of fun and then the juggling system

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.450 
lot of fun and then the juggling system
which<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.960> very<00:01:43.229> tech<00:01:43.590> Enosh<00:01:43.890> if<00:01:44.070> there's<00:01:44.250> one

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
which is very tech Enosh if there's one

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.560 
which is very tech Enosh if there's one
thing<00:01:44.520> they<00:01:44.729> take<00:01:44.909> from<00:01:45.000> tekken<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.360> most

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
thing they take from tekken the most

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.929 
thing they take from tekken the most
it's<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.229> midair<00:01:46.470> juggling<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.700> that's

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
it's the midair juggling and that's

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.190 
it's the midair juggling and that's
that's<00:01:48.180> interesting<00:01:48.659> too<00:01:48.810> because<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.079> try

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that's interesting too because you try

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.170 
that's interesting too because you try
to<00:01:49.259> figure<00:01:49.500> out<00:01:49.710> which<00:01:50.399> hits<00:01:50.700> should<00:01:50.909> go<00:01:51.060> in

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
to figure out which hits should go in

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.910 
to figure out which hits should go in
that<00:01:51.270> do<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.509> most<00:01:51.659> damage<00:01:51.780> stuff<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:52.890> that

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
that do the most damage stuff like that

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.760 
that do the most damage stuff like that
