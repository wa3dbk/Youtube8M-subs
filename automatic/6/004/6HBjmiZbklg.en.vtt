00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
one has a little points where the tool

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.629 
one has a little points where the tool
will<00:06:36.840> go

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
will go

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:39.429 
will go
and<00:06:38.120> so<00:06:38.539> that's<00:06:38.810> how<00:06:38.960> you<00:06:39.020> know<00:06:39.229> how<00:06:39.379> to

00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:39.439 
and so that's how you know how to

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:41.080 
and so that's how you know how to
unscrew<00:06:39.919> it<00:06:39.949> so<00:06:40.280> if<00:06:40.400> there<00:06:40.580> aren't<00:06:40.729> any<00:06:40.909> of

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
unscrew it so if there aren't any of

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.330 
unscrew it so if there aren't any of
these<00:06:41.530> little<00:06:42.530> indexing<00:06:43.520> marks<00:06:44.319> then

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
these little indexing marks then

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.399 
these little indexing marks then
probably<00:06:46.340> could<00:06:47.240> just<00:06:47.419> use<00:06:47.599> this<00:06:47.780> and<00:06:48.020> pop<00:06:48.229> off

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:48.409 
probably could just use this and pop off

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:53.000 
probably could just use this and pop off
the<00:06:48.590> back

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.710
