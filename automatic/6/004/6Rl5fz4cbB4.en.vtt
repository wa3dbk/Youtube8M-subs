00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.680 
like a mid-foot strike i can't really am
I<00:03:00.400> supposed<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.700> build<00:03:00.850> up<00:03:01.060> into<00:03:01.269> that<00:03:01.390> sort<00:03:01.660> of

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
I supposed to build up into that sort of

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.120 
I supposed to build up into that sort of
thing<00:03:01.750> right<00:03:01.989> yeah<00:03:02.260> so<00:03:02.590> if<00:03:02.709> I'm<00:03:02.829> showing

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
thing right yeah so if I'm showing

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.970 
thing right yeah so if I'm showing
somebody<00:03:03.310> from<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.820> ground<00:03:04.090> up<00:03:04.299> to<00:03:04.690> run<00:03:05.650> in<00:03:05.920> a

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
somebody from the ground up to run in a

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.370 
somebody from the ground up to run in a
more<00:03:06.220> natural<00:03:06.670> style<00:03:07.239> I<00:03:07.540> would<00:03:07.959> start<00:03:08.200> him<00:03:08.320> in

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
more natural style I would start him in

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.319 
more natural style I would start him in
the<00:03:08.500> barefoot<00:03:08.860> she<00:03:08.980> like<00:03:09.130> this<00:03:09.280> but<00:03:09.519> that

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
the barefoot she like this but that

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.400 
the barefoot she like this but that
means<00:03:10.540> they're<00:03:10.690> also<00:03:10.810> going<00:03:10.959> to<00:03:11.019> have<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.260> cut

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
means they're also going to have to cut

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.100 
means they're also going to have to cut
their<00:03:11.560> mileage<00:03:11.739> down<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.570> quite<00:03:13.570> a<00:03:13.600> small<00:03:13.750> run

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
their mileage down to quite a small run

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.979 
their mileage down to quite a small run
so<00:03:14.709> go<00:03:14.890> eat<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.250> precision<00:03:15.750> accurate<00:03:16.750> for<00:03:16.900> the

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
so go eat the precision accurate for the

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.479 
so go eat the precision accurate for the
shoe<00:03:17.200> alright<00:03:17.680> so<00:03:17.860> now<00:03:18.040> what's<00:03:18.430> the

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
shoe alright so now what's the

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.759 
shoe alright so now what's the
difference<00:03:18.970> between<00:03:19.090> most<00:03:19.660> I<00:03:19.780> mean<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.620> this

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
difference between most I mean so this

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.420 
difference between most I mean so this
is<00:03:20.950> a<00:03:20.980> little<00:03:21.100> bit<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.700> little<00:03:22.739> bit<00:03:23.739> flatter<00:03:24.070> or

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
is a little bit a little bit flatter or

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.130 
is a little bit a little bit flatter or
a<00:03:24.459> little<00:03:24.880> bit<00:03:25.000> there's<00:03:25.329> no<00:03:25.600> lift<00:03:25.870> in<00:03:26.019> it

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
a little bit there's no lift in it

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.199 
a little bit there's no lift in it
whatsoever<00:03:26.440> yeah<00:03:27.280> but<00:03:27.459> these<00:03:27.579> shooters<00:03:27.880> here

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
whatsoever yeah but these shooters here

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.000 
whatsoever yeah but these shooters here
the<00:03:28.420> Newton's<00:03:28.720> over<00:03:29.170> here<00:03:29.320> that<00:03:29.470> have<00:03:29.620> some

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
the Newton's over here that have some

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.580

someone<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.190> get<00:03:33.310> into<00:03:33.670> issue<00:03:34.060> that's<00:03:34.390> natural

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
someone to get into issue that's natural

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.449 
someone to get into issue that's natural

running style but they can do more
mileage<00:03:39.100> than<00:03:39.310> say<00:03:39.700> just<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.060> half<00:03:40.239> a<00:03:40.269> mile<00:03:40.570> like

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
mileage than say just a half a mile like

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.690 
mileage than say just a half a mile like
an<00:03:41.170> affair<00:03:41.410> bishop<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:42.070> that<00:03:42.220> way<00:03:42.370> if<00:03:42.489> they<00:03:42.640> do

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
of a lift right here on the Newton's is

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.900 
of a lift right here on the Newton's is
that<00:04:14.680> something<00:04:15.040> that<00:04:15.070> could<00:04:15.250> possibly<00:04:15.760> get

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
that something that could possibly get

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.670 
that something that could possibly get
caught<00:04:16.150> in<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.329> slats<00:04:16.690> as<00:04:16.959> we're<00:04:17.139> running<00:04:17.470> I

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
caught in the slats as we're running I

caught in the slats as we're running I
mean<00:04:17.949> as<00:04:18.040> a<00:04:18.100> possibility<00:04:18.459> anything<00:04:18.940> but

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
mean as a possibility anything but

anything could happen but I familiar
with<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.430> wood<00:04:21.579> one<00:04:21.730> ways<00:04:22.330> I<00:04:22.570> think<00:04:22.630> you'd<00:04:22.930> be

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
with the wood one ways I think you'd be

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.980 
with the wood one ways I think you'd be
all<00:04:23.199> right<00:04:23.350> all<00:04:23.680> right<00:04:23.710> so<00:04:24.600> these<00:04:25.600> are<00:04:25.810> nice

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
alright so and what's the difference

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.520 
alright so and what's the difference
between<00:05:04.060> this<00:05:04.570> and<00:05:04.630> what<00:05:04.870> we<00:05:05.080> were<00:05:05.169> looking<00:05:05.440> at

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
between this and what we were looking at

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.350 
between this and what we were looking at
about<00:05:05.740> about<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:06.250> same<00:05:06.430> with<00:05:07.060> these<00:05:07.180> do<00:05:07.330> have

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
about about the same with these do have

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.969 
about about the same with these do have
a<00:05:07.510> little<00:05:07.600> bit<00:05:07.720> more<00:05:07.930> of<00:05:08.020> a<00:05:08.080> heel<00:05:08.320> lift<00:05:08.590> so<00:05:08.800> it

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
a little bit more of a heel lift so it

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.800 
a little bit more of a heel lift so it
still<00:05:09.250> falls<00:05:09.490> within<00:05:09.820> natural<00:05:10.150> position

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
still falls within natural position

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.810 
still falls within natural position
because<00:05:11.020> it's<00:05:11.050> low<00:05:11.530> enough<00:05:11.710> it's<00:05:12.520> not<00:05:12.669> like<00:05:12.790> a

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
because it's low enough it's not like a

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.000 
because it's low enough it's not like a
traditional<00:05:13.360> running<00:05:13.540> shoe<00:05:13.810> but<00:05:14.740> it<00:05:14.860> does

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
traditional running shoe but it does

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.850 
traditional running shoe but it does
also<00:05:15.190> have<00:05:15.310> a<00:05:15.490> very<00:05:15.880> natural<00:05:16.660> motion<00:05:17.169> to<00:05:17.710> it

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
also have a very natural motion to it

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.409 
also have a very natural motion to it
it's<00:05:18.010> very<00:05:18.190> fluent<00:05:18.669> allows<00:05:18.910> that's<00:05:19.150> like<00:05:19.300> the

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
it's very fluent allows that's like the

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.480 
it's very fluent allows that's like the
twist<00:05:19.690> and<00:05:19.930> torque<00:05:20.229> the<00:05:20.680> way<00:05:20.800> natural<00:05:21.280> wood

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
twist and torque the way natural wood

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.700 
twist and torque the way natural wood
