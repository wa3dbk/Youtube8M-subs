details on how to do it just know that
there<00:00:27.750> are<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> few<00:00:27.960> situations<00:00:28.320> where<00:00:28.769> this

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
there are a few situations where this

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.919 
there are a few situations where this
doesn't<00:00:29.279> work<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:30.240> first<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.810> it

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
doesn't work the first is that it

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:31.820 
doesn't work the first is that it
doesn't<00:00:31.170> really<00:00:31.289> work<00:00:31.439> against<00:00:31.740> the

phenomenal positioning because it will

phenomenal positioning because it will
just<00:00:35.460> pull<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.730> into<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.000> tower<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
just pull you into the tower and the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.479 
just pull you into the tower and the
next<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.649> won't<00:00:37.860> work<00:00:37.920> if<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.280> go<00:00:38.370> on

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
next is that it won't work if you go on

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.130 
next is that it won't work if you go on

at level 1 however since most players

usually<00:03:37.690> if<00:03:37.840> you<00:03:37.959> wait<00:03:38.079> for<00:03:38.260> them<00:03:38.350> to<00:03:38.380> flash<00:03:38.560> or

usually if you wait for them to flash or
wait<00:03:39.519> until<00:03:39.760> they<00:03:39.850> are<00:03:39.880> running<00:03:40.120> away<00:03:40.389> it

up is if you get duped in the brush you

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.120

more<00:04:27.130> likely<00:04:27.340> for<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.669> enemy<00:04:27.970> ad<00:04:28.150> to<00:04:28.419> be<00:04:28.540> out

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
more likely for the enemy ad to be out

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.969 
more likely for the enemy ad to be out
of<00:04:28.660> position<00:04:28.810> because<00:04:29.320> of<00:04:29.410> wanting<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:29.710> farm

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
of position because of wanting to farm

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.680 
of position because of wanting to farm
so<00:04:30.490> you<00:04:30.580> might<00:04:30.699> just<00:04:30.850> have<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.030> go<00:04:31.240> on<00:04:31.270> them<00:04:31.509> and

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
so you might just have to go on them and

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.999 
so you might just have to go on them and
hope<00:04:31.780> they<00:04:31.840> didn't<00:04:32.169> get<00:04:32.229> their<00:04:32.410> gap<00:04:32.560> closer<00:04:32.830> at

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
hope they didn't get their gap closer at

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.730 
hope they didn't get their gap closer at
level<00:04:33.220> one<00:04:33.479> be<00:04:34.479> patient<00:04:34.930> and<00:04:35.050> user<00:04:35.229> skills<00:04:35.590> to

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
level one be patient and user skills to

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.740 
level one be patient and user skills to
the<00:04:35.830> maximum<00:04:36.250> potential<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:37.270> performed

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
the maximum potential it performed

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.330 
the maximum potential it performed
correctly<00:04:37.960> it<00:04:38.320> should<00:04:38.440> be<00:04:38.530> easy<00:04:38.770> to<00:04:38.919> develop

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
correctly it should be easy to develop

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.680 
correctly it should be easy to develop
the<00:04:39.460> strategy<00:04:39.880> into<00:04:40.120> a<00:04:40.150> very<00:04:40.479> high<00:04:40.630> success

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
the strategy into a very high success

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.379 
the strategy into a very high success
rate<00:04:41.199> probably<00:04:41.800> around<00:04:42.190> 80%<00:04:42.550> or<00:04:42.910> higher<00:04:42.940> I

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
rate probably around 80% or higher I

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.330 
rate probably around 80% or higher I
hope<00:04:44.080> I've<00:04:44.229> explained<00:04:44.650> this<00:04:44.770> in<00:04:44.919> the<00:04:44.949> best<00:04:45.160> way

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
hope I've explained this in the best way

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.850 
hope I've explained this in the best way
possible<00:04:45.509> this<00:04:46.509> is<00:04:46.750> of<00:04:46.870> course<00:04:47.110> a<00:04:47.199> tactic<00:04:47.590> best

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
possible this is of course a tactic best

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.409 
possible this is of course a tactic best
using<00:04:48.280> dual<00:04:48.430> queue<00:04:48.639> and<00:04:48.820> probably<00:04:49.240> only

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
using dual queue and probably only

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.029 
using dual queue and probably only
possible<00:04:50.050> in<00:04:50.169> duo<00:04:50.350> queue<00:04:50.560> where<00:04:50.830> you<00:04:50.889> can

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
possible in duo queue where you can

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.219 
possible in duo queue where you can
communicate<00:04:51.220> with<00:04:51.550> your<00:04:51.729> partner<00:04:52.090> but<00:04:53.020> it<00:04:53.139> is

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
communicate with your partner but it is

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:54.810 
communicate with your partner but it is
still<00:04:53.470> very<00:04:53.710> good<00:04:53.860> and<00:04:54.280> can<00:04:54.400> turn<00:04:54.550> a<00:04:54.610> weak

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
still very good and can turn a weak

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.610 
still very good and can turn a weak
laning<00:04:55.150> phase<00:04:55.300> into<00:04:55.600> a<00:04:55.720> strong<00:04:56.080> snowball<00:04:56.530> for

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
laning phase into a strong snowball for

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.070 
laning phase into a strong snowball for
your<00:04:56.800> team<00:04:56.979> the<00:04:57.910> strategy<00:04:58.419> may<00:04:58.600> work<00:04:58.900> with

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
your team the strategy may work with

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.290 
your team the strategy may work with
other<00:04:59.289> a<00:04:59.350> DS<00:04:59.680> or<00:04:59.919> other<00:05:00.160> supports<00:05:00.639> but<00:05:01.090> it<00:05:01.210> will

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
other a DS or other supports but it will

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.290 
other a DS or other supports but it will
definitely<00:05:01.510> work<00:05:01.930> best<00:05:02.229> with<00:05:02.440> Ashe<00:05:02.650> Gianna<00:05:03.300> so

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
definitely work best with Ashe Gianna so

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.120 
definitely work best with Ashe Gianna so
that's<00:05:04.720> it<00:05:04.930> for<00:05:05.050> my<00:05:05.169> first<00:05:05.350> blood<00:05:05.620> Jana<00:05:05.919> hash

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
that's it for my first blood Jana hash

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.430 
that's it for my first blood Jana hash
