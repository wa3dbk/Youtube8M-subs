whatsoever so those are the parts or the
joints<00:02:31.269> for<00:02:31.450> kami<00:02:32.010> some<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.490> irritating

joints for kami some of the irritating

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.120 
joints for kami some of the irritating
parts<00:02:34.450> are<00:02:34.630> here<00:02:35.260> on<00:02:35.440> the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
parts are here on the

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.110 
parts are here on the
braided<00:02:36.730> hair<00:02:37.080> east<00:02:38.080> attaches<00:02:38.650> easily<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.490> as

braided hair east attaches easily and as

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.570 
braided hair east attaches easily and as
long<00:02:40.390> as<00:02:40.600> you<00:02:40.780> can<00:02:41.020> keep<00:02:41.350> it<00:02:41.500> together<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:42.220> think

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
long as you can keep it together I think

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.370 
long as you can keep it together I think
there's<00:02:42.940> no<00:02:43.060> issue<00:02:43.270> and<00:02:43.600> there<00:02:44.050> are<00:02:44.080> some

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
there's no issue and there are some

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.790 
there's no issue and there are some
reports<00:02:44.500> that<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.040> legs<00:02:45.340> do<00:02:45.750> snap<00:02:46.750> off<00:02:47.080> and

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
reports that the legs do snap off and

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.780 
reports that the legs do snap off and
then<00:02:48.520> the<00:02:48.730> joints<00:02:49.150> get<00:02:49.570> broken<00:02:50.260> in<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.800> longer

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
then the joints get broken in the longer

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.530 
then the joints get broken in the longer
process<00:02:52.300> so<00:02:52.810> keep<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.710> and<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.280> really<00:02:54.820> nice

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
process so keep this and a really nice

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.980 
process so keep this and a really nice
warm<00:02:56.200> place<00:02:56.350> so<00:02:57.160> those<00:02:57.940> joints<00:02:58.390> wouldn't<00:02:58.780> be

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
warm place so those joints wouldn't be

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.250 
warm place so those joints wouldn't be
so<00:02:59.410> much<00:02:59.590> exposed<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.310> in<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.450> end<00:03:01.630> ruining

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
so much exposed and in the end ruining

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.820 
so much exposed and in the end ruining
the<00:03:02.530> joint<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.160> ruin<00:03:03.910> ruining<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.900> figure<00:03:05.320> so

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
the joint and ruin ruining the figure so

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.200 
the joint and ruin ruining the figure so
those<00:03:06.130> are<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.520> things<00:03:06.610> that<00:03:06.880> you<00:03:06.970> need<00:03:07.120> to
