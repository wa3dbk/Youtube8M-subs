00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.490
 after the 1-1 draw against Boca 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.059
 to marcelo gallardo at a conference 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:19.310
 press I think you can not evaluate 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.320
 too much the situation 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.140
 climate of the playing field on all 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.669
 things 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.960
 It was very difficult to play two teams 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:32.230
 they tried to try to play for 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.020
 up to try to put the ball in 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.210
 rival field and from there generate 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.839
 any situation that could cause the 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.820
 defensive mistake and I think it's the 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:47.019
 only way to analyze a game of 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.239
 these characteristics beyond all 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.940
 what happened in the game after 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.859
 you can count the situations 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.910
 that were generated in favor and against 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:01.390
 since the game can not be analyzed 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:04.180
 too much but out there if we count 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.830
 the situations that have been generated 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.140
 through the little that could play 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.330
 I believe that 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.520
 that we went at least we got 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.979
 some more situations of power 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.800
 complete she had 60 thousand people in 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.860
 the court was a situation something 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.030
 complex for those who had to 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.290
 they decided 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.890
 the ball 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.260
 beyond that he could not roll in 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.740
 in all fields could play for 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.470
 up did not do that did not give us the 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.820
 show obviously and good I have left 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.070
 that feeling of 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.040
 that if we have been in conditions 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.560
 normal the party could have been 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.540
 much better and I think it would have been 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.149
 much more favorable to us such 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.500
 long time but no match very 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.500
 complicated for the referee too 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.210
 not for god easy to handle 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.750
 is a team of two teams inside that 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.750
 battle 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.770
 and they take off with a lot of risk their physical 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:16.840
 it's an easy one for arrest 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.840
 and beyond the mistake that out there 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.410
 I think it gave the feeling that there was 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.510
 been criminal 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.520
 in motion until I thought there was 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.230
 been criminal because the movement is clear 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.140
 with your hand but after finishing 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.590
 it is possible that it was wrong 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.420
 then in a goal of ours we have to 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.450
 deponen a sanchez center 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.800
 I do not think there were not but say 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.710
 that is wrong also line has 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.570
 raised the flag I think that also 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.180
 There is a wrong but good final 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.680
 the referees are wrong and we 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.750
 also make mistakes and everyone 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.060
 is wrong and in these games still 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.360
 much more, not because they are at the limit and 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.360
 juana 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.319
