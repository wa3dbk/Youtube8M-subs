00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 and how about friends welcome to the channel is 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.549
 myspace welcome to a new video on 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.680
 that occasion we also inaugurated a 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.450
 new battle series of gods not 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.429
 explain very quickly what you are going to 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.870
 consist of this new series what 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.120
 let's do is in every episode in 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.770
 each chapter compare two gods 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.750
 different and through the data 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.119
 objectives that we obtain from the own 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.039
 height of the game itself compare and say 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.619
 which is the best or which a priori 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.840
 by statistics it should be the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.550
 more good the most useful for it we do not go 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.740
 to take into account nor the level of 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.530
 player is not even if the player does not 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.960
 has the god at 10 or has it at 5 or 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.760
 that is neither for now the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.469
 skills or their use in team fight 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.820
 among other things because you fight 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.559
 simply because they have not found the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.780
 way to incorporate the skills to 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.280
 this new series and audio that I will be 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.480
 thinking about it if anyone has any 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.010
 idea of what we could do to 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.899
 really compare the skills of 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.969
 objective way that I mentioned it to me because 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.070
 the truth would be happy to receive 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.020
 that information then said this 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.000
 let's start with today's chapter 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.410
 branch versus apollo we started with the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.659
 great and we started with a duel the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.880
 really strong enough that promises a lot 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.649
 two players of the gods in this case 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.539
 very dear to the majority the community 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.310
 especially to polo I know that many 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:14.289
 like yes with many you use but without 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.090
 However, the branch is not left behind and also 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.649
 I know you have many fans these 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.179
 let's take off and what are coming 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.310
 the letters that are going to give us all the 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:23.020
 necessary information about the gods 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.539
 to really know who the champion is 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.340
 of this first battle as you see here 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.500
 are the cards already displayed and we're going 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.869
 to start with the damage in the damage wins 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.759
 Branch wins branch because this damage is the 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.590
 that we have initially after the two 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.750
 they will be climbing each level the same 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.489
 amount of damage evidently based 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.989
 also in the physical power that they have 

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:42.849
 through items I have not told you 

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:44.319
 before but try little we're going to 

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:46.569
 keep in mind although obviously 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.700
 would be a factor to highlight to know if 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.619
 a god is better than another or not without 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.599
 However, as I say, this is simply 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.849
 based on the data in the objective data 

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:57.399
 let's go to it as I say in the first 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:58.989
 section on the damage wins frog let's 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.000
 the second that is life and as you see 

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:03.069
 they seem to be pretty even they start 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.989
 branch with more life but nevertheless apollo 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:06.879
 add more life with each level and this 

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:09.160
 makes that in the end I made the calculations 

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:11.080
 already so have it more than life without 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.970
 no item I repeat again 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.740
 branch which is good because they give the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.780
 victory for very little is true but 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.610
 it gives you the victory which is what 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.160
 We look forward to the next section 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.040
 to manna and in this case they win in a 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.580
 very clear very good because so much 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.980
 standout pole as you see 225 plus 40 of 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.710
 mana by level in branch change has 205 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.180
 plus 34 mana per passing level than this 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.100
 then we are going to have to contrast 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.660
 with the extra point however we go to 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.460
 following the next section of 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.880
 attack speed spills it very 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.740
 large 0.92 initially plus 1.4 per 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.800
 percent for each level in the case of 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.959
 apolo 0.9 plus 1.2 percent for each 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.640
 level here loves very clearly branch and 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.130
 really, it is one of his most important points 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.240
 strong as you know has the 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.520
 next paragraph that is the difficulty 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.530
 that we really do not value is a god is 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.450
 better or worse in case of difficulty but 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.980
 It is always good to know her for 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.959
 obviously then we get an idea of 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.820
 if it's going to cost us more or less to master it 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.010
 in this case how is the difficulty that 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.650
 hayden gives us to ram is difficult and the 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.270
 of apolo is easy we go for extra point 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.800
 that is all the extra point lucas then 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.540
 well it's a section so to speak that 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.800
 I invented myself because the gods 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.260
 always have some face 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.300
 own that distinguishes them from the rest and that 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.310
 It should be noted because it obviously can 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.500
 influence the result as you see we are going 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.970
 first with a branch and its extra point would be 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.440
 in this case given by the arrows 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.790
 astral to what do I mean with the 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.410
 astral arrows, not only your 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.420
 passive that you already know that goes 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.550
 recharging the arrows but also 1 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.320
 where you know that they are used and the others 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.750
 skills through the non-authentic dose 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.340
 passed to very low levels throw the 1 and 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.840
 with a couple of arrows so load yourself 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.700
 practically a line of minions 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.070
 you also know that until that very little 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.810
 way 25 by arrow more on the arrow 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.310
 which is evidently spent thereby 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.380
 I already tell you that there really is a 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.900
 point in favor branch and it's going to 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.460
 confer that manna you need that 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.530
 you know that before we said that he wins 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.660
 so it has set them apart be less 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.460
 that each date only spends 25 of 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.020
 Mana in all really this extra point 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.550
 it's very interesting in the branch we go with 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.440
 the one of apolo that in this case would be his 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.390
 passive you know that the passive one gives by the 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.460
 makes every ten basic attacks that 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.860
 obviously want a goal you're going to 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.660
 have five with 100% speed of 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.030
 attack which would increase your speed 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.739
 tav to that remarkably then said 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.180
 these guys we already know all the 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.740
 data we already know everything there is to 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.479
 know about these two gods 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.430
 let's go really who is the champion 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.960
 of today's first combat and the truth 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.729
 to do the first fight I was 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.080
 pretty pretty tight guys I have 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.030
 What to say to you, why good? 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.009
 have you seen which branch to win or in this 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.900
 case in the damage to also winning the 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.509
 attack speed has gained the point 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.400
 extra and apollo has making a living and the 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.569
 manna then really who wins then 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.639
 well I just told you practically 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.349
 branch is the winner of this first 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.060
 contention must be taken into account that 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.099
 both in a very high mobility 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.539
 especially to polo for example has a 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:53.620
 mobility of the last one we have not had 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.449
 in account that's why I tell you that I 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.150
 would like to incorporate in some way the 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.620
 skills but branch because it has been the 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.419
 winner of that contest as I say 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.159
 especially for his speed attack that is 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.080
 tremendous also for the base damage that 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.520
 it is very important and also for the point 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.810
 of view that as I say the topic of 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.909
 astral arrows because it makes 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.919
 practically compensate the manna that has 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.699
 of less and really it's a very point to 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.530
 your favor 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.630
 so as I say first fight 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.000
 first chapter that wins branch in this 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.130
 case for the next chapters guys 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.409
 how are we going to do it because I still do not know what 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.180
 make as good as practically a 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.470
 king of the track that would be commonly said 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.280
 what would it be like in this case as 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.080
 won branch 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.340
 they followed the next chapter against 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.200
 another under let's do it for 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.240
 categories first or if you simply 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.160
 you want us to do it with two gods 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.720
 new with two before new and we 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.220
 we forget that Rammac has won and 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.810
 then guys always 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.370
 comments as you want this series goes to 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.710
 vary a lot depending on what 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.720
 you 6 for her and me 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.090
 also that other two gods or one if 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.590
 you prefer the king of the track you want 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.000
 for the next episode because you're going to 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.280
 do you with your comments 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.139
 what are you going to say so they were 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.310
 guys here ends the first chapter of 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.169
 this new series I the truth is that 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.460
 I really want to fly 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.380
 will continue making chapters will continue 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.880
 doing battles because I think you can 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.160
 be quite interesting enough 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.660
 cool and pretty funny so no 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.690
 guys the process of liking and that 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.690
 keep enjoying is maite until another 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.690
 goodbye
