I think is restored the pride in

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.639 
I think is restored the pride in
Northern<00:00:56.030> Hemisphere<00:00:56.449> rugby<00:00:56.809> what<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:57.350> Lions

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
Northern Hemisphere rugby what the Lions

and<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.750> style<00:01:05.750> of<00:01:05.840> play<00:01:05.990> that<00:01:06.020> we<00:01:06.170> found<00:01:06.440> I

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
and the style of play that we found I

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.430 
and the style of play that we found I
would<00:01:07.520> also<00:01:07.670> like<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:07.940> add<00:01:08.149> that<00:01:08.180> not<00:01:08.810> only<00:01:09.200> and

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
would also like to add that not only and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.560 
would also like to add that not only and
they<00:01:09.950> proved<00:01:10.190> themselves<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:10.790> be<00:01:10.909> fine

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.010 
they proved themselves to be fine
rugby<00:01:12.200> players<00:01:12.470> I<00:01:12.770> think<00:01:13.670> without<00:01:14.390> hesitation

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
rugby players I think without hesitation

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.490 
rugby players I think without hesitation
they<00:01:15.590> threw<00:01:15.800> himself<00:01:16.009> to<00:01:16.369> be<00:01:16.520> good<00:01:17.240> people<00:01:18.080> and

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
they threw himself to be good people and

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.440 
they threw himself to be good people and
I<00:01:18.619> think<00:01:18.680> that<00:01:18.890> was<00:01:19.159> also<00:01:19.340> very<00:01:19.670> important<00:01:20.149> for

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
I think that was also very important for

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.359 
I think that was also very important for
the<00:01:20.539> game<00:01:20.720> of<00:01:20.869> rugby<00:01:21.020> football

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.789 

the<00:01:26.369> jersey<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.149> important<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.289> tradition

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
the jersey is important the tradition

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.429 
the jersey is important the tradition
and<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.789> players<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.509> worn<00:01:30.780> jerseys<00:01:31.289> in<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
and the players of worn jerseys in the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.889 
and the players of worn jerseys in the
past<00:01:31.820> carry<00:01:32.820> with<00:01:33.119> them<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.539> great<00:01:34.049> onus<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
past carry with them a great onus and

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.169 
past carry with them a great onus and
and<00:01:36.899> history<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:38.039> I<00:01:38.189> think<00:01:38.219> that<00:01:38.549> still<00:01:38.820> holds

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
and history and I think that still holds

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.340 
and history and I think that still holds
true<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.420> think<00:01:40.789> these<00:01:41.789> are<00:01:41.850> athletes<00:01:42.509> they<00:01:43.319> are

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
true I think these are athletes they are

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.499 
true I think these are athletes they are
competitors<00:01:44.009> they<00:01:44.789> want<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.270> prove

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
competitors they want to prove

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.649 
competitors they want to prove
themselves<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.530> be<00:01:46.679> the<00:01:46.710> best<00:01:47.039> and<00:01:47.880> therefore

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
themselves to be the best and therefore

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.510 
themselves to be the best and therefore
the<00:01:48.840> Lions<00:01:49.140> offers<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.710> opportunity<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.490> is

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the Lions offers that opportunity it is

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.980 
the Lions offers that opportunity it is
something<00:01:51.509> special

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
something special

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.289 
something special
there's<00:01:52.860> great<00:01:53.039> stresses<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.850> tensions

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
there's great stresses and tensions

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.169 
there's great stresses and tensions
attached<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:55.140> what<00:01:55.590> needs<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.009> be<00:01:56.220> done<00:01:56.369> in

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
attached to what needs to be done in

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:58.820 
attached to what needs to be done in
other<00:01:57.360> words<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.899> there's<00:01:58.349> a<00:01:58.470> prove

separate countries and here they are

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.330 
separate countries and here they are
they<00:02:03.509> now<00:02:03.720> need<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.080> prove<00:02:04.409> them<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:05.220> the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
best with the other three countries

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.919 
best with the other three countries
involved<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.819> that's<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> big<00:02:09.330> test<00:02:09.630> for<00:02:09.720> any

involved and that's the big test for any
competitor<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.679> think<00:02:11.120> perhaps<00:02:12.120> even<00:02:12.510> more

to go to the third Test to compete for
the<00:02:38.280> series<00:02:38.639> and<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.299> would<00:02:39.389> like<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.690> end<00:02:39.810> that

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
the series and I would like to end that

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.140 
the series and I would like to end that
to<00:02:40.049> happen<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.620> sense<00:02:40.980> I'm<00:02:41.609> very<00:02:41.970> very

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
to happen in that sense I'm very very

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.210 
to happen in that sense I'm very very
disappointed<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:42.840> we<00:02:43.019> have<00:02:43.500> managed<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.010> do

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.460 
disappointed that we have managed to do
that<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.639> I<00:02:44.970> think<00:02:45.030> probably<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:46.200> were<00:02:46.290> only

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470

about twenty seconds away I think at the

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:57.400 
about twenty seconds away I think at the

if<00:05:25.410> the<00:05:25.890> flame<00:05:26.220> of<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:27.210> Lions<00:05:27.600> dies<00:05:28.170> I<00:05:28.620> think

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
if the flame of the Lions dies I think

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.220
