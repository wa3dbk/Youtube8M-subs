Jacob's Ladder and stuff like that that
would<00:01:49.680> really<00:01:50.040> add<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> nice<00:01:50.369> texture<00:01:50.880> and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
would really add a nice texture and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.030 
would really add a nice texture and
color<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.420> your<00:01:51.540> pot<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.500> Terry<00:01:52.680> tell<00:01:52.920> me<00:01:52.950> a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
little bit about what type of soil you

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.139 
little bit about what type of soil you
might<00:01:54.899> use<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.530> shade<00:01:55.829> container<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.549> also

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
might use in a shade container and also

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.429 
might use in a shade container and also
I'd<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.479> know<00:01:57.570> about<00:01:57.689> watering<00:01:58.290> and

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
I'd like to know about watering and

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.560 
I'd like to know about watering and
fertilizer<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.729> key<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.210> use<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.329> very

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
fertilizer the key is to use a very

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.480 
fertilizer the key is to use a very
lightweight<00:02:00.869> potting<00:02:01.590> mix<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:02.070> your

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
lightweight potting mix in your

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.459 
lightweight potting mix in your
containers<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.299> as<00:02:03.659> far<00:02:03.810> as<00:02:03.930> watering<00:02:04.229> goes

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
containers and as far as watering goes

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.749 
containers and as far as watering goes
the<00:02:04.710> shade<00:02:04.920> plants<00:02:05.250> are<00:02:05.340> actually<00:02:05.490> pretty

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
the shade plants are actually pretty

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.160 
the shade plants are actually pretty
easy<00:02:06.030> because<00:02:06.270> they<00:02:06.509> require<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> little<00:02:07.020> bit

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
easy because they require a little bit

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.410 
easy because they require a little bit
less<00:02:07.409> water<00:02:07.740> since<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.819> Sun<00:02:09.030> isn't<00:02:09.300> hitting

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
less water since the Sun isn't hitting

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.219 
less water since the Sun isn't hitting
them<00:02:09.599> all<00:02:09.750> day

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
them all day

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.260 
them all day
as<00:02:10.289> far<00:02:10.709> as<00:02:10.739> fertilizing<00:02:11.400> goes<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.910> would

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
as far as fertilizing goes I would

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.350 
as far as fertilizing goes I would
recommend<00:02:12.660> using

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
recommend using

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.820 
recommend using
release<00:02:13.690> fertilizer<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.350> putting<00:02:14.740> that

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
release fertilizer and putting that

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.320 
release fertilizer and putting that
right<00:02:15.010> in<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.220> pot<00:02:15.400> right<00:02:15.610> when<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:15.820> plant<00:02:16.120> it

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
right in the pot right when you plant it

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.670 
right in the pot right when you plant it
and<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.930> will<00:02:17.020> carry<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.380> through<00:02:17.410> the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
and that will carry you through the

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.500 
and that will carry you through the
summer<00:02:17.950> but<00:02:18.520> I<00:02:18.580> would<00:02:18.730> also<00:02:18.910> recommend<00:02:19.090> using

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
summer but I would also recommend using

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.450 
summer but I would also recommend using
a<00:02:19.690> liquid<00:02:19.840> fertilizer<00:02:20.140> once<00:02:21.130> every<00:02:21.430> other

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
a liquid fertilizer once every other

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.310 
a liquid fertilizer once every other
week<00:02:21.640> also<00:02:22.270> throughout<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.750> summer

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
week also throughout the summer

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.370 
week also throughout the summer

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
the course of the year that's very

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.370 
the course of the year that's very
