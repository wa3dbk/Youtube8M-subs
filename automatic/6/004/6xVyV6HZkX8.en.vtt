00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
retelling at 43 pounds 98 so it's pretty

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.670

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
much 44 pounds I've used this subscribe

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.639 
much 44 pounds I've used this subscribe
and<00:00:40.920> save<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:42.030> get<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.510> extra<00:00:42.870> 5<00:00:43.079> percent<00:00:43.440> off

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.119 
and save to get the extra 5 percent off
but<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:45.270> still<00:00:45.600> works<00:00:45.899> out<00:00:46.170> per<00:00:46.379> kilo<00:00:46.800> price

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
but that still works out per kilo price

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.389 
but that still works out per kilo price

pound<00:00:50.610> 34<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.899> I've<00:00:52.260> tried<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.620> new<00:00:53.010> company<00:00:53.430> now

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.330 
pound 34 so I've tried a new company now
called<00:00:54.059> my<00:00:54.510> protein<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:56.010> see<00:00:56.160> there

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
called my protein and I can see there

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.139 
called my protein and I can see there
what<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> 5<00:00:56.940> kilogram<00:00:57.300> sack<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.969> protein<00:00:59.969> powder

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
what a 5 kilogram sack of protein powder

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.139 
what a 5 kilogram sack of protein powder
from<00:01:00.539> them<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.680> retail<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.730> think

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
from them and that retail that I think

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.520 
from them and that retail that I think
per<00:01:03.809> kilo

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.810

I<00:01:04.559> bought<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:06.270> 5<00:01:06.689> kilogram<00:01:07.470> sack<00:01:07.820> 57

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
I bought the the 5 kilogram sack 57

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.390 
I bought the the 5 kilogram sack 57
pounds<00:01:09.060> 19<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.140> per<00:01:10.979> kilo<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.610> works<00:01:11.909> out<00:01:12.270> as

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.969 

11<00:01:17.400> pound<00:01:17.670> 29<00:01:18.299> per<00:01:18.540> kilo<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> difference

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
11 pound 29 per kilo so the difference

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.539 
11 pound 29 per kilo so the difference
between<00:01:20.390> optimum<00:01:21.390> nutrition<00:01:21.540> per<00:01:22.170> kilo<00:01:22.560> cost

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
between optimum nutrition per kilo cost

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.030 
between optimum nutrition per kilo cost
is<00:01:23.900> 1934<00:01:24.900> 19<00:01:25.740> pounds<00:01:26.040> 34<00:01:26.580> per<00:01:26.790> kilo<00:01:27.150> versus<00:01:28.110> my

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
is 1934 19 pounds 34 per kilo versus my

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.499 
is 1934 19 pounds 34 per kilo versus my
proteins<00:01:29.689> opt<00:01:30.689> whey<00:01:31.560> protein<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.189> 11<00:01:32.640> pound<00:01:32.850> 29

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
proteins opt whey protein of 11 pound 29

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.510 
proteins opt whey protein of 11 pound 29
per<00:01:33.750> kilo<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.680> it's<00:01:34.860> quite<00:01:35.009> considerable

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
per kilo so it's quite considerable

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.190 
per kilo so it's quite considerable
saving<00:01:35.909> there<00:01:36.119> I've<00:01:37.110> looked<00:01:37.380> at<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.720> grams<00:01:39.720> of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
saving there I've looked at the grams of

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.719 
saving there I've looked at the grams of
protein<00:01:40.829> per<00:01:41.100> scoop<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.829> pretty<00:01:43.829> much<00:01:44.040> you're

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
protein per scoop and pretty much you're

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.830 
protein per scoop and pretty much you're
getting<00:01:44.930> very<00:01:45.930> much<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.229> same<00:01:46.470> protein<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:48.479> if

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
getting very much the same protein so if

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.060 
getting very much the same protein so if
you<00:01:48.960> normalize<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.799> down<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.130> 25<00:01:50.579> gram<00:01:52.070> scoop

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
you normalize it down to 25 gram scoop

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.880 
you normalize it down to 25 gram scoop
then<00:01:53.899> optimum<00:01:54.899> nutrition<00:01:55.079> gives<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.710> about

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
then optimum nutrition gives you about

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.319 
then optimum nutrition gives you about
19<00:01:56.430> point<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.820> 1<00:01:57.000> grams<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.420> protein<00:01:58.280> whereas

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
19 point to 1 grams of protein whereas

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.929 
19 point to 1 grams of protein whereas
the<00:02:00.329> my<00:02:00.479> protein<00:02:00.930> gives<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.290> about<00:02:01.890> 20<00:02:02.700> point

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
the my protein gives you about 20 point

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.749 
the my protein gives you about 20 point
five<00:02:03.240> grams<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.719> protein<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.430> there's<00:02:05.430> this

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
five grams of protein so there's this

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.639 
five grams of protein so there's this
very<00:02:05.820> there's<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.079> marginal<00:02:07.500> difference

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
very there's in a marginal difference

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.279 
very there's in a marginal difference
there<00:02:08.300> if<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.390> look<00:02:09.539> at<00:02:09.629> their<00:02:09.780> price<00:02:10.050> per

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
there if you look at their price per

there if you look at their price per
