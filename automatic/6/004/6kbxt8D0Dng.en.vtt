that<00:04:18.830> I<00:04:18.859> would<00:04:18.979> say<00:04:19.280> is<00:04:19.489> the

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
that I would say is the

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.760 
that I would say is the
downside<00:04:20.360> that<00:04:20.600> you<00:04:20.780> can<00:04:20.930> only<00:04:21.110> have<00:04:21.380> eight<00:04:21.620> of

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
downside that you can only have eight of

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.230 
downside that you can only have eight of
them<00:04:21.890> I<00:04:22.040> wish<00:04:22.220> if<00:04:22.400> you<00:04:22.430> had<00:04:22.670> more<00:04:22.910> they<00:04:23.120> would

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
them I wish if you had more they would

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.240 
them I wish if you had more they would
follow<00:04:23.450> you<00:04:23.720> around<00:04:23.810> in<00:04:24.110> vehicles<00:04:24.560> but<00:04:25.070> maybe

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
follow you around in vehicles but maybe

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.130 
follow you around in vehicles but maybe
that<00:04:25.490> can<00:04:25.700> come<00:04:25.850> with<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.030> later<00:04:26.300> update<00:04:26.480> for
