00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:09.639
 good morning, I have all prepared 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.920
 a pie that is not even Galician 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:15.050
 Argentina in nothing is empanada that I have 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.620
 invented I think I invented 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:21.640
 and it's very easy, I'm going to teach you 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.640
 they can be the ingredients 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.449
 this is only it's ingredient will not be 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:31.950
 missing minced meat onion and pepper is 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:34.560
 a whole onion and a red pepper 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.380
 some mushrooms that are there the 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.380
 mushroom is already cooked soy sauce 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.380
 sauce 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.620
 of oysters or option as you like 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.290
 call and puff pastry and also 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.900
 it is paved an egg to paint we go 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.180
 the egg yolk to paint the pie 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.100
 you could also throw boiled egg 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.450
 but I 'm not going to throw him out because only 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.450
 I'm going to make it meat 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.989
 Well, the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.140
 saute some onions with 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.140
 pepper 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.490
 and it does not pay much for oil of 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.910
 olive to give it more flavor and flavor 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.910
 richer 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.590
 now since I've posed a little bit that I do not 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.540
 I cut it completely because it is not 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.030
 because I'm going to throw the meat and that's how 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.040
 combine with the flavors of meat 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.840
 then we throw the minced meat this 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.939
 mince 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.649
 the you can miss what you want me to 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.229
 I have done mixed is to say that the fact 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.450
 have there to have the amount there 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.100
 right now it 's a quarter of a kilo 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.100
 so you can have an idea 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.299
 so now what we will do is leave it 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.990
 that is going to cook a little and now 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.990
 I have been showing you 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.700
 Now, as you can see, I do not let it cook 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.320
 and indeed all the mushrooms you 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.580
 we will give a couple of laps because as 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.380
 this is going to go to the oven 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.810
 it will not be necessary it is that 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.270
 not here too long because it's going to 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.270
 keep cooking then what we do 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.640
 is this promotion and now we are going to 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.140
 a little bit of black pepper because of 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.690
 you do not have to throw salt because as I have 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.460
 said this has soy sauce the sauce 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.860
 of soybeans already comes with salt the sauce 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.180
 oysters also has a little salt 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.040
 of cumin 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.430
 these are the spices the spices are 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.980
 black pepper sensible cumin and oregano 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.210
 to like me for example the fact 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.330
 because I like 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:45.830
 and that amount how much to pinch 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.420
 col we are we remove it a little bit 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.310
 as I told you the empanadas you can 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.350
 do in many ways for which 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.210
 they have their ways then now what 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.210
 I'm going to do is throw in the soy sauce 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.110
 this would be a lot of quarrel 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.440
 of soy sauce 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.180
 I'm going to give it up 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.620
 of oyster sauce 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.620
 for harder than me 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.730
 then GarcÃ­a is not like a spoonful 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.730
 the money 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.959
 it would be what man a little 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.110
 now we throw a little oregano 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.290
 this will make it take a better smell yet 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.810
 is that it smells like you do not see 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.020
 here if you want we can take a table 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.870
 finite bacon with bacon gives you a good 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.290
 Cillo flavor now we have the filling 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.700
 now I show you how the pie is made 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.300
 Now what we are going to do is fill in 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.300
 the pie 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.780
 a simple I let some juice fall 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.780
 because it is what gives all the flavor 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.830
 then spreading well towards the 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.250
 edges because this part where we go 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.250
 to close 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.600
 is very hot right now that what 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.350
 It had to be very cold a little but 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.240
 well nothing happens we'll leave it like that 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.870
 and so you see wrong people cool 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.640
 a little bit and I teach it now with the 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.310
 help from the paper already throws the stuffing 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.740
 what we do is close you'll use the 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.569
 paper because if you can not go 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.970
 I leave the same paper help what 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:44.009
 we close so I always say that the 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:48.379
 paper is very good 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.379
 and nothing that we put for a side like that 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.610
 here the same thing what we do is 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.389
 this is what I eat 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.389
 a tsunami 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:07.700
 the truth that is very rich 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.740
 and now this folded it here like this 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.249
 we remove our facts that have 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.079
 could have stayed and now we want 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:18.609
 Well, I'm going to take a little bit like that 

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:20.319
 form and I will paint it and paint it with yolk 

00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:21.759
 of egg beaten now the Swedish but what 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:25.269
 I have a shake and I have to beat it 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:28.269
 bud is now worth as you see with the yolk of 

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:31.539
 egg that has been beaten all this is painted 

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:34.060
 so that they also brown and help 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:36.150
 that is more pronounced above 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.060
 then as you can see this is very easy 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.800
 we see like this 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:45.599
 That 's right 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.599
 and he's very rich I wanted to taste the meat 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.980
 I believed 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:53.620
 what 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.320
 that could be a different flavor 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.250
 but it's not very very good because 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.250
 as I said is an invention 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.620
 but the invention always has to 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.540
 do it with insurance we are not going to 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.090
 sure the oyster sauce and the sauce 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:13.380
 Soya sticks very well with meat so 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.380
 It is an invention to be sure 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.910
 and we put it to 180 to what I have 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.689
 there to warm up to see if it can 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:27.959
 show because as I said 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:30.739
 from here with the tripod so I'm going to 

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:30.739
 put it there 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.990
 the camera if it looks good and does not open the 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.990
 door 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.200
 and nothing 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.200
 to leave it 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.370
 as you see the paper I do not receive it for 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.010
 nothing the paper I use it for everything 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.090
 I put it halfway up because this is not 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.419
 it heats it more on top than on 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.419
 under 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.390
 and I'll show you as soon as it's done 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:08.580
 here as you can see and even the most 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:10.840
 meat pie and now what I'm going to 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.770
 do is cut it 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.860
 for you to see 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:19.370
 You see with your plump I do not know if you see 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:23.020
 you'll see that it goes up a bit there and this 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.020
 It is very rich very rich 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:31.629
 and nothing that you already know that subscribe 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.580
 that soon we will be the 10,000 good 

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:36.580
 we go for three thousand and one but already 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.689
 we will be soon and share the video this 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.849
 it's very good very good 

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:44.449
 Also, I'm going to try a bit 

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:46.860
 right now we retired we tried before 

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:49.439
 I tasted the meat that was left over 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:52.050
 and I did not think it would be so so 

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:54.729
 as good as what I was 

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:56.590
 too good 

00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:59.310
 talking 

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.310
 I have a
