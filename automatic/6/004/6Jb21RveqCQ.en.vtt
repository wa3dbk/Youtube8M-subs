00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
you hit storage all devices and if you

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.660 
you hit storage all devices and if you
look<00:01:03.140> in<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:03.379> games<00:01:03.590> and<00:01:03.770> apps<00:01:03.950> so<00:01:04.369> for

look in the games and apps so for
example<00:01:05.149> if<00:01:05.869> I<00:01:05.990> go<00:01:06.109> into<00:01:06.229> my<00:01:06.439> black<00:01:06.649> ops<00:01:06.770> 2<00:01:07.060> it

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
example if I go into my black ops 2 it

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.109 
example if I go into my black ops 2 it
says<00:01:08.299> unknown<00:01:08.539> profile<00:01:09.229> there<00:01:09.530> and<00:01:09.859> on<00:01:10.850> some

says unknown profile there and on some

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.539 
says unknown profile there and on some

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
other stuff it's as like FIFA says

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.919 
other stuff it's as like FIFA says
corrupted<00:01:14.450> profile<00:01:14.929> or<00:01:15.170> non<00:01:15.859> profile<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:16.929> so

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:17.929 
corrupted profile or non profile and so

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:19.749

got to the point they're just ways to
stop<00:02:05.299> trimming<00:02:05.659> then<00:02:05.810> every<00:02:06.469> time<00:02:06.619> I<00:02:06.649> tried<00:02:06.859> to

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
stop trimming then every time I tried to

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.440 
stop trimming then every time I tried to
do<00:02:07.009> it<00:02:07.069> last<00:02:07.219> time<00:02:07.310> when<00:02:07.669> I<00:02:08.119> realized

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
do it last time when I realized

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.609 
do it last time when I realized
performance<00:02:08.960> on<00:02:09.050> there<00:02:09.200> in<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.290> first<00:02:09.500> place

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
performance on there in the first place

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.950 
performance on there in the first place
and<00:02:10.009> it<00:02:10.130> wouldn't<00:02:10.369> download<00:02:10.850> it<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:11.510> that's

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
and it wouldn't download it so that's

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.420 
and it wouldn't download it so that's
