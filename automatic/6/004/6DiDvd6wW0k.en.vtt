00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
the etch mark when we've done this and

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.889 
the etch mark when we've done this and
the<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.770> glass<00:01:30.040> run<00:01:30.430> eh<00:01:30.580> mark<00:01:30.909> is<00:01:31.119> very<00:01:31.630> hot

I'm going to plunge it into the can of
cold<00:01:36.910> water<00:01:37.149> and<00:01:37.660> this<00:01:38.530> thermal<00:01:39.070> shock<00:01:39.310> is

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
cold water and this thermal shock is

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.050 
cold water and this thermal shock is
going<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:40.090> make<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.560> glass<00:01:42.600> separate<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:44.920> a

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
going to make the glass separate with a

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.969 
going to make the glass separate with a
very<00:01:46.060> smooth<00:01:46.420> edge<00:01:46.659> I<00:01:49.320> just<00:01:50.320> need<00:01:50.679> to<00:01:50.710> keep
