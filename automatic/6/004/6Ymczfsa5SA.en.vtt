any pics off for my zerglings oh my gosh
I<00:04:26.210> didn't<00:04:26.510> see<00:04:26.720> that<00:04:26.750> he's<00:04:27.440> moving<00:04:27.770> out<00:04:27.830> with

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
I didn't see that he's moving out with

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.680 
I didn't see that he's moving out with
this<00:04:28.070> these<00:04:28.430> Marines<00:04:28.730> and<00:04:28.940> I<00:04:29.210> don't<00:04:29.420> have

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
this these Marines and I don't have

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.500 
this these Marines and I don't have
really<00:04:30.110> anything<00:04:30.620> there's<00:04:31.520> two<00:04:31.760> roaches<00:04:32.000> am<00:04:32.420> I

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
really anything there's two roaches am I

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.850 
really anything there's two roaches am I
getting<00:04:32.750> more<00:04:33.020> roaches<00:04:33.230> yeah<00:04:33.590> it<00:04:33.650> looks<00:04:33.800> like

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
getting more roaches yeah it looks like

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.100 
getting more roaches yeah it looks like
these<00:04:34.100> are<00:04:34.280> roaches<00:04:34.520> so<00:04:34.970> good<00:04:35.780> thing<00:04:35.960> about

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
these are roaches so good thing about

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.290 
these are roaches so good thing about
catching<00:04:36.740> this<00:04:36.830> early<00:04:37.250> is<00:04:37.430> that<00:04:37.610> I<00:04:37.640> can<00:04:38.000> react

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
catching this early is that I can react

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.910 
catching this early is that I can react
to<00:04:38.330> that<00:04:38.570> by<00:04:38.750> training<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.260> boatload<00:04:39.680> of

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
to that by training a boatload of

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.920 
to that by training a boatload of
roaches<00:04:40.400> so<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.120> roaches<00:04:41.390> are<00:04:41.510> coming<00:04:41.780> out

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
roaches so the roaches are coming out

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.330 
roaches so the roaches are coming out
and<00:04:42.200> they're<00:04:42.350> gonna<00:04:42.560> be<00:04:42.770> ready<00:04:43.010> for<00:04:43.250> this

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
and they're gonna be ready for this

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.210 
and they're gonna be ready for this
marine<00:04:43.730> push<00:04:44.260> I've<00:04:45.260> got<00:04:45.500> a<00:04:45.530> good<00:04:45.920> number<00:04:46.100> of

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
marine push I've got a good number of

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.710 
marine push I've got a good number of
them<00:04:46.310> to<00:04:46.550> try<00:04:46.730> to<00:04:46.790> deal<00:04:47.120> with<00:04:47.270> this<00:04:47.390> if<00:04:47.570> he's

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
them to try to deal with this if he's

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.330 
them to try to deal with this if he's
able<00:04:47.900> to<00:04:48.050> focus<00:04:48.230> my<00:04:48.530> roaches<00:04:48.710> down<00:04:49.040> it<00:04:49.160> might

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
able to focus my roaches down it might

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.270 
able to focus my roaches down it might
not<00:04:49.550> win<00:04:49.730> this<00:04:49.850> battle<00:04:50.230> pretty<00:04:51.230> close<00:04:51.830> then

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
not win this battle pretty close then

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.340 
not win this battle pretty close then
not<00:04:52.580> too<00:04:52.820> close<00:04:53.090> he<00:04:53.360> as<00:04:53.570> he<00:04:53.690> loses<00:04:53.990> his<00:04:54.110> first

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
not too close he as he loses his first

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.140 
not too close he as he loses his first
couple<00:04:54.530> of<00:04:54.620> Marines<00:04:54.770> his<00:04:54.980> dps<00:04:55.310> suffers<00:04:55.790> a<00:04:55.820> lot

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
couple of Marines his dps suffers a lot

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.630 
couple of Marines his dps suffers a lot
so<00:04:56.390> it's<00:04:56.540> not<00:04:56.660> quite<00:04:56.930> able<00:04:57.200> to<00:04:57.380> finish<00:04:58.370> this

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
so it's not quite able to finish this

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.530 
so it's not quite able to finish this
off<00:04:58.940> I<00:04:59.450> think<00:05:00.050> he<00:05:00.200> might<00:05:00.380> have<00:05:00.410> got<00:05:00.950> his

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
off I think he might have got his

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.810 
off I think he might have got his
resource<00:05:02.540> value<00:05:02.930> like<00:05:03.170> cost<00:05:04.040> efficiency<00:05:04.790> out

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
resource value like cost efficiency out

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.840 
resource value like cost efficiency out
of<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.180> way<00:05:05.360> let's<00:05:05.660> see<00:05:06.380> units<00:05:06.770> lost<00:05:07.040> uh<00:05:07.460> he's

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
of the way let's see units lost uh he's

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.090 
of the way let's see units lost uh he's
actually<00:05:08.030> lost<00:05:08.360> more<00:05:08.990> money<00:05:09.200> than<00:05:09.500> I<00:05:09.680> have<00:05:09.890> so

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
actually lost more money than I have so

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.620 
actually lost more money than I have so
I<00:05:10.130> guess<00:05:10.430> I<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.910> roaches<00:05:11.240> were<00:05:11.390> cost

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
I guess I the roaches were cost

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.420 
I guess I the roaches were cost
effective<00:05:12.080> against<00:05:12.410> those<00:05:12.590> Marines<00:05:12.920> they're

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
effective against those Marines they're

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.550 
effective against those Marines they're
pretty<00:05:13.580> strong<00:05:13.880> against<00:05:14.240> them<00:05:14.390> but<00:05:15.200> he<00:05:15.440> has

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
pretty strong against them but he has

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.320 
pretty strong against them but he has
transitioned<00:05:16.040> to<00:05:16.310> techlabs<00:05:16.820> to<00:05:17.150> get

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
transitioned to techlabs to get

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.120 
transitioned to techlabs to get
Marauders<00:05:17.930> these<00:05:18.230> roaches<00:05:18.470> will<00:05:18.830> not<00:05:18.980> do

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
Marauders these roaches will not do

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.860 
Marauders these roaches will not do

like<00:05:25.670> he<00:05:25.850> wasn't<00:05:26.030> blocked<00:05:26.360> but<00:05:26.540> he's<00:05:26.660> set<00:05:26.960> up<00:05:27.050> a

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.170 
like he wasn't blocked but he's set up a

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
to push on me with this force with just

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699 
this tiny number of roaches before I'm

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349 
able to get any medalists it could be

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:22.170 
able to get any medalists it could be
bad<00:06:20.560> for<00:06:20.860> me<00:06:20.889> so<00:06:21.190> we'll<00:06:21.340> see<00:06:21.490> if<00:06:21.520> he<00:06:21.759> did<00:06:21.940> if<00:06:22.150> he

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
bad for me so we'll see if he did if he

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.180 
bad for me so we'll see if he did if he
does<00:06:22.509> push<00:06:22.840> or<00:06:23.050> not<00:06:23.199> there<00:06:23.680> we<00:06:23.830> go<00:06:23.919> that's<00:06:24.129> the

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
does push or not there we go that's the

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.100 
does push or not there we go that's the
saturation<00:06:24.759> I<00:06:24.849> like<00:06:25.030> to<00:06:25.180> see<00:06:25.360> so

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
saturation I like to see so

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.749 
saturation I like to see so
