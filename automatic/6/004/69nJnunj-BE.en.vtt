I'm<00:00:16.010> running<00:00:16.160> the<00:00:16.309> goldfields<00:00:16.850> as<00:00:16.970> you<00:00:17.090> can

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
I'm running the goldfields as you can

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.359 
I'm running the goldfields as you can
see<00:00:17.390> the<00:00:18.230> reason<00:00:18.380> being<00:00:18.710> that<00:00:18.859> it's<00:00:19.039> the<00:00:19.130> wet

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
see the reason being that it's the wet

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.160 
see the reason being that it's the wet
season<00:00:19.580> in<00:00:19.789> North<00:00:19.939> Queensland<00:00:20.390> and<00:00:20.630> there's

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
season in North Queensland and there's

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.570 
season in North Queensland and there's
no<00:00:21.260> access<00:00:21.650> to<00:00:21.680> the<00:00:21.830> goldfields<00:00:22.189> up<00:00:22.400> there

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
no access to the goldfields up there

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.130 
no access to the goldfields up there
they're<00:00:22.760> pretty<00:00:23.240> much<00:00:23.420> the<00:00:23.480> streams<00:00:23.900> are<00:00:24.019> all

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
they're pretty much the streams are all

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.169 
they're pretty much the streams are all
up<00:00:24.289> and<00:00:24.410> the<00:00:24.500> tracks<00:00:24.710> are<00:00:24.830> closed<00:00:25.010> so<00:00:25.279> those

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:26.179 
up and the tracks are closed so those

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:27.910 
up and the tracks are closed so those

vehicle<00:00:35.120> preice<00:00:35.360> you<00:00:36.260> don't<00:00:36.440> learn<00:00:36.620> anything

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
vehicle preice you don't learn anything

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.680 
vehicle preice you don't learn anything
here<00:00:37.070> but<00:00:37.340> if<00:00:37.640> this<00:00:37.790> is<00:00:37.940> your<00:00:38.060> first<00:00:38.270> detector

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
here but if this is your first detector

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.020 
here but if this is your first detector
and<00:00:38.810> a<00:00:38.870> lot<00:00:39.020> of<00:00:39.110> people<00:00:39.290> are<00:00:39.380> buying<00:00:39.620> them<00:00:39.800> as

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
and a lot of people are buying them as

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.750 
and a lot of people are buying them as
their<00:00:41.030> first<00:00:41.270> prospecting<00:00:41.780> detector<00:00:42.760> it's

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
their first prospecting detector it's

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.520 
their first prospecting detector it's
interesting<00:00:43.970> to<00:00:44.270> understand<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:45.200> way<00:00:45.350> that

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
interesting to understand the way that

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.110 
interesting to understand the way that
the<00:00:45.770> discrimination<00:00:46.340> works<00:00:46.670> on<00:00:46.850> a<00:00:46.880> pulse

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
the discrimination works on a pulse

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.720 
the discrimination works on a pulse
machine<00:00:47.510> it's<00:00:48.440> actually<00:00:48.770> a<00:00:48.800> when<00:00:49.610> you

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
machine it's actually a when you

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.610 
machine it's actually a when you
discriminate<00:00:50.570> on<00:00:50.690> this<00:00:50.840> machine<00:00:51.170> is<00:00:51.500> actually

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
discriminate on this machine is actually

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.750 
discriminate on this machine is actually
changing<00:00:52.220> the<00:00:52.310> pulse

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
changing the pulse

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.790 
changing the pulse
July<00:00:53.090> that's<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:53.990> time<00:00:54.200> that<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:54.500> machine

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
July that's the time that the machine

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.430 
July that's the time that the machine
reads<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.190> return<00:00:55.490> pulse<00:00:55.820> from<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.480> time

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
reads the return pulse from the time

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.360 
reads the return pulse from the time
when<00:00:58.040> it<00:00:58.130> detects<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:58.550> target<00:00:58.940> so<00:01:00.040> on<00:01:01.040> a<00:01:01.070> small

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
when it detects a target so on a small

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.460 
when it detects a target so on a small
low<00:01:01.970> conducting<00:01:02.450> target<00:01:02.780> such<00:01:02.900> a<00:01:02.990> small<00:01:03.230> goal

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
low conducting target such a small goal

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.040 
low conducting target such a small goal
the<00:01:03.770> pulse<00:01:04.010> will<00:01:04.280> decay<00:01:04.760> very<00:01:04.970> quickly<00:01:05.239> so<00:01:05.930> if

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
the pulse will decay very quickly so if

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.870 
the pulse will decay very quickly so if
you<00:01:06.170> put<00:01:06.320> in<00:01:06.410> a<00:01:06.440> little<00:01:06.530> bit<00:01:06.710> of

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
you put in a little bit of

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.790 
you put in a little bit of
discrimination<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.510> all<00:01:09.200> that<00:01:09.320> does<00:01:09.440> is<00:01:09.470> open

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
discrimination and all that does is open

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.250 
discrimination and all that does is open
the<00:01:09.890> time<00:01:10.070> gap<00:01:10.280> up<00:01:10.520> and<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:11.690> will<00:01:11.900> not<00:01:12.050> read

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
the time gap up and you will not read

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.160 
the time gap up and you will not read
they<00:01:12.950> quickly<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:13.940> decaying<00:01:14.240> target<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.140> it's

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
they quickly the decaying target so it's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.350 
they quickly the decaying target so it's
discriminated<00:01:15.890> out<00:01:15.980> basically<00:01:16.460> you<00:01:17.060> know<00:01:17.120> a

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
discriminated out basically you know a

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.960 
discriminated out basically you know a
piece<00:01:18.320> of<00:01:18.470> silver<00:01:18.710> for<00:01:18.950> example<00:01:19.340> a<00:01:19.430> large<00:01:19.610> coin

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
piece of silver for example a large coin

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.910 
piece of silver for example a large coin
at<00:01:20.180> Florin<00:01:20.780> or<00:01:20.900> a<00:01:20.990> shilling<00:01:21.290> or<00:01:21.380> anything<00:01:21.710> like

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
at Florin or a shilling or anything like

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.780 
at Florin or a shilling or anything like
that<00:01:22.930> will<00:01:23.930> not<00:01:24.350> decay<00:01:24.650> quickly<00:01:24.830> at<00:01:25.130> all<00:01:25.250> so

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
that will not decay quickly at all so

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.680 
that will not decay quickly at all so
you<00:01:25.850> can<00:01:26.030> put<00:01:26.180> in<00:01:26.270> quite<00:01:26.420> a<00:01:26.480> bit<00:01:26.660> of

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
you can put in quite a bit of

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.780 
you can put in quite a bit of
discrimination<00:01:27.470> in<00:01:28.130> other<00:01:28.250> words<00:01:28.460> increase

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
discrimination in other words increase

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.390 
discrimination in other words increase
the<00:01:28.970> delay<00:01:29.659> time<00:01:29.900> on<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.200> pulse<00:01:30.440> reading<00:01:31.040> and

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
the delay time on the pulse reading and

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.850 
the delay time on the pulse reading and
you<00:01:31.970> will<00:01:32.090> still<00:01:32.240> click<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.510> target<00:01:32.870> up<00:01:32.960> so

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
you will still click the target up so

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.560 
you will still click the target up so
we're<00:01:34.100> going<00:01:34.280> to<00:01:34.370> do<00:01:34.460> now<00:01:34.610> is<00:01:34.760> just<00:01:34.940> just<00:01:35.390> just

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
we're going to do now is just just just

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.740 
we're going to do now is just just just
demonstrate<00:01:36.320> how<00:01:36.440> that<00:01:36.620> works<00:01:36.860> on<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:38.090> couple

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
demonstrate how that works on a couple

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.390 
demonstrate how that works on a couple
of<00:01:38.810> gold<00:01:38.990> nuggets<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.620> an<00:01:39.770> Australian<00:01:40.220> three

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
of gold nuggets and an Australian three

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.820 
of gold nuggets and an Australian three
pence<00:01:40.550> coin<00:01:40.760> because<00:01:41.240> I<00:01:41.810> know<00:01:42.470> a<00:01:42.500> lot<00:01:42.650> of<00:01:42.680> you

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
pence coin because I know a lot of you

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.230 
pence coin because I know a lot of you
blokes<00:01:43.040> use<00:01:43.250> these<00:01:43.430> things<00:01:43.610> on<00:01:43.729> beaches<00:01:44.090> will

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
blokes use these things on beaches will

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.120 
blokes use these things on beaches will
really<00:01:44.780> come<00:01:44.930> up<00:01:44.990> with<00:01:45.020> them<00:01:45.200> anyway<00:01:45.470> you

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
really come up with them anyway you

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.370 
really come up with them anyway you
might<00:01:46.550> be<00:01:46.670> detecting<00:01:47.229> prospecting<00:01:48.229> and

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
might be detecting prospecting and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.899 
might be detecting prospecting and
stumble<00:01:48.979> in<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.070> old<00:01:49.280> timers<00:01:49.580> camp<00:01:49.790> and

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
stumble in the old timers camp and

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.700 
stumble in the old timers camp and
you'll<00:01:50.000> do<00:01:50.240> a<00:01:50.300> bit<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:50.450> relic<00:01:50.720> honey<00:01:50.870> here<00:01:51.440> this

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
some consistency across the targets and

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.360 
some consistency across the targets and

you<00:03:50.190> know<00:03:50.250> it's<00:03:50.370> playing<00:03:50.550> signal<00:03:50.879> no<00:03:51.000> problems

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:58.399 
you know it's playing signal no problems
you<00:03:52.170> got<00:03:52.319> a<00:03:52.349> 2.4<00:03:52.920> Grammy<00:03:53.129> in<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.310> middle<00:03:53.549> here

on<00:03:59.409> the<00:03:59.530> right<00:03:59.709> we've<00:04:00.099> got<00:04:00.219> the<00:04:03.780> sterling

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
on the right we've got the sterling

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.059 
on the right we've got the sterling
silver<00:04:04.810> straying<00:04:05.560> triplets<00:04:06.159> notice<00:04:07.090> that's<00:04:07.269> a

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
silver straying triplets notice that's a

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.199 
silver straying triplets notice that's a
low<00:04:09.069> high<00:04:09.280> time<00:04:09.609> because<00:04:09.909> it's<00:04:10.030> a<00:04:10.090> high

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
low high time because it's a high

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.360 
low high time because it's a high
conductive<00:04:10.659> target<00:04:11.019> being<00:04:11.170> silver<00:04:11.590> now<00:04:12.219> what

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
conductive target being silver now what

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.520 
conductive target being silver now what
I'll<00:04:12.489> do<00:04:12.609> I'll<00:04:12.730> just<00:04:12.810> with<00:04:13.810> us<00:04:13.840> darling<00:04:14.230> a<00:04:14.409> bit

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
I'll do I'll just with us darling a bit

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.650 
I'll do I'll just with us darling a bit
of<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.680> discrimination<00:04:15.359> so<00:04:16.359> it's<00:04:16.479> just<00:04:16.539> a

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
of the discrimination so it's just a

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.590 
of the discrimination so it's just a
shift<00:04:16.900> function<00:04:17.910> I'll<00:04:18.910> put<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.150> up<00:04:19.239> on<00:04:19.359> six

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
shift function I'll put it up on six

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.300 
shift function I'll put it up on six
it's<00:04:19.780> a<00:04:19.870> fairly<00:04:20.049> high<00:04:20.259> bit<00:04:20.590> of<00:04:20.709> discrimination

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
it's a fairly high bit of discrimination

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.400 
it's a fairly high bit of discrimination
but<00:04:21.430> you<00:04:21.850> might<00:04:22.030> need<00:04:22.180> did<00:04:22.810> you<00:04:22.930> use<00:04:23.080> it<00:04:23.259> on<00:04:23.289> a

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
but you might need did you use it on a

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.129 
but you might need did you use it on a
salt<00:04:23.680> beach<00:04:23.970> well<00:04:24.970> you<00:04:25.090> might<00:04:25.240> need<00:04:25.389> in<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:25.900> salt

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
salt beach well you might need in a salt

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.650 
salt beach well you might need in a salt
lake<00:04:26.350> in<00:04:26.530> WY<00:04:26.979> I<00:04:27.220> have<00:04:27.729> to<00:04:27.910> take<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.210> salt<00:04:28.419> lakes

let's see what difference that makes
with<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.560> five<00:04:41.830> or<00:04:41.860> six<00:04:42.160> discrim<00:04:42.580> hit<00:04:43.360> roughly

the same heart on the same three targets
okay<00:04:46.810> that's<00:04:47.169> the<00:04:47.259> two<00:04:47.440> at<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.590> fault<00:04:47.830> grammar

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
okay that's the two at the fault grammar

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.600 
okay that's the two at the fault grammar
definitely<00:04:49.599> a<00:04:49.630> faint<00:04:49.840> a<00:04:49.930> signal<00:04:50.370> as<00:04:51.370> you<00:04:51.400> can

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
definitely a faint a signal as you can

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.469 
definitely a faint a signal as you can

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
see you've in effect what you've done

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.990 
see you've in effect what you've done
there<00:04:55.630> is<00:04:55.690> lost<00:04:55.900> dip<00:04:56.139> because<00:04:57.130> you<00:04:57.699> will<00:04:57.849> only

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
there is lost dip because you will only

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.240 
there is lost dip because you will only
get<00:04:58.180> that<00:04:58.389> target<00:04:59.520> at<00:05:00.520> that<00:05:00.580> signal<00:05:01.300> strength

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
get that target at that signal strength

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.370 
get that target at that signal strength
at<00:05:03.250> a<00:05:03.310> much<00:05:03.520> shallower<00:05:03.789> depth<00:05:04.120> at<00:05:04.900> a<00:05:04.990> two<00:05:05.169> point

four in the middle silly you dig it -
it's<00:05:11.530> two<00:05:11.740> ways<00:05:11.949> but<00:05:12.130> it's<00:05:12.280> a<00:05:12.310> much<00:05:12.460> plant<00:05:12.729> a

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
it's two ways but it's a much plant a

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.790 
it's two ways but it's a much plant a
signal<00:05:13.150> with<00:05:13.750> that<00:05:13.870> discrimination<00:05:14.470> -<00:05:14.560> again

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
signal with that discrimination - again

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.300
