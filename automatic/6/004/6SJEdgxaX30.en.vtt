through<00:00:32.309> world<00:00:32.610> markets<00:00:34.160> yeah<00:00:35.239> piracy<00:00:36.239> has<00:00:36.450> a

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
through world markets yeah piracy has a

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.540 
through world markets yeah piracy has a
increased<00:00:37.710> throughout<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.129> Gulf<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.399> Aden

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
increased throughout the Gulf of Aden

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.270 
increased throughout the Gulf of Aden
and<00:00:39.050> Gulf<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.140> Aden<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.410> one<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.710> our<00:00:41.040> major

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
and Gulf of Aden is one of our major

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.270 
and Gulf of Aden is one of our major
hubs<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:41.960> for<00:00:42.960> transnational<00:00:43.530> shipping

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
hubs for for transnational shipping

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.750 
hubs for for transnational shipping
going<00:00:44.879> through<00:00:45.180> enroute<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> Suez<00:00:46.500> Canal

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
going through enroute to the Suez Canal

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.490 
going through enroute to the Suez Canal
so<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.440> piracy<00:00:49.440> has<00:00:50.030> a<00:00:51.030> distinct<00:00:51.719> impact<00:00:52.110> on

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
so the piracy has a distinct impact on
