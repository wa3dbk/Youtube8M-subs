bias<00:00:18.150> ply<00:00:18.539> tires<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.619> feel<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> tire<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:20.820> just

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
bias ply tires I feel the tire just just

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.420 
bias ply tires I feel the tire just just
does<00:00:21.240> not<00:00:21.510> stay<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.500> road<00:00:22.769> as<00:00:23.039> well<00:00:23.070> as<00:00:23.310> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
does not stay on the road as well as a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.560 
does not stay on the road as well as a
radial<00:00:23.880> tire<00:00:24.439> you<00:00:25.439> can<00:00:25.680> get<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.220> 165<00:00:26.880> r15

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
radial tire you can get the 165 r15

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.390 
radial tire you can get the 165 r15
tires<00:00:27.869> which<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> pre<00:00:28.800> standard<00:00:29.220> for<00:00:29.369> a

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
tires which is a pre standard for a

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.870 
tires which is a pre standard for a
Volkswagen<00:00:30.000> which<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.240> like<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.539> put<00:00:30.720> on<00:00:31.880> they

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
Volkswagen which I like to put on they

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.360 
Volkswagen which I like to put on they
grip<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> road<00:00:33.360> very<00:00:33.600> well<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.680> find<00:00:35.280> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
grip the road very well and I find the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.240 
grip the road very well and I find the
handling<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.820> good<00:00:36.649> but<00:00:37.649> some<00:00:37.800> people<00:00:38.010> ask<00:00:38.160> me

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
handling is good but some people ask me

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.280 
handling is good but some people ask me
about<00:00:38.309> tire<00:00:38.640> pressure<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.300> if<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.050> look<00:00:40.170> in

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
about tire pressure and if you look in

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.930 
about tire pressure and if you look in
the<00:00:40.350> old<00:00:40.500> Volkswagen<00:00:40.710> manuals<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.550> came<00:00:41.760> with

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.410 
max load and that they're also talking
about<00:01:01.829> factoring<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.520> cars<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.850> maybe<00:01:03.120> weigh

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
more maybe less yeah you know give or

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.440 
more maybe less yeah you know give or
take<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:08.520> gotta<00:01:08.670> remember<00:01:08.790> Volkswagens

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
take you gotta remember Volkswagens

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.039 
take you gotta remember Volkswagens
weigh<00:01:09.630> under<00:01:09.840> 2,000<00:01:10.650> pounds<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:12.049> found

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
weigh under 2,000 pounds and I found

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.410 
weigh under 2,000 pounds and I found
that<00:01:13.200> if<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.350> blow<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.799> tire<00:01:13.979> up<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.490> lot<00:01:15.240> I

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
that if you blow the tire up a lot I

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.420 
that if you blow the tire up a lot I
felt<00:01:15.659> my<00:01:15.840> car<00:01:16.080> swaying<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.500> little<00:01:16.530> more<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.159> I

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
felt my car swaying a little more and I

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.679 
felt my car swaying a little more and I
felt<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> back<00:01:17.909> tire<00:01:18.119> sometimes<00:01:18.479> even

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
felt the back tire sometimes even

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.810 
felt the back tire sometimes even
bouncing<00:01:19.110> when<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.290> hit<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> bump<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> car

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
bouncing when you hit a bump in the car

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.899 
bouncing when you hit a bump in the car
hard<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.420> car<00:01:21.659> rides<00:01:22.170> hard<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.700> want

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
hard the car rides hard so if you want

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.450 
hard the car rides hard so if you want
the<00:01:24.240> tires<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.960> wear<00:01:24.990> correctly<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:26.430> a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the tires to wear correctly for a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.569 
the tires to wear correctly for a
Volkswagen<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.810> would<00:01:28.799> definitely<00:01:29.490> suggest

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
Volkswagen I would definitely suggest

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.580 
Volkswagen I would definitely suggest
listening<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> manual<00:01:30.930> if<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.290> want<00:01:31.500> to

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
listening to the manual if you want to

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.830 
listening to the manual if you want to
go<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> little<00:01:31.890> bit<00:01:32.070> more<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.280> maybe<00:01:32.700> go<00:01:33.030> twenty

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
go a little bit more I maybe go twenty

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.819 
go a little bit more I maybe go twenty
pounds<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.110> pressure<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.560> front<00:01:34.770> and

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
pounds of pressure in the front and

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.050 
pounds of pressure in the front and
twenty-five<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> back<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.880> kind<00:01:36.030> of

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
twenty-five in the back just to kind of

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.460 
twenty-five in the back just to kind of
balance<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.420> out<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.570> little<00:01:36.689> bit<00:01:36.869> better<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.229> I

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
balance it out a little bit better but I

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.800 
balance it out a little bit better but I
mean<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.729> amazing<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.119> know<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.360> sounds<00:01:39.630> low

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
mean it's amazing I know it sounds low

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.840 
mean it's amazing I know it sounds low
but<00:01:40.140> that's<00:01:40.650> what<00:01:40.890> Volkswagens<00:01:41.430> are<00:01:41.549> made<00:01:41.670> to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
but that's what Volkswagens are made to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.330 
but that's what Volkswagens are made to
have<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.180> their<00:01:42.360> tires<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.470> that's<00:01:44.130> another
