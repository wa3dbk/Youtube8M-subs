00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.540 
and I was paying more attention this
wouldn't<00:03:43.590> have<00:03:43.680> been<00:03:43.710> that<00:03:43.890> mutt<00:03:44.250> that

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
wouldn't have been that mutt that

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.280 
wouldn't have been that mutt that
exciting<00:03:45.060> but<00:03:45.240> because<00:03:45.570> I<00:03:45.600> wasn't<00:03:45.960> paying

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
exciting but because I wasn't paying

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.750 
exciting but because I wasn't paying
attention<00:03:46.470> i<00:03:46.800> didn't<00:03:47.070> have<00:03:47.160> my<00:03:47.190> headset<00:03:47.460> on

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
attention i didn't have my headset on

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.090 
attention i didn't have my headset on
and<00:03:47.790> i<00:03:48.180> become<00:03:48.750> relying<00:03:49.350> on<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.740> thing<00:03:49.920> with

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
and i become relying on that thing with

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.350 
and i become relying on that thing with
it<00:03:50.190> without<00:03:50.340> my<00:03:50.580> head<00:03:50.730> said<00:03:50.910> i<00:03:50.940> can't<00:03:51.240> play

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.910 
it without my head said i can't play
this<00:03:51.570> game<00:03:51.750> i<00:03:51.810> really<00:03:51.960> can't<00:03:52.410> because<00:03:52.740> it

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
this game i really can't because it

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.030 
this game i really can't because it
makes<00:03:53.160> such<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.400> difference<00:03:54.350> so<00:03:55.350> there's

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
makes such a difference so there's

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.590 
makes such a difference so there's
another<00:03:56.280> audio<00:03:56.700> part<00:03:56.940> coming<00:03:57.150> up<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:57.510> then
