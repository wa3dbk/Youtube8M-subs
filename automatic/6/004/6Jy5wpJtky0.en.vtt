00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
agree with that it was definitely the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.170 
agree with that it was definitely the
most<00:01:19.619> dramatic<00:01:20.159> moment<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.790> history<00:01:20.909> of

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
most dramatic moment in the history of

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.870 
most dramatic moment in the history of
the<00:01:21.330> show<00:01:21.590> all<00:01:22.590> right<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.100> then<00:01:23.280> they<00:01:23.549> tried

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
the show all right so then they tried

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.170 
the show all right so then they tried
out<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.119> cast<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.750> Mary<00:01:25.020> Poppins<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:26.180> think

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
out the cast of Mary Poppins I think

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.120 
out the cast of Mary Poppins I think
there<00:01:27.330> was<00:01:27.450> probably<00:01:27.509> some<00:01:28.020> extra<00:01:28.530> people<00:01:29.040> in

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
there was probably some extra people in

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.679 
there was probably some extra people in
there<00:01:29.340> because<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.700> really<00:01:30.150> don't<00:01:30.329> think<00:01:30.420> that

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
there because I really don't think that

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.530 
there because I really don't think that
all<00:01:31.200> those<00:01:31.380> people<00:01:31.740> were<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:31.890> Broadway<00:01:32.460> but

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
all those people were on Broadway but

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.440 
all those people were on Broadway but
maybe<00:01:33.540> they<00:01:33.720> were<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.920> they<00:01:35.070> performed<00:01:35.909> step

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
maybe they were so they performed step

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.340 
maybe they were so they performed step
in<00:01:36.630> time<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:37.710> was<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> tap<00:01:39.049> extravaganza<00:01:40.049> and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
in time it was a tap extravaganza and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.770 
in time it was a tap extravaganza and
the<00:01:40.710> flying<00:01:41.040> was<00:01:41.520> just<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.060> was<00:01:42.119> really<00:01:42.630> good

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the flying was just it was really good

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.179 
the flying was just it was really good
it<00:01:42.960> was<00:01:42.990> believable<00:01:43.530> um<00:01:45.140> but<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.619> lip<00:01:46.829> sync

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
it was believable um but the lip sync

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.840 
it was believable um but the lip sync
was<00:01:47.549> kind<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.000> lackluster<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:49.189> the<00:01:50.189> tap<00:01:50.460> sink

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
was kind of lackluster and the tap sink

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.510 
was kind of lackluster and the tap sink
well<00:01:51.240> they<00:01:51.360> tap<00:01:51.600> sinking<00:01:52.079> as<00:01:52.290> well<00:01:52.530> all<00:01:53.340> right

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
well they tap sinking as well all right

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.990
