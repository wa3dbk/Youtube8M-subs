will<00:00:36.000> cost<00:00:36.180> 159<00:00:37.140> dollar<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> little

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
will cost 159 dollar so it's a little

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.619

believe is 1.5 gigahertz dual-core some
interesting<00:01:11.700> features<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.360> has<00:01:12.390> dual

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
interesting features that it has dual

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.929 
interesting features that it has dual

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
speakers which they touted as being very

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.810 
speakers which they touted as being very
important<00:01:15.540> compared<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.320> say<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> ipad<00:01:17.460> which

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
important compared to say the ipad which

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.760 
important compared to say the ipad which
doesn't<00:01:18.330> have<00:01:18.450> dual<00:01:18.600> speakers<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.170> audio

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
doesn't have dual speakers and audio

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
Wi-Fi on the 2.4 gigahertz band as well

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.410 
Wi-Fi on the 2.4 gigahertz band as well
as<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.930> 5<00:01:28.140> gigahertz<00:01:28.439> band<00:01:29.180> basically<00:01:30.180> that

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
as the 5 gigahertz band basically that

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.789 
as the 5 gigahertz band basically that
means<00:01:30.450> there<00:01:30.750> are<00:01:30.840> two<00:01:31.020> antennas<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.619> there

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
means there are two antennas in there

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.460 
means there are two antennas in there
and<00:01:32.040> they<00:01:32.759> really<00:01:33.119> tried<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.600> bash<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.079> ipad

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
and they really tried to bash the ipad

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.499 
and they really tried to bash the ipad
in<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.710> lot<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.890> ways<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.490> they<00:01:35.820> say<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.119> y5

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
in a lot of ways and they say that y5

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.090 
in a lot of ways and they say that y5
performance<00:01:37.020> will<00:01:37.110> be<00:01:37.200> significantly<00:01:37.890> better

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
performance will be significantly better

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.160 
performance will be significantly better

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.289 
again MIMO meaning has two antennas and
therefore<00:01:45.840> better<00:01:46.020> performance<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:47.119> terms<00:01:48.119> of

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
therefore better performance in terms of

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.899 
therefore better performance in terms of
price<00:01:48.689> for<00:01:49.140> 16<00:01:49.770> gigabytes<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.340> Wi-Fi<00:01:50.880> only

price for 16 gigabytes of Wi-Fi only

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.940 
price for 16 gigabytes of Wi-Fi only
that'll<00:01:51.899> be<00:01:51.990> two<00:01:52.200> hundred<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.619> ninety-nine

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
that'll be two hundred and ninety-nine

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
also a model for 499 dollars that also

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.700 
also a model for 499 dollars that also
comes<00:02:05.490> with<00:02:05.610> 32<00:02:06.060> gigabytes<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.659> storage<00:02:07.110> but

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.800 
progress is now going to be stored in
the<00:05:47.530> cloud<00:05:47.680> so<00:05:48.130> it's<00:05:48.940> just<00:05:49.240> really<00:05:49.540> good

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
the cloud so it's just really good

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.600 
the cloud so it's just really good
especially<00:05:49.930> if<00:05:50.650> that<00:05:50.830> can<00:05:51.190> work<00:05:51.220> with

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
especially if that can work with

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.520 
especially if that can work with
different<00:05:51.790> devices<00:05:52.240> I<00:05:52.600> can<00:05:53.080> see<00:05:53.230> where<00:05:53.410> the

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
different devices I can see where the

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.770 
different devices I can see where the
future<00:05:53.890> would<00:05:54.100> be<00:05:54.280> when<00:05:54.700> maybe<00:05:55.360> they<00:05:55.570> have<00:05:55.750> a

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
future would be when maybe they have a

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.870
