00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.620
 8 Ne but I think that was at the time described the dj 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.410
 The idea of ​​the plan 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:58.019

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:04.080
 It is assembled I mean scissors you I lightly also review the inter-Gachotto 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:06.080
 I think it would be nice if the reviewer had a look at the person being reviewed 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.490
 Together 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.080
 I have not decided at all whether to paint or not 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.380
 Look at the state of hearing yeah 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:22.520
 It seems that it is already easy even if painted 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:25.490
 I use an airbrush, but I just want to finish it easily and finish it 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.240
 I think So is it is always as of the 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.590
 I can't help but look at the places where I speak the key 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.590
 Balazs Masuhoi 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:42.260

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.500
 A that so hit was completed 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.909
 I did 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.310
 There was a feeling of lightning coming out on the line with the Vader Fighters 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.340
 Is not a hero 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.110
 Say Takasaka and say 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.000
 It also Choice 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:21.690
 a child's short-term view of the world 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.470
 Also is produced in the base I face is a friend called rival was the entire a brief appearance was starting Spirituality 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.590
 Was 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.520
 Deformation of Kosaka say about that Kampa view body 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.640
 I 'm sorry I did n't get into the movie theater 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.430
 Zeta Te Dema cancer Tam Gundam 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.330
 Almost a full scratch say that it has remodeled 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.740
 It is in the Meiji period to say that it was made 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.740
 It is stabello of contest 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.150
 No place 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.150
 I think it's expensive 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.380
 Finally 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.910
 I 've been defeated like this and won six 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.010
 It is this problem to say 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.700
 Well 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.210
 follow that I will do any Who 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.819
 0 is 1st before Moon 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.440
 I have made it but 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.280
 It is a modification to the web riders say the 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.450
 There is no prejudice 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:19.470
 I do not have the ok function 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:22.370
 I think I heard being used in almost anything or various new mold in 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.610
 So it 's time of assembly 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.610
 now 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.810
 I feel Ya ne is the impression was strong Tteyuu latest Nechotto 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.990
 Then to 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.760
 So the characteristic of in Well that 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.500
 That of the web rider 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.500
 It's part of the wing there 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.750
 It has been changed significantly 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.490
 Gotta 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.100
 I think I and danced and 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.080
 7 was not there 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.300
 Data What 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.200
 The shape of the shield is different 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.200
 Arm brain death 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.970
 Meaning that the two You're are thicker 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.300
 of course 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.040
 The shape of the beam rifle is also different 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.040
 This under the seat 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.420
 Partial cancer of flower 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.350
 And then bring the shield part in front 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.220
 When deformed 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.160
 I think that the function is attached and I'm doing it for a while now 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.870
 Yes 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.870
 Here ぇ canon state 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.420
 Well first of all 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.139
 Removing part of the Do's Iida wing back 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.770
 One time house 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.569
 It is intense 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.569
 Repair positive 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.810
 Positive an auxiliary force 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.139
 Do you suffer from 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.139
 Think well 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.440
 It 's supposed to expand 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.129
 Transparent parts of couple 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.820
 Many books replenished 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:04.800
 It adapted for attachment 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.400
 That's your arms, right? 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.400
 Part of our house 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.650
 Fit in and fix 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:16.940
 It is on the back fine da 8 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.560
 Binder right now I have a qualification right now that I've got it 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.660
 there 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.110
 Cannon 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.110
 Of seal 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.169
 If it is a cannon system 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:34.160
 It seems to be 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:38.050
 I think that the image is pasted to the side 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.050
 That's all right 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.840
 What do impose the life of the result New 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.840
 I will do that 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.670
 It looks like this 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.249
 It's cool 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:58.289
 It became a form 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:58.289
 Stronger than Zeta Gundam 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:02.649
 Let's rotate a little 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
 Hmm 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.860
 I think so too 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.140
 I think I saw it from behind 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.969
 I think I saw from before 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:17.969
 now 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:23.160
 It allo outside 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:25.670
 I also though have increased me rotation of Celte 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.670
 Well a little 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.060
 It is absolutely expected to cool 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:42.830
 Tteyuu I hope that parentheses to samba 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:45.850
 I don't like to use it if I'm sorry 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.850
 This is that 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.160
 E had been thinking of buying 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:55.630
 It was also an order for a while 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:59.770
 I think it was good to make 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:02.940
 I think that the correlation between and will be a simple and I think 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:08.970
 It feels like a dj 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:10.360
 A remodeled island will not well enough to fill the hole in the house going to stand 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.120
 Oh dear 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:16.360
 Why Litchi is also Kanji 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.689
 Good hardness how to become a finish 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.769
 There is a car 

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:26.629
 It's on the way right now, I don't know if it's going to go a little further 

00:07:22.769 --> 00:07:26.629
 Tsu'm as much as possible completed as early Well 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.529
 Well this time 

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:32.330
 Because it seems like a debut that is not very good at 

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:35.060
 Yes, but 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:40.120
 A detailed review is that 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:42.030
