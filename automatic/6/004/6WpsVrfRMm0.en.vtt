such where we're not really with him and
we<00:02:25.870> don't<00:02:25.989> want<00:02:26.260> him<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.730> wander<00:02:27.730> off<00:02:27.850> and

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
we don't want him to wander off and

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.630 
we don't want him to wander off and
bothering<00:02:28.799> on<00:02:29.799> toward<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.100> road<00:02:30.310> which<00:02:30.519> I

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
bothering on toward the road which I

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.610 
bothering on toward the road which I
don't<00:02:30.790> think<00:02:30.970> he'd<00:02:31.090> do<00:02:31.299> but<00:02:31.600> just<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.560> little

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
don't think he'd do but just a little

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.060 
don't think he'd do but just a little
extra<00:02:32.980> safety<00:02:33.370> thing<00:02:33.610> so<00:02:34.560> basically<00:02:35.560> we<00:02:35.890> leave

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
extra safety thing so basically we leave

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.880 
extra safety thing so basically we leave
the<00:02:36.190> fence<00:02:36.430> up<00:02:37.019> over<00:02:38.019> traffic<00:02:38.230> people<00:02:38.680> come

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
the fence up over traffic people come

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.620 
the fence up over traffic people come
and<00:02:39.100> then<00:02:39.220> we'll<00:02:39.370> yank<00:02:39.549> it<00:02:39.730> down<00:02:39.790> just<00:02:40.420> before

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
and then we'll yank it down just before

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
and then we'll yank it down just before
they<00:02:40.900> get<00:02:41.049> here<00:02:41.320> and<00:02:41.580> then<00:02:42.580> after<00:02:43.209> we<00:02:43.470> get<00:02:44.470> our

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
they get here and then after we get our
