alright so this is sort of a

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.940 
alright so this is sort of a
continuation<00:00:02.730> of<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.750> last<00:00:03.780> video<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.830> the

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
continuation of the last video of the

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.600 
continuation of the last video of the
ambient<00:00:05.460> occlusion<00:00:05.640> pass<00:00:06.089> and<00:00:07.250> this<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.400> sort

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
ambient occlusion pass and this is sort

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.600 
ambient occlusion pass and this is sort
of<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.970> result<00:00:09.360> we<00:00:09.540> got<00:00:09.750> from<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.250> damn<00:00:11.460> you

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
of the result we got from the a damn you

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.830 
of the result we got from the a damn you
include<00:00:11.880> your<00:00:12.000> past<00:00:12.240> now<00:00:12.389> one<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.780> things

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
include your past now one of the things

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.039 
include your past now one of the things
I<00:00:13.080> forgot<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.469> mention<00:00:14.150> was<00:00:15.150> how<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.599> actually

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
I forgot to mention was how to actually

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.529 
I forgot to mention was how to actually
incorporate<00:00:16.590> wireframe<00:00:17.460> into<00:00:17.970> European

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
incorporate wireframe into European

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.150 
incorporate wireframe into European
occlusion<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.260> i'll<00:00:19.350> go<00:00:19.529> ahead<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.740> show<00:00:19.980> you

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
occlusion so i'll go ahead and show you

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.429 
occlusion so i'll go ahead and show you
that<00:00:20.310> really<00:00:20.580> quickly<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.750> primarily<00:00:22.020> i'm

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
that really quickly but primarily i'm

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.740 
that really quickly but primarily i'm
going<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.650> show<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.920> how<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.519> do<00:00:24.210> an

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
going to show you how to do an

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.550 
going to show you how to do an
alternative<00:00:25.650> method<00:00:26.480> doing<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.570> turntable<00:00:28.170> so

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
alternative method doing a turntable so

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.339 
alternative method doing a turntable so
instead<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.279> using<00:00:29.369> sort<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.000> like<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.349> NURBS

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
instead of using sort of like a NURBS

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.670 
instead of using sort of like a NURBS
circle<00:00:32.329> will<00:00:33.329> actually<00:00:33.780> go<00:00:33.930> ahead<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.260> turn

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
circle will actually go ahead and turn

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.760 
circle will actually go ahead and turn
the<00:00:34.890> object<00:00:35.340> itself<00:00:36.020> 360<00:00:37.020> degrees<00:00:37.350> without

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
the object itself 360 degrees without

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.440 
the object itself 360 degrees without
you<00:00:38.309> having<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:39.559> do<00:00:40.559> anything<00:00:41.180> more<00:00:42.180> than<00:00:42.390> that

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
you having to do anything more than that

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.229 
you having to do anything more than that
so<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.320> sort<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.710> sample<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.000> little

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
so this is sort of a sample in a little

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.750 
so this is sort of a sample in a little
scene<00:00:45.539> then<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.020> set<00:00:46.230> up<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.770> helix<00:00:47.460> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
scene then I set up just a helix and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.600 
scene then I set up just a helix and
then<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> polygon<00:00:49.170> plane<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.309> nothing<00:00:50.579> really

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
then a polygon plane so nothing really

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.220 
then a polygon plane so nothing really
too<00:00:52.550> complicated<00:00:53.550> right<00:00:54.000> there<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:54.780> i'll<00:00:55.020> go

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
too complicated right there so i'll go

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.080 
too complicated right there so i'll go
ahead<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.469> show<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.370> how<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.699> do<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
ahead and show you how to do the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.959 
ahead and show you how to do the
wireframes<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.890> turn<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.250> wire<00:00:59.489> frames

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
wireframes so to turn on wire frames

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.760 
wireframes so to turn on wire frames
you're<00:01:00.210> going<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.420> go<00:01:00.539> ahead<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.930> go<00:01:01.590> into

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
you're going to go ahead and go into

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.420 
you're going to go ahead and go into
your<00:01:02.100> hypershade

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
your hypershade

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.320 
your hypershade
and<00:01:05.430> then<00:01:05.519> you're<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.790> select<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
and then you're going to select the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.380 
and then you're going to select the
surface<00:01:06.750> sheet<00:01:07.080> node<00:01:08.000> and<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:09.119> you're<00:01:09.299> going

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
surface sheet node and then you're going

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.490 
surface sheet node and then you're going
to<00:01:09.450> select<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.680> input<00:01:11.159> output<00:01:11.880> connections

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
to select the input output connections

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.010 
to select the input output connections
and<00:01:13.500> then<00:01:13.649> go<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.799> set<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:14.689> then<00:01:15.689> go<00:01:15.899> to<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
and then go to set one then go to the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.770 
and then go to set one then go to the
set<00:01:16.259> one<00:01:16.409> tab<00:01:16.649> and<00:01:17.000> then<00:01:18.000> under<00:01:18.360> mental<00:01:18.570> ray

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
set one tab and then under mental ray

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.120 
set one tab and then under mental ray
you're<00:01:19.020> going<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> skip<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.649> contours

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
you're going to skip the contours

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.730 
you're going to skip the contours

obviously enable contour rendering the
width<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> lines<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:23.940> probably<00:01:24.420> go

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
width of the lines you can probably go

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:30.139 
width of the lines you can probably go
down<00:01:24.690> to<00:01:25.049> maybe<00:01:25.590> point<00:01:26.280> 5<00:01:26.820> or<00:01:27.210> 0<00:01:27.240> point<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:29.149> now

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
down to maybe point 5 or 0 point for now

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.510 
down to maybe point 5 or 0 point for now
depending<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> object<00:01:31.289> I<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> helix

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
depending on the object I have a helix

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.609 
depending on the object I have a helix
as<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.600> see<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.080> could<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> lot

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
as you can see and this could have a lot

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.399 
as you can see and this could have a lot
of<00:01:34.649> lines<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.399> could<00:01:35.580> look<00:01:35.729> kind<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.030> ugly

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
of lines so this could look kind of ugly

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.719 
of lines so this could look kind of ugly
but<00:01:37.409> i'll<00:01:37.649> just<00:01:37.860> show<00:01:38.039> you<00:01:38.069> anyway<00:01:38.550> for<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
but i'll just show you anyway for the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.669 
but i'll just show you anyway for the

and<00:02:05.970> then<00:02:06.570> basically<00:02:06.810> around<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.620> let<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.220> all

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:08.370 
and then basically around so let and all

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.360 
and then basically around so let and all
around<00:02:08.820> Polly<00:02:09.300> faces<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.410> then<00:02:10.650> if<00:02:11.040> you<00:02:11.160> want

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
around Polly faces and then if you want

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.820 
around Polly faces and then if you want
you<00:02:11.490> can<00:02:11.670> select<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.330> call<00:02:12.630> planar<00:02:13.170> face<00:02:13.440> but

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
you can select a call planar face but

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.830 
you can select a call planar face but
we'll<00:02:13.980> just<00:02:14.190> leave<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.490> off<00:02:14.670> for<00:02:14.820> now<00:02:15.030> and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
we'll just leave that off for now and

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.590 
we'll just leave that off for now and
then<00:02:15.900> we'll<00:02:16.350> go<00:02:16.560> ahead<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.190> just<00:02:17.280> do<00:02:17.510> maybe<00:02:18.510> a

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
then we'll go ahead and just do maybe a

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.770 
then we'll go ahead and just do maybe a
quick<00:02:19.560> render<00:02:20.240> maybe<00:02:21.240> just<00:02:21.480> give<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.720> a

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
quick render maybe just give you a

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.410 
quick render maybe just give you a
better<00:02:21.980> image<00:02:22.980> quality<00:02:23.310> will<00:02:23.700> set<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.060> up<00:02:24.210> to

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
better image quality will set this up to

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.350 
better image quality will set this up to
720<00:02:25.170> however<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.770> will<00:02:25.920> beef<00:02:26.160> up<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:27.030> render

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
720 however this will beef up the render

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.140 
720 however this will beef up the render
time<00:02:27.600> for<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:28.800> I'll<00:02:29.490> go<00:02:29.640> ahead<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.880> pause

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
time for it so I'll go ahead and pause

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.270 
time for it so I'll go ahead and pause
the<00:02:30.420> video<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:31.970> all<00:02:33.710> started<00:02:34.710> again<00:02:34.950> once

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
the video and all started again once

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.190 
the video and all started again once
it's<00:02:35.460> done<00:02:35.610> rendering<00:02:37.250> ok<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:38.310> with<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.200> render

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
it's done rendering ok so with a render

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.440 
it's done rendering ok so with a render
time<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.620> 3<00:02:40.800> minutes<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.220> 55<00:02:41.580> seconds<00:02:42.150> this<00:02:42.330> is

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
time of 3 minutes and 55 seconds this is

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.140 
time of 3 minutes and 55 seconds this is
exactly<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.170> result<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:43.760> we<00:02:44.760> are<00:02:44.880> looking

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
exactly the result that we are looking

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.790 
exactly the result that we are looking
for<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:45.720> we<00:02:45.840> actually<00:02:46.110> now<00:02:46.440> have<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.790> contour

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
for so we actually now have the contour

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.490 
for so we actually now have the contour
wireframe<00:02:49.800> on<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.850> object<00:02:51.000> itself<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:52.350> this

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
wireframe on the object itself so this

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.540 
wireframe on the object itself so this
is<00:02:52.650> basically<00:02:52.770> what<00:02:53.160> it's<00:02:53.280> going<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.460> look

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
is basically what it's going to look

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.330 
is basically what it's going to look
like<00:02:53.670> when<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.300> render<00:02:54.570> out<00:02:55.100> whatever<00:02:56.100> it<00:02:56.250> is

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
like when you render out whatever it is

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.150 
like when you render out whatever it is
you're<00:02:56.640> trying<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.510> render<00:02:57.810> out<00:02:58.020> on<00:02:58.980> your

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
you're trying to render out on your

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.080 
you're trying to render out on your
object<00:02:59.640> with<00:03:00.090> an<00:03:00.180> ambient<00:03:00.540> occlusion<00:03:00.660> pass
