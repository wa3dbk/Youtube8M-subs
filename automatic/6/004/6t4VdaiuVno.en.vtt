unfortunately<00:02:49.349> that's<00:02:49.440> not<00:02:49.590> enough<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:51.349> the

unfortunately that's not enough so the

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.039 
unfortunately that's not enough so the
issue<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.799> that<00:02:52.829> it's<00:02:53.069> a<00:02:53.130> coin<00:02:53.400> toss

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
issue is that it's a coin toss

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.509 
issue is that it's a coin toss
historically<00:02:55.250> retrospectively<00:02:56.250> when<00:02:56.459> we

it<00:03:18.720> was<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.840> YouTube<00:03:19.020> video<00:03:19.260> what<00:03:19.620> does<00:03:19.710> the

you<00:03:26.790> they<00:03:26.970> may<00:03:27.060> say<00:03:27.240> I<00:03:27.270> have<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.450> flu<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.050> they

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
you they may say I have a flu and they

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.230 
you they may say I have a flu and they
say<00:03:28.770> flu<00:03:29.010> Plus<00:03:29.430> no<00:03:29.580> spleen<00:03:29.790> you're<00:03:29.970> thinking

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
say flu Plus no spleen you're thinking

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.550 
say flu Plus no spleen you're thinking
about<00:03:30.330> this<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.930> issue<00:03:31.050> of<00:03:31.170> course<00:03:31.440> is

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
about this and the issue of course is

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.860 
about this and the issue of course is
that<00:03:31.620> those<00:03:31.920> encapsulated<00:03:32.760> organisms<00:03:33.330> which

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
that those encapsulated organisms which

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.330 
that those encapsulated organisms which
are<00:03:34.020> normally<00:03:34.290> optimized<00:03:34.800> and<00:03:35.040> cleared<00:03:35.280> by

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
are normally optimized and cleared by

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.430 
are normally optimized and cleared by
the<00:03:35.460> spleen<00:03:35.850> that's<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.570> much<00:03:36.780> less<00:03:36.990> efficient

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
the spleen that's a much less efficient

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.050 
the spleen that's a much less efficient
process<00:03:37.890> about<00:03:38.430> half<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.760> time<00:03:38.910> it's

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
process about half the time it's

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.670 
process about half the time it's
pneumococcus<00:03:39.660> there<00:03:39.870> are<00:03:40.020> others<00:03:40.410> the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
pneumococcus there are others the

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.860 
pneumococcus there are others the
oddball<00:03:41.100> that's<00:03:41.400> nice<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.850> remember<00:03:42.240> number

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
oddball that's nice to remember number

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.350 
oddball that's nice to remember number
one<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:43.110> Babesia<00:03:43.650> so<00:03:44.370> Babesia<00:03:44.880> is<00:03:45.060> one<00:03:45.240> of

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
one is Babesia so Babesia is one of

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.940 
one is Babesia so Babesia is one of
those<00:03:45.510> infections<00:03:46.140> it's<00:03:46.320> like<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.740> said<00:03:46.800> before

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
those infections it's like I said before

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.330 
those infections it's like I said before

red cells the spleen would normally take

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.370 
red cells the spleen would normally take
get<00:03:54.270> rid<00:03:54.450> of<00:03:54.540> them<00:03:54.630> if<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:54.840> have<00:03:54.960> no<00:03:55.080> spine<00:03:55.260> you

in<00:04:24.300> majority<00:04:24.660> of<00:04:24.720> cases<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.200> trick<00:04:25.350> is<00:04:25.470> to

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
in majority of cases the trick is to

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.960 
in majority of cases the trick is to
treat<00:04:25.710> them<00:04:25.800> right<00:04:26.010> away<00:04:26.100> and<00:04:26.370> not<00:04:26.460> wait<00:04:26.940> for

immunize<00:04:40.950> them<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.940> level<00:04:42.210> of<00:04:42.300> evidence<00:04:42.450> for

immunize them the level of evidence for

immunize them the level of evidence for

these otherwise pediatric infections

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.650 
these otherwise pediatric infections
like<00:04:45.720> Haemophilus<00:04:46.610> Neisseria<00:04:47.610> that<00:04:48.390> I<00:04:48.420> think

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
like Haemophilus Neisseria that I think

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.910 
like Haemophilus Neisseria that I think
for<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:48.870> boards<00:04:49.290> they<00:04:49.440> would<00:04:49.590> say<00:04:49.710> you<00:04:49.770> don't

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
for the boards they would say you don't

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.290 
for the boards they would say you don't
have<00:04:50.010> to<00:04:50.100> do<00:04:50.220> that<00:04:50.340> because<00:04:50.490> adults<00:04:50.940> don't<00:04:51.090> get

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
have to do that because adults don't get

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.540 
have to do that because adults don't get
this<00:04:51.540> I<00:04:51.780> always<00:04:52.350> do<00:04:52.680> that<00:04:52.800> because<00:04:53.370> I<00:04:53.490> think

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
this I always do that because I think

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.770 
this I always do that because I think
the<00:04:53.700> reason<00:04:53.910> adults<00:04:54.210> don't<00:04:54.300> get<00:04:54.480> this<00:04:54.660> is

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
the reason adults don't get this is

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.540 
the reason adults don't get this is
because<00:04:55.020> most<00:04:55.260> of<00:04:55.320> them<00:04:55.470> have<00:04:55.590> a<00:04:55.620> spleen<00:04:56.010> and<00:04:56.190> I

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
because most of them have a spleen and I

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.100 
because most of them have a spleen and I
have<00:04:56.730> met<00:04:56.940> patients<00:04:57.390> who<00:04:57.540> have<00:04:57.690> almost<00:04:57.900> died

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
have met patients who have almost died

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.170 
have met patients who have almost died
of<00:04:58.140> nice<00:04:58.380> serial<00:04:58.710> sepsis<00:04:59.100> at<00:04:59.220> age<00:04:59.340> 56<00:04:59.820> after

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
of nice serial sepsis at age 56 after

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.330 
of nice serial sepsis at age 56 after
losing<00:05:00.450> their<00:05:00.570> spleen<00:05:00.810> so<00:05:01.530> that's<00:05:01.860> not

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
losing their spleen so that's not

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.740 
losing their spleen so that's not
necessarily<00:05:02.760> for<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.030> boards<00:05:03.270> but<00:05:03.450> for<00:05:03.630> my

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
necessarily for the boards but for my

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.450 
necessarily for the boards but for my
practice<00:05:04.200> what<00:05:04.530> I<00:05:04.560> do<00:05:04.710> is<00:05:05.100> I'll<00:05:05.250> give<00:05:05.400> them

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
practice what I do is I'll give them

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.890 
practice what I do is I'll give them
every<00:05:05.760> shot<00:05:05.970> I<00:05:06.000> can<00:05:06.240> think<00:05:06.450> of<00:05:06.570> if<00:05:06.720> there<00:05:06.840> were

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
every shot I can think of if there were

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.060 
every shot I can think of if there were
more<00:05:07.050> shots<00:05:07.290> I'd<00:05:07.470> give<00:05:07.590> them<00:05:07.680> more<00:05:07.890> of<00:05:07.920> those

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
more shots I'd give them more of those

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.620 
more shots I'd give them more of those
because<00:05:08.580> this<00:05:08.670> is<00:05:08.790> a<00:05:08.820> rotten<00:05:09.060> way<00:05:09.240> to<00:05:09.300> wait<00:05:09.510> and

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
because this is a rotten way to wait and

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.320 
because this is a rotten way to wait and
watch<00:05:09.720> patients
