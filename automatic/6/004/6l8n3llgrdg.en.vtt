hole in the Wiis library aside from its
quality<00:02:08.599> I<00:02:08.630> think<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.289> most<00:02:09.440> surprising

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
quality I think the most surprising

thing<00:02:10.220> about<00:02:10.250> Speed<00:02:10.789> Racer<00:02:11.030> is<00:02:11.420> its<00:02:11.870> controls

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
thing about Speed Racer is its controls

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.009 
thing about Speed Racer is its controls
and<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.489> fact<00:02:13.760> that<00:02:13.879> they<00:02:14.209> aren't<00:02:14.420> terrible

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
and the fact that they aren't terrible

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.589 
and the fact that they aren't terrible
the<00:02:15.440> game<00:02:15.620> was<00:02:15.769> released<00:02:15.890> in<00:02:16.310> 2008<00:02:17.030> back<00:02:17.390> when

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
the game was released in 2008 back when

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.360 
the game was released in 2008 back when

developers forced motion into their
games<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.849> didn't<00:02:20.540> even<00:02:20.630> consider<00:02:21.140> adding<00:02:21.470> an

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
games and didn't even consider adding an

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.630 
games and didn't even consider adding an
alternative<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:23.450> play<00:02:23.720> with<00:02:23.930> tilts<00:02:24.410> and

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
alternative so you play with tilts and

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.089 
alternative so you play with tilts and
listen<00:02:25.670> I<00:02:25.760> despise<00:02:26.510> tilt<00:02:27.049> steering<00:02:27.380> it's

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
listen I despise tilt steering it's

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.490 
listen I despise tilt steering it's
actually<00:02:28.489> pretty<00:02:28.970> adequate<00:02:29.599> in<00:02:29.810> speed<00:02:30.140> racer

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
actually pretty adequate in speed racer

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.710 
actually pretty adequate in speed racer
that's<00:02:30.950> because<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.400> tracks<00:02:31.730> are<00:02:32.000> more

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
that's because the tracks are more

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.600 
that's because the tracks are more
forgiving<00:02:33.290> than<00:02:33.319> those<00:02:33.709> in<00:02:33.860> f-zero<00:02:34.010> they

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
forgiving than those in f-zero they

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.789 
forgiving than those in f-zero they
actually<00:02:34.880> kind<00:02:35.090> of<00:02:35.150> lead<00:02:35.599> you<00:02:35.810> into<00:02:36.079> the<00:02:36.349> turn

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
actually kind of lead you into the turn

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.699 
actually kind of lead you into the turn
so<00:02:36.980> steering<00:02:37.880> is<00:02:38.000> a<00:02:38.030> lot<00:02:38.239> smoother<00:02:38.750> if<00:02:39.470> you're

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
so steering is a lot smoother if you're

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.069 
so steering is a lot smoother if you're
looking<00:02:39.980> for<00:02:40.160> differences<00:02:40.549> well<00:02:41.030> there<00:02:41.959> are

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
looking for differences well there are

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.199 
looking for differences well there are
car<00:02:42.470> foo<00:02:42.680> mechanics<00:02:43.190> that<00:02:43.489> let<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:43.880> attack

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
car foo mechanics that let you attack

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.210 
car foo mechanics that let you attack
other<00:02:44.420> cars<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.049> earn<00:02:45.290> additional<00:02:45.440> points

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
other cars and earn additional points

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.780 
other cars and earn additional points
you<00:02:47.120> can<00:02:47.239> also<00:02:47.720> enter<00:02:48.139> this<00:02:48.470> crazy<00:02:49.190> alternate

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
you can also enter this crazy alternate

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.580 
you can also enter this crazy alternate
dimension<00:02:50.299> when<00:02:50.450> you<00:02:50.510> save<00:02:50.750> up<00:02:50.900> your<00:02:50.930> boost<00:02:51.290> on

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
dimension when you save up your boost on

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.250 
dimension when you save up your boost on
the<00:02:51.980> negative<00:02:52.370> side<00:02:52.400> it's<00:02:53.359> not<00:02:53.569> as<00:02:53.690> pretty<00:02:53.959> or

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
the negative side it's not as pretty or

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.129 
the negative side it's not as pretty or
as<00:02:54.530> fast<00:02:54.799> as<00:02:55.130> GX<00:02:55.579> and<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.420> multiplayer<00:02:56.750> is

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
as fast as GX and the multiplayer is

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.220 
as fast as GX and the multiplayer is
limited<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.680> split-screen<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.639> mean<00:02:59.630> there's

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
limited to split-screen I mean there's

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.840 
limited to split-screen I mean there's
not<00:03:00.470> much<00:03:00.739> here<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.100> haven't<00:03:01.310> seen<00:03:01.639> before

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
not much here you haven't seen before

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.759 
not much here you haven't seen before
but<00:03:02.420> that's<00:03:02.810> kind<00:03:03.109> of<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.230> point

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
but that's kind of the point

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.699 
but that's kind of the point
fans<00:03:04.069> wanted<00:03:04.519> to<00:03:04.579> see<00:03:04.670> this<00:03:05.030> on<00:03:05.209> Wii<00:03:05.500> albeit<00:03:06.500> in

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
fans wanted to see this on Wii albeit in

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.710 
fans wanted to see this on Wii albeit in
a<00:03:06.799> different<00:03:07.160> form<00:03:07.430> but<00:03:07.970> they<00:03:08.090> never<00:03:08.269> got<00:03:08.480> it

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
a different form but they never got it

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.960 
a different form but they never got it
so<00:03:08.930> that's<00:03:09.290> where<00:03:09.470> Speed<00:03:09.859> Racer<00:03:10.100> fits<00:03:10.549> in<00:03:10.790> if

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
so that's where Speed Racer fits in if

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.720 
so that's where Speed Racer fits in if
you're<00:03:11.389> really<00:03:11.989> desperate<00:03:12.470> for<00:03:12.980> an<00:03:13.069> f-zero

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
you're really desperate for an f-zero

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.120 
you're really desperate for an f-zero
like<00:03:14.060> experience<00:03:14.810> on<00:03:14.989> your<00:03:15.139> Wii<00:03:15.380> this<00:03:15.980> is<00:03:16.100> a

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
like experience on your Wii this is a

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.849 
like experience on your Wii this is a
perfectly<00:03:16.700> solid<00:03:16.910> little<00:03:17.389> racer<00:03:17.750> besides<00:03:18.560> and

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
perfectly solid little racer besides and

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:29.280 
perfectly solid little racer besides and
it's<00:03:19.459> not<00:03:19.609> like<00:03:19.730> you<00:03:19.790> have<00:03:19.880> a<00:03:19.940> choice<00:03:20.180> right

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.590 

yes
