00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.679
 hello girls that as they are 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.619
 Welcome to your new good channel 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.380
 Well, today we are going to do 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:17.940
 seasons 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.770
 The first thing we are going to do is paint 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.830
 our bottom nails that we 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.800
 decide in my case I chose already know 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.730
 the brand that I love I have this 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:34.540
 color something has to fascinated is the 218 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.670
 and then if they want to get it and good 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.690
 I gave two passes to my nail so that 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.960
 Exactly the color is very strong 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.410
 now 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.170
 what we are going to do is make the fund 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.250
 of our flower that can also be 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.530
 decide as you want in 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:01.899
 my case I am using this color 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.460
 is from jordan and is number 158 and good 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.650
 it is very easy what we are going to do 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.950
 we're just going to grab here the 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.950
 color and we're going to put in with circles 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.260
 and that's all we 're going to do 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.110
 trying that we do not have much left 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.860
 a lot of excess because otherwise it goes to 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:28.330
 take a long time to dry 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.490
 and as I always tell you , you decide 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.430
 where will they accommodate the flowers of what 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.050
 way they will give it and well that 's what 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.030
 first thing we 're going to do we 're going to 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.380
 wait for it to dry to start doing 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.560
 the shape of the flower 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.530
 Well, since it's dry, we 're going to 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.159
 do now what are the sheets of 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:56.409
 our flower and for this I am using 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:58.390
 this green color is number 9 46 and what 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.290
 what we are going to need is as always a 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.680
 piece of paper 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.330
 let's put some of our 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.429
 nail polish and with the help of a toothpick 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.800
 let's make the sheets go see what 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.430
 easy is to make them we just take a 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.250
 bit 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.250
 and we make some lines 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.010
 As I always tell you, you decide the 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.110
 design that will give you many flowers 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.890
 how many leaves will your 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.890
 its flower 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.270
 and since it is very dry I am going to 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.600
 teach how we are going to do the design of 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.600
 the flower 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.610
 and well, since we have is that these 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.939
 Now, what are we going to paint? 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.090
 to do is design the potato and it's 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:58.970
 ok, we are going to use a red color or 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.060
 as I tell you the color that you 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.210
 decide to do it 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:10.590
 let's put a few drops here 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:13.890
 and with help from the other side of the stick 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.250
 let's take color 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.580
 and we're going to do as if we did as 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.580
 one or 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.840

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.209

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.490

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.960
 a little bit here 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.060

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.060
