00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.650
 then type chicks and specialist in cardiology catholic university of 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.290
 rome eg federico fellini's doctor so he will tell us some 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.630
 episode we then made obvious 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.760
 poggiali and close this great our series d 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.320
 fish with us 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.369
 Luigi Ciaramelletti Councilor for Culture, Sport and Tourism 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.119
 of the Lazio region. I would immediately start with ivo chicks because he must 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.470
 present what study has brought us today 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.980
 brought two stars practically the bike 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.820
 even the 175 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.560
 freccia d'oro labeled 1 roma 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.280
 belonged to the Duce and on this bike the Duce of 1900 31 was declared 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.540
 milan motorcyclist 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.430
 or even his card headed to the cavalier benito mussolini which is the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.610
 card number 1 of the Italian motorcycle association 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.860
 then and then a very important piece of history because at the time there was also 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.150
 cerastar to the crisis 29 30 and there was a s-economy adipe papers the duce wanted 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.890
 launch this medium as an elective means of transport especially for the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.880
 worker world for how many years the decent way, then there was snow was a motorcycle 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.910
 although having a single cylinder with two exhaust pipes 1 i.e. solutions 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.800
 techniques are really sophisticated for those with a passion for mechanics 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.170
 we also have the pump for the pump you with which weight spin happened 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.710
 because there were no roads jumped off the matte at the time and when it was 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.720
 threw it was necessary DIY and the pupa was very useful to inflate later 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.480
 having repaired the inner tube 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.320
 paper mills to then be able to walk and continue travel 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.610
 this pump to a whole story if there is time that we can tell name 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.290
 Mintero know how he had this mute 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.800
 it's complicated and it was a lucky and fortuitous case 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.790
 I had an accident with the car and those days I did not study 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.960
 prevented the lady with her mother at a thousand miles begged to visit the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.799
 because it probably wouldn't have come back 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.830
 I go sailing with such insistence by e-mail 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.100
 it is said that I would have done it willingly but at that moment I was phoning a 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.960
 friend who for years had promised me his bike for a moment, a little bike 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.410
 500 red I also dreamed of having a palme but really like the way 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.420
 look at me, I'm white, looking at Mr. Lavy, even to me 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.870
 I don't care for a piece of iron 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.569
 do not even mention it to me, but look at it, it is a particular white one 1 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:36.239
 Rome 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.200
 and it belonged to the duce berlin lady so sweatshirt left alone, bank 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.540
 I left the phone case alone 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.070
 and he said surely I would not be able to afford it if she did 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.879
 polite to let me see after your mother's visit 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.159
 I will be happy to admire this piece of history 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.579
 then the series of events I succeeded in having it 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.189
 among them it was even canceled ex officio from the office of mine 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.180
 noticed after buying it simply because it hadn't been 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.079
 paid the stamp so much 85 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.169
 who wanted me to change the plaque bertolotti someone must change place of 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.909
 I work in Caracas if by chance we don't return the boat to its origin like this 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:17.959
 it was and therefore 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.430
 I often stop the police and the carabinieri 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.639
 the traffic police 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.279
 and they ask for the autograph but but maria rosa I mica the most comical thing that 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:29.789
 even a police patrol came into my garage 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:33.570
 closed for holidays said gate watch that I don't let myself out anymore 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.130
 excuse us for not considering us service but we are curious 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.979
 we do not believe that it is still the plaque 1 Rome 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:44.349
 so much so that they wanted to check they called the station ready 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.489
 we would like to know who owns the Rome license plate 1 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:48.449
 which then 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:52.589
 and then they just hung up thinking the same way to love 3 times for 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:57.209
 having the route before passing the councilor we also present the other one 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.550
 bike that actually 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.689
 we a few weeks ago already had 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:08.869
 the plot is the famous 125 r vespa of Roman holidays of 1951 

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:13.939
 and presumably a must because those who sold it to me sold it to me as the 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.629
 vespa of Roman holidays but presumably 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:21.539
 she is sitting besides is more bona than gregory peck recently disappeared 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.539
 we also have some pictures for free 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.020
 to these two great characters and then we also have images 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.740
 delete this one here though 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.040
 the wasp I have to say 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.680
 we see that they are scenes from the film narra ganz e 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.930
 Roman the very moment when or 3d is back 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.669
 take the wasp 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.639
 pero vivo en with gregory peck 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.770
 face photographer together for a photo on the sea 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.080
 they have all seen 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.900
 canceled romagna 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.520
 and connected the fashion of the Vespa because then from there the Vespa continued his 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.840
 traveled up to three days even abroad. everything, was the charm of 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.789
 this wasp 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.259
 that even today we are engaged on us who have to make an appointment 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.389
 at the sistine in February because then 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:15.499
 Roman holidays will be brought emma on stage with maximum ghini and serena 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:20.990
 gautier probable that larchini and gino landi we have this wishful thinking 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.449
 I am happy to satisfy any request also because 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.180
 already within reach of the new construction they took it well in half 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.759
 between the capitol a few days ago 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.159
 good assessor 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.139
 this particular moment for me 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.750
 I think councilor because here they are here in here before going to the sun 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.490
 cyprus when maximum time 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.349
 you have to be audery new holidays hhhh 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.470
 ah, that will be difficult for you 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.129
 then equal 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:49.699
 gregory peck and audrey hepburn
