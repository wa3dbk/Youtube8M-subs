00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:50.250
 again here is my room 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.680
 the first time you see the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.080
 wallpaper 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.780
 So I'll tell you a little bit later. 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.460
 you on every detail of what as 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.220
 Such a room is still a 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.930
 But for now this is it and I said 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.830
 who always do the update for you 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.350

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.610
 Good, what has changed since last Sunday. 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.890
 by the room 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.530
 What changed was the part of the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.170
 nec wall now we're with 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.899
 cute wallpaper ali is 16 a 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.460
 door is also a differential because it 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.340
 I was without anything behind and then I solved 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.960
 make this fund cool because I 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.380
 I had several whimsical services here 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.090
 That's when I hit on this idea. 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.710
 super cool for girls like to 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.280
 that I spent in instagram 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.460
 now is it does not make me I bought 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.380
 look how cool 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.509
 joão farinha i bought in pernambucanas 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.330
 was 10 reais each - these two here 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.610
 is this and is this I had 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.500
 Only now, just buy the cover. 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.750
 cuter cushion but so far 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.560
 I did not buy and for now it will stay 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.319
 like this 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.289
 and I told you I was going to buy one 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.550
 White thigh all but did not roll because I 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.140
 I did not find 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:06.479
 and that's what I thought was one for 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.250
 double bed at last is a little piece of 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.440
 cleans up by saying that I do not 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.870
 situation, I have to move the chair 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:20.099
 the charger and borboletinhas and 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.440
 that sticker that this sticker here I 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:26.430
 I bought on the express website that I told 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.650
 for you in the decoration video and the 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.959
 carpet look that grace on a carpet of 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.000
 Skin I tell the truth to you I 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.489
 I thought it was going to be bigger, huh? 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.640
 but it was good too because it messes a lot 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.410
 easy and it 's small so it 's cool 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.959
 also to take some photos with the 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.000
 background so I really liked him and 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.700
 color people is purposeful as this agreement 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.080
 It's better to be annoyed, but at the price. 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.660
 it was not 30 reais and tomorrow is cool is 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.930
 to match even the green us water 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:04.090
 blue and why food in the middle a bit 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:06.190
 so tone with the wallpaper is what 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.770
 Nothing much has changed 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.450
 it was this people the curtain did not buy 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.860
 also because I did not find it for the 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.420
 size of my because I want that 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.530
 blackout né 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.950
 I do not think the size of my 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:22.660
 window the wardrobe too i said 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.459
 that I was going to paint him we would change 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.220
 it's white, but we should not 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.840
 time to do this even more 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.000
 idea does not change we want to leave it 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.790
 white because so it stains a lot 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.130
 type before he will put the hand not 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.680
 is black and does not look very cool 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.680
 now also that we have not changed yet 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.320
 It's the mirror because here the 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.350
 pink play is a pink type of this 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.480
 for her to write 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.220
 But you still do not think why when the 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.440
 people buy today to run away from 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.060
 esteio bought because my father had not 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.739
 plus the same drawing to put the 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.790
 Language for waiting I did not try the 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.030
 mirror 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.100
 I'm still going to paint, I bought a 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.080
 sticker also to put here in this 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.370
 only part that has not arrived yet 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.620

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.670
 here on your device you have no idea here 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.860
 also 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.010
 I'm leaving the chair because I 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.380
 I have not set the little table there as 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:24.010
 I told you why not yet. 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.169
 left over even because the same line is 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.350
 The most expensive object that I will tell a 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.060

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:35.830
