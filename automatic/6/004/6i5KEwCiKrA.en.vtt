he has to keep his hand on my ball
as<00:04:03.680> soon<00:04:03.890> as<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.099> get<00:04:04.189> an<00:04:04.310> e<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:04.849> he<00:04:05.000> sort<00:04:05.180> of

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
as soon as you get an e and he sort of

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.160 
as soon as you get an e and he sort of
got<00:04:05.420> many<00:04:05.689> separation<00:04:06.760> for<00:04:07.760> its<00:04:07.970> clothes<00:04:08.239> it

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
got many separation for its clothes it

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.750 
got many separation for its clothes it
is<00:04:09.260> cause<00:04:09.530> I<00:04:09.560> think<00:04:09.769> that<00:04:09.920> first<00:04:10.189> angle<00:04:10.519> gives

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
is cause I think that first angle gives

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.949 
is cause I think that first angle gives
it<00:04:10.879> away<00:04:11.000> though<00:04:11.269> I<00:04:11.329> think<00:04:11.510> there's<00:04:11.659> a<00:04:11.689> bit<00:04:11.870> of

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
it away though I think there's a bit of

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.929 
it away though I think there's a bit of
separation<00:04:12.140> at<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.680> bottom<00:04:12.980> this<00:04:13.640> is<00:04:13.819> the

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:13.939 
separation at the bottom this is the

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:17.920 
separation at the bottom this is the
ball<00:04:14.150> go<00:04:14.360> back<00:04:14.720> on<00:04:14.900> and<00:04:15.140> off<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.739> ground<00:04:16.930> why

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
ball go back on and off the ground why

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.099 
ball go back on and off the ground why
this<00:04:17.989> is<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.410> tough<00:04:18.709> one<00:04:18.919> I<00:04:19.539> think<00:04:20.539> this<00:04:20.720> is<00:04:20.870> this

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
this is a tough one I think this is this

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.600 
this is a tough one I think this is this
is<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.380> angle<00:04:21.680> from<00:04:21.799> the<00:04:21.979> side<00:04:22.220> where<00:04:22.430> you<00:04:22.490> see

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
is the angle from the side where you see

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.360 
is the angle from the side where you see
a<00:04:22.760> bit<00:04:23.030> of<00:04:23.150> a<00:04:23.210> gap<00:04:23.590> as<00:04:24.590> it<00:04:24.740> comes<00:04:24.949> down<00:04:25.100> oh<00:04:25.160> he's

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
a bit of a gap as it comes down oh he's

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.420 
a bit of a gap as it comes down oh he's
got<00:04:25.490> to<00:04:25.520> keep<00:04:25.699> his<00:04:25.760> hand<00:04:26.030> on<00:04:26.120> that<00:04:26.180> ball

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
got to keep his hand on that ball

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.249 
got to keep his hand on that ball
certainly<00:04:28.270> as<00:04:28.449> he<00:04:28.570> goes<00:04:28.750> under<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.080> ground

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
certainly as he goes under the ground

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.469 
certainly as he goes under the ground
his<00:04:29.470> hand<00:04:29.650> has<00:04:29.830> to<00:04:29.979> be<00:04:30.100> on<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.370> ball<00:04:30.580> and<00:04:31.389> I

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
his hand has to be on the ball and I

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.379 
his hand has to be on the ball and I
think<00:04:31.750> just<00:04:32.290> at<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.590> last<00:04:32.770> minute<00:04:33.120> do<00:04:34.120> we<00:04:34.210> see

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
think just at the last minute do we see

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.739 
think just at the last minute do we see
any<00:04:34.600> separation

00:04:36.739 --> 00:04:36.749 
any separation

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:38.570 
any separation
I<00:04:36.779> think<00:04:37.319> I've<00:04:37.439> given<00:04:37.589> I<00:04:37.919> think<00:04:38.129> he's<00:04:38.249> had<00:04:38.429> the

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
I think I've given I think he's had the

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.949 
I think I've given I think he's had the
fingers<00:04:38.909> off<00:04:39.029> the<00:04:39.059> ball<00:04:39.330> here<00:04:39.539> although<00:04:39.689> down

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:39.959 
fingers off the ball here although down

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:42.499 
fingers off the ball here although down
looking<00:04:40.289> at<00:04:40.439> that<00:04:40.649> it<00:04:40.949> does<00:04:41.159> but<00:04:41.879> certainly

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
looking at that it does but certainly

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.570 
looking at that it does but certainly
it's<00:04:43.019> got<00:04:43.229> to<00:04:43.349> be<00:04:43.409> conclusive<00:04:43.830> prude<00:04:44.249> because

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
it's got to be conclusive prude because

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.939 
it's got to be conclusive prude because
the<00:04:44.699> referees<00:04:45.059> sent<00:04:45.329> it<00:04:45.419> up<00:04:45.509> as<00:04:45.659> a<00:04:45.689> try<00:04:45.959> now

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
the referees sent it up as a try now

00:04:46.949 --> 00:05:00.470 
the referees sent it up as a try now
this<00:04:47.099> is<00:04:47.249> probably<00:04:47.339> going<00:04:47.579> to<00:04:47.639> be<00:04:47.729> comfort

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480
