00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.410
 Today I introduce you to my new project 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.719
 in front 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.089
 and this is about bonsai on feet 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.519
 bonsai also feet so so are 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:16.049
 meant roots and really no feet 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.830
 but those are the roots then 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.470
 later on, and that gives a lot 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.670
 interesting appearance and I show 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.540
 Do not look at the candidates 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.540
 just picked 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.239
 while this is here 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.890
 this is a family 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.970
 and I do not know that 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.970
 It was about 23 months ago 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.559
 and this phase will count for a long time 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:53.410
 Feet get this is an experiment 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:56.230
 and I'm curious how that then 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.620
 will look later and I explain that 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.450
 some of you now we have that 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.850
 we need to start experimenting 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.580
 a pot with fleece in it with it down 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.600
 The substrate does not regulate out a few 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:16.020
 Stone pond paint suitable size 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.020
 Tailored and of course substrate 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:25.430
 First, we fill the pot here where 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.430
 the plant comes in 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.630
 We now have about half to three 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.710
 quarter the pot filled and more 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.320
 also does not need to be pure because we 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.210
 then still need that around there 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.890
 to deposit a few stones 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:55.580
 so that does not fall over now 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:11.120
 Let's do the slide together and love 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:12.430
 the wire frame so the whole comes 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.390
 in now in the pot 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.390
 Of course we have a little bit of one 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.150
 with that the relationship is finished and 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.990
 Now we fill the whole with 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.990
 substrate stone 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.490
 the purpose we take now 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.370
 petrifactions in now a bit 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:50.040
 substrate on not much want that 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.040
 the rigid ones are just covered 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:01.900
 a few stones in and again 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:08.340
 again some fruit advice is the steyr 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:18.340
 reasonably laid are a few stones 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:20.320
 even then full again filled 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:27.340
 is the whole and we need it now 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:29.700
 still logically a plant the 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.700
 visitors 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.560
 this is the chosen plant that is 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.939
 also a transfer and this 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.530
 Candidates I cut all the time 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:41.260
 back and bands continue theirs too 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.909
 so that has to stay small for the purpose 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.620
 so I have time today for material 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.620
 a new idea 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.489
 in the circus a good one now 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.530
 climb a bit 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.530
 of course, cut the root 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.889
 and now we have more because it 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:27.000
 comes out of course that is good and 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.780
 so if there are a few now 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.780
 remove 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.720
 You can still use that one 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:39.539
 also a plant if I'm okay now 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.770
 especially here two more in principle 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:44.039
 we then need double stars 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.850
 not alone from the me for it 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:49.850
 But suppose who really does not care 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.850
 no matter 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.800
 yes , let the upper part of the come that 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.560
 is not too green now 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:07.210
 that's okay yes and so plant less 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:16.160
 extend the good ones a bit now 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:31.370
 place these substrates out with third place 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:32.870
 back on it either my god I the 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.419
 heart love but we need the water 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:40.060
 that's the way it was 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.060
 sprinkle with a good one already 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.780
 The meaning of the whole thing is now 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.590
 of course that we have the roots to one 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.980
 bring whimsical forms and see 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.890
 if we succeed 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:01.280
 now is very important in this 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:05.060
 approach that the plants grow 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:08.360
 should be allowed to should so should 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:11.320
 no case cut so that 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.330
 Root growth is driving growth 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.510
 touches and then strong roots 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.340
 to develop because if we have the 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.560
 ball now constantly cut back then 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.820
 The roots are not really 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.990
 get fat and not so fast 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.990
 walk down the pot 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:33.320
 yes, or something similar should the whole 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:40.620
 then later when it is finished 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:43.980
 a madness calls her to the feet rain in 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.450
 rain stand so i hope i could 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.320
 Also inspire you a bit 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:51.120
 to do a few experiments like that and 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.130
 Let's have a look at the happy ones 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.960
 So planting myself already the 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:59.310
 I am very happy and I hope so too 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:06.480
 thank you to create up to one 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:08.040
 other times the black polish rakitic runs 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:12.570
 I have a water box and allow 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:14.970
 may plant because they are after 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.590
 of course, not the sun 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.080
 So the plants remain up 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.280
 we are done with shadows sometimes 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.090
 stand or 

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:26.430
 without stop and fertilized is now still 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.440
 not that is common before the 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.360
 second one expects to plant the plants 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.120
 really are in growth and in this 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.250
 Plant spring is not yet 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.940
 In addition, there are a total of such 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.940
 measures, of course
