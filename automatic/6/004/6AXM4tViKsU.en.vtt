00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.560 
so it's you know all quite new to me but
when<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.310> looked<00:00:32.579> at<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.730> few<00:00:32.880> pictures<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.390> can

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.510 
when I looked at a few pictures I can
totally<00:00:34.020> see<00:00:34.260> why<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.560> would<00:00:34.860> say<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.130> I

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
