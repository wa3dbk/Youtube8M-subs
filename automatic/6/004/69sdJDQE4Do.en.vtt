in here it's it's packed in tight
there's<00:02:35.250> no<00:02:35.370> space<00:02:35.700> left<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:38.340> then<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.269> right

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
there's no space left and then the right

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.599 
there's no space left and then the right
hand<00:02:39.450> side<00:02:39.959> it's<00:02:40.799> one<00:02:41.159> cabinet<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:44.370> upper

hand side it's one cabinet the upper

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.729 
hand side it's one cabinet the upper
part<00:02:44.849> is<00:02:44.970> smaller<00:02:45.629> than<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.989> lower<00:02:46.139> part<00:02:46.500> so

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739

out to an outlet at the back behind

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.469 
out to an outlet at the back behind
those<00:03:58.769> hoses<00:03:59.280> so<00:03:59.400> when<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.639> door<00:03:59.849> is<00:03:59.879> down<00:04:00.180> and

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:00.479 
those hoses so when the door is down and

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:02.420 
those hoses so when the door is down and
the<00:04:00.959> trailer<00:04:01.199> is<00:04:01.319> plugged<00:04:01.560> in<00:04:01.739> you<00:04:02.010> can<00:04:02.190> have

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
the trailer is plugged in you can have

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.409 
the trailer is plugged in you can have
power<00:04:02.819> and<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.180> can<00:04:03.479> have<00:04:03.599> light<00:04:04.970> so<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.000> is

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
power and you can have light so that is

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.879 
power and you can have light so that is
actually<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.840> really<00:04:07.049> nice<00:04:07.319> little<00:04:07.680> thing<00:04:07.799> to

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
actually a really nice little thing to

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.770 
actually a really nice little thing to
have<00:04:08.010> because<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.430> trailer<00:04:08.729> is<00:04:08.879> not<00:04:08.909> always

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
have because the trailer is not always

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.689 
have because the trailer is not always
plugged<00:04:10.079> into<00:04:10.229> the<00:04:10.379> truck<00:04:10.650> so<00:04:11.750> then<00:04:12.750> down<00:04:12.989> here

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:13.699 
plugged into the truck so then down here

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:16.599 
plugged into the truck so then down here
there's<00:04:14.699> a<00:04:14.790> power<00:04:15.030> bar<00:04:15.359> hardwired<00:04:16.049> so<00:04:16.409> the

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
there's a power bar hardwired so the

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.770 
there's a power bar hardwired so the
chargers<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.729> battery<00:04:18.000> charges<00:04:18.449> for<00:04:18.630> the

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
chargers the battery charges for the

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.020 
chargers the battery charges for the
battery<00:04:19.470> tools<00:04:19.709> can<00:04:20.039> sit<00:04:20.519> on<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.729> shelf<00:04:20.760> here

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.400 

and<00:04:24.360> then<00:04:25.230> at<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:25.470> end<00:04:25.500> keyway<00:04:27.050> it's<00:04:28.050> a<00:04:28.140> switch

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
and then at the end keyway it's a switch

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.350 
and then at the end keyway it's a switch
and<00:04:28.740> a<00:04:28.920> to<00:04:29.100> gang<00:04:29.340> outlet<00:04:29.730> so<00:04:29.940> when<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:30.150> traders

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
and a to gang outlet so when the traders

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.720 
and a to gang outlet so when the traders
plugged<00:04:30.750> in<00:04:31.100> we<00:04:32.100> have<00:04:32.220> power<00:04:32.430> right<00:04:32.700> there

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
plugged in we have power right there

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.410 
plugged in we have power right there
this<00:04:33.090> is<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.420> core<00:04:33.660> did<00:04:33.990> I<00:04:34.080> use<00:04:35.420> heavy-duty

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
this is the core did I use heavy-duty

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.440 
this is the core did I use heavy-duty
flexible<00:04:37.320> cord<00:04:37.560> it's<00:04:37.980> just<00:04:38.190> 15<00:04:38.640> amp<00:04:38.880> so<00:04:39.390> you

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
flexible cord it's just 15 amp so you

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.780 
flexible cord it's just 15 amp so you
can't<00:04:39.750> run<00:04:40.050> too<00:04:40.440> heavy<00:04:40.830> an<00:04:41.010> item<00:04:41.280> on<00:04:41.400> there<00:04:41.610> but

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
can't run too heavy an item on there but

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.970 
can't run too heavy an item on there but
it's<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:42.030> 50<00:04:42.780> foot<00:04:43.020> cord<00:04:43.260> so<00:04:43.730> and<00:04:44.730> the<00:04:45.510> one<00:04:45.720> end

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
it's a 50 foot cord so and the one end

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.300 
it's a 50 foot cord so and the one end
is<00:04:46.980> just<00:04:47.340> designed<00:04:47.670> to<00:04:48.000> go<00:04:48.210> right<00:04:48.660> into<00:04:49.470> the

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
is just designed to go right into the

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.760 
is just designed to go right into the
socket<00:04:50.760> that<00:04:50.910> I<00:04:51.300> bought<00:04:51.690> at<00:04:51.900> hardware<00:04:52.260> store

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
socket that I bought at hardware store

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.690 
socket that I bought at hardware store
that's<00:04:53.610> a<00:04:53.730> marine<00:04:54.090> socket<00:04:58.130> and<00:04:59.130> it<00:04:59.310> just<00:04:59.490> plugs

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
that's a marine socket and it just plugs

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.330 
that's a marine socket and it just plugs
right<00:04:59.850> in<00:05:00.090> there

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
right in there

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.290 
right in there
so<00:05:02.510> that<00:05:03.510> is<00:05:03.780> our<00:05:03.990> work<00:05:04.169> trailer<00:05:04.820> we<00:05:05.820> use<00:05:06.000> every

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
so that is our work trailer we use every

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.780 
so that is our work trailer we use every
day

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
day

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.670 
day
it's<00:05:08.790> a<00:05:08.940> 10-footer<00:05:09.540> I<00:05:09.810> could<00:05:10.080> probably<00:05:10.290> use<00:05:10.650> a

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
it's a 10-footer I could probably use a

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.080 
it's a 10-footer I could probably use a
12<00:05:11.190> or<00:05:11.520> 16<00:05:12.560> but<00:05:13.560> in<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:14.160> locations<00:05:14.790> where<00:05:14.940> we

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
12 or 16 but in the locations where we
