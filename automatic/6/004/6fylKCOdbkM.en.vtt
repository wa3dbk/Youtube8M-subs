plastic packages you just get to the
meat<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.880> products<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.420> have<00:00:36.450> actually

meat of the products I have actually
prepped<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.579> product<00:00:39.000> prior<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:39.960> but

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
prepped the product prior to this but

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.840 
prepped the product prior to this but
what<00:00:40.800> you're<00:00:40.950> basically<00:00:41.309> gonna<00:00:41.550> see<00:00:41.730> is

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
what you're basically gonna see is

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.610 
what you're basically gonna see is
everything<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> prodigy<00:00:43.170> comes<00:00:43.410> with

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
everything that the prodigy comes with

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.680 
everything that the prodigy comes with
this<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.489> unit<00:00:44.789> itself<00:00:45.059> as<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.420> can<00:00:45.539> see

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
this is the unit itself as you can see

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.150 
this is the unit itself as you can see
it's<00:00:45.809> very<00:00:45.870> small<00:00:48.710> it's<00:00:49.710> just<00:00:49.920> slightly

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
it's very small it's just slightly

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.670 
it's very small it's just slightly
slightly<00:00:51.090> bigger<00:00:51.329> than<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.629> standard<00:00:52.140> box<00:00:52.440> of

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
slightly bigger than a standard box of

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.860 
slightly bigger than a standard box of
matches<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.309> volume<00:00:53.940> probably<00:00:54.660> probably

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
matches that volume probably probably

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.360 
matches that volume probably probably
nothing<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.149> very<00:00:57.360> small<00:00:57.449> unit

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
nothing in it so it's a very small unit

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.619 
nothing in it so it's a very small unit
very<00:00:59.370> manageable<00:01:01.879> just<00:01:02.879> go<00:01:03.030> through<00:01:03.329> some<00:01:03.600> of

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
very manageable just go through some of

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.380 
very manageable just go through some of
the<00:01:04.280> some<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.460> other<00:01:05.489> bits<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.000> pieces<00:01:06.180> so

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the some of the other bits and pieces so

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.570 
the some of the other bits and pieces so
that's<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.900> GPS<00:01:07.350> tracker<00:01:07.650> itself<00:01:10.580> inside

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
that's the GPS tracker itself inside

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.580 
that's the GPS tracker itself inside
this<00:01:11.880> side<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.330> box<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.409> your

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
this side of the box you have your

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.969 
this side of the box you have your
driver<00:01:13.830> disc<00:01:18.259> also<00:01:19.259> comes<00:01:19.470> with<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> USB

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
driver disc also comes with the USB

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.039 
driver disc also comes with the USB
cable<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.820> didn't<00:01:21.479> take<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.659> out<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
cable I didn't take that out of the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.499 
cable I didn't take that out of the
packet<00:01:22.409> because<00:01:22.710> really<00:01:23.580> no<00:01:23.820> point<00:01:24.060> showing

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
packet because really no point showing

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.020 
packet because really no point showing
that<00:01:27.020> it<00:01:28.020> also<00:01:28.200> comes<00:01:28.470> with<00:01:28.619> two<00:01:28.740> backs<00:01:29.189> so

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
that it also comes with two backs so

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.219 
that it also comes with two backs so
you've<00:01:30.210> got<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> back<00:01:30.630> that's<00:01:30.900> actually

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
you've got the back that's actually

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.050 
you've got the back that's actually
fitted<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.829> unit<00:01:32.250> when<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.520> take<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.909> out

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
fitted to the unit when you take it out

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.749 
fitted to the unit when you take it out
of<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.270> box<00:01:33.920> it<00:01:34.920> also<00:01:35.070> comes<00:01:35.520> with<00:01:35.579> a

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
of the box it also comes with a

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.640 
of the box it also comes with a
magnetizer<00:01:36.360> then<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.259> get<00:01:37.470> that

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
magnetizer then if you can get that

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.880 
magnetizer then if you can get that
detailing<00:01:38.220> there<00:01:39.079> you<00:01:40.079> should<00:01:40.200> see<00:01:40.530> four

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
detailing there you should see four

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.410 
detailing there you should see four
little<00:01:41.070> mounds<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.850> there<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.210> they're

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
little mounds on there and they're

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.520 
little mounds on there and they're
they're<00:01:42.990> reasonably<00:01:43.500> powerful<00:01:43.710> magnets<00:01:45.530> that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
they're reasonably powerful magnets that

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.190 
they're reasonably powerful magnets that
so<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.369> actually<00:01:47.399> change<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.659> back<00:01:48.899> on

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
so you can actually change the back on

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.990 
so you can actually change the back on
the<00:01:49.350> unit<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:49.950> means<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.579> attached

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the unit and it means it can be attached

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.670 
the unit and it means it can be attached
to<00:01:51.899> anything<00:01:52.409> metal<00:01:53.030> just<00:01:54.030> obviously<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.439> save

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
to anything metal just obviously to save

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.130 
to anything metal just obviously to save
any<00:01:55.890> confusion<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.090> not<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.960> its

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
any confusion this this is not in its

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.770 
any confusion this this is not in its
native<00:01:58.560> state<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.780> weatherproof

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
native state is not a weatherproof

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.200 
native state is not a weatherproof
tracker<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.799> wouldn't<00:02:02.460> go<00:02:02.610> sticking<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.180> to

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
tracker so I wouldn't go sticking it to

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.859 
tracker so I wouldn't go sticking it to
the<00:02:03.360> underside<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:04.079> vehicle<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:05.790> expect<00:02:06.689> it

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
the underside of a vehicle and expect it

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.660 
the underside of a vehicle and expect it
to<00:02:06.990> be<00:02:07.140> alright<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.770> goes<00:02:07.979> out<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.369> sort<00:02:08.640> of

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
to be alright if it goes out in sort of

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.210 
to be alright if it goes out in sort of
like<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.819> heavy<00:02:09.119> heavy<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> heavy<00:02:10.830> rainy<00:02:11.129> day

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
like a heavy heavy on a heavy rainy day

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.400 
like a heavy heavy on a heavy rainy day
so<00:02:13.030> it's<00:02:13.150> not<00:02:13.240> made<00:02:13.480> for<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.750> reason<00:02:14.290> it's

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
so it's not made for that reason it's

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.710 
so it's not made for that reason it's
just<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:15.010> make<00:02:15.160> fitting<00:02:15.670> easier<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.300> know<00:02:16.450> you

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
just to make fitting easier you know you

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.150 
just to make fitting easier you know you
know<00:02:16.840> in<00:02:17.050> a<00:02:17.140> metallic<00:02:17.500> environment<00:02:19.710> so<00:02:20.710> also

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
know in a metallic environment so also

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.450 
know in a metallic environment so also
in<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.400> packaging<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:22.650> get<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.680> standard

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
in the packaging you get a standard

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.280 
in the packaging you get a standard
three-pin<00:02:25.000> adapter<00:02:25.720> which<00:02:25.870> I'll<00:02:26.050> show<00:02:26.260> you

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
three-pin adapter which I'll show you

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.790 
three-pin adapter which I'll show you
how<00:02:26.590> that's<00:02:26.740> how<00:02:27.250> that<00:02:27.430> that's<00:02:27.640> used<00:02:28.650> in<00:02:29.650> a

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
how that's how that that's used in a

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.290 
how that's how that that's used in a
minute

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
minute

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.840 
minute
that's<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.420> one<00:02:31.570> side<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:33.250> part<00:02:33.490> is<00:02:33.640> also

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
that's a one side and the part is also

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.010 
that's a one side and the part is also
shipped<00:02:34.420> with<00:02:34.830> two<00:02:35.830> batteries<00:02:36.630> which<00:02:37.630> is<00:02:37.780> very

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
shipped with two batteries which is very

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.170 
shipped with two batteries which is very
convenient<00:02:38.650> because<00:02:38.770> obviously<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.940> can

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
convenient because obviously you you can

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.670 
convenient because obviously you you can
actually<00:02:40.420> be<00:02:40.660> recharging<00:02:41.170> one<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:41.620> the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
the time so you can run the batteries in

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.790 
the time so you can run the batteries in
the<00:02:51.340> loop<00:02:52.110> fixing<00:02:53.110> it<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.290> battery<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:53.770> very

out and showed you the fitting of it but
it's<00:03:10.510> just<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:10.900> standard<00:03:11.350> sim<00:03:11.680> trap<00:03:13.410> pop<00:03:14.410> that

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
it's just a standard sim trap pop that

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.650 
it's just a standard sim trap pop that
in<00:03:14.770> there<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.460> that's<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.910> sim<00:03:16.180> fitted

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
in there and and that's the sim fitted

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.510 
in there and and that's the sim fitted
simple<00:03:17.080> as<00:03:17.140> that<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.500> standard<00:03:18.160> saw<00:03:18.310> like

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
simple as that the standard saw like

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.490 
simple as that the standard saw like
mobile<00:03:18.850> telephone<00:03:19.420> kind<00:03:20.200> of<00:03:20.350> seemed<00:03:20.590> fitting

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:19.730 
very accurate and it gets a fix in some

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.960 
very accurate and it gets a fix in some
really<00:07:19.970> adverse<00:07:20.540> of<00:07:20.960> like<00:07:21.170> locations<00:07:21.950> so<00:07:22.340> it's

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:22.970 
really adverse of like locations so it's

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.290 
really adverse of like locations so it's
a<00:07:23.090> very<00:07:23.330> capable<00:07:23.570> unit<00:07:24.790> this<00:07:25.790> especially

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:26.300 
a very capable unit this especially

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.960 
a very capable unit this especially
considering<00:07:26.960> its<00:07:27.350> size<00:07:27.440> I<00:07:27.980> mean<00:07:28.760> that<00:07:28.940> just

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:28.970 
considering its size I mean that just

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.520 
considering its size I mean that just
about<00:07:29.300> concludes<00:07:29.540> this<00:07:29.960> video<00:07:30.140> and<00:07:30.440> I've

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:30.530 
about concludes this video and I've

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.830 
about concludes this video and I've
obviously<00:07:31.280> created<00:07:32.240> a<00:07:32.330> couple<00:07:32.510> of<00:07:32.660> other

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 
obviously created a couple of other

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.400 
obviously created a couple of other
videos<00:07:33.230> that<00:07:33.490> show<00:07:34.490> the<00:07:34.990> live<00:07:35.990> tracking

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:36.410 
videos that show the live tracking

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.700 
videos that show the live tracking
interface<00:07:37.100> and<00:07:37.780> how<00:07:38.780> the<00:07:38.840> tracking<00:07:39.230> on<00:07:39.530> this

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:39.710 
interface and how the tracking on this

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.260 
interface and how the tracking on this
unit<00:07:40.040> would<00:07:40.100> actually<00:07:40.490> work<00:07:40.700> so<00:07:41.030> you<00:07:41.090> can

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:41.270 
unit would actually work so you can

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.670 
unit would actually work so you can
actually<00:07:41.450> see<00:07:43.000> the<00:07:44.000> unit<00:07:44.390> in<00:07:44.510> a<00:07:44.600> in<00:07:45.350> a<00:07:45.470> live

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 
actually see the unit in a in a live

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.300 
actually see the unit in a in a live
tracking<00:07:46.100> environment<00:07:47.830> go<00:07:48.830> ahead<00:07:49.040> and<00:07:49.190> watch

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:49.310 
tracking environment go ahead and watch

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.970 
tracking environment go ahead and watch
those<00:07:49.550> videos<00:07:50.500> thanks<00:07:51.500> for<00:07:51.620> watching<00:07:51.890> this
