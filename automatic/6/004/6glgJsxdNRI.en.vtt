00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 and in fact I found this morning from 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.359
 Korean beef fillet on the 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.940
 market so it's a fake piece 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.269
 net that I wrapped in film 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.790
 plastic or that it's round like that 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.199
 then I cut them into slices and 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.130
 after I used the string of 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.279
 butcher it prevents the meat goes away 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.980
 stay well euros like that so I 'm going 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.730
 season it's salt it's solal 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.730
 the one that nothing a little weight 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.600
 am I going to do what I'm going 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:39.600
 quadrille 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.640
 so here I went back but steak and we 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.899
 sees that thanks to mobile gray water 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.399
 I really have what's called a 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.399
 frame grid 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.640
 I will leave him a little rested 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.320
 for them to render for then 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.250
 contracts so they are not too 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.370
 juicy in fact so I'm going to continue my 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.040
 preparing the beef and then I'm going 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.360
 prepare asparagus so the asparagus 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.360
 green to judge their freshness 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:43.660
 so if that's good 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.670
 why talk about asparagus have this 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:51.009
 party there and very stringy therefore it is 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:53.670
 Bourget garbage yard I'm going to put 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.619
 in a baking dish 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.490
 if I have butter in fact I put it either 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.040
 I put it in small pieces 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:05.850
 he founded anyway oven that 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:11.680
 under saddle and here I have fines and that 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.850
 I'm going to put it in the oven 175 celsius to 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.870
 about 15 minutes 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.430
 so in fact here I am serving with mashed potatoes 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.239
 sweet potatoes 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.560
 perfectly organic tinhan and the 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.900
 color I also put a little bit of 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:34.060
 carrots potatoes just for the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:36.219
 link so to do I do not forget 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:46.239
 to remove the string is not very 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:49.450
 nice to eat some string then 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.810
 I will serve but asparagus as a 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:58.239
 bed in fact how sensual it is I 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:01.689
 put the kid the pen on a bed and 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.549
 then served with a big hazelnut 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:11.349
