different from what they look now and

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.190 
different from what they look now and
they're<00:04:07.790> going<00:04:07.970> to<00:04:08.090> update<00:04:08.360> even<00:04:08.810> more<00:04:08.990> in<00:04:09.080> the

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
they're going to update even more in the

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.420 
they're going to update even more in the
next<00:04:09.320> 50<00:04:09.680> years<00:04:09.800> and<00:04:09.980> it's<00:04:10.070> gonna<00:04:10.190> be<00:04:10.280> even

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
next 50 years and it's gonna be even

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.090 
next 50 years and it's gonna be even
faster<00:04:10.850> so<00:04:11.390> you<00:04:11.900> know<00:04:12.200> in<00:04:12.290> 50<00:04:12.590> years<00:04:12.650> once

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
faster so you know in 50 years once

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.380 
faster so you know in 50 years once
again<00:04:13.340> everything's<00:04:13.940> going<00:04:14.150> to<00:04:14.240> be<00:04:14.360> different

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.669 
thing but it will be like
remote-controlled<00:05:35.879> it<00:05:36.089> will<00:05:36.239> be<00:05:36.389> manual<00:05:37.379> just

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:37.679 
remote-controlled it will be manual just

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:39.799 
remote-controlled it will be manual just
do<00:05:37.799> it's<00:05:37.949> drive<00:05:38.399> itself<00:05:38.789> in<00:05:39.089> and<00:05:39.269> it<00:05:39.389> will<00:05:39.539> it

00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:39.809 
do it's drive itself in and it will it

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:41.149 
do it's drive itself in and it will it
won't<00:05:39.929> get<00:05:40.110> in<00:05:40.199> car<00:05:40.379> crashes<00:05:40.649> and<00:05:40.979> it<00:05:41.039> will

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:41.159 
won't get in car crashes and it will

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:42.829 
won't get in car crashes and it will
limit<00:05:41.339> car<00:05:41.729> crashes<00:05:42.059> just<00:05:42.239> in<00:05:42.329> general<00:05:42.539> and

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:42.839 
limit car crashes just in general and

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:44.269 
limit car crashes just in general and
there<00:05:42.929> won't<00:05:42.989> be<00:05:43.139> as<00:05:43.259> many<00:05:43.409> every<00:05:43.769> year<00:05:44.099> so

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:44.279 
there won't be as many every year so

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.069 
there won't be as many every year so
there<00:05:44.399> are<00:05:44.429> positives<00:05:45.119> to<00:05:45.209> things<00:05:45.689> like<00:05:45.869> this

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:46.079 
there are positives to things like this

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:48.619 
there are positives to things like this
but<00:05:46.289> also<00:05:46.469> we<00:05:47.009> kind<00:05:47.219> of<00:05:47.279> lose<00:05:47.639> that<00:05:47.909> ability<00:05:48.059> of

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:48.629 
but also we kind of lose that ability of

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:49.969 
but also we kind of lose that ability of
controlling<00:05:49.229> things<00:05:49.409> ourself<00:05:49.589> and

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
controlling things ourself and

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:51.739 
controlling things ourself and
everything<00:05:50.309> kind<00:05:50.429> of<00:05:50.549> becomes<00:05:50.879> done<00:05:51.209> for<00:05:51.599> us

00:05:51.739 --> 00:05:51.749 
everything kind of becomes done for us

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:53.449 
everything kind of becomes done for us
which<00:05:52.049> isn't<00:05:52.409> necessarily<00:05:52.469> a<00:05:52.949> good<00:05:53.099> thing<00:05:53.159> at

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:53.459 
which isn't necessarily a good thing at

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:55.219 
which isn't necessarily a good thing at
all<00:05:53.489> but<00:05:54.179> you<00:05:54.419> see<00:05:54.659> this<00:05:54.779> in<00:05:54.929> a<00:05:54.989> lot<00:05:55.019> of

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
all but you see this in a lot of

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:56.449 
all but you see this in a lot of
different<00:05:55.319> things<00:05:55.619> like<00:05:55.979> like<00:05:56.219> I<00:05:56.309> said

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:56.459 
different things like like I said

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:58.249 
different things like like I said
driving<00:05:56.969> if<00:05:57.059> you<00:05:57.089> weren't<00:05:57.389> able<00:05:57.599> to<00:05:57.749> drive<00:05:58.079> I

00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 
driving if you weren't able to drive I

00:05:58.259 --> 00:05:59.600 
driving if you weren't able to drive I
feel<00:05:58.469> like<00:05:58.559> driving<00:05:59.039> is<00:05:59.129> actually<00:05:59.249> kind<00:05:59.579> of

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
feel like driving is actually kind of

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.279 
feel like driving is actually kind of
fun<00:05:59.789> driving<00:06:00.029> is<00:06:00.299> a<00:06:00.449> privilege<00:06:00.479> it's<00:06:01.049> a<00:06:01.109> fun

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
fun driving is a privilege it's a fun

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.619 
fun driving is a privilege it's a fun
thing<00:06:01.499> to<00:06:01.529> do<00:06:01.769> and<00:06:02.009> if<00:06:02.489> we<00:06:02.819> no<00:06:02.999> longer<00:06:03.029> drive

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:03.629 
thing to do and if we no longer drive

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:05.029 
thing to do and if we no longer drive
ourselves<00:06:03.809> places<00:06:04.499> then<00:06:04.679> you<00:06:04.859> know<00:06:04.919> we're

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
ourselves places then you know we're

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:06.439 
ourselves places then you know we're
just<00:06:05.069> becoming<00:06:05.399> more<00:06:05.519> and<00:06:05.789> more<00:06:05.909> lazy<00:06:06.209> as<00:06:06.419> a

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:06.449 
just becoming more and more lazy as a

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.329 
just becoming more and more lazy as a
society<00:06:06.899> so<00:06:07.319> if<00:06:07.499> you<00:06:07.589> look<00:06:07.709> at<00:06:07.799> it<00:06:07.829> both<00:06:08.009> sides

00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:08.339 
society so if you look at it both sides

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:10.309 
society so if you look at it both sides
that<00:06:08.609> maybe<00:06:08.789> car<00:06:09.479> crashes<00:06:09.929> there<00:06:10.019> won't<00:06:10.169> be<00:06:10.229> as

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 
that maybe car crashes there won't be as

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.079 
that maybe car crashes there won't be as
many<00:06:10.439> car<00:06:10.709> crashes<00:06:11.129> any<00:06:11.279> more<00:06:11.489> and<00:06:11.699> more

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:12.089 
many car crashes any more and more

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:14.449 
many car crashes any more and more
people<00:06:12.209> won't<00:06:12.839> die<00:06:13.049> from<00:06:13.349> things<00:06:13.619> every<00:06:14.129> year

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:14.459 
people won't die from things every year

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:15.919 
people won't die from things every year
but<00:06:14.609> at<00:06:14.699> the<00:06:14.789> same<00:06:14.939> time<00:06:15.119> we're<00:06:15.629> becoming

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:15.929 
but at the same time we're becoming

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:17.689 
but at the same time we're becoming
lazier<00:06:16.469> and<00:06:16.529> lazier<00:06:16.709> and<00:06:16.979> lazier<00:06:17.129> and<00:06:17.429> we're

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 
lazier and lazier and lazier and we're

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:20.299 
lazier and lazier and lazier and we're
not<00:06:17.819> being<00:06:18.149> in<00:06:18.419> control<00:06:18.479> of<00:06:19.169> things<00:06:19.499> as<00:06:19.829> much

00:06:20.299 --> 00:06:20.309 
not being in control of things as much

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:21.469 
not being in control of things as much
as<00:06:20.459> we<00:06:20.549> use<00:06:20.729> to<00:06:20.879> our<00:06:20.909> kind<00:06:21.239> of<00:06:21.299> letting

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
as we use to our kind of letting

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.779 
as we use to our kind of letting
technology<00:06:22.199> control<00:06:22.679> things<00:06:22.919> more<00:06:23.309> than<00:06:23.609> we

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
technology control things more than we

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:25.189 
technology control things more than we
