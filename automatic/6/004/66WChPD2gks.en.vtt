00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180
 I'll wave whimpering 97 and I'll talk about the nintendo or an inmate fight in which my 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.440
 last video had a picture like that 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.600
 Of course he left thinking but it was a photomontage because if it were not really 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.879
 I would talk about this 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.990
 what happens is that it is a video made by pablo belmonte arias aíco trailer that 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.120
 have made other videos like super mario galaxy vs super mario and universe 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.779
 festero and central among others what happens is that the video is not a Felix and 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.779
 not a complaint after he explained to them to start the video 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.159
 the plan 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.979
 sea 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.590
 m 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:57.689
 Weber will do that that's why that's for sure that he let him go through his mouth 

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:02.139
 What happened is that Pablo Belmonte did it as a complaint and an extract of what he said 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:07.009
 in e3 of 2005 I realized that the developers only care about 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:08.540
 good graphics and things 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.430
 for style but I wanted an innovation thinking that nintendo is the only 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.710
 exit that he wants to innovate do not look at it or as an end but as an airplane 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.430
 of innovation there is an urban legend that that was used 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.659
 ea to create luigi controls 

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:26.679
 well that's all for now I just tell them to have a good vacation and I 

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:30.529
 I'm working on a video of the kirk r-il game that for obvious reasons is not 

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:33.829
