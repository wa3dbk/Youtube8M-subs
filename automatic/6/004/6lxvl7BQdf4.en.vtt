coming in watch this here's one thing I

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.620

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
think should change so watch the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.440 
think should change so watch the
balloons<00:01:51.750> are<00:01:52.049> gonna<00:01:52.200> stop<00:01:52.560> right<00:01:53.270> wait<00:01:54.270> where

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
balloons are gonna stop right wait where

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.780 
balloons are gonna stop right wait where
do<00:01:54.509> they<00:01:54.600> stop<00:01:54.869> they're<00:01:55.229> coming<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.100> they

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
do they stop they're coming in and they

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.060 
do they stop they're coming in and they
stop<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.329> then<00:01:57.780> they<00:01:57.869> keep<00:01:58.079> going<00:01:58.439> now<00:01:58.829> that

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
stop and then they keep going now that

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.620 
stop and then they keep going now that
air<00:01:59.250> sweepers<00:01:59.670> exist<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.180> don't<00:02:00.420> think<00:02:00.570> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
air sweepers exist I don't think the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.999 
air sweepers exist I don't think the
balloon<00:02:00.899> should<00:02:01.140> stop<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.590> think<00:02:01.770> they<00:02:01.829> should

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
balloon should stop I think they should

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.880 
balloon should stop I think they should
have<00:02:02.040> kind<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.610> consistent<00:02:03.469> moving<00:02:04.469> motion

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
have kind of a consistent moving motion

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.130 
have kind of a consistent moving motion

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.460 
because then it's almost as if the air
sweepers<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:08.220> theirs<00:02:08.789> theirs

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470
