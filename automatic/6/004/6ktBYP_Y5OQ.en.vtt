00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
now because I've just jammed this out

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.990 
now because I've just jammed this out
using<00:01:23.060> a<00:01:23.300> hammer<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:24.560> then<00:01:24.920> we<00:01:25.100> can<00:01:25.250> just<00:01:25.400> pull

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
using a hammer and then we can just pull

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.710 
using a hammer and then we can just pull
it<00:01:26.060> out<00:01:26.560> there's<00:01:27.560> no<00:01:27.770> glue<00:01:28.010> in<00:01:28.250> this<00:01:28.370> one<00:01:28.600> so<00:01:29.600> it

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
it out there's no glue in this one so it

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.260 
it out there's no glue in this one so it
was<00:01:29.870> pretty<00:01:30.110> easy<00:01:30.350> to<00:01:30.500> do<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.030> when<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:32.120> look

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
was pretty easy to do and when you look

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.460 
was pretty easy to do and when you look
inside<00:01:33.160> you<00:01:34.160> can<00:01:34.190> see<00:01:34.520> that<00:01:34.930> it's<00:01:35.930> empty

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
inside you can see that it's empty

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.130 
inside you can see that it's empty
there's<00:01:36.650> nothing<00:01:37.040> in<00:01:37.130> there<00:01:37.310> so<00:01:37.970> if<00:01:38.930> we're

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
there's nothing in there so if we're

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.050 
there's nothing in there so if we're
going<00:01:39.290> to<00:01:39.410> play<00:01:39.590> something<00:01:40.040> in<00:01:40.130> here<00:01:40.370> make

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
going to play something in here make

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.090 
going to play something in here make
sure<00:01:41.300> that<00:01:41.450> what<00:01:41.660> you<00:01:41.810> get<00:01:42.020> is<00:01:42.200> this<00:01:42.380> expanding

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
sure that what you get is this expanding

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.250 
sure that what you get is this expanding
thing<00:01:43.310> you're<00:01:43.430> here<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:43.900> not<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:45.140> were

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
thing you're here and not the were

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.710 
thing you're here and not the were
screwed<00:01:45.620> side<00:01:45.830> point<00:01:46.130> oh<00:01:46.340> well<00:01:47.060> I<00:01:47.090> think<00:01:47.240> most

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
screwed side point oh well I think most

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.540 
screwed side point oh well I think most
lever<00:01:48.020> guards<00:01:48.409> has<00:01:48.920> this<00:01:49.100> expanding<00:01:49.700> thing<00:01:50.170> so

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
lever guards has this expanding thing so

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.950 
lever guards has this expanding thing so
we're<00:01:52.550> now<00:01:52.790> going<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.210> proceed<00:01:53.630> with<00:01:53.870> the

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
we're now going to proceed with the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.469 
we're now going to proceed with the
install<00:01:54.320> but<00:01:55.159> before<00:01:55.520> that<00:01:55.670> let<00:01:55.909> me<00:01:55.940> show<00:01:56.090> you

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.840 
install but before that let me show you
how<00:01:57.440> this<00:01:57.740> thing<00:01:57.800> works

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
how this thing works

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.960 
how this thing works
because<00:01:59.800> some<00:02:00.800> people<00:02:00.830> ask<00:02:01.280> so<00:02:01.490> how<00:02:01.700> do<00:02:01.760> you

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
because some people ask so how do you

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.240 
because some people ask so how do you
put<00:02:02.240> it<00:02:02.360> in<00:02:03.790> how<00:02:04.790> do<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:05.470> put<00:02:06.470> this<00:02:06.650> inside

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
put it in how do you put this inside

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.389 
put it in how do you put this inside

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
here and there's no connection and then

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.120 
here and there's no connection and then
as<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:10.909> can<00:02:11.060> see

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
as you can see

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.560 

you<00:02:13.280> try<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.610> put<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.690> in<00:02:15.190> like<00:02:16.190> that<00:02:16.570> it's

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
you try to put this in like that it's

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.840 
you try to put this in like that it's
there's<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.140> lot<00:02:18.170> of<00:02:18.380> space<00:02:18.590> there<00:02:18.830> this<00:02:19.640> is

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
there's a lot of space there this is

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.250 
there's a lot of space there this is
because<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.540> idea<00:02:20.690> is<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:22.220> thing<00:02:22.820> here<00:02:23.260> this

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
because the idea is this thing here this

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.310 
because the idea is this thing here this
screw<00:02:24.650> when<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.460> tighten<00:02:25.700> this<00:02:26.120> part<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:27.260> is

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
screw when you tighten this part this is

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.920 
screw when you tighten this part this is
going<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:27.860> go<00:02:28.010> down<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.520> this<00:02:29.360> is<00:02:29.480> going<00:02:29.780> to

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
going to go down and this is going to

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.950 
going to go down and this is going to
expand<00:02:30.440> was<00:02:30.980> this<00:02:31.190> is<00:02:31.820> going<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.150> force<00:02:32.750> this

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
expand was this is going to force this

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.930 
expand was this is going to force this
to<00:02:33.200> expand<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.100> that's<00:02:34.160> going<00:02:34.490> to<00:02:34.550> expand

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
to expand and that's going to expand

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.010 
to expand and that's going to expand
inside<00:02:35.210> your<00:02:35.990> handlebar<00:02:37.540> so<00:02:38.540> that's<00:02:38.750> how<00:02:38.900> it

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
inside your handlebar so that's how it

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.870 
inside your handlebar so that's how it
locks<00:02:39.260> up<00:02:39.440> now<00:02:39.890> for<00:02:40.220> this<00:02:40.340> one<00:02:40.580> there's

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
locks up now for this one there's

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.970 
locks up now for this one there's
another<00:02:41.120> piece<00:02:41.390> here<00:02:41.450> there's<00:02:42.290> going<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.740> give

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
another piece here there's going to give

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.880 
another piece here there's going to give
it<00:02:43.690> more<00:02:44.690> area<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.140> expand<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:47.290> that's<00:02:48.290> that's

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
it more area to expand and that's that's

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.360 
it more area to expand and that's that's
how<00:02:49.670> it's<00:02:49.880> going<00:02:50.090> to<00:02:50.300> work<00:02:50.330> now<00:02:51.340> take<00:02:52.340> note

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
how it's going to work now take note

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.160 
how it's going to work now take note
that<00:02:52.580> when<00:02:52.850> you're<00:02:53.000> doing<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.390> right<00:02:53.540> side<00:02:53.870> as

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
that when you're doing the right side as

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.900 
that when you're doing the right side as
you<00:02:54.320> can<00:02:54.380> see<00:02:54.620> my<00:02:54.770> bike<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.190> on<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.460> side<00:02:55.640> stand

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
you can see my bike is on the side stand

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.190 
you can see my bike is on the side stand
it's<00:02:56.630> angled<00:02:57.670> going<00:02:58.670> down<00:02:58.910> so<00:02:59.780> when<00:02:59.960> you<00:03:00.050> have

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
it's angled going down so when you have

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.810 
it's angled going down so when you have
this<00:03:00.290> extra<00:03:00.650> piece<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.100> you<00:03:01.160> do<00:03:01.310> this<00:03:01.520> it's

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
this extra piece and you do this it's

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.240 
this extra piece and you do this it's
not<00:03:02.510> tight<00:03:02.810> yet<00:03:02.840> it's<00:03:03.290> going<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.740> fall<00:03:03.980> into

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
not tight yet it's going to fall into

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.400 
not tight yet it's going to fall into
your<00:03:04.430> handlebar<00:03:05.030> so<00:03:05.660> that's<00:03:05.990> going<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.290> be<00:03:06.380> a

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
your handlebar so that's going to be a

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.560 
your handlebar so that's going to be a
bit<00:03:06.590> of<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:06.770> hassle<00:03:06.950> so<00:03:07.370> maybe<00:03:08.000> what<00:03:08.210> you<00:03:08.330> can<00:03:08.480> do

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
bit of a hassle so maybe what you can do

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.440 
bit of a hassle so maybe what you can do
is<00:03:09.070> take<00:03:10.070> your<00:03:10.250> bike<00:03:10.430> upright<00:03:11.170> or<00:03:13.090> bend<00:03:14.090> it<00:03:14.270> on

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
is take your bike upright or bend it on

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:24.850 
is take your bike upright or bend it on
the<00:03:14.630> other<00:03:14.840> side<00:03:21.790> so<00:03:22.790> that<00:03:22.820> it<00:03:23.330> can<00:03:23.630> be<00:03:23.810> a<00:03:24.050> bit

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
the other side so that it can be a bit

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.300 
the other side so that it can be a bit
flat<00:03:25.160> also<00:03:25.850> try<00:03:26.120> to<00:03:26.150> tighten<00:03:26.570> this<00:03:26.690> so<00:03:26.870> that

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
flat also try to tighten this so that

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.300 
flat also try to tighten this so that
try<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.370> tighten<00:03:28.730> this<00:03:28.820> already<00:03:29.120> so<00:03:30.040> this<00:03:31.040> one

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
try to tighten this already so this one

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.100 
try to tighten this already so this one
will<00:03:31.550> not<00:03:31.700> easily<00:03:32.090> fall<00:03:32.390> off<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:32.810> that<00:03:32.840> it

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
will not easily fall off so that it

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.170 
will not easily fall off so that it
would<00:03:33.290> just<00:03:33.470> try<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.220> bite<00:03:35.110> into<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.320> inner

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
would just try to bite into the inner

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.300 
would just try to bite into the inner
this<00:03:38.180> inner<00:03:38.480> piece<00:03:38.840> so<00:03:39.650> it<00:03:39.830> doesn't<00:03:40.130> fall<00:03:40.280> off

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
this inner piece so it doesn't fall off

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.610 
this inner piece so it doesn't fall off
so<00:03:40.730> I'm<00:03:41.240> going<00:03:41.600> to<00:03:41.660> start<00:03:41.870> tightening<00:03:42.260> this

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
so I'm going to start tightening this

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.199 
so I'm going to start tightening this
one<00:03:42.830> now<00:03:44.680> all<00:03:45.680> right<00:03:45.890> so<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.310> have<00:03:46.640> tightened

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
one now all right so I have tightened

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.410 
one now all right so I have tightened
this<00:03:48.110> piece<00:03:48.470> already<00:03:48.800> as<00:03:49.160> you<00:03:50.000> can<00:03:50.150> see<00:03:50.330> it<00:03:50.450> has

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
this piece already as you can see it has

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.010 
this piece already as you can see it has
expanded<00:03:53.420> a<00:03:53.720> bit<00:03:53.750> I<00:03:54.550> see<00:03:55.550> they're<00:03:55.820> trying<00:03:56.810> to

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
expanded a bit I see they're trying to

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.900 
expanded a bit I see they're trying to
expand<00:03:57.500> and<00:03:57.740> then<00:03:57.890> so<00:03:58.070> that<00:03:58.100> we<00:03:58.340> can<00:03:58.490> now<00:03:58.610> place

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
expand and then so that we can now place

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.949 
expand and then so that we can now place
this<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.300> it's<00:03:59.810> not<00:03:59.959> going<00:04:00.200> to<00:04:00.320> go<00:04:00.440> inside<00:04:00.860> now

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
this and it's not going to go inside now

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.360 
this and it's not going to go inside now
adding<00:04:02.959> very<00:04:03.200> important<00:04:03.800> warning<00:04:04.250> when

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
adding very important warning when

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.310 
adding very important warning when
you're<00:04:04.520> trying<00:04:04.700> to<00:04:04.850> place<00:04:05.150> something<00:04:05.390> on<00:04:05.690> your

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
you're trying to place something on your

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.810 
you're trying to place something on your
trowel<00:04:06.650> on<00:04:06.800> the<00:04:06.980> throttle<00:04:07.280> cable<00:04:07.459> on<00:04:07.700> the

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
trowel on the throttle cable on the

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.040 
trowel on the throttle cable on the
trial<00:04:08.060> side<00:04:08.650> because<00:04:10.120> what<00:04:11.120> we<00:04:11.300> don't<00:04:11.480> want<00:04:11.810> is

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
trial side because what we don't want is

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.949 
trial side because what we don't want is
this<00:04:12.290> that<00:04:13.130> when<00:04:13.400> we<00:04:13.430> put<00:04:13.820> this<00:04:13.940> here<00:04:14.360> it's

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
this that when we put this here it's

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.840 
this that when we put this here it's
going<00:04:15.170> to<00:04:15.320> hit<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.650> rubber<00:04:15.830> and<00:04:16.160> since<00:04:16.700> this

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
going to hit the rubber and since this

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.910 
going to hit the rubber and since this
is<00:04:17.000> going<00:04:17.180> to<00:04:17.270> be<00:04:17.359> a<00:04:17.390> fixed<00:04:17.630> piece<00:04:17.900> it's<00:04:18.440> going

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
is going to be a fixed piece it's going

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.030 
is going to be a fixed piece it's going
to<00:04:19.130> move<00:04:20.060> it's<00:04:20.900> going<00:04:21.200> to<00:04:21.290> be<00:04:21.410> scratching<00:04:21.710> this

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
to move it's going to be scratching this

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.530 
to move it's going to be scratching this
one<00:04:22.280> so<00:04:22.760> we're<00:04:22.910> going<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:23.180> have<00:04:23.390> some

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
one so we're going to have some

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.300 
one so we're going to have some
resistance<00:04:24.050> on<00:04:24.290> your<00:04:24.350> throttle<00:04:24.800> now<00:04:25.250> you

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
resistance on your throttle now you

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.980 
resistance on your throttle now you
don't<00:04:25.640> want<00:04:25.820> that<00:04:25.910> to<00:04:25.970> happen<00:04:26.300> you<00:04:26.510> want

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
don't want that to happen you want

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.320 
don't want that to happen you want
some<00:04:27.199> space<00:04:27.410> on<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.830> because<00:04:28.550> you<00:04:29.030> don't<00:04:29.180> want

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
some space on it because you don't want

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.029 
some space on it because you don't want
it<00:04:29.630> to<00:04:29.780> lock<00:04:29.960> up<00:04:30.169> now<00:04:30.410> I<00:04:31.099> don't<00:04:31.160> know<00:04:31.630> why<00:04:33.039> the

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
it to lock up now I don't know why the

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.270 
it to lock up now I don't know why the
space<00:04:34.430> on<00:04:34.669> this<00:04:34.849> one<00:04:35.090> is<00:04:35.240> just<00:04:35.509> this<00:04:35.720> much

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
space on this one is just this much

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.790 
space on this one is just this much
while<00:04:37.280> on<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:37.669> other<00:04:37.819> side<00:04:38.180> on<00:04:38.479> the<00:04:39.349> left<00:04:39.590> side

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
while on the other side on the left side

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.240 
while on the other side on the left side
where<00:04:40.220> there's<00:04:40.520> some<00:04:40.699> throttle<00:04:42.099> there's<00:04:43.099> a

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
where there's some throttle there's a

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.730 
where there's some throttle there's a
big<00:04:43.430> gap<00:04:43.639> I<00:04:43.930> don't<00:04:44.930> know<00:04:44.990> maybe<00:04:45.199> we<00:04:45.530> should

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
big gap I don't know maybe we should

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.010 
big gap I don't know maybe we should
have<00:04:45.919> a<00:04:45.949> bigger<00:04:46.250> gap<00:04:46.520> here<00:04:46.910> on<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.660> travel

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
have a bigger gap here on the travel

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.350 
have a bigger gap here on the travel
side<00:04:48.229> rather<00:04:49.099> than<00:04:49.280> this<00:04:49.490> one<00:04:49.729> because<00:04:49.940> all

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
side rather than this one because all

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.629 
side rather than this one because all
this<00:04:50.599> thing<00:04:50.870> does<00:04:51.050> is<00:04:51.259> nothing<00:04:51.650> just<00:04:51.860> hold<00:04:52.490> on

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
this thing does is nothing just hold on

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.640 
this thing does is nothing just hold on
to<00:04:52.789> it<00:04:52.910> you<00:04:52.940> don't<00:04:53.180> turn<00:04:53.360> it<00:04:53.569> and<00:04:54.440> you<00:04:54.470> have

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
to it you don't turn it and you have

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.499 
to it you don't turn it and you have
that<00:04:54.800> much<00:04:54.979> space<00:04:58.030> also<00:04:59.030> another<00:04:59.210> thing

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
that much space also another thing

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:01.450 
that much space also another thing
you're<00:04:59.750> trying<00:04:59.870> to<00:05:00.110> put<00:05:00.289> something<00:05:00.590> here<00:05:00.800> so

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
you're trying to put something here so

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.210 
you're trying to put something here so
since<00:05:01.789> the<00:05:01.940> idea<00:05:02.090> is<00:05:02.509> this<00:05:03.349> metal<00:05:03.889> piece<00:05:04.039> is

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
since the idea is this metal piece is

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.680 
since the idea is this metal piece is
going<00:05:04.400> to<00:05:04.520> expand<00:05:04.909> it's<00:05:05.060> going<00:05:05.330> to<00:05:05.449> apply<00:05:05.659> some

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
going to expand it's going to apply some

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.610 
going to expand it's going to apply some
pressure<00:05:05.900> on<00:05:06.470> your<00:05:07.400> tube<00:05:07.720> so<00:05:08.720> you<00:05:08.780> don't<00:05:09.349> want

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
pressure on your tube so you don't want

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.559 
pressure on your tube so you don't want
to<00:05:09.770> apply<00:05:10.009> too<00:05:10.069> much<00:05:10.310> pressure<00:05:10.669> that<00:05:10.880> the

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:11.569 
to apply too much pressure that the

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:13.210 
to apply too much pressure that the
inner<00:05:11.780> tube<00:05:12.080> would<00:05:12.259> expand<00:05:12.680> because<00:05:13.009> that's

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
inner tube would expand because that's

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.589 
inner tube would expand because that's
going<00:05:13.370> to<00:05:13.460> make<00:05:13.520> your<00:05:13.810> throttle<00:05:14.810> movement<00:05:16.599> a

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
going to make your throttle movement a

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.279 
going to make your throttle movement a
bit<00:05:19.240> this<00:05:20.240> will<00:05:20.449> restrain<00:05:20.810> the<00:05:20.990> throttle

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
bit this will restrain the throttle

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.890 
bit this will restrain the throttle
movement<00:05:21.409> and<00:05:22.000> you<00:05:23.000> might<00:05:23.180> get<00:05:23.509> your<00:05:23.539> shuttle

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
movement and you might get your shuttle

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.339 
movement and you might get your shuttle
to<00:05:24.500> lock<00:05:24.650> up<00:05:24.889> so<00:05:25.130> I'm<00:05:25.849> going<00:05:26.360> to<00:05:26.389> do<00:05:26.990> this<00:05:27.139> now

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
to lock up so I'm going to do this now

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:31.330 
to lock up so I'm going to do this now
and<00:05:27.560> what<00:05:28.250> I'm<00:05:28.340> going<00:05:28.550> to<00:05:28.699> do<00:05:28.909> is<00:05:29.620> not<00:05:30.620> to<00:05:30.650> not

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
and what I'm going to do is not to not

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.219 
and what I'm going to do is not to not
is<00:05:31.639> to<00:05:31.940> give<00:05:32.150> it<00:05:32.300> a<00:05:32.389> little<00:05:32.539> space<00:05:32.810> like<00:05:33.050> this

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
is to give it a little space like this

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:38.740 
is to give it a little space like this
and<00:05:34.060> so<00:05:35.060> that<00:05:35.090> I<00:05:35.620> won't<00:05:36.620> have<00:05:37.570> restrain<00:05:38.570> the

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
and so that I won't have restrain the

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.990 
and so that I won't have restrain the
trolley<00:05:39.020> or<00:05:39.289> just<00:05:40.250> give<00:05:40.520> it<00:05:40.610> a<00:05:40.669> little<00:05:40.820> more

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
trolley or just give it a little more

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.060 
trolley or just give it a little more
like<00:05:41.360> that<00:05:41.570> I<00:05:41.780> think<00:05:42.560> that<00:05:42.680> should<00:05:42.830> be<00:05:42.860> good

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
like that I think that should be good

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.939 
like that I think that should be good
enough<00:05:43.870> I'm<00:05:44.870> going<00:05:45.139> I'm<00:05:45.259> going<00:05:45.320> to<00:05:45.500> do<00:05:45.560> that<00:05:45.710> by

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
enough I'm going I'm going to do that by

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:54.310 
enough I'm going I'm going to do that by
turning<00:05:46.789> this<00:05:47.080> until<00:05:48.080> it<00:05:48.199> locks<00:05:48.349> up<00:05:53.110> okay<00:05:54.110> guys

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
turning this until it locks up okay guys

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.439 
turning this until it locks up okay guys
my<00:05:54.680> lever<00:05:54.949> guard<00:05:55.280> is<00:05:55.400> now<00:05:55.520> installed<00:05:55.940> now<00:05:56.210> let

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
my lever guard is now installed now let

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:58.209 
my lever guard is now installed now let
me<00:05:56.599> just<00:05:56.930> do<00:05:57.110> a<00:05:57.169> quick<00:05:57.229> review<00:05:57.590> of<00:05:57.800> this<00:05:58.039> item

00:05:58.209 --> 00:05:58.219 
me just do a quick review of this item

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:02.680 
me just do a quick review of this item
so<00:05:59.210> I<00:05:59.659> got<00:06:00.199> this<00:06:00.639> four<00:06:01.639> thousand<00:06:02.330> five<00:06:02.479> hundred

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
so I got this four thousand five hundred

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:11.249 
so I got this four thousand five hundred
pesos<00:06:03.280> which<00:06:04.280> is<00:06:04.550> around<00:06:07.599> 20<00:06:08.599> 30<00:06:09.520> $30<00:06:10.520> I<00:06:10.759> think

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
pesos which is around 20 30 $30 I think

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:15.580 
pesos which is around 20 30 $30 I think
or<00:06:12.259> something<00:06:12.830> more<00:06:13.520> and<00:06:14.080> this<00:06:15.080> is<00:06:15.259> pretty

or something more and this is pretty

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.629 
or something more and this is pretty
okay<00:06:15.830> when<00:06:16.400> you<00:06:16.520> look<00:06:16.729> at<00:06:16.880> it<00:06:18.219> at<00:06:19.219> least<00:06:19.490> it's

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 
okay when you look at it at least it's

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:22.629 
okay when you look at it at least it's
in<00:06:19.729> the<00:06:19.849> red<00:06:20.060> color<00:06:20.830> there's<00:06:21.830> some<00:06:22.069> aluminum

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 
in the red color there's some aluminum

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:23.320 
in the red color there's some aluminum
port<00:06:22.909> here

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
port here

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.080 
port here
that's<00:06:24.050> a<00:06:24.139> nice<00:06:24.289> finish<00:06:24.680> and<00:06:25.310> it<00:06:25.430> comes<00:06:25.789> with

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
that's a nice finish and it comes with

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.420 
that's a nice finish and it comes with
extra<00:06:26.569> but<00:06:27.560> shorter<00:06:28.389> guards<00:06:29.389> now<00:06:30.110> the<00:06:31.039> problem

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
extra but shorter guards now the problem

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.309 
extra but shorter guards now the problem
with<00:06:31.550> this<00:06:31.669> one<00:06:31.909> is<00:06:31.940> this<00:06:32.389> is<00:06:32.659> a<00:06:32.719> temporary

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 
with this one is this is a temporary

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:37.510 
with this one is this is a temporary
part<00:06:33.860> for<00:06:34.130> my<00:06:34.280> monster<00:06:35.089> and<00:06:35.330> until<00:06:36.229> I<00:06:36.520> find

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
part for my monster and until I find

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.580 
part for my monster and until I find
something<00:06:38.029> good<00:06:38.210> enough<00:06:38.479> here<00:06:39.190> because

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
something good enough here because

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.570 
something good enough here because
even<00:06:41.520> though<00:06:41.640> this<00:06:41.820> is<00:06:42.000> metal<00:06:42.800> this<00:06:43.800> the<00:06:44.370> most

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
even though this is metal this the most

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.740 
even though this is metal this the most
important<00:06:45.060> part<00:06:45.240> is<00:06:46.160> your<00:06:47.160> dad<00:06:47.510> that<00:06:48.510> is

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
important part is your dad that is

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.130 
important part is your dad that is
plastic<00:06:49.820> like<00:06:50.820> the<00:06:50.970> plastic<00:06:51.210> my<00:06:51.600> dog<00:06:51.870> just

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:52.140 
plastic like the plastic my dog just

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.620 
plastic like the plastic my dog just
