wasn't feeling well that I also went to

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.660 
wasn't feeling well that I also went to
a<00:00:51.989> concert<00:00:52.260> which<00:00:52.620> honestly<00:00:52.829> did<00:00:53.219> not<00:00:53.250> help<00:00:53.520> my

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
a concert which honestly did not help my

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.330 
a concert which honestly did not help my
voice<00:00:53.910> at<00:00:54.120> all<00:00:54.410> but<00:00:55.410> there's<00:00:55.739> nothing<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.280> can

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.139 
that guess the problem with that is that
I<00:01:51.960> don't<00:01:52.110> necessarily<00:01:52.350> get<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.520> will<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
I don't necessarily get it will be the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.420 
I don't necessarily get it will be the
show<00:01:54.360> later<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.140> know<00:01:55.229> like<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.920> then

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
show later on I know like like then

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.190 
show later on I know like like then
we'll<00:01:56.579> be<00:01:56.729> advanced<00:01:57.299> media's<00:01:57.659> like<00:01:57.780> making<00:01:58.140> a

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
we'll be advanced media's like making a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.600 
we'll be advanced media's like making a
game<00:01:58.380> or<00:01:58.560> something<00:01:58.920> for<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.219> but<00:01:59.460> that's

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
pretty cool so um other than that I do

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.309 
pretty cool so um other than that I do

like poking battle a lot um I do I think

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:06.360 
like poking battle a lot um I do I think
it<00:05:02.500> will<00:05:02.560> overtake<00:05:03.039> smogon<00:05:03.550> I<00:05:04.650> don't<00:05:05.650> think<00:05:06.099> so

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
it will overtake smogon I don't think so

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.950 
it will overtake smogon I don't think so
i<00:05:06.550> think<00:05:06.610> it's<00:05:07.029> just<00:05:07.120> because<00:05:07.389> there's<00:05:07.719> so

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960

max<00:07:36.270> you<00:07:36.450> know<00:07:36.570> i<00:07:36.630> think<00:07:36.690> there's<00:07:36.990> one<00:07:37.080> more

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380 
max you know i think there's one more

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.840 
max you know i think there's one more
turn<00:07:37.620> after<00:07:37.800> this<00:07:38.010> because<00:07:38.280> he<00:07:38.400> ran<00:07:38.610> out<00:07:38.820> of

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:38.850 
turn after this because he ran out of

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.440 
turn after this because he ran out of
her<00:07:39.030> covers<00:07:39.620> and<00:07:40.620> like<00:07:41.010> yeah<00:07:41.430> this<00:07:41.880> is<00:07:42.180> poised

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:42.450 
her covers and like yeah this is poised

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:47.260 
her covers and like yeah this is poised
install<00:07:42.960> was<00:07:43.830> like<00:07:44.100> ah<00:07:45.050> it<00:07:46.050> was<00:07:46.170> like<00:07:46.350> brutal

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:47.270 
install was like ah it was like brutal

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.200 
install was like ah it was like brutal
so<00:07:48.270> yeah<00:07:48.450> well<00:07:48.780> i<00:07:48.810> think<00:07:49.110> it's<00:07:49.320> one<00:07:49.620> more<00:07:49.770> turn

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:50.210 
so yeah well i think it's one more turn

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.430 
so yeah well i think it's one more turn
because<00:07:51.210> he<00:07:51.360> actually<00:07:51.480> runs<00:07:51.900> out<00:07:52.020> of<00:07:52.050> recover

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:52.440 
because he actually runs out of recover

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.959 
because he actually runs out of recover
so<00:07:52.770> all<00:07:52.950> I<00:07:53.010> can<00:07:53.100> do<00:07:53.370> is<00:07:53.400> go<00:07:53.730> for

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:53.969 
so all I can do is go for

00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:56.299 
so all I can do is go for
I<00:07:53.999> speed<00:07:54.360> and<00:07:54.599> there<00:07:55.259> you<00:07:55.439> go<00:07:55.649> there's<00:07:56.009> the

00:07:56.299 --> 00:07:56.309 
I speed and there you go there's the

00:07:56.309 --> 00:08:00.829 
I speed and there you go there's the
game<00:07:56.549> 65<00:07:57.389> terms<00:07:57.779> turns<00:07:58.769> a<00:07:59.039> pure<00:07:59.610> stall<00:08:00.299> it<00:08:00.659> was
