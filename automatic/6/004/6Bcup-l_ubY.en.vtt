00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.620
 Hi, I'm the gem of the jar of ideas and 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.820
 what are we going to do today is something 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.130
 very simple to use our hands to 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.010
 make a box like this without 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.380
 glue and also with a 5 or 6 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.600
 folds we're going to get we do about 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:26.010
 to put a card and little more 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:28.060
 we started to put together 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.250
 to begin with what we are going to do is 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.619
 longitudinal fold right in the center 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.720
 of paper and now what we do is 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.280
 another line perpendicular to the one that does not 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.280
 be initially towards the other side 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.220
 this 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.520
 what we are going to do now is decorate it 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.250
 We're going to put a label on it a little bit 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.850
 metal with the name of the person who 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.850
 let's give 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.130
 and we are also going to mark where we are going to 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.130
 put a bow on top of the label 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.469
 for this we are going to use this 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.700
 tool that is a die cutter 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:25.030
 taking as a guide the marquitas that 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.030
 we have done 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.280
 on the chest 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.360
 and then what we are going to do is 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.580
 place the bow the most fun is 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.900
 that everyone uses their creativity to 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.800
 do it as you like 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.800
 good 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.460
 and you already have your prologue presented 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.460
 it looks like a chulada 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:21.380
 the envelope is very resultÃ³n and super easy 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.989
 to do deployments in the half minute 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.989
 you have made a couple of envelopes 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.379
 and now what we are going to do is a 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.359
 greeting card or a card 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:38.459
 of the client that we want to express to you 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:38.459
 our gratitude whatever you want 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.180
 to decorate anything we put a bow 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.549
 and a little bit of sealing so that 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.379
 give a touch as well as an old one 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.709
 label you want too are very 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.709
 cool 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.709
 two 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.209
 Well, you have already seen that it is a 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.209
 cent and I work with our hands and 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.640
 that with four or five basic ideas 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.769
 you can do things people encourage you to 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.700
 that you use your hands and head 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.700
 to create
