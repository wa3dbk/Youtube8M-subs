00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
because he has been by himself for the

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.789 
because he has been by himself for the

last few years he has actually trained

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.210 
last few years he has actually trained
himself<00:03:37.130> to<00:03:37.790> be<00:03:37.940> stronger<00:03:38.840> because<00:03:39.319> being<00:03:39.889> by

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
himself to be stronger because being by

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.129 
himself to be stronger because being by
himself<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:40.970> not<00:03:41.120> relying<00:03:41.540> on<00:03:41.720> others

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
himself and not relying on others

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.620 
himself and not relying on others
allowed<00:03:42.739> him<00:03:42.980> to<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.579> use<00:03:43.760> his<00:03:43.910> full<00:03:44.150> potential

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
allowed him to to use his full potential

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.509
