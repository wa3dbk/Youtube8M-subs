Direct live videos where they showed off

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.980 
Direct live videos where they showed off
all<00:00:11.130> their<00:00:11.280> new<00:00:11.429> stuff<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:11.940> like<00:00:12.059> news<00:00:12.300> which

all their new stuff and like news which

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.390

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
they do from time to time and I still

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.829 
they do from time to time and I still
think<00:00:14.549> it's<00:00:14.639> an<00:00:14.700> incredibly<00:00:15.089> awkward<00:00:15.299> way<00:00:15.660> of

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
think it's an incredibly awkward way of

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.140 
think it's an incredibly awkward way of
delivering<00:00:16.350> things<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.279> people<00:00:17.400> but<00:00:17.820> that's

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
delivering things to people but that's

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.580 
delivering things to people but that's
besides<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.660> point<00:00:18.750> what<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> big<00:00:19.410> deal<00:00:19.529> is

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
besides the point what the big deal is

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.230 
besides the point what the big deal is
is<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.949> amount<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.250> titles<00:00:20.640> announced<00:00:21.060> for

DMC<00:02:18.370> which<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.760> thought<00:02:18.909> was<00:02:19.060> going<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.209> be<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
DMC which I thought was going to be the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.720 
DMC which I thought was going to be the
biggest<00:02:19.659> Devil<00:02:19.989> May<00:02:20.080> Cry<00:02:20.110> game<00:02:20.680> turned<00:02:21.519> out<00:02:21.610> to

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
biggest Devil May Cry game turned out to

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.030 
biggest Devil May Cry game turned out to
be<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:22.150> least<00:02:22.659> selling<00:02:23.200> that<00:02:23.409> is<00:02:23.530> also<00:02:23.769> behind

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
be the least selling that is also behind

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.339 
be the least selling that is also behind
Devil<00:02:24.430> May<00:02:24.549> Cry<00:02:24.580> 4<00:02:24.760> which<00:02:25.330> did<00:02:25.659> really<00:02:25.900> bad<00:02:26.080> -

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
Devil May Cry 4 which did really bad -

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.670 
Devil May Cry 4 which did really bad -
so<00:02:26.950> like<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:28.360> maybe<00:02:28.510> rebooting<00:02:29.080> franchise<00:02:29.500> is

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
so like so maybe rebooting franchise is

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.110 
so like so maybe rebooting franchise is
