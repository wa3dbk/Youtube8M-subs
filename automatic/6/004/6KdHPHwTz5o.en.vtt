00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.000
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.750
 me 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:49.400
 And surely remove the alkali but big cause I'm alkali 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:55.970
 But I also want to enjoy curls and straights 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:01:00.540
 I wanted to make a medicine that is kind to my hair, but I have a pawy wa this time this time 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:05.760
 It does not contain buying there Kedomo I was asked to not made, the following items 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:14.400
 Because you have the power, you can strike without choice amis 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:20.530
 It is weakly acidic at a harbor 6.8 and the concentration of reductant is quite high at 100%. 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:25.380
 Because of this, the time for proper reduction is long and no overtime, and anyone fails 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.380
 It is also a point that can be operated without 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:43.740
 The and pour I think that there is a swell toward a little bit of the root 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:52.399
 This time's style is bob style so it feels soft without pats 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:52.399
 I 'm going to finish I will put on a home em c type treatment agent overall 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:02.119
 Because it is a diffusive type 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.119
 The point is that the application amount is to be applied firmly 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.490
 Please open firmly about 2 cm at the same base as normal straight 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:18.550
 As it is weakly acidic, we don't do anything, so we wrap a small rod 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:23.560
 It is ok if there is a curl of 1.5 times 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:28.910
 Get used to it is recommended that you check the curl check 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:33.490
 The point is to put a little longer compared to the alkaline type 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:36.590
 I'm going to flush this child because the curl of 1.5 times is out 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:41.890
 Because I want to flush the medicine well 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.890
 I will make a weekly recommendation at carbonated spring 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:50.840
 I will put in the hair and put in the iron 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:57.880
 If the root habit is strong , take slices 5 mm apart 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:03:04.120
 I will let the hair end Malay while opening the tension with the iron of the setting of 200 degrees 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:07.610
 We tend to worry about protein denaturation by processing at high temperature, but we incline hair to alkali 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:13.880
 You can reduce the damage because it is not 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:20.170
 Station or to Brom 3 type will continue to top the of after the normal from the roots to the hair tips 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.170
 That person is because can be applied to the speedy compared to the clean type 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.080
 me 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:54.640
 I think that the amount of hair is also a type of song that is easy to open 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:56.310
 It is the establishment of this time, but the direction of the root is made straight immediately and the curl is put on the direction of the hair . 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.849
 I think 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:05.180
 Since the treatment rest reduction power decreases , the salphite tofu which has reduction power 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:11.090
 I will go 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:13.599
 Model's hair end is high damage now , so this time is divided into time being the root and hair end 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.599
 To go 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:23.479
 A the base was allowed to stand for 15 minutes after you finished de towards the bristles 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.479
 We will apply 1 solution 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:40.070
 With the oil after the intermediate washing hair with carbonated spring 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.070
 I'm in a state where I have talked about it 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.990
 cmc We will wind with tofu anion rod 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.650
 Oh it will continue always the two liquids of bromine 3 type was applied 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:44.620
 Separately from good compatibility ingredients that methyl Loughton contained in Seibu as characteristic 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:51.460
 You can achieve a glossy and moist finish 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:59.440
 I was changed to a no alkaline type of system from before about six months, but customers also next time 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:06:04.610
 Without the bristles of Gois and Pasa have gotten to very satisfied with the state it was in when you visit 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:07.240
 I really study to stretch and change my style 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.240
