00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.590
 practiced 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.590
 Direct start of a three-phase asynchronous motor 

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:12.539
 Direct starting is one of the ways to start induction motors 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:13.380
 three-phase 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.849
 defeat in short 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.679
 this form of start-up is usually used to kill for engines of 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:21.789
 small power 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.130
 an engine starts directly when its tension hinges are applied to the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.619
 who must work 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.659
 when it connects directly to the network 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:32.860
 this connection 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.840
 It is done through a contact 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.569
 a contact is a device intended to close and open 

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:41.610
 electric circuits 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.969
 in this case it is an electromagnetic contact 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.850
 in which the efforts 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.150
 are supplied by an electromagnet 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.840
 if you join contact but the technician 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.960
 septien awaits engine 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.370
 which has as a function 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.500
 Motor protection against overloads 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.500
 however there are different forms of direct attack 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.570
 the operation of the direct network 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.170
 Dexter coupling circuits are based on command and power 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.770
 the power circuit 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.690
 performance of the power circuit 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.680
 the order of the phrases that the circuit powers this king and what 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.829
 made peace avoid those that join the command circuit 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.560
 When the current reaches the circuit, the magnetothermic switch is a 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.570
 electromagnet causes the contacts of a motor to close 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.170
 The function of the magnetothermic switch 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.170
 is to protect the circuit against snowfall intensities 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.179
 as previously mentioned 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.419
 The motor guard consists of contacts and a thermal relay 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.210
 the thermal cd of the motor guard 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.750
 It is composed of metal sheets 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.820
 to increase the intensity of the current 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.190
 that circulates through them deform 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.340
 to step on the contact siller of the thermal king protects the engine against 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.200
 overloads 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.010
 If the material already on the right 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.350
 the contacts from the left open 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.109
 and those on the right close 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:10.179
 to allow the passage of the current 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.179
 and that the motor mount in this sense 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.849
 these contacts are in parallel 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:22.489
 to reverse the direction of rotation of the engine would be enough to change two of the 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.489
 you agree keeping the rest in the initial position 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:28.889
 in the case of the circuit 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:32.619
 that is observed on the screen the phases that are changed are the pillar 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.109
 the control circuit 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.110
 the functions of the control circuit 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.529
 single stop 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:41.559
 start-up the engine 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:44.129
 and the reversal of the engine turn 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.189
 the operation of the control circuit is as follows 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.849
 if we want the motor to turn to the right we will press the marten button 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:53.789
 right 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:57.079
 in the figure indicated with the initials p mtv 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.430
 this causes the running 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.459
 of contact will govern the right 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.369
 with the initials ka md 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:06.350
 Likewise 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.540
 the kmt 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.119
 Feedback 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:12.979
 which are parallel to the right-hand drive button are 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:14.939
 closes 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.439
 the newly opened contact element 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.609
 indicated with the initials in it 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.979
 closes when pressing the marten button on the right 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:24.509
 p on the cd 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:28.059
 and the normally closed contact element opens 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:30.709
 in this 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.019
 allows to open the contact of tour of the right k mb 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.609
 and that the current can pass through the circuit 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.609
 therefore the motor turn to the right 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:46.239
 To carry out the reversal of the turn, the following will be done 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:48.030
 first 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.799
 the left drive button is pressed 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.479
 pmi 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:56.169
 the gypsy in this way the contact will rule from the left 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.439
 kmi 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:02.889
 then the ska emery the feedback that are found 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.889
 parallel with the left push button 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:12.219
 normally closed contact element indicated with the eps with the initials n 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.219
 anf encloses accuses the push button of the left 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.169
 and the normally closed contact element opens 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.949
 indeed 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.580
 this allows the alderman contact on the left to open 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.780
 km 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.270
 and therefore makes the financial engine go bankrupt 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.620
 finally to stop the engine 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.550
 he got one of the two stop buttons 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.940
 ppi soc 1 p dv are all 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.529
 causing the opening of the circuit understand the arrest of this 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:44.449
 finally the engine will stop
