00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.759
 hi there, this is Nikita and in this video I 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.480
 I will show you various ways 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.269
 for you monkey quang oslo it will be all 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.280
 the ways that I know I use and if 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.560
 you will have some other way which 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.510
 I will not show in this video write it in 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.320
 describe the comments you will not 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.080
 it is interesting to know him and so let's 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.090
 let's start 1 way as always to start 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.840
 you need to throw either a giant or hogov 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.449
 to lure out 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.300
 I picked up the clan castle 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.160
 base for video which has a clan castle 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.530
 next to the thief so that the army could 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.480
 barter faster and so the video does not last long 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.370
 tighten up here I used two giants 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.039
 we are looking for the closest head 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.789
 building to the planned troops send 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.250
 there archer 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:55.320
 or barbarian there is no difference how you want 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.300
 they all go there and when you are riding 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.460
 competition is very important that all were in 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.309
 one bunch of one group and this is the most 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.040
 easy way to just throw it stupidly 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.510
 lightning and mages that you have not achieved 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.060
 finish two or three 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.369
 archer me or in this case 4 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.000
 second way how to trick out a column with 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.920
 balls 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.270
 as I said, you can just as well 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.390
 use hogs but if radius 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.640
 the actions of the horse castle is located behind 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.990
 outside the outer walls the base is better 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.350
 use giants because their 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.930
 more life i usually need two hogs 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.610
 to lure the race with all very 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.049
 very rare that one hook lure 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.200
 all and every time in each example is necessary 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.049
 lure warriors from a wrought-iron castle 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.780
 out and the first ball will leave bad 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.910
 here is the second ball I will kill all the troops for 1 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.850
 so the third way how to kill a race with 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:00.470
 gods according to the standard scheme we throw 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.720
 giant and best spouse and always when 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.240
 you kill the clan castle not schoolgirls 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.560
 how do i get the shackled lock better with me 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.920
 didn't show it because it's boring 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.330
 and all this is already thinking, and this is how it understands 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.850
 when lure out your column 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.680
 students need to surround or build 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.290
 such a line and urgency to divert 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.920
 attention mages while attention can 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.440
 the earpiece is turned on magicians my magicians will kill him 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.540
 Mages and so I will not show 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.300
 the process itself and you monkey it is already 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.760
 it becomes monotonous and boring now 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.080
 we will kill the Kosovo valkyries clan 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.680
 This example I got it 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.780
 bad very bad you should this 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.480
 get better again distract attention 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.870
 magicians and better sleep my archers and 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.820
 Valkyrie kill all for one or two times 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.370
 the next way is to kill the combination lock 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.320
 summer army of him dragon throw 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.000
 dragon from behind and he must all 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.710
 once or twice kill as well as valkyrie 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.720
 but I do not advise you to use it 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.480
 because the dragon is ranked 25th and 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.700
 if the best magicians kill him then you just 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.590
 just spent 25th place in their 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.900
 camp that is, do not do that 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.120
 and the very last way I'll show you 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.280
 how to barter and kill quang weaken we 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.400
 before landing the witch first 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.200
 put a few barbarians or dinner with 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.660
 front so she had time to do 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.470
 skeletons and war prone castle not 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.270
 began to shoot right out like this 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.060
 here 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.920
 and at this point I will finish the video with everything 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.540
 thank you so much for watching up 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.540
 next video and bye
