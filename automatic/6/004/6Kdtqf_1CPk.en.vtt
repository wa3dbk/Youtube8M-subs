hey there again everyone um yesterday I
released<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.640> video<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:06.170> i<00:00:07.170> created<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.859> diamond

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
released a video and i created a diamond

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.030 
released a video and i created a diamond
generator<00:00:08.580> which<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.030> right<00:00:09.210> here<00:00:10.040> John

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
generator which is right here John

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.070 
generator which is right here John
diamond<00:00:11.309> generator<00:00:11.730> used<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.570> lot<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.929> things

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
diamond generator used a lot of things

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.570 
diamond generator used a lot of things
if<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.440> want<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.679> know<00:00:13.769> how<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:13.950> works<00:00:14.160> check

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
if you want to know how it works check

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.710 
if you want to know how it works check
out<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:14.849> video<00:00:14.969> um<00:00:16.699> but<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.210> just<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.570> way

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
out that video um but this is just a way

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.080 
out that video um but this is just a way
I<00:00:19.080> also<00:00:19.439> started<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> way<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.760> said

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
I also started on the way this is I said

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.359 
I also started on the way this is I said
it<00:00:21.210> would<00:00:21.330> work<00:00:21.480> for<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> Tekkit<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.710> as<00:00:23.279> you

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
it would work for a Tekkit and as you

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.740 
it would work for a Tekkit and as you
can<00:00:23.460> see<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.609> threw<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:23.970> bunch<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.300> tests<00:00:24.600> down

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
can see I threw a bunch of tests down

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.210 
can see I threw a bunch of tests down
here<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.170> there<00:00:25.380> used<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.680> be<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.830> few<00:00:26.039> pipes

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
here and there used to be a few pipes

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.830 
here and there used to be a few pipes
here<00:00:26.400> i'm<00:00:26.609> chaining<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.300> up<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.599> it's<00:00:27.750> not

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
here i'm chaining it up and it's not

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.650 
here i'm chaining it up and it's not
working<00:00:27.960> i<00:00:28.320> gots<00:00:29.039> insertion<00:00:29.670> pipe<00:00:29.849> here<00:00:30.240> which

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
working i gots insertion pipe here which

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.020 
working i gots insertion pipe here which
I'm<00:00:31.320> not<00:00:31.500> really<00:00:31.650> testing<00:00:32.099> as<00:00:32.219> more<00:00:32.460> see<00:00:32.910> how

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
I'm not really testing as more see how

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.090 
I'm not really testing as more see how
it<00:00:33.149> works<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.660> seems<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.960> work<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.890> same

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
it works and it seems to work the same

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.709 
it works and it seems to work the same
i'm<00:00:35.370> still<00:00:35.730> fiddling<00:00:36.000> with<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.390> trying<00:00:36.660> to

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
i'm still fiddling with that trying to

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.200 
i'm still fiddling with that trying to
figure<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:36.989> out<00:00:37.129> but<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.219> problem<00:00:38.460> was<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.940> said

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
figure it out but the problem was I said

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.270 
figure it out but the problem was I said
tech<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.690> would<00:00:39.809> work<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.200> tech<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.980> does<00:00:41.129> not

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
tech it would work and tech it does not

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.310 
tech it would work and tech it does not
have<00:00:41.550> these<00:00:41.760> pipes<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.270> thought<00:00:42.600> they<00:00:42.809> did<00:00:43.020> but

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
have these pipes I thought they did but

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.549 
have these pipes I thought they did but
they<00:00:43.350> don't<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.550> um<00:00:44.820> somebody<00:00:45.750> asked<00:00:46.079> me<00:00:46.140> if

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
they don't so um somebody asked me if

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.510 
they don't so um somebody asked me if
there<00:00:46.829> was<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.950> way<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.070> build<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.399> without

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
there was a way to build it without

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.810 
there was a way to build it without
these<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:49.020> gone<00:00:49.260> ahead<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.950> built<00:00:50.700> it

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
these and I have gone ahead and built it

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.520 
these and I have gone ahead and built it
without<00:00:51.000> those<00:00:51.210> it's<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.570> little<00:00:51.780> bit<00:00:51.930> bigger<00:00:52.260> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
without those it's a little bit bigger a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.560 
without those it's a little bit bigger a
little<00:00:52.739> bit<00:00:52.949> clunkier<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.910> uh<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.480> to

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
little bit clunkier this uh you have to

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.290 
little bit clunkier this uh you have to
redstone<00:00:54.870> engine<00:00:55.260> get<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.649> redstone<00:00:55.890> signal

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
redstone engine get it a redstone signal

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.170 
redstone engine get it a redstone signal
but<00:00:57.300> uh<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.989> works<00:00:58.289> I'm<00:00:58.920> happy<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.820> say<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.030> does

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
but uh it works I'm happy to say it does

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.150 
but uh it works I'm happy to say it does
work<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.809> what<00:01:01.199> it'll<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.559> instead<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.949> that

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
work so what it'll do instead of that

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.450 
work so what it'll do instead of that
one<00:01:02.340> where<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.579> keeps<00:01:02.820> only<00:01:04.040> you<00:01:05.040> know<00:01:05.129> this

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
one where it keeps only you know this

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.580 
one where it keeps only you know this
mini<00:01:05.670> stalked<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.240> doesn't<00:01:06.479> fill<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.780> this

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
mini stalked it doesn't fill this this

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.570 
mini stalked it doesn't fill this this
one<00:01:08.180> it<00:01:09.180> thrives<00:01:10.049> let's<00:01:10.799> get<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.070> daytime<00:01:11.369> it

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
one it thrives let's get a daytime it

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.700 
one it thrives let's get a daytime it
drives<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.150> get<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.360> full<00:01:12.689> as<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.290> see<00:01:13.530> it's

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
drives to get it full as you see it's

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.480 
drives to get it full as you see it's
filling<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.430> right<00:01:14.640> now<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:16.220> promo<00:01:17.220> tiling

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
filling up right now and promo tiling

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.370 
filling up right now and promo tiling
with<00:01:17.610> all<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> other<00:01:18.000> pipes<00:01:18.270> was<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.110> would

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
with all the other pipes was it would

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.070 
with all the other pipes was it would
fill<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.009> slot<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:22.850> so<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.450> way<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.900> is

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
fill this slot and so the way this is

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.480 
fill this slot and so the way this is
remedied<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:26.990> i<00:01:27.990> guess<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.710> advanced

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
remedied is I i guess the advanced

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.030 
remedied is I i guess the advanced
insertion<00:01:29.939> pipe<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:31.040> different<00:01:32.040> from<00:01:33.979> all<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
insertion pipe is different from all the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.830 
insertion pipe is different from all the
other<00:01:35.220> pipes<00:01:35.460> because<00:01:35.729> as<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.450> see<00:01:36.540> is

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
other pipes because as you can see is

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.350 
other pipes because as you can see is
all<00:01:37.259> putting<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.860> there<00:01:38.009> right<00:01:38.130> now<00:01:38.360> that's

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
all putting it in there right now that's

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.789 
all putting it in there right now that's
because<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.659> has<00:01:39.780> space<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:42.290> it<00:01:43.290> when<00:01:43.710> it

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
because it has space and it when it

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.889 
because it has space and it when it
doesn't<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.490> space<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.000> one<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.329> fills<00:01:45.659> and

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
doesn't have space so one this fills and

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.050 
doesn't have space so one this fills and
this<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.140> still<00:01:46.380> empty<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.890> will<00:01:47.610> switch<00:01:47.909> over

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
this is still empty it will switch over

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.399 
this is still empty it will switch over
and<00:01:48.240> start<00:01:48.630> going<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.049> antimatter

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
and start going to the antimatter

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.139 
and start going to the antimatter
relayed<00:01:49.770> disposing<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.369> extra<00:01:50.790> red<00:01:50.909> stone
