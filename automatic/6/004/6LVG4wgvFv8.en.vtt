00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.840
 Hello, my beloved ones. 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.719
 It's ok with you, the speaker is the 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.009
 magnifying glass and today we have another episode of 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.719
 poor efficiency 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.390
 in celebration of the launch of pokémon 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.340
 omega ruby and pokémon alfa fire 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.519
 nothing better than poor efficiency 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.949
 with the initials of bad because after all 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.000
 accounts they also have very 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.630
 crazy puc dex and mega evolutions what 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.290
 It's cooler there, the pokémon 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.260
 forest your arm can even cut 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.570
 thicker trees incomparable in 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.789
 fighting in the jungle 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.489
 resistance of all types of 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.850
 vary between five thousand and twenty thousand 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.280
 the force required to cut the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.530
 harder woods would be equivalent to 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.420
 bite of a tyrannosaurus rex 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.640
 so that you, I could cut 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.620
 your arm would need to be 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.170
 moving at a constant speed of 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.420
 4 thousand kilometers per hour which is more 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.790
 faster than blackburn the plane 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.840
 man-made speed already created by 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.479
 humanity 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.400
 the energy consumed would be 584 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.009
 calories per second 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.119
 the same as eating 70,000 strawberry kits 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.900
 every minute 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.330
 The force would be 5 thousand and 500 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.670
 even though the force produced by 800 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.430
 kilograms of dynamite 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.659
 ie the hospital despite a pokémon 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.490
 of grass is an explosive pokémon 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.979
 we can easily say that they separate me 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.770
 would have enough force to cut a 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.100
 half human or maybe even 15 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.259
 people queuing that such means 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.909
 too bloodthirsty not not stopped 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.909
 being there in the world pokémon is leaving 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.140
 the pokémon fire two and I want to try 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:02.930
 but very strong is able to jump on 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.280
 a building of 30 more with only one hop 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.439
 usually every floor of a building has 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.270
 three to four meters high 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.209
 that means blaze who can 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.330
 jump from 90 to 120 meters 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.270
 height 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.640
 this is more than 60 times your height 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.440
 more than the statue of liberty one 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.410
 human being as blaze that could not 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.980
 jump up to 30 meters high almost 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.870
 height of the redeeming christ the speed 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.990
 necessary for laws that could 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.190
 jump at this point would be 528 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.830
 kilometers per hour 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.560
 with such force that the kick English 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:44.470
 does not have an extra force yesterday 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:47.380
 are 27,000 456 thousand points 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.030
 with such force on a blake kick in the 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.300
 power and tossing war chariots 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.080
 we have English areas and it exists in 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.420
 real world 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.610
 perhaps there were no soldiers if they used 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.160
 only laws and carlos to face the 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.320
 army after all since 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.440
 could easily defeated tanks of 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:10.320
 war that such would be an easier life 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:13.500
 for the military is not a mud fish 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.750
 can swim while holding a ship 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.260
 capable of knocking out an enemy the only 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.420
 because it would do much more than 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.330
 just knock out your enemy 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.190
 he is undoubtedly one of the most pokémons 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.480
 stronger than has appeared here in because 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:35.860
 I could see the smallest type of ship 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.570
 business weighs 45 thousand grt than the measure 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.330
 used to measure in life 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.970
 this means that the only sound arm 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.300
 by is almost two thousand times stronger 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.000
 between the normal human being a punch of this 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.360
 pokémon would have strength of stonehenge before 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.820
 one million four hundred and thirteen thousand 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.930
 ps the pressure equivalent to the 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.850
 gravity exerted by 52 thousand seven hundred 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.950
 and thirty-five earth plants 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.350
 the punch of your partnership strong enough 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.610
 to open holes in any material 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.890
 terrestrial 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.440
 perhaps a very thick front of 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.530
 diamond but that would still 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.350
 the port is too strong daughter 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.290
 surreally strong and that my beloved ones 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.080
 was the reason why 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.289
 in the trio of the initial pokémons of roni 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.240
 You already know, everyone is very nice. 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.729
 I like 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.819
 many of them used a lot of blaze in 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:36.000
 xy pokémon I used enough the age 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:38.490
 Let's play the Pokémon but one 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.889
 black rubby pokémon I'm going from a team 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.250
 and I want to have a sound but I want to get 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:47.370
 final with powerful mega sound for you 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.330
 which one of the initial megas of bad you? 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.610
 most like 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.740
 choose one and leave comments 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.229
 also adds the request if I liked it 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.389
 a jewel in the video the joinha is very 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.729
 important even but very very very 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.800
 even then I always liked the video 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.289
 This helps the hell out the channel. 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.970
