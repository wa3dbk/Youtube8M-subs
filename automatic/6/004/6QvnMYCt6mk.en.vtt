spring like there isn't a single acting
but<00:02:29.730> this<00:02:29.849> has<00:02:30.000> an<00:02:30.120> advantage<00:02:30.390> because<00:02:30.840> if

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
but this has an advantage because if

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.170 
but this has an advantage because if
you're<00:02:31.080> using<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.440> pop-up<00:02:31.920> like<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.459> drum<00:02:32.760> popper

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
you're using a pop-up like a drum popper

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.570 
you're using a pop-up like a drum popper
you<00:02:34.110> can<00:02:34.260> push<00:02:34.440> air<00:02:34.590> into<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.830> bottom<00:02:35.160> it'll

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
you can push air into the bottom it'll

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.699 
you can push air into the bottom it'll
shoot<00:02:35.819> up<00:02:35.910> really<00:02:36.209> fast<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.840> it'll<00:02:37.440> drop<00:02:37.650> down

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
shoot up really fast and it'll drop down

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.720 
shoot up really fast and it'll drop down
really<00:02:38.160> fast<00:02:40.010> there's<00:02:41.010> some<00:02:41.130> optional<00:02:41.430> pieces

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
really fast there's some optional pieces

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.080 
really fast there's some optional pieces
you<00:02:41.819> might<00:02:41.970> want<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.180> look<00:02:42.300> at<00:02:42.480> getting

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
you might want to look at getting

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.979 
you might want to look at getting
instead<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.180> using<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.510> debris<00:02:45.810> filter<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:48.840> can

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
instead of using a debris filter you can

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.990 
instead of using a debris filter you can
take<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.350> out<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.590> use<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> speed<00:02:50.819> control

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
take that out and use a speed control

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.770 
take that out and use a speed control
exhaust<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:55.549> by<00:02:56.549> turning<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:57.030> needle<00:02:57.299> dial<00:02:57.540> I

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
exhaust and by turning the needle dial I

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.120 
exhaust and by turning the needle dial I
can<00:02:58.500> control<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.099> speed<00:02:59.459> of<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.480> cylinder

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
can control the speed of the cylinder

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.289 
can control the speed of the cylinder
another<00:03:02.130> optional<00:03:02.580> item<00:03:02.849> you<00:03:02.940> might<00:03:03.060> want<00:03:03.269> to

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
another optional item you might want to

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.839 
another optional item you might want to
look<00:03:03.420> at<00:03:03.540> getting<00:03:03.950> is<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.010> quick<00:03:05.340> connect<00:03:05.670> to

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
look at getting is a quick connect to

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.280 
look at getting is a quick connect to
compressor<00:03:06.299> fitting<00:03:08.480> this<00:03:09.480> allows<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:10.019> to

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
compressor fitting this allows you to

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.589 
compressor fitting this allows you to
make<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.799> Quick<00:03:11.040> Connect<00:03:11.430> style<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:12.480> the

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
make the Quick Connect style to the

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:13.990 
make the Quick Connect style to the
Quick<00:03:12.780> Connect<00:03:13.110> style<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.620> goes<00:03:13.769> into

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
Quick Connect style that goes into

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.910 
Quick Connect style that goes into
compressor<00:03:15.000> air<00:03:15.180> line<00:03:15.390> hose<00:03:18.500> so<00:03:19.500> with<00:03:19.650> one<00:03:19.829> of

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
compressor air line hose so with one of

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.300 
compressor air line hose so with one of
these<00:03:20.010> you'd<00:03:20.310> push<00:03:20.549> in<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.820> air<00:03:20.940> line<00:03:22.010> go<00:03:23.010> into

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
these you'd push in the air line go into

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.750 
these you'd push in the air line go into
the<00:03:23.430> import<00:03:23.850> into<00:03:24.440> your<00:03:25.440> compressor<00:03:28.760> if

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
the import into your compressor if

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.910 
the import into your compressor if
you're<00:03:29.970> simply<00:03:30.359> using<00:03:30.390> tees<00:03:31.049> and<00:03:31.079> splitters

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
you're simply using tees and splitters

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.370 
you're simply using tees and splitters
you<00:03:32.519> don't<00:03:32.670> need<00:03:32.880> one<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.180> those<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:34.170> can<00:03:34.350> just

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
you don't need one of those you can just

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.949 
you don't need one of those you can just
simply<00:03:34.880> install<00:03:35.880> it<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.150> tee<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.690> keep

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
simply install it to the tee and keep

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.599 
simply install it to the tee and keep
going<00:03:37.200> down<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.590> line<00:03:37.769> until<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.340> get<00:03:38.489> to

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
going down the line until you get to

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.240 
going down the line until you get to
your<00:03:38.640> compressor<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.480> use<00:03:39.690> one<00:03:39.900> there<00:03:40.250> that's

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
your compressor and use one there that's

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.280 
your compressor and use one there that's
why<00:03:41.370> we<00:03:41.489> don't<00:03:41.609> include<00:03:41.940> one<00:03:42.299> of<00:03:42.420> these<00:03:42.569> with

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
why we don't include one of these with

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.770 
why we don't include one of these with
the<00:03:43.470> kit<00:03:43.680> because<00:03:44.489> if<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:45.299> have<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.480> lot<00:03:45.750> of

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
the kit because if you have a lot of

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.650 
the kit because if you have a lot of
these<00:03:46.049> kits<00:03:46.709> around<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:48.060> only<00:03:48.209> need<00:03:48.420> one<00:03:48.630> of

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
these kits around you only need one of

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.700 
these kits around you only need one of
these<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:49.680> don't<00:03:49.709> need<00:03:49.889> one<00:03:50.130> for<00:03:50.280> each<00:03:50.370> kit
