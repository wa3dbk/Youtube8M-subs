are met ornamental fish I strongly

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.499 
are met ornamental fish I strongly
suggest<00:01:31.570> putting<00:01:32.280> an<00:01:33.280> algae<00:01:33.729> eater<00:01:33.910> or<00:01:34.060> two<00:01:34.360> in

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
suggest putting an algae eater or two in

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.060 
suggest putting an algae eater or two in
there<00:01:34.660> really<00:01:35.650> makes<00:01:35.830> a<00:01:35.950> tremendous

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
difference I need to give it a little

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.149 
difference I need to give it a little
