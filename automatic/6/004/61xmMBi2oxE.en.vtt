00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.690
 to a match of a team that we have 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:08.389
 would do because we want to wait to get to 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.910
 europe and we know it makes it very complicated 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.549
 we know that valencia has a great 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.920
 team but I trust the team and we 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.110
 we're going to face competitive and well I think 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.940
 that I mark early I think that 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.030
 we have achieved the goal that we 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.930
 I had scored the club we got 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.090
 with enough match 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.520
 I do not know about separation and now everything 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.110
 come know yourself that it is true that the 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.870
 people are wanting to get something 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.180
 more of all Europe and everything will go through the 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.870
 time is not competitive and I think that 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.510
 no one 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.329
 that we do not think even with so many points 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.789
 at this point but good what has 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.739
 been the sacrifice of all for the 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.620
 team has been throughout the year very 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.120
 well and we deserve I think that the 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.250
 way is how are we doing so far 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.140
 which is match by match but they are only 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.699
 in the three Valencian points think 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.519
 beyond not if we win then we put ourselves 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.500
 so many points just think that in that 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.659
 match and so we have done very well until 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.200
 Now let's see if if we continue like I 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:12.800
 I think it's the way if we know that the 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.300
 team that has very good forwards and 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.800
 two good matches I 'm not going to so many 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.630
 Sometimes, what worries me the most is 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.460
 that we do not have failures 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.500
 in front of the goal I think the most 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.390
 important and then what they do 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.679
 they will not matter very little but 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.210
 Well I think the important thing is that 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.990
 the team is well that goes out to win and 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.990
 now we can get the victory on 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.210
 team is not every number we know that 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.830
 every game is a world and so far 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.780
 we have said the same speech that 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.090
 I had left game and we are going 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.539
 well let's continue like this we will not 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.539
 change the dynamics 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.710
 and the usual always played some 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.110
 always goes out to play soccer 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.080
 always goes on the attack to try to make 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.490
 goals and I hope that this years giving 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.650
 a lot of good results and we're going to 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.240
 go like this because why change there's no 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.850
 gold the same to the forward whenever 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.640
 has occasion is the only one who wants is 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.440
 make a goal what does have stress is more 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.240
 easy that when you have one but that 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.520
 it is here we are both me and all 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.830
 front very well facing goal 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.890
 and that is being appreciated by someone good 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.800
 you always look at me the goal has not marked 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.780
 at the beginning of the season was the attempt 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.600
 exceed 16 goals maybe last year 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.209
 I think just one way and going 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.090
 to see if I can if I can never overcome 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.390
 now that I have all awareness of 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.800
 world and what commands the one that the one 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.560
 decides that the same does not play here and the other 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.880
 day he decided to put me and I think it's not in 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.260
 one more and especially the victory of 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.660
 team I do not know the truth is that it is now 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.790
 very well facing the goal or the faces almost 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.230
 all that has the stockings for inside 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.019
 and that's good for the team we're going to 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.510
 keep doing goals if that's not 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.640
 the competition above 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.040
 is very good especially for the xbox and 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.200
 I think he has a very good job, I think 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.700
 that in five or six matches there are or three 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.590
 goals has contributed a lot to the team and 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.530
 good as long as I always come to contribute 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.019
 always good the truth is that with desire 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.760
 to be there seeing the team as 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.920
 I was playing very well at 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.450
 football that had many chances I 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.700
 what I wanted was to be there and parity 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.750
 to the team but well I think I've 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.750
 returned the same way
