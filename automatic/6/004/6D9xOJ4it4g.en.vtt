00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.059
 again 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.029
 hello to all hello master with you for two years housing and this 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.610
 that it implies for that fahmi so what measures can protect 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.909
 fabienne housing 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.189
 and many specific measures 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.789
 in that the legislator intended to grant enhanced protection 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.830
 to this particular place that is the family residence where the family 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.099
 when I do not sleep said 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.259
 so that when we wanted so avoided 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.980
 that by husband alone owner of the building more often on a whim this 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.450
 building without the consent of the spouse will require 5 hours 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.150
 and this denial the spouse's name for obviously not be cabistes 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.090
 when it comes to 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.920
 the common residence of the inhabitants costs is it also 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.830
 protected 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.710
 absolutely 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.399
 it is from this benefit of this enhanced protection has been extended 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.609
 where the inhabitant by the legislator at the time of the adoption of the law 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.160
 in terms of cohabitation 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.000
 we were expecting children to 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.890
 a child does not have the capacity to sell the property that would belong to him 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.830
 totally 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.050
 or partially what is the procedure to follow 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.970
 well if it appeared that the bank became necessary grow 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.010
 indispensable for example- and parents go abroad where the image 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.650
 becomes crazy about fees 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.580
 the minor to sell will have to be allowed this land and sea hootsuite 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.580
 hours in the event of death will seek the agreement of the judge 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.880
 2 the judge who will agree after being surrounded by precautions and 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.950
 have made sure that the price is a suitable price and some 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.619
 parents or grandparents wish to buy 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.600
 to a real estate for their children their grandchildren so gold 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.130
 that they can have capital is that a good solution 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.720
 according to you 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.720
 it can be a good solution of the idea sometimes it is to allow 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.600
 the child or grandchildren in the capital in order to majority 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.600
 to avoid heavy taxes in case of defeat 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.630
 so that on this point why not but it must still be considered 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.280
 a lot of caution also because for the child question 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.530
 owner of the building first will have to get permission 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.009
 buy this building by his parents 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.080
 6 there is more need to resort to borrowing 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.829
 well it can be problematic or impossible and finally you have to know 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:18.229
 and that's the advice I would give 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.589
 the circumstances of life are not known the child 18 years old owner of 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:24.649
 his building in the belly gold these bearings it was not the assumption 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:29.039
 to consider it can also percent before financial problems and 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.629
 to see his guide afp cj and parents who would like to recover because 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.919
 that they need capital data he would not have talked about the possibility 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:37.879
 talking about parents who 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.269
 they become older who own two more at the 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.189
 house he wants to put on sale and what they can sign 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.189
 the act only voice when it needs to appeal to their children 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.089
 for 100 th 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:54.429
 the fact of strangers but by handicap in itself and so the concept the German the 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:55.779
 management of their heritage 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:57.249
 their life 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:59.469
 they can 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.659
 take part dropped freely anyway as long as they are long 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:05.649
 intellectual abilities they need both 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:07.970
 if management in heritage seems a little heavy 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.710
 nothing prevents you from signing a power of attorney for such august l 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.359
 child 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.309
 see for several children 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:15.950
 and equipment and cie 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.200
 discharged by the power of attorney given to the children of the day-to-day management 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.530
 part of their heritage for example 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.370
 while that can happen there and that parents do not have all their 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.810
 intellectual intellectual abilities for example with the 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.099
 Alzheimer's disease 'what's going on in this situation 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.339
 if one or both parents 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:35.859
 that they have any faculty diminished 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.949
 For example, it is possible for children to apply for permission from the 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:41.679
 magistrate judge 

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:43.810
 so that 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.999
 to be able to be a provisional administrator 

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:51.359
 either before the family is a lawyer or what do I know and who will take in 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.519
 charge the daily management of the property of its citizens 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.579
 this management center acts common management and as soon as a match off 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.670
 derive from this day-to-day management, it will be necessary to be authorized again 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.669
 justice of the peace by doing a big thank you master for all these clarifications 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:09.499
 then on time 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:09.989
 otherwise
