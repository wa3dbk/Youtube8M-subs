this is the way I do it about 10 well I

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.359 
this is the way I do it about 10 well I
started<00:01:18.610> about<00:01:18.909> 12<00:01:19.180> years<00:01:19.390> ago<00:01:19.509> and<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:21.070> picked

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
started about 12 years ago and I picked

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.120 
started about 12 years ago and I picked
up<00:01:21.520> Paul's<00:01:21.759> guitar<00:01:22.119> and<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:22.960> loved<00:01:23.229> it<00:01:23.380> the

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
up Paul's guitar and I loved it the

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.990 
up Paul's guitar and I loved it the
thing<00:01:24.460> is<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:25.119> concept<00:01:25.720> I<00:01:25.900> had<00:01:26.170> about<00:01:26.619> this

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
thing is the concept I had about this

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.340 
thing is the concept I had about this
DVD<00:01:28.000> was<00:01:28.869> that<00:01:29.080> I<00:01:29.290> would<00:01:29.350> have<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:30.210> score<00:01:31.350> moving

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
DVD was that I would have a score moving

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.520 
DVD was that I would have a score moving
and<00:01:32.500> sync<00:01:32.799> to<00:01:33.130> everything<00:01:33.790> that<00:01:34.030> I<00:01:34.299> played<00:01:34.750> the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
and sync to everything that I played the

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.580 
and sync to everything that I played the
three<00:01:35.799> DVDs<00:01:36.310> in<00:01:36.579> this<00:01:36.729> box<00:01:37.030> set<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:38.170> problem

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
three DVDs in this box set the problem

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.580 
three DVDs in this box set the problem
about<00:01:39.100> realizing<00:01:39.820> this<00:01:39.939> concept<00:01:40.540> is<00:01:40.720> how<00:01:41.110> am<00:01:41.439> I

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
about realizing this concept is how am I

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.940 
about realizing this concept is how am I
going<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.860> get<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.159> score<00:01:44.970> inside<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.680> the

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
going to get the score inside the the

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.219 
going to get the score inside the the
video<00:01:48.280> this<00:01:49.149> is<00:01:49.360> this<00:01:49.509> was<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:49.810> whole<00:01:49.960> problem

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
video this is this was the whole problem

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.780 
video this is this was the whole problem
and<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:51.720> clearly<00:01:52.720> I<00:01:53.530> couldn't<00:01:54.340> spend<00:01:54.640> the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
and and clearly I couldn't spend the

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.870 
and and clearly I couldn't spend the
next<00:01:54.970> two<00:01:55.570> or<00:01:55.689> three<00:01:55.750> years<00:01:56.460> transcribing<00:01:57.460> all

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
next two or three years transcribing all

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.780 
next two or three years transcribing all
my<00:01:58.119> improvisations<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.890> tunes<00:02:00.520> and

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
my improvisations and the tunes and

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.480 
my improvisations and the tunes and
everything<00:02:01.299> so<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.439> only<00:02:02.619> solution<00:02:02.890> I<00:02:03.280> came

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
everything so the only solution I came

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.420 
everything so the only solution I came
up<00:02:03.640> with<00:02:03.670> was<00:02:04.119> to<00:02:04.149> get<00:02:04.509> a<00:02:04.540> MIDI<00:02:04.869> guitar<00:02:05.189> which<00:02:06.189> I

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
up with was to get a MIDI guitar which I

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.870 
up with was to get a MIDI guitar which I
did<00:02:06.670> and<00:02:06.939> I<00:02:07.570> proceeded<00:02:08.200> to<00:02:08.350> record<00:02:08.619> audio<00:02:09.220> and

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
did and I proceeded to record audio and

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.520 
did and I proceeded to record audio and
MIDI<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:12.150> through<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.989> know<00:02:14.079> and

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
MIDI and through that you know and

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.470 
MIDI and through that you know and
Paul's<00:02:14.860> guitar<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.310> didn't<00:02:15.519> have<00:02:15.670> many<00:02:15.850> which

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
Paul's guitar I didn't have many which

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.560 
Paul's guitar I didn't have many which
was<00:02:16.720> my<00:02:16.989> first<00:02:17.769> divergence<00:02:18.579> from<00:02:18.760> from<00:02:19.299> Paul

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
was my first divergence from from Paul

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.530 
was my first divergence from from Paul
and<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.230> didn't<00:02:20.530> know<00:02:20.709> that<00:02:20.739> he<00:02:21.190> actually<00:02:21.549> could

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
and I didn't know that he actually could

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.310 
and I didn't know that he actually could
make<00:02:22.750> me<00:02:23.019> a<00:02:23.290> MIDI<00:02:23.500> guitar

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
make me a MIDI guitar

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.180 
make me a MIDI guitar
but<00:02:25.770> if<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.130> look<00:02:26.310> at<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.490> box<00:02:27.080> set<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.440> DVD

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
but if you look at the box set the DVD

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.790 
but if you look at the box set the DVD
boxset<00:02:29.490> you<00:02:29.820> won't<00:02:30.060> see<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:31.050> guitar<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.650> it

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
was you will see Paul's guitar because

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.420 
was you will see Paul's guitar because
that's<00:02:33.900> how<00:02:34.080> much<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.470> loved<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:34.920> really

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
that's how much I loved it I really

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.370
