00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.890
 for some data from the single bisbal 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.660
 It costs a new video with more 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.759
 halo information 4 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.890
 we started well then the first thing that you 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.970
 I bring are possible spoilers of the 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.450
 halo campaign 4 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.669
 Well, it may start in halo 4 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.070
 let's see Dr. Halse and the program 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:20.779
 spartan return in the new way the 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.429
 program is therefore that it has a 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.519
 very important role in the history of 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:27.769
 game with this I think that the adopted 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.779
 false and could be in infinity for 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.119
 observe how the 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.129
 sparta program in four or that maybe 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.960
 will appear in the halo campaign 4 of 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.730
 some way or other that logically 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.010
 some we know 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.519
 we have seen new enemies but some 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.780
 p 343 industries has not revealed us yet 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.640
 one of these enemies will have the 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.769
 wild and bloody nature of the 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.559
 groups united with agility and speed 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.359
 of the angels what will make the boss 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.050
 teacher has to use every tactic that 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.810
 know to knock them down 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.030
 always pretty 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.690
 pretty cool these possible enemies 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.660
 of the truth describe everything as a challenge 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.370
 to knock it down but good now it will be 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.870
 see how they are 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.310
 the next thing this is an article of 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.560
 xm where they talked about the demo of e3 and 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.320
 is that it comes to the culés of the enemies 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.230
 to the fiancés but the most interesting 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.550
 that appears is the following this is a 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:30.240
 ask me what they did to me here thibault 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.640
 they have a pretty summers name 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.430
 infiniti will appear in the other games 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.320
 of the trilogy place that we have ready 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.660
 already for the master boss we have a 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.610
 story for the bottom end and if 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.490
 will struggle with giving things 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.970
 well then as you are seeing then 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.650
 He also talks about just one season to 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.300
 one that are focusing on one 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.390
 hunosa season that I think what 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.280
 has responded to reference Spartans and 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.900
 Well, surely you have answered 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.760
 that's like a good book because it's logical 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.290
 think that the infinite was going appears in the 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.570
 Spartans 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.070
 about 90 I mean to mean this that the 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.050
 let's see in other players but as the 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.170
 hard I think he's responding to 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.790
 another question totally different 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.280
 people the meadows other fragments of 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.260
 this item the coloring will be 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.270
 present and they will do it the shape of a group 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.820
 of reduced or whiting 2 looking for 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.070
 one of his gods in requiem so 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.380
 while thieves efe is trying 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.900
 secure requiem to prevent a one 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.030
 costly war the sect of the young 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.680
 rebels are conspiring to use 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.930
 this ordered to exclude his protection of 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.930
 attack of the sticks to leave them to 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.760
 all this united that you will be in the world 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.490
 worthy shot of threat out of runner 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.459
 will mean that both a campaign when 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.580
 the spartan pge will be your group good 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.220
 then describe us to the problems 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.780
 as religious crackpot ie 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.850
 that will be even crazier than in others 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.880
 games 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.990
 and who are looking for gods requires 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:04.590
 quite interesting is like this 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:07.760
 neither should we highlight much more than 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.569
 this small segment and the next thing that 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.160
 332 that steve downs the master chief 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.140
 will attend the bridge with and seems to be 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.420
 that to which he will speak only left four 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.610
 with light at this moment is how 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.810
 You see why it is 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:28.220
 preparing for those of halo 4 in the 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:31.890
 next world account and a good 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.960
 vision this Friday or today tomorrow 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.390
 and on Sunday and well then 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.130
 I do not know what he said about halo 4 because 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.290
 I found nothing I suppose that this end 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.640
 of the week we will know something of what I have 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.330
 spoken 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.670
 So, as I show you now the uc 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.550
 gray has said in some way that such 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.810
 there will be information about halo 4 soon 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.030
 later we can be seeing someone has 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.620
 commented that there are still four 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.340
 weeks before we see more 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.920
 halo information 4 who has said has 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.220
 said more the caves after that is 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.890
 all funny today that is David Ellis 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.950
 says this one 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.950
 and this may mean then there will be 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.010
 information sooner or none the 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.200
 information until other months 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.000
 so I hope it's the first 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.620
 but and I hope it's the first bottle 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.570
 you could not talk more about the 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.280
 campaign or something more of the multiple now 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.030
 prove more armor the truth that 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.820
 it would be pretty good if they did 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.710
 has then finally been confirmed 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.680
 assistance of halo 4 to various events 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.640
 in the first event is micromanía game 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.160
 in France from 10 to 13 October and the 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:52.330
 next is the pax in seattle on 1 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:55.090
 September well the pac is installed 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.630
 from August 31 to September 2 but 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.520
 as I said with the 4 only 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.160
 will be at that fair on the 1st of 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.320
 September and well so far the 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.080
 video because the visit has liked the 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.800
 beagle greetings and I think he deserves and he 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.800
 can you prepare us
