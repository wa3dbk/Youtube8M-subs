going to tell you whey protein is a

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.430 
going to tell you whey protein is a
fast-acting<00:00:48.030> protein<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.289> should<00:00:49.410> be

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
fast-acting protein and so it should be

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.860 
fast-acting protein and so it should be
consumed<00:00:49.920> at<00:00:50.129> times<00:00:50.460> when<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.820> need<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.750> know

there's<00:03:08.920> really<00:03:09.040> two<00:03:09.130> main<00:03:09.610> issues<00:03:09.880> when<00:03:10.360> it

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
there's really two main issues when it

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.479 
there's really two main issues when it
comes<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:11.050> assessing<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:11.860> quality<00:03:12.040> of<00:03:12.370> any

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
comes to assessing the quality of any

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.220 
comes to assessing the quality of any
individual<00:03:13.090> protein<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.630> first<00:03:13.930> is<00:03:14.110> the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
individual protein the first is the

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.470 
individual protein the first is the
biological<00:03:14.860> value<00:03:15.070> and<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.820> second<00:03:16.239> is<00:03:16.330> the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
biological value and the second is the

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.690 
biological value and the second is the
amino<00:03:16.810> acid<00:03:17.170> profile<00:03:17.590> so<00:03:18.310> when<00:03:18.430> we're<00:03:18.550> talking

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
amino acid profile so when we're talking

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.490 
amino acid profile so when we're talking
about<00:03:18.940> biological<00:03:19.540> value<00:03:20.050> what<00:03:20.380> we're

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
about biological value what we're

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.010 
about biological value what we're
alternately<00:03:20.950> referring<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:21.670> is<00:03:21.910> how<00:03:22.480> much<00:03:22.810> of

alternately referring to is how much of

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.830 
alternately referring to is how much of

that protein source is actually utilized

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.930 
that protein source is actually utilized
by<00:03:26.290> your<00:03:26.320> body<00:03:26.620> so<00:03:26.800> if<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:26.980> consume<00:03:27.340> 30<00:03:27.670> grams

by your body so if you consume 30 grams

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.820 
by your body so if you consume 30 grams
of<00:03:28.060> protein<00:03:28.120> from<00:03:28.540> source<00:03:28.840> a<00:03:28.989> how<00:03:29.440> many<00:03:29.680> of
