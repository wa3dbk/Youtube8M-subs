cables get it camera-ready we're going
to<00:01:17.640> do<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.760> video<00:01:17.880> on<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.299> at<00:01:18.510> work<00:01:18.720> probably

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
to do a video on this at work probably

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.469 
to do a video on this at work probably
next<00:01:19.920> week<00:01:20.190> assuming<00:01:20.940> that<00:01:21.090> they're<00:01:21.270> done

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
next week assuming that they're done

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.490 
next week assuming that they're done
with<00:01:21.659> all<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.020> painting<00:01:22.440> and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
with all of the painting and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.630 
with all of the painting and
construction<00:01:23.040> they're<00:01:23.159> doing<00:01:23.340> right<00:01:23.490> now

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
construction they're doing right now

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.100 
construction they're doing right now
because<00:01:23.909> we're<00:01:24.060> getting<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.450> bit<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.020> an

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
because we're getting a bit of an

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.600 
because we're getting a bit of an
expansion<00:01:25.650> we're<00:01:25.860> getting<00:01:26.040> some<00:01:26.250> more<00:01:26.400> room

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
expansion we're getting some more room

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.539 
expansion we're getting some more room
and<00:01:26.850> some<00:01:26.970> more<00:01:27.119> space<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:28.010> to<00:01:29.010> protect<00:01:29.219> it

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
and some more space and to protect it

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.800 
and some more space and to protect it
from<00:01:29.609> all<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.000> decided<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.539> might<00:01:30.659> as<00:01:30.780> well

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
from all that I decided I might as well

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.380 
from all that I decided I might as well
just<00:01:31.020> bring<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.289> home<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.700> finish<00:01:32.700> up<00:01:32.909> my

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
just bring it home and finish up my

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.410 
just bring it home and finish up my
cabling<00:01:33.930> again<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:35.159> way<00:01:35.310> GTX<00:01:35.880> Titans<00:01:36.270> in

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
cabling again for way GTX Titans in

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.990 
cabling again for way GTX Titans in
there<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:36.990> that's<00:01:37.829> pretty<00:01:38.159> awesome<00:01:38.250> it's

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
there so that's pretty awesome it's

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.060 
there so that's pretty awesome it's
probably<00:01:39.210> about<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.840> best<00:01:40.140> configuration

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
probably about the best configuration

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.130 
probably about the best configuration
that<00:01:41.609> we're<00:01:41.789> going<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.969> have<00:01:42.179> in<00:01:42.359> this<00:01:42.509> test

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
that we're going to have in this test

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.499 
that we're going to have in this test
bed<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.409> quite<00:01:43.799> some<00:01:44.070> time<00:01:44.210> but<00:01:45.210> we've<00:01:45.390> been

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
bed for quite some time but we've been

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.270 
bed for quite some time but we've been
doing<00:01:45.719> lots<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.960> testing<00:01:46.289> on<00:01:46.380> those<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.859> I

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
doing lots of testing on those and I

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.429 
doing lots of testing on those and I
have<00:01:47.429> one<00:01:47.640> more<00:01:47.670> video<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.750> benchmarks<00:01:49.350> that

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
have one more video with benchmarks that

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.740 
have one more video with benchmarks that

the V RMS and whatnot on the motherboard
as<00:03:45.760> mentioned<00:03:46.090> we<00:03:46.360> did<00:03:46.510> do<00:03:46.600> some<00:03:46.750> overclocking

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
as mentioned we did do some overclocking

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.440 
as mentioned we did do some overclocking
with<00:03:47.380> this<00:03:47.530> system<00:03:47.740> I've<00:03:48.460> been<00:03:48.670> overclocking

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
with this system I've been overclocking

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.230 
with this system I've been overclocking
I<00:03:49.510> got<00:03:49.660> it<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:49.930> nice<00:03:50.080> stable<00:03:50.320> 4.5<00:03:50.950> gigahertz

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
I got it to a nice stable 4.5 gigahertz

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.030 
I got it to a nice stable 4.5 gigahertz
because<00:03:52.260> doing<00:03:53.260> my<00:03:53.410> last<00:03:53.590> video<00:03:53.860> with<00:03:53.950> the

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
because doing my last video with the

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.310 
because doing my last video with the
4-way<00:03:54.250> Titans<00:03:54.700> everyone<00:03:54.970> said<00:03:55.240> about<00:03:55.540> how<00:03:55.750> far

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
4-way Titans everyone said about how far

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.160 
4-way Titans everyone said about how far
can<00:03:56.590> this<00:03:56.770> actually<00:03:57.190> go<00:03:57.370> so<00:03:58.000> stay<00:03:58.630> tuned<00:03:58.840> again

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
can this actually go so stay tuned again

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.230 
can this actually go so stay tuned again

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
11 50 megahertz which was pretty awesome

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.000 
11 50 megahertz which was pretty awesome
got<00:04:13.420> some<00:04:13.600> pretty<00:04:13.840> amazing<00:04:14.290> numbers<00:04:14.770> out<00:04:14.920> of

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
it as well and then we also upped the

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.400 
it as well and then we also upped the

I'm<00:04:45.449> coming<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:45.990> end<00:04:46.139> of<00:04:46.259> my<00:04:46.289> time<00:04:46.560> with

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
I'm coming to the end of my time with

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.439 
I'm coming to the end of my time with
him<00:04:46.830> which<00:04:46.949> is<00:04:47.100> very<00:04:47.280> sad<00:04:47.550> but<00:04:48.180> it's<00:04:48.330> been

him which is very sad but it's been

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.029 
him which is very sad but it's been
really<00:04:48.569> cool<00:04:48.810> to<00:04:48.870> play<00:04:49.139> with<00:04:49.710> all<00:04:49.860> that

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
really cool to play with all that

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:50.960 
really cool to play with all that
hardware<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.460> see<00:04:50.610> what<00:04:50.759> kind<00:04:50.940> of

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
hardware and see what kind of

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.700 
hardware and see what kind of
performance<00:04:51.270> if<00:04:51.600> you<00:04:51.720> get<00:04:51.900> also<00:04:52.380> a<00:04:52.410> kind<00:04:52.590> of

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
performance if you get also a kind of

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.730 
performance if you get also a kind of
power<00:04:52.889> draw<00:04:53.130> you<00:04:53.370> need<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:54.479> 1600<00:04:55.440> watts<00:04:55.590> is

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
power draw you need the 1600 watts is

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.860 
power draw you need the 1600 watts is
definitely<00:04:56.160> warranted<00:04:56.550> under<00:04:56.940> peak<00:04:57.479> load<00:04:57.720> it

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
definitely warranted under peak load it

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.620 
definitely warranted under peak load it
was<00:04:57.990> pushing<00:04:58.979> past<00:04:59.520> thirteen<00:05:00.120> hundred<00:05:00.360> watts

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
was pushing past thirteen hundred watts

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.860 
was pushing past thirteen hundred watts
which<00:05:01.259> is<00:05:01.560> a<00:05:02.190> lot<00:05:02.639> of<00:05:02.669> wattage<00:05:03.000> but<00:05:03.240> for<00:05:03.810> the

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
which is a lot of wattage but for the

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.140 
which is a lot of wattage but for the
amount<00:05:03.960> of<00:05:04.080> power<00:05:04.259> gets<00:05:04.560> Titans<00:05:04.919> actually<00:05:05.430> not

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
amount of power gets Titans actually not

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.300 
amount of power gets Titans actually not
even<00:05:06.509> that<00:05:06.660> bed<00:05:06.870> there's<00:05:07.440> a<00:05:07.500> closer<00:05:07.770> look<00:05:08.039> at
