00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
of fun with your audio the first idea

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.340 
of fun with your audio the first idea
for<00:00:32.369> medicine<00:00:32.730> came<00:00:33.030> from<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.930> taking<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
for medicine came from just taking the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.139 
for medicine came from just taking the
micro<00:00:34.710> being<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> micro<00:00:35.430> G<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.940> just

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
micro being the micro G and just

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.090 
micro being the micro G and just
exploding<00:00:36.930> giving<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.559> many<00:00:37.680> more<00:00:37.920> options

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
exploding giving so many more options

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.100 
exploding giving so many more options
and<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.059> thought<00:00:39.210> would<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.450> really<00:00:39.719> cool<00:00:39.899> if

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
and we thought would be really cool if

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.830 
and we thought would be really cool if
we<00:00:40.140> could<00:00:40.260> add<00:00:40.860> some<00:00:40.920> lfos<00:00:41.579> here<00:00:41.910> or<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.390> patent

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
we could add some lfos here or a patent

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.630 
we could add some lfos here or a patent
sequencer<00:00:43.379> or<00:00:43.559> just<00:00:43.860> connect<00:00:44.520> things

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
sequencer or just connect things

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.310 
sequencer or just connect things
together<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.210> ways<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.629> can't<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:46.020> with<00:00:46.200> those

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
together in ways you can't do with those

00:00:46.320 --> 00:01:00.250 
together in ways you can't do with those
pedals<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.370> result<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.879> extremely<00:00:48.570> fun

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.869 

mega<00:01:01.260> synth<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.680> great<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.520> take<00:01:02.730> your

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
mega synth is great you can take your

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.000 
mega synth is great you can take your
guitar<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.480> turn<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.870> into<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.290> synthesizer

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
guitar and turn it into a synthesizer

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.130 
guitar and turn it into a synthesizer
which<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.909> really<00:01:06.180> fun<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.869> get<00:01:07.020> these

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
which is really fun you can get these

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.990 
which is really fun you can get these
really<00:01:07.380> unique<00:01:07.619> sounds<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.610> really

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
really unique sounds that you really

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.580 
really unique sounds that you really
wouldn't<00:01:09.240> think<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.020> would<00:01:10.170> hear<00:01:10.439> out

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
wouldn't think that you would hear out

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.500 
wouldn't think that you would hear out
of<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.799> guitar<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:11.760> then<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.150> get<00:01:12.270> really

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
of a guitar but then you can get really

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.359 
of a guitar but then you can get really
simple<00:01:12.930> sounds<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.439> just<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.830> really<00:01:14.070> nice

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
simple sounds to just like really nice

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.359 
simple sounds to just like really nice

it there's a pattern gain on it that

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.940 
it there's a pattern gain on it that
really<00:01:19.049> makes<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.500> very<00:01:19.590> interesting

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.399 

we<00:01:28.700> wanted<00:01:28.909> to<00:01:28.969> make<00:01:29.180> a<00:01:29.210> really<00:01:29.570> attractive<00:01:29.810> UI

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
we wanted to make a really attractive UI

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.889 
we wanted to make a really attractive UI
to<00:01:31.159> make<00:01:31.189> it<00:01:31.460> as<00:01:31.549> simple<00:01:31.820> as<00:01:31.909> possible<00:01:32.000> to

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
to make it as simple as possible to

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.929 
to make it as simple as possible to
connect<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.469> signal<00:01:33.680> path<00:01:34.039> through<00:01:34.399> one<00:01:34.850> of

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
connect the signal path through one of

connect the signal path through one of
our<00:01:35.060> priorities<00:01:35.539> was<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:36.170> just<00:01:36.320> give<00:01:36.469> the<00:01:36.619> user

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
our priorities was to just give the user

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.830 
our priorities was to just give the user
complete<00:01:37.189> flexibility<00:01:37.820> as<00:01:38.149> easily<00:01:38.539> as

mega<00:01:46.039> synth<00:01:46.310> is<00:01:46.520> intended<00:01:47.030> to<00:01:47.060> be<00:01:47.450> a

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
mega synth is intended to be a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.929 
mega synth is intended to be a
subtractive<00:01:48.740> synthesizer<00:01:49.250> for<00:01:49.640> your<00:01:49.819> guitar

subtractive synthesizer for your guitar
bass<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:50.780> just<00:01:50.990> like<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.140> subtractive<00:01:51.710> synth

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
bass so just like a subtractive synth

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.910 
bass so just like a subtractive synth
you<00:01:52.130> have<00:01:52.310> some<00:01:52.610> voices<00:01:53.319> filters<00:01:54.319> amps

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
you have some voices filters amps

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.059 
you have some voices filters amps
modulators<00:01:55.909> and<00:01:56.420> macro<00:01:56.960> controls<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.890> really

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
modulators and macro controls the really

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:59.350 
modulators and macro controls the really
cool<00:01:58.189> thing<00:01:58.429> is<00:01:58.579> you<00:01:58.610> can<00:01:58.909> connect<00:01:59.240> them

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
cool thing is you can connect them

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.089
