00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:09.820
 Here we will explain the nature of dilute solutions 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:16.240
 Dilute solution concentration is small It is the nature of the solution 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:18.490
 Here you will learn in the first one is here for the phenomenon It is three paintings by the nature of the dilute solution 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.990
 It will be the boiling point rise written 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:26.539
 Phenomenon two eyes freezing point depression 3 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:32.239
 My dream is the morning of the vibration . We will learn about these three as the nature of dilute solution. 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:36.559
 Because for an explanation and continue to a boiling point increase in this phenomenon called the boiling point rise in the first one 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:40.760
 Even though is not a phenomenon that the boiling point of the solution is increased 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.980
 What kind of phenomenon is this? Suppose that there is pure water here 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.540
 so 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:50.220
 It is boiling point is 100 degrees under 1 atmosphere of that pure water 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:53.400
 But I melt it is something Western-style in its pure is the water 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.879
 Well It's is good also dissolve whatever is good for example sodium chloride 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:00.970
 It's also good at Sato and gas, but I'll dissolved something Western-style 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:06.970
 In other words, I'm going to use this as an aqueous solution . 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:11.800
 Then the boiling point will rise, that is , the boiling point under 1 atmosphere pressure will not be 100 degrees 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:14.510
 The temperature is higher than 100 degrees, and the phenomenon that the boiling point becomes higher occurs. 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.710
 That's why it's rising boiling point 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:21.800
 Why is it that something is dissolved in pure water in a Western-style room 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:26.780
 About the mechanism that boiling point rises 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:31.790
 Description to think about things that I want to live is not it boiling point and the is difficult 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.500
 What I have to think about first is what is this super atmospheric pressure shown here 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:39.720
 I need to think about this information 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:45.300
 It is for the detailed explanation of how it is Kirazu in vapor pressure level and what the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.110
 I have prepared a bed for this steam pressure lecture, so I hope you can hear it there 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.300
 But 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.810
 Well momentum Briefly Well it's there is the cheap this solution is trying to evaporation 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.490
 is 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.000
 This solution is not going to provocation 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.400
 This This 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.870
 Evaporating The evaporating momentum is just as easy as it is the vapor pressure 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.560
 That's what it sounds like 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:10.460
 At that time compared to the time of pure water 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:16.020
 It's now when I melt a Western-style room Steam pressure 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.810
 The phenomenon that this falls will happen, and this will be the steam pressure drop. 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:23.560
 The 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:30.430
 The sometimes compared to something state of the say you steam pressure drop which is good Is pure water Fu say 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:32.319
 It is such a phenomenon that the vapor pressure is lowered by melting the western room when it is melted 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.800
 Steam pressure cures 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:43.310
 This in but it was this kind of phenomenon is referred to as the why and the first place the vapor pressure now 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:49.670
 It's a provocative force , but it's the molecule of that water in this pure thing that evaporates 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:55.640
 It is why there is about Well of course mountain in the molecule of water called it 1 suck, but it is the molecule of the water this is 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.819
 It's going to be evaporating, so there 's something now that we're adding Western rooms 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.920
 Well, something 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:06.989
 It's that thing that was this in 10 days, I do not try to evaporation it is is this 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:13.170
 The water evaporates, but the salt evaporates, for example , because it dissolved 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:16.810
 Compared to when it was good or not I'm a mean I do Then originally 100% water as say whether 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:22.270
 The one that wo n't evaporate is at the bottom of the win 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:24.640
 Because long hair does not occur, it means that the first momentum declines. 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.450
 It means that the steam pressure will drop 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:33.970
 First of all, I do not understand the boiling point rise suddenly, but it is the first 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.840
 First it is necessary to understand that pure relative dissolve the steam pressure something manner by drops 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.970
 Right 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:45.160
 The lower the steam pressure on it, the lower the price rises 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:50.290
 Next , I would like to explain the bottom line, but in the first place 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:53.410
 It's such that what it was temperature of that this boiling point about this of vapor pressure 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:57.490
 In the lecture you carry a detailed explanation 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.980
 How is the boiling point decided ? I would like to confirm it now 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.010
 This steam pressure that appeared is this 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.010
 It depends on the temperature, so the higher the temperature 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:11.620
 The value of the steam pressure has increased It is 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:13.400
 For example, if the temperature is water, the higher the temperature is, the more it evaporates. 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:18.139
 The higher the temperature, a positive Author 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:21.019
 The amount depends on the feeling that the dart gets bigger, so it depends on this temperature It is called steam pressure 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:26.760
 It it was a Kimaru value at only temperature of 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:31.710
 This atmospheric pressure in the value of the vapor pressure 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.420
 There is a time when it's equal and when you change the temperature it's almost low then high 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:39.300
 Because the value of steam pressure changes 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:43.240
 So in a certain temperature above it is much waiting there but it is not there is a time that the head is equal to 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:49.120
 Well that's when it comes to that temperature 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:53.979
 This is the boiling point . Well, the mechanism around that is also a lecture of a long-term guy 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.789
 I explain it, but if you check the important point of the rank, the vapor pressure depends on the temperature 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:59.830
 If I change 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:03.260
 So that the temperature at which the vapor pressure value is just equal to the tigers is the boiling point 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:11.510
 It was a matter of course . 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:14.750
 However, now the value of this vapor pressure will be smaller. The value of vapor pressure is the vapor pressure drop. 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:19.490
 Is smaller in smaller from when this 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:23.249
 Atmospheric pressure to Tokyo at the time of the equally no longer will I originally pure and atmospheric pressure 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:27.029
 It seems that the steam pressure will be reduced by melting something from the fishing condition 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:32.579
 Then this will cause the vapor pressure to be less than atmospheric pressure 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:33.539
 In Then this is no longer to boil in why is this temperature no longer is at the boiling point 

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:39.629
 It will not end 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:41.330
 The dough is why there is only sometimes I'll raise the temperature was in the wind that tries to That temperature in 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:44.509
 Raise the temperature 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:51.409
 Let's go in a way of getting a captivity This is Mr. T. This is 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:55.249
 It is a higher value than t, so when the temperature is raised like that, the steam pressure will eventually become 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:58.429
 It will come when it becomes equal to the atmospheric pressure again 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:06:02.629
 Once also do it by raising the temperature even though fell vapor pressure 

00:05:58.429 --> 00:06:07.819
 It will not get tired with the atmospheric pressure anyway 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:08.449
 So boiling occurs when the atmospheric pressure is this vapor pressure because boiling occurs becomes this equal 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:10.990
 Because 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:17.820
 Then that 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:22.890
 This is the boiling point at that time now that I wrote to Fu that the temperature now t fields Mr. 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:28.170
 It's going to be said that at this time it's too late and it's just the t degree 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:32.520
 The temperature is higher in the key dash compared to the 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:37.810
 It is in other words the at the time of the pure water has a boiling point was t the degree of this is 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:42.400
 Even if the air pressure falls in the town by melting something, the super ki's equal equally 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:43.150
 If it doesn't boil, the temperature is raised because it doesn't boil, and the person who wants to see the above 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.770
 Becomes equal 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:53.260
 High temperature this is the solution than the original than the t of time because throat t rush the 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:55.060
 And of'll dissolved something purely that the boiling point will be that the boiling point rises 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.800
 It is this mechanism by say 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:01.879
 Speaking mechanism that is easily the boiling point rise 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:07.250
 This is the cause of the steam pressure drop First of all, the steam pressure drop occurs 

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:13.780
 So that means that the boiling point will rise, and the principal pressure will decrease in this area. 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:13.780
 You must have an understanding with the organized in easy to mistake the fact that the boiling point rises
