00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.240
 this video is presented by asus 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.309
 I am at the company gysi on the 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.869
 computex 2015 and we'll take a look 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.789
 Sandwich 2 to this one right now 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.769
 was presented in comparison to 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:17.869
 predecessor has done a lot 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.080
 we have two sizes this time 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.710
 christo is 49 x 41 mm tall the 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.089
 small so measures 45 x 37 millimeters 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.890
 So it's much smaller 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.140
 the bigger one let you of the size 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.970
 compare with the show 1 the 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.440
 display looks at first glance 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.750
 just as it is out again 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.649
 Amoled display also sees the resolution 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.750
 same thing 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.660
 by the way, android is running on the page 2 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.030
 who 5.1 point one and we have this time 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.300
 also a wlan functionality at the 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.899
 In addition, one is missing 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.699
 Susanne watch 267 certified that is 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.230
 you can also just under the 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.140
 shower so bring no problem! 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.750
 or very slightly swimming that 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.550
 This is called a meter deep for 30 minutes 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.170
 is the maximum on the right side 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.660
 By the way, this is a crown to see 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.760
 crown is not like apple's 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.020
 apple marc watch but it is 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.060
 ultimately just a simple one 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.680
 then one touch of a button longer draufkommt 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.200
 By the way, in the settings 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.600
 pretty much at the sn-resch 2 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.190
 is also that we are very many colors and 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.820
 benders have a total of three colors 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.270
 silver anthracite and so you gold 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.730
 come various tapes in silicone leather 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.350
 or metal and these have turn 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.850
 different colors so here on 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.830
 18 different 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.490
 Possible combinations come that is 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.590
 pretty much 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.450
 and therefore it is probably the most personal 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.560
 smart watch your with android who 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.480
