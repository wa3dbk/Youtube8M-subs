 When I want to use it, I do not take up a place when I can get it out quickly 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:14.190
 This week we will introduce some kind of useful folding goods 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.190

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.640
 The 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.870
 me 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:32.990
 Good Well then 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:36.500
 It is hard to carry luggage even in seasons when there are many events outside, such as barbecues and camping 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:40.830
 So this one 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:44.600
 It is lift and carry that can carry four mornings 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:48.210
 If there is a carry to say 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.250
 I think you carry is easy luggage 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.020

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.400
 Load capacity is 50 kg 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.660
 Ok also transport of the no luggage 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:04.570
 And the recommended point of this carry 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.570
 It's so easy to fold 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:13.860
 When folded, the thickness is 5.8 cm 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:20.790
 If it is this, I will not take a place 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:26.300
 The body is about 3 kg lighter than the can and easy to carry 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.120
 This variety can use a convenient carry and there is one 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.970
 Oh 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.820
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:35.860
 A little 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:39.520
 But it is useful to have a simple springboard when the say 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.659

 It is a step size of just the right size to a little after this set p 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:57.710
 When taking things out of a kitchen shelf that is hard to reach 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.990
 As a platform for tanks 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:07.500
 There are various uses such as shooting at athletic meet 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.229
 Peace of mind with a rubber non-slip is back 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.790
 Even folding 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.900
 So easy 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:23.190
 Storage does not take place either 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:28.370
 I want to put a lovely and functional springboard in my house 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.370
