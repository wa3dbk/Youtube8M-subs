welcome<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.730> my<00:00:14.849> unboxing<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.509> review<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.959> the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
welcome to my unboxing and review of the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.060 
welcome to my unboxing and review of the
a<00:00:16.110> soos<00:00:16.500> geforce<00:00:17.310> gtx<00:00:17.730> 760<00:00:18.450> mars<00:00:19.110> now<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.920> might

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
a soos geforce gtx 760 mars now it might

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.940 
a soos geforce gtx 760 mars now it might
seem<00:00:20.430> like<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.700> regular<00:00:20.939> gtx<00:00:21.720> 760<00:00:22.259> except<00:00:22.830> that

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
seem like a regular gtx 760 except that

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.740 
seem like a regular gtx 760 except that
that<00:00:22.980> one<00:00:23.340> comes<00:00:23.849> in<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.029> package<00:00:24.360> that<00:00:24.540> looks<00:00:24.630> a

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
that one comes in a package that looks a

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.540 
that one comes in a package that looks a
little<00:00:24.810> something<00:00:25.050> like<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.349> so<00:00:25.740> no<00:00:25.919> this<00:00:26.369> is

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
little something like this so no this is

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.310 
little something like this so no this is
something<00:00:26.759> special<00:00:27.300> with<00:00:27.450> the<00:00:27.570> mars<00:00:27.810> branding

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
something special with the mars branding

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.069 
something special with the mars branding
on<00:00:28.439> there<00:00:28.650> we<00:00:28.800> know<00:00:29.099> we're<00:00:29.340> getting<00:00:29.579> something

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
on there we know we're getting something

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.569 
on there we know we're getting something
rog<00:00:31.079> and<00:00:31.290> something<00:00:31.680> a<00:00:31.770> little<00:00:32.009> bit<00:00:32.130> different

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
rog and something a little bit different

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.200 
rog and something a little bit different
so<00:00:32.809> inside<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.050> box<00:00:34.200> packed<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.219> nice<00:00:35.670> soft

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
so inside the box packed in nice soft

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.560 
so inside the box packed in nice soft
closed<00:00:36.630> cell<00:00:36.930> foam<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.500> get<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.070> gtx<00:00:38.610> 760<00:00:39.149> mars

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
closed cell foam we get the gtx 760 mars

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.290 
closed cell foam we get the gtx 760 mars
which<00:00:39.809> has<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> gorgeous<00:00:40.700> direct<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.030> to

it<00:01:35.700> also<00:01:36.060> has<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> full<00:01:36.960> backplate<00:01:37.530> unlike<00:01:37.890> the

it also has a full backplate unlike the

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.459 
it also has a full backplate unlike the
reference<00:01:38.369> gtx<00:01:38.820> 690<00:01:39.390> which<00:01:39.539> does<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> couple<00:01:40.380> of

reference gtx 690 which does a couple of

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.050 
reference gtx 690 which does a couple of
things<00:01:40.649> so<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:40.979> might<00:01:41.369> be<00:01:41.399> able<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.850> argue

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
things so you might be able to argue

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.370 
things so you might be able to argue
that<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.450> helps<00:01:42.689> with<00:01:42.719> heat<00:01:42.899> dissipation<00:01:43.229> a

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
that it helps with heat dissipation a

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.590 
that it helps with heat dissipation a
little<00:01:43.560> bit<00:01:43.680> but<00:01:43.859> it<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.880> what<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.210> also<00:01:45.240> does

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
little bit but it but what it also does

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.179 
little bit but it but what it also does
is<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.869> actually<00:01:46.049> protects<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.740> components

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
is it actually protects the components

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.830 
is it actually protects the components
on<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.310> back<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.700> gives<00:01:47.820> more<00:01:47.969> rigidity<00:01:48.659> to

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
on the back and gives more rigidity to

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.510 
on the back and gives more rigidity to
the<00:01:48.990> card<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.770> it's<00:01:49.890> less<00:01:50.100> likely<00:01:50.490> to

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the card so that it's less likely to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.639 
the card so that it's less likely to
flex<00:01:50.909> speaking<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.689> rigidity<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.259> card<00:01:52.530> it

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
flex speaking of rigidity to the card it

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.889 
flex speaking of rigidity to the card it

the card it has a backplate it on the

yuna sink that actually does contribute

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.090 
yuna sink that actually does contribute
to<00:02:00.240> cooling<00:02:00.479> because<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.380> being<00:02:01.619> actively

performance<00:02:45.330> testing<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.440> performance<00:02:46.950> is

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
performance testing the performance is

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.010 
performance testing the performance is
pretty<00:02:47.220> similar<00:02:47.520> these<00:02:48.120> two<00:02:48.390> fans<00:02:48.660> here<00:02:48.990> are

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
pretty similar these two fans here are

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.110 
pretty similar these two fans here are
their<00:02:49.470> dust<00:02:49.830> proof<00:02:50.130> design<00:02:50.370> fans<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:50.970> this

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
their dust proof design fans so this

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.660 
their dust proof design fans so this
offers<00:02:51.480> extended<00:02:52.020> longevity<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:53.459> they'll

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
offers extended longevity and so they'll

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.220 
offers extended longevity and so they'll
basically<00:02:53.850> just<00:02:54.480> last<00:02:54.750> longer<00:02:55.050> without

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230

it<00:03:05.660> this<00:03:06.660> card<00:03:07.020> won't<00:03:07.650> perform<00:03:07.860> that

it this card won't perform that

it this card won't perform that
differently<00:03:08.820> from<00:03:09.360> two<00:03:09.630> gtx<00:03:10.190> 760<00:03:11.190> directs<00:03:11.910> you

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
bling bling so let's get into

bling bling so let's get into
performance<00:03:16.830> numbers<00:03:17.220> what<00:03:17.940> do<00:03:18.060> we<00:03:18.180> compare

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660

Seuss's own numbers reference Titan a
lot<00:03:22.920> but<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.160> don't<00:03:23.250> think<00:03:23.489> that<00:03:23.700> makes<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:24.030> lot

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
lot but I don't think that makes a lot

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.850 
lot but I don't think that makes a lot
of<00:03:24.209> sense<00:03:24.510> because<00:03:24.720> Titan<00:03:25.200> is<00:03:25.290> significantly

of sense because Titan is significantly

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.130 
of sense because Titan is significantly
