00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
texture of it here so like the curl

texture of it here so like the curl
pattern<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.760> really<00:00:59.940> not<00:01:00.180> formed<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
pattern is really not formed and the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.030 
pattern is really not formed and the
problem<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.229> apply<00:01:04.710> water

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
problem is is that I have to apply water

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.370 
problem is is that I have to apply water
and<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.820> apply<00:01:05.939> water<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.780> don't<00:01:07.110> want<00:01:07.229> my

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
and if I apply water I don't want my

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.770 
and if I apply water I don't want my
leaves<00:01:07.710> out<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.979> get<00:01:08.189> wet<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:09.060> normally<00:01:09.750> I

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
leaves out to get wet so normally I

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.270 
leaves out to get wet so normally I
would<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.020> use<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> spray<00:01:10.530> bottle<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:11.040> can't

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
would just use a spray bottle but can't

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.100 
would just use a spray bottle but can't
do<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.850> way<00:01:12.090> because<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.750> leave<00:01:12.900> out

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
do it that way because of the leave out

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.700 
do it that way because of the leave out
so<00:01:13.830> what<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.090> basically<00:01:15.479> wet<00:01:16.110> my<00:01:16.290> hands

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
so what I do is I basically wet my hands

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.550 
so what I do is I basically wet my hands
with<00:01:16.920> water<00:01:17.450> not<00:01:18.450> using<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.780> spray<00:01:18.990> bottle<00:01:19.200> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
with water not using a spray bottle and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.160 
with water not using a spray bottle and
from<00:01:20.100> there<00:01:20.340> with<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.060> water<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.420> my<00:01:21.630> hand<00:01:21.869> I

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
from there with the water on my hand I

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.550 
from there with the water on my hand I
basically<00:01:22.710> just<00:01:22.830> gently<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:24.020> finger<00:01:25.020> detangle

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
basically just gently a finger detangle

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.679

completely<00:01:45.390> wet<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.530> where<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.070> damp

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
completely wet but where it is damp

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.580 
completely wet but where it is damp
enough<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.270> start<00:01:48.630> kind<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.049> like<00:01:49.229> finger

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
enough to start kind of like finger

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.010 
enough to start kind of like finger
detangling<00:01:50.070> through<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.820> then<00:01:51.330> fluff<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.840> out

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
detangling through and then fluff it out

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.889 
detangling through and then fluff it out
to<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.890> potential<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.580> wanted<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:54.240> so

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
to the potential that I wanted to be so

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.310 
to the potential that I wanted to be so
I<00:01:55.200> basically<00:01:55.409> do<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:56.610> each<00:01:56.939> section<00:01:57.899> of

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
I basically do that for each section of

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.219 
I basically do that for each section of
the<00:01:58.560> hair<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.580> my<00:02:00.119> hair<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.479> three<00:02:00.720> parts<00:02:00.750> I

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
the hair so my hair is in three parts I

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.289 
the hair so my hair is in three parts I
kind<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.500> do<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.009> three<00:02:02.280> or<00:02:02.460> four<00:02:02.729> part

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
kind of do this in a three or four part

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.060 
kind of do this in a three or four part
me<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:03.990> are<00:02:04.080> kind<00:02:04.289> of<00:02:04.320> split<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.710> back<00:02:04.890> up

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
me and are kind of split in the back up

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.279 
me and are kind of split in the back up
into<00:02:05.310> two<00:02:05.460> parts<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.780> just<00:02:06.990> finger

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
into two parts and I just finger

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.050 
into two parts and I just finger
detangle<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.130> I've<00:02:08.310> told<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.610> guys<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.759> had<00:02:09.030> a

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
detangle and I've told you guys I had a

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.490 
detangle and I've told you guys I had a
little<00:02:09.239> matting<00:02:09.720> with<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:09.989> hair<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.470> I

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
little matting with this hair so I

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.949 
little matting with this hair so I
basically<00:02:10.860> use<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.670> water<00:02:11.880> finger<00:02:12.390> detangle

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
basically use the water finger detangle

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.620 
basically use the water finger detangle
as<00:02:13.769> I<00:02:13.950> go<00:02:14.100> as<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.459> can<00:02:14.610> see<00:02:14.819> water<00:02:15.330> use

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
as I go as you can see water use

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.720 
as I go as you can see water use
immediately<00:02:15.900> transforms<00:02:16.799> these<00:02:17.040> curls<00:02:17.519> look

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
immediately transforms these curls look

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.240 
immediately transforms these curls look
at<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:17.940> curl<00:02:18.150> pattern<00:02:18.180> now<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:19.470> water<00:02:19.950> does

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
at the curl pattern now so water does

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.280 
at the curl pattern now so water does
the<00:02:20.280> trick<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.030> I'm<00:02:21.660> just<00:02:21.810> going<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.019> repeat

leave<00:03:28.230> out<00:03:28.440> here<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:29.220> doesn't<00:03:29.700> mess<00:03:29.880> up

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
leave out here it doesn't mess up

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.720 
leave out here it doesn't mess up
so<00:03:31.570> as<00:03:31.900> you<00:03:32.170> can<00:03:32.290> see<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.950> hair<00:03:33.190> is<00:03:33.220> a<00:03:33.370> little

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
so as you can see the hair is a little

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.570 
so as you can see the hair is a little
more<00:03:33.850> dry<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.540> so<00:03:35.110> when<00:03:35.740> I'm<00:03:35.890> taking<00:03:36.250> my<00:03:36.340> leave

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
more dry and so when I'm taking my leave

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.210 
more dry and so when I'm taking my leave
out<00:03:36.820> out<00:03:37.090> this<00:03:37.750> will<00:03:37.930> be<00:03:37.960> perfect<00:03:38.320> because<00:03:38.740> it

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
out out this will be perfect because it

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.610 
out out this will be perfect because it
won't<00:03:39.490> my<00:03:40.120> hair<00:03:40.330> won't<00:03:40.480> frizz<00:03:40.810> up<00:03:41.050> from<00:03:41.440> the

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
won't my hair won't frizz up from the

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.750 
won't my hair won't frizz up from the
the<00:03:42.100> deafness<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:43.120> other<00:03:43.240> hair<00:03:44.220> okay<00:03:45.220> so

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
the deafness of the other hair okay so

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.000 
the deafness of the other hair okay so
now<00:03:46.420> that<00:03:46.450> I've<00:03:46.750> allowed<00:03:47.080> my<00:03:47.320> hair<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.800> some

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
now that I've allowed my hair to some

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.520 
now that I've allowed my hair to some
time<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.460> dry<00:03:48.670> I'm<00:03:49.270> basically<00:03:49.870> just<00:03:49.990> going<00:03:50.350> to

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
through blending my hair and here's a

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.520 
through blending my hair and here's a
tip<00:04:02.440> I<00:04:03.250> don't<00:04:04.090> always<00:04:04.450> do<00:04:04.690> these<00:04:04.840> twists<00:04:05.170> every

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
tip I don't always do these twists every

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.070 
tip I don't always do these twists every
day<00:04:05.710> so<00:04:06.400> if<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:07.060> twists<00:04:07.360> are<00:04:07.480> intact

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
day so if the twists are intact

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.860 
day so if the twists are intact
I<00:04:08.110> basically<00:04:08.410> just<00:04:08.680> separate<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.430> hair<00:04:09.870> from

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
I basically just separate the hair from

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.170 
I basically just separate the hair from
the<00:04:10.990> beads

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
the beads

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.839 
the beads
do<00:04:12.689> the<00:04:12.840> same<00:04:13.109> process<00:04:13.439> as<00:04:13.829> far<00:04:13.859> as<00:04:14.280> my<00:04:14.519> daily

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
do the same process as far as my daily

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.779 
do the same process as far as my daily
making<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:16.380> just<00:04:16.859> continue<00:04:17.250> on<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.639> that's

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
making and I just continue on and that's

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.550 
making and I just continue on and that's
pretty<00:04:17.970> much<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.239> so<00:04:18.690> that<00:04:18.930> is<00:04:19.049> my<00:04:19.199> daily

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
pretty much it so that is my daily

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.180

nightly maintenance is a breeze I

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.469 
nightly maintenance is a breeze I
basically<00:04:32.310> go<00:04:32.759> through<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.030> process<00:04:33.419> of

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
basically go through the process of

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.570 
basically go through the process of
using<00:04:33.660> ponytail<00:04:34.199> holders<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:35.009> take<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.370> hair

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
out from the hair and I'm basically

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.990 
out from the hair and I'm basically
taking<00:04:43.229> one<00:04:43.830> point<00:04:44.070> two<00:04:44.190> holder<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:44.699> put<00:04:44.910> it

taking one point two holder and put it

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.180 
taking one point two holder and put it
at<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.210> very<00:04:45.479> top<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:45.930> here<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.740> one<00:04:46.979> in<00:04:47.099> the

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
at the very top to here the one in the

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.029 
at the very top to here the one in the
middle<00:04:47.370> and<00:04:47.669> one<00:04:48.120> at<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.240> end<00:04:48.360> I<00:04:49.020> do<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.830> same

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
middle and one at the end I do the same

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:51.950 
middle and one at the end I do the same
for<00:04:50.099> the<00:04:50.460> other<00:04:50.639> side<00:04:50.699> again<00:04:51.599> I<00:04:51.630> take<00:04:51.900> a

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
for the other side again I take a

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.770 
for the other side again I take a
ponytail<00:04:52.349> holder<00:04:52.560> I<00:04:53.130> put<00:04:54.030> one<00:04:54.330> at<00:04:54.449> the<00:04:54.570> very

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780

top<00:04:55.020> of<00:04:55.229> the<00:04:55.349> hair<00:04:55.590> one<00:04:56.340> in<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.550> middle<00:04:56.940> and

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.879 
top of the hair one in the middle and
one<00:04:57.419> at<00:04:57.509> the<00:04:57.539> end<00:04:57.660> and<00:04:58.139> the<00:04:58.259> purpose<00:04:58.620> of<00:04:58.740> this

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
one at the end and the purpose of this

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.850 
one at the end and the purpose of this
is<00:04:59.099> just<00:04:59.250> to<00:04:59.340> keep<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.789> hair<00:05:00.150> in<00:05:01.020> place<00:05:01.470> so

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
is just to keep the hair in place so

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.760 
is just to keep the hair in place so
when<00:05:02.009> I'm<00:05:02.130> sleeping<00:05:02.699> it<00:05:02.940> doesn't<00:05:03.330> matte<00:05:03.660> or<00:05:04.080> or

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
when I'm sleeping it doesn't matte or or

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.790 
when I'm sleeping it doesn't matte or or
frizz<00:05:05.099> up<00:05:05.130> even<00:05:06.030> more<00:05:06.240> and<00:05:06.539> so<00:05:06.599> basically<00:05:07.380> I'm

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
frizz up even more and so basically I'm

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.409 
frizz up even more and so basically I'm
just<00:05:07.979> trying<00:05:08.220> to<00:05:08.250> protect<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.759> hair<00:05:09.000> as<00:05:09.120> best

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
just trying to protect the hair as best

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.379 
just trying to protect the hair as best
as<00:05:09.570> I<00:05:09.690> know<00:05:09.750> how<00:05:10.080> so<00:05:10.740> I<00:05:10.770> do<00:05:10.889> that<00:05:11.220> for<00:05:11.550> all<00:05:12.120> three

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
as I know how so I do that for all three

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.260 
as I know how so I do that for all three
sections<00:05:12.900> of<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.440> weave<00:05:13.770> and<00:05:14.190> then<00:05:14.880> from

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
sections of the weave and then from

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.060 
sections of the weave and then from
there<00:05:15.539> I<00:05:15.840> basically<00:05:16.380> just<00:05:16.500> take<00:05:17.010> the<00:05:17.220> hair<00:05:17.520> and

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070
