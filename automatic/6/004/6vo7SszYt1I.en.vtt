00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.290
 hi youtubers today i will show you the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.530
 mythical beings that in the real 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.930
 they have been discovered 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.970
 effect to make a video 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.010
 to start you notice that anything 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.440
 animation or video that you want me to do 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.860
 you just have to comment, let's start with the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.860
 video 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.480
 67 it has been concluded that the hairs of 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.029
 mysterious creatures analyzed by him 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.640
 are bear bears the hairs of the 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.980
 assumptions and x as they were rated 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.199
 in Nepal by people from the area 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.059
 result of the investigation establishes 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.339
 that the two samples are genetically 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.440
 identical to a species of polar bear 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.780
 located formerly in svalbard 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.420
 Norway 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.190
 the result indicates that polar bears and 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.199
 of brown fur have crossed in 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.960
 common territories for thousands of 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.059
 years generating hybrid species like this 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.809
 which is just a cross between different 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.809
 types of bears 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.780
 5 chupacabras what really is a 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.490
 coyote with a disease that falls 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.159
 the skin until it becomes the 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.580
 little monster that you see a serious weapons to 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.580
 optics 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.530
 4 giant squid architeuthis as 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.079
 scientific name can get to measure 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.210
 up to 20 meters so legends 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.789
 old ones could be likely by taking 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.679
 this as a reference they have a way 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.329
 deadly to digest the prey with the 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.759
 teeth of rings in the tentacles 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.179
 they catch the prey while the beak makes 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.179
 suction 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.610
 3 Cyclops child is a disease 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.650
 genetics caused by a failure in 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.170
 cells by the presentation of a 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.299
 Additional chromosome is a syndrome of 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.250
 malformation that has no class 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.990
 of cure or concrete treatment and that 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.259
 makes those who suffer suffer 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.670
 serious physical and mental inadequacies 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.670
 they have little chance of surviving 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.390
 2 dragon is just a simple myth taking 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.790
 as reference skeletons of 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.079
 tiranosaurius rex very likely 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.079
 close to money vaults 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.420
 1 megalodon this is probably 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.489
 exist in abyssal depths but 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.379
 due to the great extent of the sea this 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.060
 it's hard to find 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.099
 they say that in discovery max in a 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.739
 expedition on December 22 of 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.040
 2013 is believed to be one according to the 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.040
 Photographs 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.760
 that's all for today I hope you have them 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:36.340
 liked and remember if you liked what 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.340
 what he did would help me a lot until then
