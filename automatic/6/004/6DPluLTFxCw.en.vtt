00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.339
 played in Madrid a final 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.979

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.710
 that when the game was over he gave a 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.780
 jump and climbed up the goal 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.549

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.080
 valencianista because they are many years and 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:24.000

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.119
