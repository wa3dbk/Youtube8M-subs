because they're very inexpensive I think

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.860 
because they're very inexpensive I think
each<00:03:59.520> of<00:03:59.550> these<00:03:59.850> were<00:04:00.030> two<00:04:00.240> dollars<00:04:00.570> apiece

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
each of these were two dollars apiece

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.870 
each of these were two dollars apiece
and<00:04:01.170> they're<00:04:01.740> really<00:04:02.070> great<00:04:02.190> quality<00:04:02.490> there's
