00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:29.529
 champions who like my routine 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.529
 I have seen many questions to mark 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.629
 routine and almost always bring it 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.760
 Similar 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.070
 normally the weight with an exercise 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.860
 quiet this to sign 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.110
 joints warm up well and then 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.309
 there I move to a heavy free exercise 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.100
 let's say I'm going to train chest I start with 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.110
 some light orange cables 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.100
 lubricious and hot joints in the 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:04.580
 chest and then I move to exercise 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.789
 heavy for example a 23 inclined or 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.000
 you come to plan and add meto began to 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:13.700
 do not take the requests with a 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.140
 disc and then with two equal discs and 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.240
 then with three already against her what 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.700
 I consider it heavy then I count the 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.670
 series is first series and one with four 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.950
 discs some 36 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.590
 46 heavy after there I'm 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.299
 moving yahel avis series otri series 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.100
 more intense more intensity of 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.979
 high repetitions nothing of sescam their 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.440
 tensions managing to call the intensity 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.870
 not so thick 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.100
 and after that, the same again to another 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.930
 heavy exercise for isolation and 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.330
 after there he finished with an exercise 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.640
 of pumping and we give 6 sets of 15 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.180
 repetitions with nothing to rest or 10 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.760
 seconds of rest for these routines and 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.110
 the routines are not to define for 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.110
 all grow 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.510
 many times to mark is not true if 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.399
 You make variation of detentions more 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.620
 repetitions matched a bit more 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.050
 hardness work different fibers but 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.790
 all are to grow equally already with 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.060
 a lot of weight you work different fibers 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.490
 also tours and the widest and you see 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.380
 you create a little more sizes but good 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.770
 that's how I bring my routine in 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.640
 all the muscles of the exercise 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.780
 light heating second exercise 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.360
 heavy if it is 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.150
 legs the squats and back a 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.520
 rowing if you're a man press 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.160
 ok third exercise to me would be a 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.050
 slight intensity three turns respect 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.870
 if you jump little rest fourth exercise 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.270
 isolation this same heavy but more 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.900
 that nothing with very good technique and last 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:01.930
 firefighter exercise 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:04.930
 do your routines and thus establish the 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.930
 champion 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.370
 one
