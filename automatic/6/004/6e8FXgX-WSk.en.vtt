00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.290
 now all these others in hd you are black 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.240
 and he wonders why this is a 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.550
 bit early because I took a 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.610
 full fucking minute to kill this 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.279
 person in one against 115 deaths in 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.410
 simple and with the new update 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.449
 now very well guys I really made a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.420
 big shit when I say I do leave 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.140
 grab the control and I dropped it and the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.440
 right trigger landed on top of a 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.030
 metal tip and good fucked be by 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.340
 that in times that you are going to see in 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.649
 what does not shoot the enemy is of a 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.690
 shot is weak and did not shoot him like that is 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.149
 simple good really nothing else I want 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.030
 give my opinion about the update and 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.070
 give advice to all of you gentlemen 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.170
 Misses and aliens who are watching 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.210
 this video now very well guys 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.300
 really the update is excellent 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.470
 all the automatic rifle in town 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.300
 balanced in a way that they are 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.430
 powerful person and easy to use 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.740
 for example in this situation in this 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.899
 one against one something many examples of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.460
 how to use this suppressor were 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.659
 there are really times that I miss the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.420
 enemy 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.909
 in the correct way instead of using the br 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.399
 or some other weapon now very well kid 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.500
 the update greatly influences the 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.350
 precision weapons like the repelus 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.749
 carving test of mary and carbine 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.340
 but obviously not really many 

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:34.500
 people are used to using 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.869
 these weapons for example I do not use much 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.819
 from the carbine and look at that branch I kill myself 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.609
 a bastard after I killed him 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.859
 that's legal I want a crap egg not 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.270
 well speaking seriously when really 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:47.789
 things are a bit strange for 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.319
 we really do not have like that 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.640
 a little more scary for example there's 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.829
 many people who are going to use us 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.349
 the light rifle usually have him 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.810
 afraid to use that weapon or get used to it and 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:59.250
 times they even insult him or 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.689
 recommend not using the good from my 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.090
 point of view the luso rifle in a weapon 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.099
 excellent and more when you have the zoom a 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.869
 weapon very difficult to use as if it were 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:08.549
 a suppressor since a weapon promises and 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.530
 really most of the weapons 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.290
 they promise they are not so simple to use 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.569
 now very well the head of light is like the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.079
 When you're not aiming at the sun 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.060
 when with the zoom is like a fear 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:23.880
 when people are used 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.739
 types of repelÃºs is very simple to use it 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.060
 same with the carbine really I do not 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.310
 I'm used to the chaperone that 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.530
 although sometimes I use it in some 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.880
 departures now very well guys what's up 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.770
 with the carbine the carbine has to be 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.900
 have much more precision 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.480
 precision than that of mere the br for 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.150
 to be able to kill a person quickly and not 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.519
 I'll hurt you a lot now that it happens with the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.440
 from mary the rifle goes also that of m &amp; r no 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.569
 it must be in all situations I 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.330
 I explain when the person is using a 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.730
 of m &amp; r should not kill someone 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.980
 simply by far from short or from 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.900
 medium range or range like you 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.260
 want to say rather be a little more 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.330
 simple that nothing months specifically 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.130
 made for far comedians in 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.200
 change when you are facing a 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.360
 dog or with a carbine or rifle 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.730
 of battle sorry I repeated it with a rifle 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.610
 of assault before the update the 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.349
 dmr was the most powerful weapon in 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.150
 all situations now with this 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.250
 really update all weapons 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.290
 they have a chance to be over powerful 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.019
 or powerful in different situations 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.510
 for example , m &amp; r is already what it says 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.810
 effective from far but not close 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.300
 why 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.459
 you have assault rifle the br carbine 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.680
 the suppressor efe storm until the 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.500
 pistol the hand is a super weapon 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.569
 powerful in short and medium reach 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.790
 but already when it moves away a little bit like 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.650
 that long reach over the tricks 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.390
 they want them to say really do not have 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.280
 a specific name for that is already 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.500
 the power is just the same with the 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.090
 Equal assault with the same shotgun 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.220
 with battle rifle et cetera etcetera 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.590
 then when we are with the rifle 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.720
 light or with the suppressor really are 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.280
 very complicated weapons use the suppressor 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.380
 is much more complicated than using 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.760
 reflector mind of saying jump the rifle 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.400
 of light is much more complicated than using 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.519
 that the rifles battles the dmr and 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.890
 really everything has as it is said a 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.170
 chemistry if you know how to use that chemistry if 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.940
 you synchronize with that chemistry with 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.769
 this weapon system 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.989
 it's probably going to be much better than 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.419
 before and will dominate other players 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.740
 with these weapons now very good guys 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.090
 really me in this example was I 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.620
 I just had to use shelter 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.300
 battle you have to get used to 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.270
 these things you have to get used to that 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.729
 system that good the suppressor is not 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.520
 good in situations far away really 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.860
 It is very 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.470
 very powerful close up practically in 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.970
 your face but not of medium length that one 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.229
 you have to be accustomed to 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.490
 boiled range 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.860
 now my opinion this update 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.470
 it really gave me a chance to all 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.370
 weapons when I say all is all rifle 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.250
 assault rifles 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.750
 efe storm all mother in series from 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.419
 my point of view of really is a 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.560
 precision that is full to the address 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.930
 correct 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.169
 343 did an excellent job in adding 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.570
 a great update for you to gilo 4 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.030
 go as it is said building a new 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.830
 base a new system for the new hey 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.510
 what it would be and the five consoles 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.620
 now very clearly really many 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.350
 people are used to using 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.850
 weapons like carbines really I do not 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.960
 I'm used to carbines but 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.910
 I'm trying to use it 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.400
 little by little that 's my recommendation to 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.560
 you me being you start using 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.110
 different weapons really improves ideal 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.330
 of m &amp; r or if you really like the br 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.460
 as I now use other weapons let's 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.490
 to start using the rifle or start 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.680
 use the obama carbine to start using the 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.720
 rifle assault suppressor rifle storm 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.510
 really now yes the four now a 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.940
 little choice when said power since 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.949
 the dmr now is not the main weapon that 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.479
 everyone will use 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:49.580
 lately he was playing in the 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.400
 four is already liking carbine rifle and 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.830
 loose rifle assault and pr and from time to time 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.430
 when to fear 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.860
 although I'm still sorry I 'm still thinking 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.020
 that weapon remains the fag not 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.420
 I know but really that weapon should not be 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.180
 in game I do not know I think I think it's a 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:11.450
 buggy bug bring that that gun and what 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.760
 rich and manipulate not manipulate but as 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.400
 refer to 343 to use those 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.410
 arms the next trilogy in my 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.600
 opinion the dmr should not be in the 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.480
 game since we already have several weapons of 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.910
 Far away from all kinds of fun 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.820
 like that other people's chance 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.990
 complain or ruin a game and good 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.940
 guys really that's all that 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.340
 I want to say for today I hope the video 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.690
 if you liked it, please, I like it and if 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.460
 you want to share with all these friends 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.680
 to see that really weapons 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.780
 they are really good the update is 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.630
 a good chance to start using other 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.969
 weapons and start learning to use them and 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.909
 well from my point of view I think that 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:52.699
 the production was an excellent job 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:54.860
 done for 343 and week that I'm going to 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:56.629
 leave up here good guys without being 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.429
 This one liked to like I repeat 

00:06:56.629 --> 00:07:00.829
 Share it with your friends if you want 

00:06:58.429 --> 00:07:02.209
 they know more in this and without anything 

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:04.759
 to say I leave you with terms 

00:07:02.209 --> 00:07:06.559
 second against 115 to one was this 20 

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:08.149
 but I really got bored me control 

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:09.949
 I was going up a lot if you were to be 

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:11.929
 a little and gameplay you will notice 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:16.539
 can you guys without anything else to say 

00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:16.539
 See you I'm such a berghes black
