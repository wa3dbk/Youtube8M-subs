long time with a great track record and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.859 
long time with a great track record and
he<00:01:41.159> wrote<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.759> book<00:01:41.970> which<00:01:42.180> explains<00:01:42.210> things

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
he wrote this book which explains things

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.560 
he wrote this book which explains things
a<00:01:43.140> lot<00:01:43.950> more<00:01:44.130> in-depth<00:01:44.460> than<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.700> think<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:45.090> lot

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
a lot more in-depth than I think a lot

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.999 
a lot more in-depth than I think a lot
of<00:01:45.600> other<00:01:45.780> people<00:01:46.049> explain<00:01:46.380> them<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:46.920> he

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
of other people explain them but he

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:47.960 
of other people explain them but he
expensive<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> way<00:01:47.520> that's<00:01:47.670> easy<00:01:47.880> to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
expensive in a way that's easy to

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.380 
expensive in a way that's easy to
understand<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.880> like<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.909> said<00:01:51.149> he<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.360> a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
understand and like I said he is a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.639 
understand and like I said he is a
science<00:01:51.780> guy<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.079> for<00:01:52.229> those<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.530> are

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
science guy so for those of you that are

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.260 
science guy so for those of you that are
into<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.920> science<00:01:53.189> stuff<00:01:53.369> he<00:01:53.880> talks<00:01:54.149> about

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
into the science stuff he talks about

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.100 
into the science stuff he talks about
stuff<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.659> that

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
stuff like that

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.359 
stuff like that
but<00:01:55.439> he<00:01:55.500> puts<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.829> way<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.250> all

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
but he puts in a way that we can all

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.959 
but he puts in a way that we can all
understand<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.229> let's<00:01:58.229> get<00:01:58.380> started<00:01:58.799> with

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
understand so let's get started with

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:04.670 
understand so let's get started with
let's<00:01:59.969> see<00:02:01.189> alright<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.909> he<00:02:03.119> talks<00:02:03.360> about<00:02:03.680> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
let's see alright so he talks about the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.130 
let's see alright so he talks about the
carbohydrates<00:02:05.369> not<00:02:05.969> being<00:02:06.390> all<00:02:06.600> equal<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.079> he

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
carbohydrates not being all equal and he

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.680 
carbohydrates not being all equal and he
also<00:02:07.259> does<00:02:07.469> also<00:02:07.740> talk<00:02:07.920> about<00:02:07.950> how<00:02:08.690> certain

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
also does also talk about how certain

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.630 
also does also talk about how certain
foods<00:02:10.020> elicit<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:10.709> certain

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
foods elicit for certain

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.920 
foods elicit for certain
moment<00:02:12.000> responses<00:02:12.450> which<00:02:12.600> is<00:02:12.720> what<00:02:12.840> I've

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
moment responses which is what I've

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.150 
moment responses which is what I've
tried<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.170> explain<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.500> you<00:02:13.560> guys<00:02:13.590> many<00:02:13.890> times

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
tried to explain to you guys many times

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.430 
tried to explain to you guys many times
so<00:02:14.940> he<00:02:15.000> says<00:02:15.150> while<00:02:15.330> 200<00:02:15.720> calories<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.230> game

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
so he says while 200 calories of a game

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.920 
so he says while 200 calories of a game
look<00:02:16.640> illicit<00:02:17.640> less<00:02:17.970> insulin<00:02:18.420> than<00:02:18.600> 200

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
look illicit less insulin than 200

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.510 
look illicit less insulin than 200
counties<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.290> refined<00:02:19.620> foods<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.130> pretzels

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
counties of refined foods just pretzels

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.790 
counties of refined foods just pretzels
or<00:02:21.150> fat-free<00:02:21.569> potato<00:02:21.930> chips<00:02:22.200> there's<00:02:22.620> another

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
or fat-free potato chips there's another

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.130 
or fat-free potato chips there's another
aspect<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.310> complex<00:02:23.760> crops<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.150> consider<00:02:24.480> the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
aspect of complex crops to consider the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.720 
aspect of complex crops to consider the
more<00:02:25.350> refined<00:02:25.650> processor<00:02:26.370> cooked<00:02:26.610> the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
more refined processor cooked the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.730 
more refined processor cooked the
complex<00:02:27.120> carbohydrate<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:28.230> faster<00:02:28.680> it

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
complex carbohydrate the faster it

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.650 
complex carbohydrate the faster it
breaks<00:02:28.920> down<00:02:29.070> into<00:02:29.340> glucose<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:30.000> guy<00:02:30.450> that

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
breaks down into glucose a guy that

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.980 
breaks down into glucose a guy that
means<00:02:30.780> if<00:02:31.430> obviously<00:02:32.430> it's<00:02:33.000> refined<00:02:33.690> too<00:02:33.840> much

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
means if obviously it's refined too much

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.570 
means if obviously it's refined too much
it<00:02:34.140> breaks<00:02:34.320> down<00:02:34.350> faster<00:02:34.860> like<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> sugar<00:02:35.280> even

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
it breaks down faster like a sugar even

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.160 
it breaks down faster like a sugar even
if<00:02:35.640> it's<00:02:35.760> not<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.910> sure<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.840> even<00:02:36.959> have<00:02:37.050> to

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
if it's not a sure so you even have to

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.930 
if it's not a sure so you even have to
green<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:37.590> process<00:02:38.040> then<00:02:38.190> reduce<00:02:38.459> down<00:02:38.670> it's

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
green this process then reduce down it's

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.390 
green this process then reduce down it's
still<00:02:39.180> going<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.360> process<00:02:39.540> like<00:02:40.100> in<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.220> field

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
still going to process like in a field

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.340 
still going to process like in a field
like<00:02:41.670> it's<00:02:41.910> white<00:02:42.180> bread<00:02:42.420> for<00:02:42.600> instance<00:02:42.900> is

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
like it's white bread for instance is

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.690 
like it's white bread for instance is
going<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.590> process<00:02:43.830> pretty<00:02:44.160> much<00:02:44.340> just<00:02:44.520> like<00:02:44.640> a

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
going to process pretty much just like a

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.260 
going to process pretty much just like a
sugar<00:02:44.970> because<00:02:45.180> it's<00:02:45.300> processed<00:02:45.720> so<00:02:45.780> much<00:02:45.989> so

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
sugar because it's processed so much so

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.060 
sugar because it's processed so much so
it's<00:02:48.270> an<00:02:48.360> intern<00:02:48.690> effects<00:02:49.290> insulin<00:02:49.680> levels<00:02:49.950> no

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
it's an intern effects insulin levels no

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.280 
it's an intern effects insulin levels no
he<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.519> a<00:02:50.550> very<00:02:50.700> big<00:02:50.910> believer<00:02:51.000> in<00:02:51.450> insulin

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
he is a very big believer in insulin

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.430 
he is a very big believer in insulin
levels<00:02:52.560> affecting<00:02:53.040> fat<00:02:53.730> loss<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.840> my<00:02:55.050> because

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
levels affecting fat loss so my because

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.470

the<00:03:27.450> easier<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.840> is<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:27.959> digest<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.680> the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
greater the insulin spike is so eating

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.750 
greater the insulin spike is so eating
mashed<00:03:31.470> potatoes<00:03:31.890> is<00:03:31.980> not<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.310> same<00:03:32.489> thing<00:03:32.670> as

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
mashed potatoes is not the same thing as

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.470 
mashed potatoes is not the same thing as
eating<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.000> potato

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
eating a potato

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.120 
eating a potato
I<00:03:33.510> look<00:03:34.049> at<00:03:34.170> firsthand<00:03:34.440> because<00:03:34.620> when<00:03:34.860> I<00:03:34.890> was

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
I look at firsthand because when I was

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.310 
I look at firsthand because when I was
eating<00:03:35.250> mashed<00:03:35.459> potatoes<00:03:35.880> saying<00:03:36.540> I'm<00:03:36.720> eating

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
eating mashed potatoes saying I'm eating

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.710 
eating mashed potatoes saying I'm eating
potatoes<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:37.890> I<00:03:38.340> got<00:03:38.489> fat<00:03:38.820> it's<00:03:39.150> not<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.510> same

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
potatoes and I got fat it's not the same

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.410 
potatoes and I got fat it's not the same
so<00:03:39.989> it's<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.170> different<00:03:40.470> hormone<00:03:40.680> response<00:03:41.420> to

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
so it's a different hormone response to

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.660 
so it's a different hormone response to
a<00:03:42.450> similar<00:03:42.900> food<00:03:43.250> another<00:03:44.250> thing<00:03:44.370> he<00:03:44.459> talks

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
a similar food another thing he talks

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.600 
a similar food another thing he talks
about<00:03:44.760> is<00:03:45.170> elevated<00:03:46.170> insulin<00:03:46.320> levels<00:03:46.590> for<00:03:47.549> the

about is elevated insulin levels for the

person hoping to control body fat is

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.890 
person hoping to control body fat is

or<00:04:03.299> you<00:04:03.329> lose<00:04:03.600> very<00:04:03.780> little<00:04:03.900> fat

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
or you lose very little fat

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
certain point basically shuts down fat

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.069 
certain point basically shuts down fat
loss<00:04:14.190> so<00:04:14.880> therefore<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.570> foods<00:04:15.840> that<00:04:15.900> you

take in cause that insulin response

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.420 
take in cause that insulin response
which<00:04:18.630> can<00:04:18.870> either<00:04:19.019> speed<00:04:19.440> or<00:04:19.680> slow<00:04:19.830> down<00:04:20.039> fat

caloric limits

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.050

that's<00:04:31.950> what<00:04:32.160> I<00:04:32.190> just<00:04:32.250> said<00:04:32.490> so<00:04:33.060> basically

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
that's what I just said so basically

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.740 
that's what I just said so basically
let's<00:04:33.720> say<00:04:34.430> these<00:04:35.430> guys<00:04:35.669> who<00:04:36.000> you<00:04:36.660> know

let's say these guys who you know

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.820 
let's say these guys who you know
they're<00:04:36.900> eating<00:04:37.080> like<00:04:37.169> 500<00:04:37.620> grams<00:04:37.770> of

weeks to get lean why do you think
that's<00:04:50.910> happening<00:04:51.060> because<00:04:51.750> you're<00:04:51.930> slowing

foods<00:04:54.710> that<00:04:55.710> reverse<00:04:56.130> what<00:04:56.310> you're<00:04:56.460> trying<00:04:56.639> to

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
foods that reverse what you're trying to

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.240 
foods that reverse what you're trying to
do<00:04:56.820> if<00:04:57.540> your<00:04:57.690> bodies<00:04:57.930> are<00:04:58.020> secreting<00:04:58.860> too<00:04:59.070> much

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
do if your bodies are secreting too much

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.250 
do if your bodies are secreting too much
insulin<00:04:59.610> not<00:05:00.240> just<00:05:00.419> insulin<00:05:00.750> as<00:05:00.840> air<00:05:00.930> but<00:05:01.110> too

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
insulin not just insulin as air but too

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.740 
insulin not just insulin as air but too
much<00:05:01.440> insulin<00:05:01.850> you<00:05:02.850> are<00:05:03.120> going<00:05:03.360> to<00:05:03.419> burn<00:05:03.510> fat

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
much insulin you are going to burn fat

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.390 
much insulin you are going to burn fat
at<00:05:03.900> a<00:05:03.960> slower<00:05:04.169> pace<00:05:04.200> your<00:05:04.680> body's<00:05:04.919> in<00:05:05.040> storage

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
at a slower pace your body's in storage

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.430 
at a slower pace your body's in storage
mode<00:05:05.550> it<00:05:05.700> does<00:05:05.880> not<00:05:06.090> burn<00:05:06.480> that<00:05:06.720> much<00:05:06.900> fat<00:05:07.140> if

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
mode it does not burn that much fat if

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.140 
mode it does not burn that much fat if
your<00:05:07.680> insulin<00:05:08.040> levels<00:05:08.280> are<00:05:08.340> too<00:05:08.400> high<00:05:08.520> playing

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
your insulin levels are too high playing

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.150 
your insulin levels are too high playing
it<00:05:09.300> simple<00:05:09.630> so<00:05:10.380> you<00:05:10.440> have<00:05:10.740> to<00:05:10.919> keep<00:05:11.040> the

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
it simple so you have to keep the

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.470 
it simple so you have to keep the
insulin<00:05:11.430> levels<00:05:11.700> under<00:05:11.850> control

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
insulin levels under control

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.720 
insulin levels under control
or<00:05:12.900> keep<00:05:13.050> them<00:05:13.200> low<00:05:13.410> and<00:05:13.950> that's<00:05:14.130> not<00:05:14.340> done<00:05:14.580> by

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
or keep them low and that's not done by

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.940 
or keep them low and that's not done by
eating<00:05:14.970> sugars<00:05:15.390> and<00:05:15.570> processed<00:05:16.320> foods<00:05:16.800> and

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
eating sugars and processed foods and

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.530 
eating sugars and processed foods and
breads<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:17.790> all<00:05:17.850> kinds<00:05:18.060> of<00:05:18.120> weird<00:05:18.270> shit<00:05:18.510> like

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
breads and all kinds of weird shit like

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.870 
breads and all kinds of weird shit like
that<00:05:18.690> and<00:05:19.320> that's<00:05:19.710> why<00:05:19.950> these<00:05:20.010> people<00:05:20.370> take<00:05:20.520> so

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
that and that's why these people take so

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.920 
that and that's why these people take so
long<00:05:21.390> to<00:05:22.229> get<00:05:22.410> lean<00:05:22.680> and<00:05:22.880> even<00:05:23.880> then<00:05:24.060> they're

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
long to get lean and even then they're

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.629 
long to get lean and even then they're
not<00:05:25.050> even<00:05:25.290> where<00:05:25.440> they<00:05:25.560> want<00:05:25.800> it<00:05:25.889> to<00:05:25.919> be<00:05:26.010> so

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
not even where they want it to be so

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:27.950 
not even where they want it to be so
they're<00:05:26.790> having<00:05:27.000> a<00:05:27.060> hard<00:05:27.270> time<00:05:27.479> not<00:05:27.660> only<00:05:27.810> just

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
they're having a hard time not only just

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.240 
they're having a hard time not only just
getting<00:05:28.200> to<00:05:28.380> where<00:05:28.500> they<00:05:28.560> want<00:05:28.710> to<00:05:28.740> be<00:05:28.830> but

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
getting to where they want to be but

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.530 
getting to where they want to be but
they<00:05:29.310> can't<00:05:29.520> even<00:05:29.580> control<00:05:29.970> it<00:05:30.180> to<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:30.360> point

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
they can't even control it to the point

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.240 
they can't even control it to the point
to<00:05:31.229> get<00:05:31.410> to<00:05:31.590> where<00:05:31.710> they<00:05:31.800> want<00:05:31.830> to<00:05:31.979> be<00:05:32.100> in<00:05:32.190> the

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
to get to where they want to be in the

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.280 
to get to where they want to be in the
end<00:05:32.400> then<00:05:33.060> they<00:05:33.150> drop<00:05:33.360> off<00:05:35.330> let's<00:05:36.330> see<00:05:36.540> when

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
end then they drop off let's see when

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.110 
end then they drop off let's see when
it's<00:05:37.410> on<00:05:37.560> levels<00:05:37.860> rise<00:05:38.040> excess<00:05:38.520> glucose<00:05:38.910> is

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
it's on levels rise excess glucose is

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.580 
it's on levels rise excess glucose is
cleared<00:05:39.450> from<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:39.720> bloodstream<00:05:39.930> and

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
cleared from the bloodstream and

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.770 
cleared from the bloodstream and

liver stores for glucose are full all

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.710 
liver stores for glucose are full all
glucose<00:05:47.340> will<00:05:47.460> be<00:05:47.550> packed<00:05:47.789> away<00:05:48.030> his<00:05:48.180> body<00:05:48.419> fat

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
glucose will be packed away his body fat

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.570 
glucose will be packed away his body fat
so<00:05:49.590> which<00:05:49.680> means<00:05:49.860> basically<00:05:50.340> if<00:05:50.490> you're

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
so which means basically if you're

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.880 
so which means basically if you're
eating<00:05:50.669> 400<00:05:51.240> grams<00:05:51.390> of<00:05:51.510> carbs<00:05:51.930> more<00:05:52.740> than

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
eating 400 grams of carbs more than

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.000 
eating 400 grams of carbs more than
likely<00:05:53.070> your<00:05:53.970> your<00:05:54.690> glycogen<00:05:55.560> stores<00:05:55.860> are

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
likely your your glycogen stores are

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.140 
likely your your glycogen stores are
full<00:05:56.330> so<00:05:57.330> when<00:05:57.870> you<00:05:57.960> put<00:05:58.580> anything<00:05:59.580> else<00:05:59.910> in

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
full so when you put anything else in

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.060 
full so when you put anything else in
above<00:06:00.539> that<00:06:00.750> so<00:06:01.500> let's<00:06:01.650> say<00:06:01.800> you're<00:06:01.950> eating

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
above that so let's say you're eating

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.240 
above that so let's say you're eating
315<00:06:03.030> you're<00:06:03.270> 50<00:06:03.630> grams<00:06:03.810> left<00:06:04.050> 350<00:06:04.830> more<00:06:05.100> than

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
315 you're 50 grams left 350 more than

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.340 
315 you're 50 grams left 350 more than
likely<00:06:05.400> has<00:06:05.669> filled<00:06:06.000> up<00:06:06.180> your<00:06:06.930> glycogen

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
likely has filled up your glycogen

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.290 
likely has filled up your glycogen
stores<00:06:07.590> where<00:06:08.280> is<00:06:08.400> another<00:06:08.640> 50<00:06:08.970> going<00:06:09.120> to<00:06:09.210> go

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
stores where is another 50 going to go

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.600 
stores where is another 50 going to go
the<00:06:10.020> ice<00:06:10.110> cream<00:06:10.350> is<00:06:10.470> going<00:06:10.590> to<00:06:10.650> go<00:06:10.800> in<00:06:11.010> the<00:06:11.430> fat

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
the ice cream is going to go in the fat

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.000 
the ice cream is going to go in the fat
stores<00:06:11.910> but<00:06:12.630> now<00:06:12.690> what<00:06:12.840> happens<00:06:13.169> is<00:06:13.320> it's<00:06:13.860> not

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
stores but now what happens is it's not

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.469 
stores but now what happens is it's not
that<00:06:14.070> much<00:06:14.430> fat<00:06:14.640> you're<00:06:14.820> adding<00:06:15.030> a<00:06:15.090> little<00:06:15.300> bit

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
that much fat you're adding a little bit

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.810 
that much fat you're adding a little bit
of<00:06:15.570> fat<00:06:15.750> but<00:06:16.680> if<00:06:17.010> you're<00:06:17.220> dieting<00:06:17.460> you<00:06:17.610> don't

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
of fat but if you're dieting you don't

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.219 
of fat but if you're dieting you don't
to<00:06:17.910> be<00:06:17.940> adding<00:06:18.390> any<00:06:18.570> fat<00:06:18.720> you<00:06:18.960> want<00:06:19.110> to<00:06:19.169> be

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
to be adding any fat you want to be

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.320 
to be adding any fat you want to be
constantly<00:06:19.380> burning<00:06:19.830> fat<00:06:20.190> so<00:06:20.970> you<00:06:21.030> want<00:06:21.210> those

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
constantly burning fat so you want those

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.120 
constantly burning fat so you want those
those<00:06:21.720> liver<00:06:21.990> glycogen<00:06:22.229> and<00:06:22.680> muscle<00:06:23.070> glycogen

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
those liver glycogen and muscle glycogen

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.670 
those liver glycogen and muscle glycogen
be<00:06:23.550> actually<00:06:23.850> depleted<00:06:24.780> a<00:06:24.840> little<00:06:25.080> bit<00:06:25.169> so

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
be actually depleted a little bit so

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.960 
be actually depleted a little bit so
when<00:06:25.800> you<00:06:25.860> eat<00:06:25.950> those<00:06:26.039> carbs<00:06:26.430> it<00:06:26.580> can't<00:06:26.820> be

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
when you eat those carbs it can't be

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.159 
when you eat those carbs it can't be
stored<00:06:27.120> as<00:06:27.270> body<00:06:27.300> fat<00:06:27.539> it<00:06:27.750> goes<00:06:27.870> into<00:06:28.050> the

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
stored as body fat it goes into the
