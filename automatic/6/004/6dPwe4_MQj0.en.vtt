00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.250
 hello to all and andrea is 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.690
 so today we find ourselves for 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.120
 a new video is then today 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.599
 it will be the 7 ol l cross of the method 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.309
 friedrich 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.739
 So here I will show you animals 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.140
 a little faster than in the 

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:20.550
 Simple tutorials here and Friedrich 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.519
 so I will show you each case 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.569
 how do the axes execute them 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.849
 recognize but that normally we 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:29.789
 know I will also show you for 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.189
 every case if we ever fall 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.899
 differently a better algo in 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.359
 function of where we fall 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.710
 So here I'll show you that it can 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:38.910
 to be useful you do not have to 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.320
 take what will be important that will be the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.079
 first album that I will show you for 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:49.350
 everyone here we go we go 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:51.420
 start right now so the first 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.550
 case it's the zune 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.920
 so that is the case of the chair 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.850
 in glass so good recognizes because 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.649
 when we place as it was a 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.909
 fish and this one looks at us here 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.399
 so he the lgo everyone knows 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:08.240
 it's the upside down chair so era a 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:13.950
 era premium one era and 2 is resumed but 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.990
 so here is it then if we ever fall 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.579
 in a different angle if ever in 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:26.100
 time like this like this well we can 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:31.860
 do and take back 1002 era a prime era 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:35.640
 an area that's up so next now 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.960
 the case haunts one so for for for 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.729
 execute it mainly we will get 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.530
 to pass like that so it's the fish 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.820
 is con right and absolute the norm 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.159
 keep it the same when you are placed 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.649
 like that like that one nonorgues 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.240
 do not look at us this is the opposite 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.270
 or the symmetrical of that precisely 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.450
 so he conventional lgo we get 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.500
 place like that the tunes of the 2nd premium 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.500
 the premiums 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.880
 r a bonus 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:06.979
 r premium so that's the chair what but 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:10.220
 if we ever fall like that we can 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.320
 do this algorithm and take them back 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:20.270
 Premium air premiums 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:24.680
 r premium then two r super fast up 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.170
 so we continue now the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.459
 quarter h 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.720
 so he's pretty fast enough then 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.030
 so the conventional lgo is when 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.890
 we are like that here and we do 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.660
 simply the chair upside down 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.310
 but we read manu the winds made 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.440
 part of a twice the chair but 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.620
 we cancel the unnecessary movements so 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:50.900
 air of 2 and recovery of the premium 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.880
 r pu erh primes an air bonus 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:59.630
 and airprint 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:02.660
 and then if we ever fall like that we 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.989
 can do that talgo which is good too 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.209
 r me it's the same as this one it's 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:13.580
 the same as this one but upside down era 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:29.170
 a premium era of r premiums and recovery 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:32.610
 r + 2 r next so here we arrive okapi 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.080
 this is this one 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.260
 so him when we fall like that 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.980
 legault that's it so a little bit more 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.940
 dear that others learns him so ru 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:04:01.200
 2 r2 of the premium 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:04:03.990
 r2 premium r22er that's it and if ever we 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.540
 falls like this can do the same 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:15.900
 algorithm on the left 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:24.510
 she had 2 l2 a l2 of l2 u2 she premium 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:27.750
 pin up on then continue now the 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.510
 case case so had the one called 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:35.100
 the headlights here are two that we 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.390
 look like that so him well it's 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.640
 the only one who will use movements 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.940
 teeth the white sticks to r and bd 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:46.200
 u so it's just going on 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:53.940
 like that and we'll make r2 tunes 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:57.430
 premium u2r bonuses and took u2 and 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:02.690
 resume hop 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:06.080
 we continue then we come to slats 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:10.100
 so is there you are well i had this 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.170
 like that there of the inverted finally two 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.970
 like that there is one who looks at him there 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:17.060
 and he's getting here 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.080
 and so when we are like that actually 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.580
 there are not really any algos 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.170
 conventional for that one on our 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.680
 tombs like that are all like this finally 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:29.260
 this is what the two are still 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:36.550
 falls like that we make small such premium 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:40.940
 a bonus l us air that premium 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:45.940
 she's got a voice over so we have a 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.940
 little problem to be done in the end so here 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:00.620
 and when we fall like that 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:04.670
 even bow algo symmetric a small 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:09.770
 air premiums + r bonus premium 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:12.010
 it takes an area and a little bit 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.010
 safari 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:21.270
 so here is now the last one the case 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.369
 she then this case is 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:27.430
 and a bit like the one before 

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:30.999
 so he just starts it 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:34.719
 like so by placing herself like that she 

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:37.569
 premium premium and there instead of doing 

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:44.309
 can she in that first one does she 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:53.919
 premium an era of premium she 

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:59.830
 so now is the day so now 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:07:01.719
 the one on the right and well we'll get 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:08.139
 place here and we will do the harm that in 

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:14.339
 symmetrical and now resumed 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:16.689
 compass also air and a little air a 

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:20.399
 area and premiums 

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:24.879
 it takes precedence over a prime area 

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:26.830
 finally after that ended up removing 

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:28.419
 I 'm going to do the rotation just 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:34.839
 before it makes a spirit so here I have 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:35.800
 then here we are already finished 

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:38.439
 quite fast 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:42.309
 there are only 7 so valentin has already 

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:44.289
 done on point hotels next I 

00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:48.219
 think we'll do the lines then we 

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:51.969
 will leave them canvas and the brake on 

00:07:48.219 --> 00:07:54.339
 will make all waters alleles from the small 

00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:57.550
 ls so here I hope you have 

00:07:54.339 --> 00:08:01.150
 last but the video is a plus for 

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:03.820
 an upcoming video that pleased him 

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:06.630
 elsewhere in this August 15 

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.630
