00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.969
 today today racing has to lose not us 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.379
 will matter if we ever lose today we have 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.180
 to lose because the red one day to the 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.059
 time if you pay an entry to see the 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.039
 grains there is nothing to give them but very 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.420
 let's follow my case in all portals and 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.640
 I think racing is going to go out and play 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.470
 how your team will not want to lose 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.030
 same as us 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:34.090
 good but what happened 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:36.400
 in fact he said it was a headbutt of the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.270
 centurion who went near the pole after 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.270
 a center of Corvalan 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.159
 I was on the court and I commented on this 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.359
 party for the silver radio 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:49.429
 wait I do not say he will arrive without his three 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.399
 faults and here comfortably enter me 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:55.870
 cashier ortiz cooking the box 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.870
 jce and nothing else 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.610
 as centurion as central forward what 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.600
 what happens is the fourth proposal 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:08.550
 santiso dos goles and cámpora 32 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.350
 lizardi's rooms for martín 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.560
 cauteruccio a timid closing of box is 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.110
 difficult to analyze this part of the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.520
 feeling that is very left with the 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.560
 responsibility and it was imprecise did not have 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.680
 did not have clear arrivals the game was 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.380
 a mess by somehow 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.780
 what do I know, it was very difficult for me 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.630
 commenting explain it in terms of 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.149
 tactical football play strategy 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.920
 you going to an appearance is with 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.049
 field that depending on kills and 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.159
 after he loses it he got over it raising 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.220
 over the body of the green area to 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.450
 behind 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.020
 tied the subsequent circumstances 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.030
 did not end in the tie served him 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.770
 quilmes to mean a draw because 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.770
 quilmes divides distinct 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.659
 but it has been a win32 match 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:13.520
 South American 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:16.280
 You need to clear any fan of 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.840
 any similar box would want its 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.020
 team lose so that the rival of 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.020
 forever 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.200
 is very divided to see 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.760
 quilmes is still trying good pass from 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.660
 martín cauteruccio the author of the unique 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.690
 goal of the match for gustavo obermán that 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:43.370
 He emphasized he gives it to them to say that 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.860
 finish placing and take out 10 million of the 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.030
 reserve of quilmes between second time 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.870
 to define the match he had it 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.290
 got weird quilmes and we keep 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.500
 speculating about what happened 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.269
 a lot for weeks for this 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.819
 match with the result has been placed the 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.140
 win reflecting beams quilmes 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.560
 that those who speak will follow us 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.019
 speaking and those who respect this 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.129
 profession and respect people 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.989
 surely they will take it as an anecdote 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.180
 or a ball a capped manuel that 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.290
 could have been the tie yes and I think 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.790
 the player who left did not start 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.409
 outside the arch he beat there and in monkey he 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.689
 attacked twice the worst part they take 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.250
 the players and the coach because yes 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:22.709
 you win because you won say lose because 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.489
 you lost if if you tie the same thing 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.489
 then here 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.799
 there is nothing weird just com party 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.010
 of soccer where they hit 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.010
 First
