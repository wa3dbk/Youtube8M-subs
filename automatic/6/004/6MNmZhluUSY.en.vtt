00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
to be purple but I didn't have enough

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.060 
to be purple but I didn't have enough
purple<00:01:36.390> wore<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.899> all<00:01:37.109> items<00:01:37.469> in<00:01:37.560> Norfolk

purple wore it all items in Norfolk

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.450 
purple wore it all items in Norfolk
because<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:38.880> big<00:01:39.180> and

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
because it's so big and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.480 
because it's so big and
mostly<00:01:41.000> I<00:01:41.090> miscalculated<00:01:41.510> and<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.590> run<00:01:43.340> out

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
mostly I miscalculated and a run out

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.950 
mostly I miscalculated and a run out
just<00:01:43.760> as<00:01:43.880> I<00:01:43.970> was<00:01:44.030> about<00:01:44.150> to<00:01:44.270> finish<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.720> tail

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
just as I was about to finish the tail

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
just as I was about to finish the tail
so<00:01:45.230> I<00:01:45.260> had<00:01:45.410> to<00:01:45.500> start<00:01:45.710> all<00:01:45.860> over<00:01:45.890> again<00:01:46.210> and<00:01:47.980> it

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
so I had to start all over again and it

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.310 
so I had to start all over again and it
did<00:01:49.190> use<00:01:49.370> a<00:01:49.400> lot<00:01:49.790> of<00:01:49.820> warm<00:01:50.180> because<00:01:51.050> it<00:01:51.140> is

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
did use a lot of warm because it is

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.340 
did use a lot of warm because it is
quite<00:01:51.590> big<00:01:51.830> but<00:01:52.240> I<00:01:53.240> think<00:01:53.479> monies<00:01:53.900> will<00:01:54.080> really

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
quite big but I think monies will really

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.650 
quite big but I think monies will really
like<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:55.040> that's<00:01:56.000> all<00:01:56.180> that<00:01:56.300> matters

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
like it so that's all that matters

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.219
