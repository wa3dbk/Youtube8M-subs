there<00:00:59.989> is<00:01:00.200> a<00:01:00.230> small<00:01:00.620> difference<00:01:00.800> when<00:01:01.190> I<00:01:01.219> first

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
there is a small difference when I first

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.520 
there is a small difference when I first
bite<00:01:01.790> into<00:01:01.940> it<00:01:04.510> at<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:05.659> first<00:01:05.870> second<00:01:06.260> or<00:01:06.350> two

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
bite into it at the first second or two

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.130 
bite into it at the first second or two
I<00:01:06.560> can't<00:01:06.950> tell<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.190> difference<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:08.750> then

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
I can't tell the difference and then

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.710 
I can't tell the difference and then
there's<00:01:09.350> that<00:01:09.530> go<00:01:11.140> it<00:01:12.140> doesn't<00:01:12.350> have<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.590> strong

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
there's that go it doesn't have a strong

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.570 
there's that go it doesn't have a strong
sheetal<00:01:14.720> taste<00:01:15.049> like<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:15.950> regular<00:01:16.100> ones<00:01:16.400> do

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
sheetal taste like the regular ones do

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.640 
sheetal taste like the regular ones do
it<00:01:16.700> kind<00:01:16.909> of<00:01:16.940> faints<00:01:17.270> out<00:01:17.390> at<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.720> end<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:21.530> it

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
it kind of faints out at the end and it

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.780 
it kind of faints out at the end and it
has<00:01:21.680> like<00:01:21.979> a<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:24.369> texture<00:01:25.369> is<00:01:25.430> a<00:01:25.490> little<00:01:25.700> bit

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
has like a the texture is a little bit

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.570 
has like a the texture is a little bit
more<00:01:25.970> of<00:01:26.680> fluffy<00:01:27.680> I<00:01:27.860> guess<00:01:28.190> that's<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.490> best

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
more of fluffy I guess that's the best

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.780 
more of fluffy I guess that's the best
way<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:28.820> describe<00:01:29.600> it<00:01:29.840> instead<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.710> that<00:01:30.920> hard

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
way to describe it instead of that hard

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.350 
way to describe it instead of that hard
crunch<00:01:32.920> like<00:01:33.920> when<00:01:34.100> they're<00:01:34.220> who<00:01:35.030> knows<00:01:35.210> how

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
crunch like when they're who knows how

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.590 
crunch like when they're who knows how
they<00:01:35.510> make<00:01:35.659> Cheetos<00:01:35.990> but<00:01:37.119> this<00:01:38.119> one<00:01:38.299> feels<00:01:38.450> a

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
they make Cheetos but this one feels a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.730 
they make Cheetos but this one feels a
little<00:01:38.780> bit<00:01:38.990> lighter<00:01:43.600> it's<00:01:44.600> actually<00:01:44.930> it<00:01:45.259> is<00:01:45.710> a

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
little bit lighter it's actually it is a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.830 
little bit lighter it's actually it is a
good<00:01:45.979> tasting<00:01:46.250> Cheadle<00:01:46.610> but<00:01:47.330> I<00:01:47.600> think<00:01:47.780> I

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
good tasting Cheadle but I think I

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.030 
good tasting Cheadle but I think I
prefer<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.140> regular<00:01:48.590> ones<00:01:48.740> or<00:01:48.890> these<00:01:51.040> just

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
prefer the regular ones or these just

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.950 
prefer the regular ones or these just
because<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.400> regular<00:01:53.090> ones<00:01:53.270> have<00:01:53.450> a<00:01:53.479> lot<00:01:53.930> more

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
because the regular ones have a lot more

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.830 
because the regular ones have a lot more
flavor<00:01:54.680> Lum<00:01:55.070> or<00:01:55.250> taste<00:01:55.520> throughout<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.659> bite

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
flavor Lum or taste throughout the bite

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.580 
flavor Lum or taste throughout the bite
I<00:01:57.110> mean<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:57.560> throughout<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:59.470> when<00:02:00.470> you're

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
I mean it throughout the when you're

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.499 
I mean it throughout the when you're
eating<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:01.009> and<00:02:01.189> this<00:02:01.640> one<00:02:01.790> it<00:02:01.880> just<00:02:01.909> seemed<00:02:02.390> to

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
eating it and this one it just seemed to

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.950 
eating it and this one it just seemed to
thin<00:02:02.810> out<00:02:02.960> at<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.259> end

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.310 

their<00:02:08.960> overall<00:02:09.470> good<00:02:10.270> but<00:02:11.270> I<00:02:11.630> don't<00:02:12.110> think<00:02:12.170> I'm

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320
