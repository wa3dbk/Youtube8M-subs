00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.629
 Here then have to take small 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.640
 you have always made a box 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.639
 plastic like that you fill the water 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.019
 of the aquarium a normal box what 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:12.809
 of course catch the female in question 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.920
 which one net so before already made us 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.710
 good hands because if you do not have them 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.090
 wet hands and have your hands 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.740
 dry with with body heat 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.490
 we discussed fish from 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.230
 Red Devils of the hands then the shock 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.520
 the week in his 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:34.260
 it is that you are here and the state 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.690
 females did you look where she is 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.800
 swollen here there below the world that 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.660
 moves below the mouth in fact it's 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.250
 true because these little ones when in fact there 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.150
 you have to press with the thumb and 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.550
 the right index finger next to the mouth of 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.989
 way to open them 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.360
 like that he goes slowly on the other hand 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.530
 because it's still fragile 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.790
 he hoisted above and normally 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.260
 will you spit the cops and look at you 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.120
 see this as a go spit thee 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.020
 flames 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.399
 but when I read you have more gently 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.770
 it's really cooking gently what 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.840
 because otherwise it's Kremlin and 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.039
 latuquois 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.119
 so what do you have here when you see there 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:09.390
 it being routed door 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.590
 and dan less good from time to time 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.000
 you stop a little what you know it's 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.830
 well important especially you stop a 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.960
 little there is a pity there are some 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.160
 days the wood you have well but escapes 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.360
 hands later and later be a little 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.479
 you even have who can like that in 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.649
 water naturally its side of the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.090
 sea so as not too much the 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.380
 stress and especially you swim because 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.560
 otherwise she will reveal these little ones it's 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.910
 a prison reflex what are you doing 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.440
 will you see it cool a dime the glottis in 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.330
 done so that actually this 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.369
 when you do that it's like you're doing 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.200
 it lets me go is the beautiful effect and 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.459
 that's what makes kids do 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.319
 that they are easier after that 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.599
 closer to the boucan is sailing or the 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:47.220
 butchery tessin then he will resume 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:48.450
 in the same place you press up 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.340
 speak normally she's still going in 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:58.509
 spit the double chance 3 get his 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:59.710
 bush but yeah you see there again she 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.819
 still small inside we see 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.819
 although against day is tomorrow 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.240
 what is important is good 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.240
 rub like this 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.270
 that you have not done 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.840
 open a touch a little in our 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.910
 enemies in the car he moved a 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.070
 little do you see a lot the manager 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.730
 So here we are after you look at your 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.900
 week I try to watch a little the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.020
 in like that there is damage 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.190
 is a super happy day when wade 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.810
 in any case when you see that 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.210
 underneath to deflate what is that 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.820
 kcdc diseases transparent and all that 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.930
 is smaller so what are you doing 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.190
 especially when he just did that because 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.810
 that you do that you do them a lot 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.680
 that the army took in the kitchens that 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.030
 do not immediately release others in 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.410
 aquarium so that they come out ap 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.430
 five little minutes what five minutes 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.430
 all the same because it is very usefull 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.380
 body it is so there you have 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.770
 little voices that's a door kate the 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.210
 that he gave the bo trophy the story does not 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.550
 does not make his wave to latvala talent and 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.370
 which had several scope but finally a 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.180
 scope of several taboos but our 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.180
 group there I do not know if 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.730
 and that's what 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.410
 yeah 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.040
 and especially important to do 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.930
 it's especially not too much reliance on the 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.099
 week when you do that and well the 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.049
 let yourself retype a little bit in 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:33.159
 his landing net afterwards so that 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.629
 some cases up there or down in 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.810
 underneath holds a white glove the asean 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.810
 make 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.830
 here 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.280
 but his nerves 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.610
 that's way for this little explanation
