life<00:00:40.200> Protection<00:00:40.710> Act<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.850> process<00:00:42.210> where

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
life Protection Act is a process where

we can set aside special areas of the

we can set aside special areas of the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.360 
for the long-term benefit of all
California<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.390> idea<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.739> take<00:00:53.129> as

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
California so this idea is to take as

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.750 
California so this idea is to take as
minimal<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.570> impact<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.710> our<00:00:56.309> human

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
minimal and impact on our human

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.779 
minimal and impact on our human
interaction<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.780> create<00:00:58.559> parks<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.489> allow

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
interaction and create parks that allow

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.580 
interaction and create parks that allow
us<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.210> preserve<00:01:00.420> things<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.320> everyone

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
us to preserve things so that everyone

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.500 
us to preserve things so that everyone
can<00:01:01.859> enjoy<00:01:02.010> them<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:03.000> like<00:01:03.149> we<00:01:03.300> have

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
can enjoy them just like we have

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.500 
can enjoy them just like we have

national parks we have Yosemite we want

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.420 
national parks we have Yosemite we want
to<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.840> these<00:01:07.140> areas<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.770> people<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:08.189> come

it's unique its diverse it's spectacular

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.570 
it's unique its diverse it's spectacular
and<00:02:04.820> it's<00:02:04.910> like<00:02:05.179> no<00:02:05.360> other<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:06.429> just<00:02:07.429> feel
