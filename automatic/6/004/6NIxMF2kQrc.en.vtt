00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:11.520
 we are in the reception of the chicks 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.990
 the first day they arrive here to the 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:18.420
 farm we are organizing here 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.550
 the yard must Drinker 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.410
 put a pebble because if you do not 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.080
 they throw among themselves in theirs 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.720
 missing and have to carry more stones 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.830
 almost completely they should cover the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.869
 water surface 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.200
 because there already fits a chick and it 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.260
 choke 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.070
 so 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.440
 as you already know more or less this is the 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.589
 way to make it the heat source in 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.460
 medium here is the bell below the 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:54.550
 heat source nothing 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:57.520
 on the sides all around food and water 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.980
 they must take care that the water is not 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.370
 down the heat source this causes 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:07.540
 diseases and it's a problem and if those 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:11.400
 the falconcytes those can also be 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:15.610
 for excess heat 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.230
 then you can start already having 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.230
 to start is to start more 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.540
 the rounded corners as you can see 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.540
 there 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:35.080
 and we are going to supply the first food 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:39.960
 here we go only what is the elche 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.960
 There are six different microorganisms 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:52.940
 powdered 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.710
 a powder that we hydrate if a 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.710
 gelatin lumps 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:04.310
 have to put enough so that 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.310
 consume as first food 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.140
 so what are we going to put all 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:21.220
 consume quite a bit what 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:25.300
 they consume more or less of this age the 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.780
 chicks yes for 100 chicks with 7 of 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.020
 10 grams maximum of gel chic 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:36.960
 they hydrate and they eat all day 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.960
 and in the drinking water we will replace 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.260
 and so that they have enough calories in 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.689
 the reception 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.440
 and have the assimilation also 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:52.590
 Remember that not just 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.590
 to absorb from the yolk 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.659
 they have their egg food 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.090
 more or less going to put about 10 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.090
 milliliters 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.180
 berlin 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.210
 this is what they are given is calories 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.220
 enough calories 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.910
 so they have this 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:25.620
 energy energy remember the 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:29.450
 pebbles is important 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.450
 that has ventilation 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.160
 you can modulate the ventilation your 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.420
 heat source 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:43.060
 and your bed is important that the bed is 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.820
 disinfected and fumigated we use 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.160
 in this case Oatstraw what we 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:52.240
 works well 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.160
 this celtic food is going to 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.260
 supply as a complement the 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.240
 first day I eat nothing else about that 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.490
 that put the top part and already 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.560
 later twice a week 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.900
 The clean can be given only two 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.170
 days with two days is enough for 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.710
 have a good load of calories and 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.710
 of energy
