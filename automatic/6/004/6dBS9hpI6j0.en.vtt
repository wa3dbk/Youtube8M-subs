some<00:00:49.050> more<00:00:49.079> four<00:00:49.500> star<00:00:49.530> crystal<00:00:50.190> shards<00:00:50.780> yeah

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
some more four star crystal shards yeah

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.160 
some more four star crystal shards yeah
let's<00:00:52.590> do<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:52.980> boom<00:00:53.579> there<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.329> go<00:00:54.570> first<00:00:54.899> ever

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
let's do it boom there we go first ever

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.740 
let's do it boom there we go first ever
crystal<00:00:56.100> shard<00:00:57.000> crystal<00:00:57.710> right<00:00:58.710> here<00:00:59.600> so<00:01:00.600> we

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
crystal shard crystal right here so we

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.360 
crystal shard crystal right here so we
can't<00:01:00.989> add<00:01:01.230> another<00:01:01.530> one<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
can't add another one and the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.250 
can't add another one and the
straightaway<00:01:02.879> mellow<00:01:03.149> forester<00:01:03.629> or<00:01:03.840> couple

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
straightaway mellow forester or couple

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.340 
straightaway mellow forester or couple
four<00:01:04.409> stars<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:04.970> like<00:01:05.970> not<00:01:06.479> too<00:01:06.659> many<00:01:06.840> 4<00:01:07.080> stars

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
four stars but like not too many 4 stars

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.140 
four stars but like not too many 4 stars
I'm<00:01:07.560> not<00:01:07.770> sure<00:01:07.979> what<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.549> difference<00:01:08.760> is

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
I'm not sure what the difference is

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.609 
I'm not sure what the difference is
hopefully<00:01:09.810> there<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> difference

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
hopefully there is a difference

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.960 
hopefully there is a difference
difference<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.810> kind<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:13.020> drop<00:01:13.409> rates

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
difference in kind of like drop rates

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.920 
difference in kind of like drop rates
hopefully<00:01:14.970> there<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> difference<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.750> like

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
hopefully there is a difference in like

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.660 
hopefully there is a difference in like
four<00:01:16.170> star<00:01:16.409> drop<00:01:16.590> rates<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.430> would<00:01:17.549> be

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
four star drop rates that would be

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.870 
four star drop rates that would be
amazingly<00:01:18.270> epic<00:01:18.509> new<00:01:18.840> sick<00:01:19.220> it<00:01:20.220> should<00:01:20.520> be<00:01:20.549> a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
amazingly epic new sick it should be a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.730 
amazingly epic new sick it should be a
bit<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.780> higher<00:01:22.080> chance<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.500> getting<00:01:22.710> a

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
bit of a higher chance of getting a

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.780 
bit of a higher chance of getting a
Forrester<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.570> it's<00:01:24.570> harder<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.740> get<00:01:26.369> the
