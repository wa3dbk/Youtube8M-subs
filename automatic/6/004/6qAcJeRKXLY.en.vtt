can actually say if you only had a

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.120 
can actually say if you only had a
single

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
single

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.100 
single
a<00:02:14.180> world<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.480> wanted<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.720> bring<00:02:15.870> into

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
a world that you wanted to bring into

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.660 
a world that you wanted to bring into
multiplayer<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.950> would<00:02:17.100> just<00:02:17.250> copy<00:02:17.460> the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
multiplayer you would just copy the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.700 
multiplayer you would just copy the
folder<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.180> place<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.660> here<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.050> you

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
folder and place it in here and you

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.350 
folder and place it in here and you
would<00:02:19.830> just<00:02:19.860> simply<00:02:20.160> change<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.730> level<00:02:21.210> name

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
would just simply change the level name

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.230 
would just simply change the level name
to<00:02:21.600> whatever<00:02:21.870> world<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.760> or<00:02:23.760> whatever<00:02:24.030> the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
to whatever world it is or whatever the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.480 
to whatever world it is or whatever the
folder<00:02:24.510> name<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.050> that's<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.010> world<00:02:26.280> it's

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
folder name is and that's the world it's

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.740 
folder name is and that's the world it's
going<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.670> open<00:02:26.760> up<00:02:26.940> whenever<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.300> opens<00:02:27.390> so

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
going to open up whenever it opens so

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.440 
going to open up whenever it opens so
for<00:02:27.990> me<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.140> have<00:02:28.410> world<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:29.040> then<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.820> have<00:02:30.060> subs

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
for me I have world and then I have subs

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.110 
for me I have world and then I have subs
so<00:02:31.260> we're<00:02:31.380> obviously<00:02:31.560> for<00:02:31.980> my<00:02:32.100> subs<00:02:32.370> whenever

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
so we're obviously for my subs whenever

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.050 
so we're obviously for my subs whenever
we<00:02:33.330> do<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.630> again<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.430> server<00:02:35.430> IP<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.820> actually

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
we do that again a server IP I actually

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.420 
we do that again a server IP I actually
filled<00:02:36.510> this<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.830> can<00:02:37.950> simply<00:02:38.310> get

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
filled this in and you can simply get

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.740 
filled this in and you can simply get
that<00:02:38.610> information<00:02:38.850> by<00:02:39.270> opening<00:02:39.570> up<00:02:39.690> your

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
how people are going to connect but you

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.920 
how people are going to connect but you
need<00:05:14.010> to<00:05:14.100> make<00:05:14.250> sure<00:05:14.310> that<00:05:14.790> they<00:05:14.940> type<00:05:15.180> in<00:05:15.389> the

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
need to make sure that they type in the

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.260 
need to make sure that they type in the
2<00:05:16.200> 55<00:05:16.680> 65<00:05:17.160> because<00:05:17.490> that's<00:05:17.729> telling<00:05:18.030> them<00:05:18.060> what

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
2 55 65 because that's telling them what

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.030 
2 55 65 because that's telling them what
port<00:05:18.540> to<00:05:18.630> go<00:05:18.780> to<00:05:18.840> and<00:05:19.200> that's<00:05:19.710> how<00:05:19.860> they're

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
port to go to and that's how they're

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.320 
port to go to and that's how they're
going<00:05:20.130> to<00:05:20.190> connect<00:05:20.490> through<00:05:20.700> it<00:05:20.790> so<00:05:21.210> what

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
going to connect through it so what

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.870 
going to connect through it so what
we'll<00:05:21.479> do<00:05:21.630> is<00:05:21.810> a<00:05:22.280> test<00:05:23.280> so<00:05:23.430> we'll<00:05:23.580> just<00:05:23.610> go
