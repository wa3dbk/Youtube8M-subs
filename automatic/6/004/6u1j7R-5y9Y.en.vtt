actually I wouldn't say it's easy but

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.139 
actually I wouldn't say it's easy but
it's<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.829> me<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.040> easy<00:00:44.399> just<00:00:44.730> because<00:00:45.059> I

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
it's to me it's easy just because I

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.580 
it's to me it's easy just because I
don't<00:00:45.300> feel<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:45.780> really<00:00:45.960> extra<00:00:46.410> work

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
don't feel like it's really extra work

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.440 
don't feel like it's really extra work
when<00:00:47.039> someone<00:00:47.430> tells<00:00:47.610> me<00:00:47.760> what<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.000> do<00:00:48.210> and

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
when someone tells me what to do and

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.420 
when someone tells me what to do and
what<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.809> do<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.050> get<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> done<00:00:49.710> and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
what I have to do I just get it done and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.130 
what I have to do I just get it done and
I<00:00:50.550> think<00:00:50.610> when<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.120> healthy<00:00:51.629> balance

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
I think when you have a healthy balance

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.590 
I think when you have a healthy balance
in<00:00:52.320> life<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.890> not<00:00:53.489> just<00:00:53.730> too<00:00:54.210> much<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.570> one

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
in life and not just too much of one

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.260 
in life and not just too much of one
thing<00:00:54.860> it<00:00:55.860> makes<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.129> huge<00:00:56.399> whole<00:00:56.879> world<00:00:57.090> of

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
thing it makes a huge whole world of

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.360
