00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.200
 and then gang beauty for those who spoke 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.340
 to sort games with another video 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.590
 for you 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.140
 in today's video we will return to 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.750
 show you 're better with fig 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.420
 I found on twitter three of my 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.650
 That machine is so I could 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.050
 keep the 30 fps so far the minimum 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.770
 fell was 30 fps without recording 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.170
 beauty is the following configuration here in 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.100
 post-processing video settings 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.400
 I hung up just the cross the environment 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.530
 it's because I won 16 frame only 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.269
 Disabling this is here and the rest of that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.640
 everything is connected is in the post 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.989
 processing only the completion of the environment 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.870
 in off 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.909
 here in charts is an active time five 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.310
 off the maximum number of frames per 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.770
 second is in 60 we are in full hd 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.780
 here the view bet by placing 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.299
 full screen because the game has already opened 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.000
 window I do not know why here is lydia 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.789
 hearst I left off never call 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.560
 if you do not have the fuck bc because 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.530
 linking here you can in the 15 frames 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.270
 joking number of teaching characters 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.210
 average shadow quality in the medium 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.820
 average ground water quality let in 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.320
 auto put up putting on ultra is guess 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.780
 that does not influence performance by 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.210
 The less I saw is grass density 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.689
 Medium texture on high get put 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.909
 high visibility in the medium and high 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.719
 detail on the top of the radio show to be 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.920
 off 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:53.909
 I was able to increase some settings 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.500
 the average for the top but was're cool 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.689
 to protect the cattle I do not know if 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.810
 aggravating we will face 30 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.159
 frames but I was playing so far 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.880
 little did not 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.439
 I think it's very good, the game is very much 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.850
 fuck still out with that quality 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.080
 graphics you have 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.120
 I have to talk in one possibility 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.360
 very big blat is good for damn 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.150
 gameplay also has nothing to talk about 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.190
 of the game maybe they can launch a pet 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.520
 that improves performance a bit 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.290
 I know man had said in the previous video 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.320
 test workshop 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.150
 the game was used a bit is not 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.020
 I know now I 'm not sure if it's more 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.730
 optimized 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.130
 What's optimized is too heavy 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.940
 Even a blackjack who played well for 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.460
 Wow, I've seen people with 780 picking up 20 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.240
 prizes the day I do not know the quality was 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:52.260
 playing too but the guy does not know you 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.240
 Talk, but it's okay to play. 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.430
 old killing one used can not really 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.320
 play is what matters and here you can 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.060
 see that it did not fall 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:12.170
 I think it's a fight on the front left of 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:12.170
 touch now let's imagine at the 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.200
 lesion 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.620
 It's a guy, come, come here, man. 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.360
 the antenna but does not say how it even turns on 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:49.050
 keep the power intensity ligne opa 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.840
 mass but beauty people she was what 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.739
 I had to show it to you. 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.630
 managed to run smoothly with this 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.489
 confidence do not know ahead of 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.630
 game is going to have some part that will 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.030
 fall of 30 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.459
 probably because I play full 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.170
 of effects and such but so far it is 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.390
 this configuration for those who 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.900
 has a similar profile and may be 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.760
 leaving her but beauty is this guys 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.890
 I hope you liked the video ta 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.470
 joins the channel and until the 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.470
 The next spoke the hug was worth it.
