00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.900
 on the first minutes of the game that it is not for

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.850

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.620
 other minor characters 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.920
 people played this game in different ways 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.920
 eg 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.270
 or 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.710
 and we have spare pants 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.560
 but the very fearless is just a little 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.110
 have tried 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.110
 and move on to adventure 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.900
 gameplay is very simple developers so 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.069
 and told all the players here's a camera 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.470
 here's a notebook 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.110
 looking at health but the camera has 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.480
 a small bonus is night vision 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.940
 without which the game go almost 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.790
 impossible because basically you have to 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.580
 wander through the dark rooms sewage 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.830
 and the streets night vision is not very much and 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.260
 free to keep to the end 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.769
 games and tops just need to collect 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.769
 batteries 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.039
 the result was a very game 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.560
