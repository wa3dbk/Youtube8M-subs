00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.580 
is actually scrunching up a bit this is
the<00:03:20.970> fun<00:03:21.150> part<00:03:21.180> get<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.810> know<00:03:21.930> this<00:03:22.049> not<00:03:22.290> very

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
the fun part get to know this not very

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.180 
the fun part get to know this not very
well<00:03:22.829> what<00:03:23.610> I'm<00:03:23.700> going<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.910> do<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.709> with<00:03:25.709> my<00:03:25.829> 3/8

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
well what I'm going to do is with my 3/8

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.949 
well what I'm going to do is with my 3/8
inch<00:03:26.459> rope<00:03:26.700> I'm<00:03:26.970> going<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.269> take<00:03:27.420> my<00:03:27.630> left<00:03:27.780> hand

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
inch rope I'm going to take my left hand

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.110 
inch rope I'm going to take my left hand
over<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.530> left<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:28.950> I'll<00:03:29.640> pull<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:29.910> out

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
over to the left and I'll pull it out

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.840 
over to the left and I'll pull it out
and<00:03:30.750> take<00:03:30.900> my<00:03:30.930> right<00:03:31.260> hand<00:03:31.370> take<00:03:32.370> this<00:03:32.519> extra

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
and take my right hand take this extra

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.699 
and take my right hand take this extra
rope<00:03:33.030> over<00:03:33.299> here<00:03:33.450> take<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.079> on<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.260> other<00:03:34.410> side

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
rope over here take it on the other side

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.860 
rope over here take it on the other side
of<00:03:34.739> my<00:03:34.980> loop<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:36.239> I'm<00:03:36.299> going<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.480> stick<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:36.780> up

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
of my loop and I'm going to stick it up

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.500 
of my loop and I'm going to stick it up
underneath<00:03:37.140> and<00:03:37.530> with<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:38.730> finger<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.360> I'm

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
underneath and with that finger and I'm

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.150 
underneath and with that finger and I'm
going<00:03:39.989> to<00:03:40.019> put<00:03:40.170> it<00:03:40.260> up<00:03:40.350> through<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.769> jaw<00:03:40.950> glue

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
going to put it up through the jaw glue

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.280 
going to put it up through the jaw glue
by<00:03:41.340> men<00:03:41.519> with<00:03:41.670> my<00:03:41.760> left<00:03:42.000> hand<00:03:42.269> I'm<00:03:43.079> going<00:03:43.200> to

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
by men with my left hand I'm going to

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.620 
by men with my left hand I'm going to
pull<00:03:43.410> up<00:03:43.730> I'm<00:03:44.730> going<00:03:44.850> to<00:03:44.910> tighten<00:03:45.180> up<00:03:45.269> on<00:03:45.450> that

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
pull up I'm going to tighten up on that

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.720 
pull up I'm going to tighten up on that
and<00:03:45.810> what<00:03:46.380> I've<00:03:46.500> made<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.799> just<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.130> big<00:03:47.310> ol<00:03:47.489> loop

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
and what I've made is just a big ol loop

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.660 
and what I've made is just a big ol loop
of<00:03:47.940> Big<00:03:48.090> Ear<00:03:48.590> with<00:03:49.590> this<00:03:49.799> I'm<00:03:50.010> not<00:03:50.190> I'm<00:03:50.430> not

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
of Big Ear with this I'm not I'm not

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.340 
of Big Ear with this I'm not I'm not
quite<00:03:50.910> done<00:03:50.940> I'm<00:03:51.510> going<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.810> bury<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.140> length

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
quite done I'm going to bury the length

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.690 
quite done I'm going to bury the length
of<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.620> it's<00:03:52.799> fairly<00:03:52.980> simple<00:03:53.280> you

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
of it it's fairly simple you

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.550 
of it it's fairly simple you
make<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:53.910> bigger<00:03:54.090> or<00:03:54.180> smaller<00:03:54.360> this<00:03:55.290> is<00:03:55.440> the

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
make it bigger or smaller this is the

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
make it bigger or smaller this is the
part<00:03:55.770> that's<00:03:55.860> going<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.099> take<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.310> little<00:03:56.430> bit

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
part that's going to take a little bit

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.640 
part that's going to take a little bit
of<00:03:56.670> practice<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:57.900> want<00:03:58.050> to<00:03:58.110> make<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.410> loop

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
of practice you want to make that loop

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.500 
of practice you want to make that loop
that<00:03:59.040> person<00:03:59.459> looks<00:03:59.610> or<00:03:59.940> at<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.060> right<00:04:00.239> size

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
that person looks or at the right size

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.800 
that person looks or at the right size
so<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:01.019> can<00:04:01.200> take<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:02.360> do<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.510> exact

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
so that you can take it and do the exact

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.809 
so that you can take it and do the exact
same<00:04:03.840> thing<00:04:04.319> one<00:04:04.560> more<00:04:04.739> time<00:04:04.800> you'll<00:04:05.640> take

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
same thing one more time you'll take

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.400 
same thing one more time you'll take
your<00:04:05.910> left<00:04:05.970> hand<00:04:06.239> you'll<00:04:06.840> take<00:04:07.019> it<00:04:07.110> over<00:04:07.170> here

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
your left hand you'll take it over here

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.380 
your left hand you'll take it over here
on<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.920> left<00:04:08.129> side<00:04:08.250> of<00:04:08.400> sloop<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:08.790> make<00:04:08.910> make

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
on the left side of sloop and make make

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.740 
on the left side of sloop and make make
a<00:04:09.420> an<00:04:10.280> imaginary<00:04:11.280> loop<00:04:11.489> take<00:04:12.209> your<00:04:12.239> right<00:04:12.510> hand

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
a an imaginary loop take your right hand

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.780 
a an imaginary loop take your right hand
go<00:04:13.440> over<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:13.890> top<00:04:14.099> of<00:04:14.130> that<00:04:14.310> loop<00:04:14.610> one<00:04:14.760> more

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
go over the top of that loop one more

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.270 
go over the top of that loop one more
time<00:04:15.290> up<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:19.320> you're<00:04:19.530> just<00:04:19.680> going<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.100> do<00:04:20.190> the

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
time up and you're just going to do the

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.670 
time up and you're just going to do the
same<00:04:20.459> exact<00:04:21.000> knot<00:04:21.180> over<00:04:21.450> again<00:04:21.780> what<00:04:22.470> you<00:04:22.650> want

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
same exact knot over again what you want

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.990 
same exact knot over again what you want
to<00:04:22.919> have<00:04:23.070> though<00:04:23.310> is<00:04:23.430> you<00:04:23.520> want<00:04:23.669> to<00:04:23.700> have<00:04:23.820> this

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
to have though is you want to have this

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.879 
to have though is you want to have this
small<00:04:24.360> little<00:04:24.570> eye<00:04:24.810> hole<00:04:25.050> nothing<00:04:25.680> bigger

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
smaller if you can get it's very

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.659 
smaller if you can get it's very
important<00:04:28.260> that<00:04:28.320> you<00:04:28.530> make<00:04:28.740> this<00:04:29.010> loop<00:04:29.250> very
