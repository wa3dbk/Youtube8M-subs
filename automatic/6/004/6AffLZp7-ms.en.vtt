00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
those with only one guitar because it's

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.710 
those with only one guitar because it's
pretty<00:01:51.110> it's<00:01:51.649> got<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.039> heavy<00:01:52.399> pounding<00:01:52.789> going

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:55.849 
on that that is that really that really

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.460 
on that that is that really that really
sells<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:56.599> anyway<00:01:56.840> we'll<00:01:57.110> talk<00:01:57.229> about<00:01:57.319> the

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470

chords first which all we're gonna be
really<00:01:58.819> simple<00:01:59.060> in<00:01:59.239> just<00:01:59.390> a<00:01:59.450> minute<00:01:59.569> matter<00:01:59.750> of

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
really simple in just a minute matter of

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.059 
really simple in just a minute matter of
fact<00:01:59.929> I<00:02:00.050> might<00:02:00.200> not<00:02:00.349> even<00:02:00.470> talk<00:02:00.709> about<00:02:00.979> the

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069

at the end of the bridge there is a

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.520 
at the end of the bridge there is a
little<00:02:08.030> section<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:08.750> here<00:02:08.989> it<00:02:09.080> is<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.319> chord

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
little section so here it is the chord

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.630 
little section so here it is the chord
progression<00:02:09.890> in<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.399> section<00:02:10.700> we<00:02:10.940> hit<00:02:11.330> San

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
progression in that section we hit San

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.480 
progression in that section we hit San
and<00:02:11.819> stops<00:02:12.540> doesn't<00:02:13.530> stop<00:02:13.710> and<00:02:13.980> then<00:02:14.160> just

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
and stops doesn't stop and then just

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.340 
and stops doesn't stop and then just
drops<00:02:14.760> down<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.210> d<00:02:15.420> minor<00:02:15.660> lets<00:02:15.959> that<00:02:16.110> hold

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
drops down to a d minor lets that hold

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.510 
drops down to a d minor lets that hold
and<00:02:16.560> even<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.770> beat<00:02:16.920> stop<00:02:17.220> for<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.400> little

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
and even the beat stop for a little

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.430 
and even the beat stop for a little
while<00:02:17.670> before<00:02:17.910> they<00:02:18.240> for<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.810> kick<00:02:19.020> back<00:02:19.050> in

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
while before they for the kick back in

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.410 
while before they for the kick back in
with<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.770> chord<00:02:19.950> progression<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:20.880> there<00:02:21.270> you

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
with the chord progression so there you

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.960 
with the chord progression so there you
have<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.630> five<00:02:22.560> chords<00:02:22.980> counting<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.490> one<00:02:23.700> d

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
have the five chords counting the one d

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.970 
have the five chords counting the one d
minor<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:25.020> sequence<00:02:25.440> really<00:02:25.800> never

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
minor and the sequence really never

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.710 
minor and the sequence really never
changes<00:02:26.490> if<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.730> just<00:02:26.970> listen<00:02:27.270> carefully

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
changes if you just listen carefully

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.390 
changes if you just listen carefully
you'll<00:02:28.230> notice<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.560> at<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.800> end<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.070> various

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
you'll notice that at the end of various

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.490 
you'll notice that at the end of various
sections<00:02:29.760> there<00:02:30.209> are<00:02:30.480> additional<00:02:30.840> measures

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
sections there are additional measures

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.710 
sections there are additional measures
of<00:02:31.709> f<00:02:32.070> sometimes<00:02:32.550> just<00:02:32.790> one<00:02:32.940> sometimes<00:02:33.510> a

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
of f sometimes just one sometimes a

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.949 
of f sometimes just one sometimes a
whole<00:02:33.900> set<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.140> four<00:02:34.550> any<00:02:35.550> so<00:02:35.940> that's<00:02:36.840> really

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
whole set of four any so that's really

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.090 
whole set of four any so that's really
it<00:02:37.110> we're<00:02:37.410> going<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.590> talk<00:02:37.709> about<00:02:37.830> in<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.070> next
