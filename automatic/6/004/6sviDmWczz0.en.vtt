then after they download you just
install<00:03:09.859> them<00:03:10.069> it's<00:03:10.519> really<00:03:10.940> that<00:03:11.180> simple

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
install them it's really that simple

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.819

then<00:03:11.659> all<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:11.870> got<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.079> do<00:03:12.139> is<00:03:12.260> restart<00:03:12.650> your

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
then all you got to do is restart your

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.970 
then all you got to do is restart your
computer<00:03:12.950> it<00:03:13.599> now<00:03:14.599> for<00:03:14.900> AMD<00:03:15.170> I<00:03:15.319> believe<00:03:15.739> it's

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
computer it now for AMD I believe it's

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.369 
computer it now for AMD I believe it's
the<00:03:16.129> same<00:03:16.159> way<00:03:16.670> I'm<00:03:16.970> not<00:03:17.480> going<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:18.049> be<00:03:18.169> going

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
the same way I'm not going to be going

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.080 
the same way I'm not going to be going
to<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.739> steps<00:03:19.010> because<00:03:19.220> I<00:03:19.400> don't<00:03:19.579> have<00:03:19.699> an<00:03:19.819> AMD

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
to the steps because I don't have an AMD

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.520 
to the steps because I don't have an AMD
so<00:03:20.540> it's<00:03:20.690> not<00:03:20.810> going<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:21.049> work<00:03:21.799> properly<00:03:22.129> but

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
so it's not going to work properly but

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.849 
so it's not going to work properly but
same<00:03:24.530> steps<00:03:24.829> just<00:03:25.190> install<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:25.819> run<00:03:26.629> it<00:03:26.859> search

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
same steps just install it run it search

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.180 
same steps just install it run it search
download<00:03:28.760> install<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.989> drivers<00:03:30.379> restart

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
download install the drivers restart

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.960 
download install the drivers restart
your<00:03:31.340> computer<00:03:32.290> then<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.410> should<00:03:33.590> be<00:03:33.709> done

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
your computer then you should be done

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.180 
your computer then you should be done
now<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:35.389> don't<00:03:36.079> remember<00:03:36.199> from<00:03:36.590> my<00:03:36.709> last<00:03:36.739> year

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
I'm where to go to check if your DirectX

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.479 
I'm where to go to check if your DirectX
is<00:03:39.859> enabled

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
is enabled

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.460 
is enabled
two<00:03:41.060> ways<00:03:41.269> you<00:03:41.510> can<00:03:41.629> get<00:03:41.780> there<00:03:42.049> you<00:03:42.349> can

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
two ways you can get there you can

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.470 
two ways you can get there you can
either<00:03:42.560> go<00:03:42.769> right<00:03:42.949> here<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:43.459> type<00:03:43.940> in<00:03:44.090> DX<00:03:44.680> diag

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
either go right here and type in DX diag

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.319 
either go right here and type in DX diag
or<00:03:47.739> you<00:03:48.739> can<00:03:48.919> use<00:03:49.069> the<00:03:49.250> run<00:03:49.489> which<00:03:49.849> the<00:03:50.209> way

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
or you can use the run which the way

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.479 
or you can use the run which the way
that<00:03:50.510> I<00:03:50.540> open<00:03:50.870> it<00:03:50.959> up<00:03:51.019> is<00:03:51.199> just<00:03:51.230> Windows<00:03:51.799> X<00:03:52.160> R

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
that I open it up is just Windows X R

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.860 
that I open it up is just Windows X R
and<00:03:53.000> then<00:03:53.900> type<00:03:54.079> in<00:03:54.260> DXi<00:03:54.829> and<00:03:55.160> press<00:03:55.310> ok<00:03:55.870> so

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
and then type in DXi and press ok so

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.080 
and then type in DXi and press ok so
those<00:03:57.139> are<00:03:57.290> your<00:03:57.379> two<00:03:57.500> ways<00:03:57.769> of<00:03:57.949> doing<00:03:58.069> it<00:03:58.310> just

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
those are your two ways of doing it just

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.050 
those are your two ways of doing it just
go<00:03:59.569> to<00:03:59.629> the<00:03:59.930> display<00:04:00.409> tab<00:04:00.709> and<00:04:01.579> you<00:04:01.819> want<00:04:02.000> to

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
go to the display tab and you want to

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.300 
go to the display tab and you want to
look<00:04:02.209> and<00:04:02.480> make<00:04:02.569> sure<00:04:02.750> that<00:04:02.989> I<00:04:03.769> think<00:04:04.129> all

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
look and make sure that I think all

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.800

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
three of these have to be enabled but

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.569 
three of these have to be enabled but
mainly<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.590> direct3d<00:04:06.949> is<00:04:07.310> what<00:04:07.459> we're

worried<00:04:07.849> about

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:08.199
