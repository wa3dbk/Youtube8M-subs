and in the shower I kind of you know got

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.959 
and in the shower I kind of you know got
a<00:00:57.300> towel<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.989> rub<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.739> ward<00:00:59.280> along<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.730> towel

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
a towel and rub the ward along the towel

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.560 
a towel and rub the ward along the towel
get<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.539> get<00:01:01.289> some<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.680> did<00:01:01.859> skin<00:01:02.190> off

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
get the get some that did skin off

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.850 
get the get some that did skin off
because<00:01:03.570> they<00:01:03.809> say<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.049> scrape<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.799> I

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
because they say to scrape it so I

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.320 
because they say to scrape it so I
figured<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> towel<00:01:05.549> would<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> best<00:01:06.150> way

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
figured the towel would be the best way

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.390 
figured the towel would be the best way
to<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.750> because<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.740> definitely<00:01:07.950> don't<00:01:08.159> want

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
but it didn't last very long you know

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.470 
but it didn't last very long you know
last<00:03:44.709> is<00:03:44.860> like<00:03:45.010> a<00:03:45.040> few<00:03:45.340> set<00:03:45.550> brief<00:03:45.850> seconds<00:03:46.330> and

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
last is like a few set brief seconds and

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.449 
last is like a few set brief seconds and
then<00:03:46.570> it<00:03:46.630> was<00:03:46.750> gone<00:03:46.989> I<00:03:47.280> couldn't<00:03:48.280> feel<00:03:48.430> it

not<00:05:15.120> going<00:05:15.300> to<00:05:15.390> stay<00:05:15.540> big<00:05:15.840> hopefully<00:05:16.970> so<00:05:17.970> I'll

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
not going to stay big hopefully so I'll

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.330 
not going to stay big hopefully so I'll
need<00:05:19.170> something<00:05:19.380> smaller<00:05:19.710> besides<00:05:20.130> these

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
don't seem like it'd be real effective

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.570 
don't seem like it'd be real effective
but<00:05:33.270> as<00:05:33.600> you<00:05:33.750> can<00:05:33.840> see<00:05:34.100> you<00:05:35.100> know<00:05:35.220> this<00:05:35.400> thing
