00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
do you think that shadow will keep

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.619 
do you think that shadow will keep
chasing<00:03:50.360> silver<00:03:50.840> I<00:03:51.129> don't<00:03:52.129> know<00:03:52.340> work<00:03:52.640> I<00:03:52.970> guess

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
chasing silver I don't know work I guess

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.990 
chasing silver I don't know work I guess
it<00:03:53.810> depends<00:03:54.200> on<00:03:54.590> just<00:03:54.829> how<00:03:54.980> bad<00:03:55.310> shadows

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
it depends on just how bad shadows

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.440 
it depends on just how bad shadows
well<00:03:56.930> shadow<00:03:57.470> seems<00:03:57.890> pretty<00:03:58.159> bad<00:03:58.459> so<00:03:59.030> he<00:03:59.209> could

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
well shadow seems pretty bad so he could

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.780 
well shadow seems pretty bad so he could
be<00:03:59.599> chasing<00:03:59.870> silver<00:04:00.500> for<00:04:00.860> hours<00:04:01.159> on<00:04:01.280> end<00:04:01.340> I

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
be chasing silver for hours on end I

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.819 
be chasing silver for hours on end I
think<00:04:02.299> it<00:04:02.720> will<00:04:02.870> be<00:04:03.049> for<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.409> best

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
think it will be for the best

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.500 
think it will be for the best
if<00:04:03.980> we<00:04:04.159> just<00:04:04.400> let<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.790> two<00:04:04.970> of<00:04:05.000> them<00:04:05.299> talk

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
if we just let the two of them talk

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.500 
if we just let the two of them talk
things<00:04:05.810> over<00:04:06.409> good<00:04:06.980> idea<00:04:07.280> Meena<00:04:07.609> now<00:04:08.299> I<00:04:08.329> think

things over good idea Meena now I think

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.660

it's<00:04:08.959> a<00:04:09.049> good<00:04:09.200> time<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.739> wrap<00:04:09.920> it<00:04:09.950> up

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
it's a good time to wrap it up

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.780 
it's a good time to wrap it up
