00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.320
 A lot of rain and now I'm going to 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.449
 passed by some streets to us here 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.900
 to see how the situation in our 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.900
 community 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:07.890
 is're mad thing is to play 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.020
 do not leave in the car 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:55.430
 Anyway, I believe that 's what happened. 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:02:00.940
 As you are singing here on the street and 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.940

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.660
 he 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:25.480
 good this is the result of wanting to do is 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:31.459
 this adventure pass by the gallÃ³ street 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.709

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.629
 the car died 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.319
 It's the car died I had to push 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:43.689
 demolay all and now call the mechanic 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:47.030
 to see what the fuck I think 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:49.870
 good then this was the result ne people 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.700
 want to go out on the street past 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.280
 flooded to show the flood 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.889
 go a tip do not pass it would be late 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.680
 chaos if you 're not in a tractor a bus 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:03.079
 and a tall car in a big car does not 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.239
 passes a flooded street 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.700
 you suddenly do not know if it's deep 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.889
 If you are not, do not make up on it because the 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.849
 business and so the car is now in the 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.790
 mechanical 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:16.459
 the engine was pro bag understood at least 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.819
 two thousand reais of loss is right 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.000
 but at least I hope it works for you 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.940
 What are you seeing there? 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.989
 car down a street if it has flooded 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.989
