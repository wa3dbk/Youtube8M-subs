00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.470 

hopefully<00:04:36.950> one<00:04:37.160> thing<00:04:37.400> you<00:04:38.000> don't<00:04:38.120> know<00:04:38.330> the

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
hopefully one thing you don't know the

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.330 
hopefully one thing you don't know the
location<00:04:38.600> sometimes<00:04:39.440> you<00:04:39.620> find<00:04:39.860> Sonny's<00:04:40.190> like

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340

here's<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.800> 10<00:04:43.010> locations<00:04:43.540> that's<00:04:44.540> a<00:04:44.690> nice

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870
