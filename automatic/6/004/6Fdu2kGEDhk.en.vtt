00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
important to have strong muscles around

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.850 
important to have strong muscles around
stomach<00:01:53.860> so<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:55.299> exercise<00:01:55.780> is<00:01:56.349> also

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
stomach so this exercise is also

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.660 
stomach so this exercise is also
balanced<00:01:57.310> but<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.649> need<00:01:59.829> to<00:01:59.979> work<00:02:00.159> out<00:02:00.429> the

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
balanced but you need to work out the

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.309 
balanced but you need to work out the
core<00:02:00.909> also<00:02:01.390> so<00:02:02.159> my<00:02:03.159> hips<00:02:03.509> are<00:02:04.509> suffering<00:02:05.049> a<00:02:05.170> lot

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
core also so my hips are suffering a lot

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.889 
core also so my hips are suffering a lot
when<00:02:05.649> we<00:02:05.679> are<00:02:06.009> skiing<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:06.670> sometimes<00:02:07.629> it's

when we are skiing it sometimes it's

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.150 
when we are skiing it sometimes it's
very<00:02:07.989> bumpy<00:02:08.410> so<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:11.200> pressure<00:02:11.470> is<00:02:11.709> everytime

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
very bumpy so the pressure is everytime

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.789 
very bumpy so the pressure is everytime
here<00:02:12.519> when<00:02:12.910> we<00:02:13.060> are<00:02:13.180> skiing<00:02:13.450> down<00:02:13.690> so<00:02:14.049> I<00:02:14.470> have
