can't<00:01:59.880> really<00:02:00.000> teach<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.570> some<00:02:01.079> players<00:02:01.350> have

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
can't really teach it some players have

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.770 
can't really teach it some players have
a<00:02:01.649> knack<00:02:01.950> for<00:02:01.979> always<00:02:02.579> getting<00:02:03.299> behind<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
15 it's almost a guarantee that it seems

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.650 
15 it's almost a guarantee that it seems
like<00:02:47.730> I'm<00:02:47.819> giving<00:02:47.940> up<00:02:48.150> some<00:02:48.390> sort<00:02:48.599> of

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
like I'm giving up some sort of

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.089 
like I'm giving up some sort of
opportunity<00:02:49.230> in<00:02:49.319> front<00:02:49.349> of<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.680> net<00:02:49.920> and

opportunity in front of the net and

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.530 
opportunity in front of the net and
that's<00:02:50.250> not<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.489> good<00:02:50.670> look<00:02:50.849> and<00:02:51.239> that's<00:02:51.390> just

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
that's not a good look and that's just

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.930 
that's not a good look and that's just
how<00:02:51.660> FIFA<00:02:52.140> works<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:53.040> my<00:02:53.190> opponents<00:02:53.640> always

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
how FIFA works that my opponents always

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.449 
how FIFA works that my opponents always
capitalize<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.480> just<00:02:54.959> feels<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.440> way<00:02:55.620> so

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
capitalize it just feels that way so

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.160 
capitalize it just feels that way so
you've<00:02:56.609> got<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.970> play<00:02:57.269> smart<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:57.989> then<00:02:58.079> you

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
you've got to play smart and then you

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.170 
you've got to play smart and then you
have<00:02:58.410> things<00:02:59.250> like<00:02:59.340> this<00:02:59.579> where's<00:02:59.940> just

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180
