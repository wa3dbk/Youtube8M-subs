jump<00:01:59.970> up<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.800> flat<00:02:01.800> sign<00:02:02.190> looks<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.450> it

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
jump up a flat sign looks like this it

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.020 
jump up a flat sign looks like this it
makes<00:02:04.620> the<00:02:04.770> note<00:02:04.950> next<00:02:05.160> to<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.460> move<00:02:05.670> down<00:02:06.000> a

half step or to the black or white key
to<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.119> left<00:02:09.380> let's<00:02:10.380> say<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.649> had<00:02:10.950> an<00:02:11.100> F<00:02:11.340> with

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
to the left let's say you had an F with

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.160 
to the left let's say you had an F with
the<00:02:11.850> sharp<00:02:12.180> in<00:02:12.330> front<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:12.750> instead<00:02:13.050> of

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
the sharp in front of it instead of

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.710 
the sharp in front of it instead of
playing<00:02:13.470> F<00:02:13.830> you'll<00:02:14.580> go<00:02:14.790> up<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.210> black<00:02:15.450> key

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
playing F you'll go up to the black key

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
playing F you'll go up to the black key
a<00:02:15.930> half<00:02:16.200> step<00:02:16.500> up<00:02:16.820> gonna<00:02:17.820> be<00:02:17.940> F<00:02:18.120> sharp<00:02:18.530> if<00:02:19.530> you

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
a half step up gonna be F sharp if you

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.610 
a half step up gonna be F sharp if you
have<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.310> B<00:02:20.820> sharp

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
it'll go up a half step to C because

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.810 
it'll go up a half step to C because
there<00:02:25.320> is<00:02:25.410> no<00:02:25.590> black<00:02:25.860> key<00:02:26.100> in<00:02:26.130> between<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.640> two

signature tells you how many beats
you'll<00:02:55.740> have<00:02:55.860> in<00:02:56.010> each<00:02:56.130> measure<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:57.600> C<00:02:57.900> stands

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
you'll have in each measure the C stands

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.280 
you'll have in each measure the C stands
for<00:02:58.500> common<00:02:59.130> time<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.580> it's<00:03:00.300> four<00:03:00.870> beats<00:03:01.140> per
