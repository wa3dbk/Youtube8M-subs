00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.840
 we are well at cropalati in the province of 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.480
 cosenza 384 meters above sea level 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.600
 and even here we tend to produce i 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.990
 this is good quality hams 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.890
 beautiful dried up of about 16 kg of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.080
 a homemade pig 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.080
 as a first move we have it purged 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.119
 for four days using weights 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.390
 my case I use carboys 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.809
 from a few meters above in order to 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.949
 encourage compression and do it 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:45.890
 purge longer possible apologizes 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:50.839
 for 3 4 days then it is sprinkled with 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.570
 salt as you see three more sixteen more 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:56.360
 days because the rule is used for 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.760
 every meat program we make a 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.710
 day so there are 16 programs 16 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.469
 days still in salt for a 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.640
 overall less than twenty days later 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:10.610
 of which will be washed completely from the 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.460
 salt and I prefer to leave it inside the 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.600
 bathe in cold water for at least 12 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.340
 hours 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.130
 past this time will be peppered to 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.470
 they will use pigskin a 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.350
 cover the part of the meat not 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.350
 we will leave for another 20 days 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.909
 without salt in the past horizontal level 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.040
 in others see days then after a 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.240
 total of about 40 days will be 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.549
 hung in a cool environment at 4 5 degrees 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.470
 for at least three months 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.549
 past this period we will use the 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.159
 fat with black pepper flour and 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.640
 will be practically applied 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.799
 so-called signature the whole part of 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.570
 meat will be practically strewn with 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.810
 this fat with flour 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.550
 and competes imagined black arrived on 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.190
 period of heat then between June 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.110
 July August September and October on 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.680
 ham I the opposition rho in one 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.509
 small cold room recovered from 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.959
 a refrigerator among three other four 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.300
 months arrived at a new season 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.600
 fresh will be hung up again to finish 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.670
 its drying therefore practically 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.020
 the seasoning 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.840
 let's say if this project everything 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.459
 will go smooth can be consumed a 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.160
 January February next year 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.370
 so powers we will be at least 12 months 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.590
 exact seasoning this video by 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.050
 launch then we will see all the 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.430
 hand sequences until the end with a 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.430
 single final video 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.130
 here is this very rudimentary method for 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:50.000
 press the other joint a good glass 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.950
 and very ecological is very clean therefore 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.750
 fits very well with your own weight 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.069
 to press for at least four days in 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.769
 so that the ham 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.780
 blood comes out completely is 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.239
 important this step because the 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.700
 blood giving the question that could 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.420
 compromising its quality up 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.129
 just to fail completely 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.510
 thanks for the attention from micro aesthetic 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.510
 palates province of cosenza
