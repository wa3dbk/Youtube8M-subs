Rover Sport so we're going to work with
the<00:01:54.650> discovery<00:01:55.190> to<00:01:55.400> first<00:01:56.860> just<00:01:57.860> push<00:01:58.190> the

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
the discovery to first just push the

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.760 
the discovery to first just push the
checkmark<00:02:01.390> then<00:02:02.390> it<00:02:02.600> goes<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.840> discovery<00:02:03.530> -

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
checkmark then it goes to discovery -

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.290 
checkmark then it goes to discovery -
this<00:02:04.280> will<00:02:04.460> be<00:02:04.550> engine<00:02:04.940> management

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
this will be engine management

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:12.460 
this will be engine management

to<00:02:22.880> do<00:02:23.150> is<00:02:23.420> get<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.050> set<00:02:24.320> on<00:02:24.500> where<00:02:24.920> you're

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
to do is get it set on where you're

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:36.510 
to do is get it set on where you're
going<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.250> go<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.730> then<00:02:26.660> turn<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.050> key<00:02:27.260> on

which<00:02:53.600> I<00:02:53.750> just<00:02:53.959> did<00:02:56.590> then<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:57.709> thinks<00:02:58.040> about<00:02:58.160> it

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
which I just did then it thinks about it

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.780 
which I just did then it thinks about it
for<00:02:58.580> a<00:02:58.640> little<00:02:58.760> bit

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.759 

it<00:03:03.420> gives<00:03:03.599> you<00:03:03.719> the<00:03:03.810> hardware<00:03:04.260> that's<00:03:04.439> in<00:03:04.680> the

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
it gives you the hardware that's in the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
ECU it's not really important then it

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.289

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
tells you this is the actual serial

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.000 
tells you this is the actual serial
number<00:03:12.569> of<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.900> ECU<00:03:13.409> that's<00:03:13.680> kind<00:03:13.950> of

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
number of the ECU that's kind of

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.740 
number of the ECU that's kind of
important<00:03:14.489> if<00:03:14.579> you're<00:03:14.700> going<00:03:14.849> to<00:03:14.939> reprogram

farther here says it's not present

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.899 
farther here says it's not present
because<00:04:07.049> I<00:04:07.079> did<00:04:07.379> fix<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.829> actually<00:04:08.760> has<00:04:08.879> a

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
because I did fix it actually has a

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.640 
because I did fix it actually has a
battery<00:04:09.209> cutoff<00:04:09.810> in<00:04:09.989> it<00:04:10.109> because<00:04:10.260> this<00:04:10.409> car

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
battery cutoff in it because this car

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.479 
battery cutoff in it because this car
sits<00:04:11.040> all<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.400> time

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.699 

then<00:04:17.090> you<00:04:17.209> scroll<00:04:17.569> down<00:04:17.599> because<00:04:18.410> we<00:04:18.590> know

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
then you scroll down because we know

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.860 
then you scroll down because we know
what's<00:04:18.889> wrong<00:04:19.160> we<00:04:19.759> fix<00:04:20.030> it<00:04:20.180> by<00:04:20.359> hooking<00:04:20.690> it<00:04:20.780> up

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
what's wrong we fix it by hooking it up

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.129 
what's wrong we fix it by hooking it up
again<00:04:21.199> just<00:04:21.859> go<00:04:22.039> to<00:04:22.099> the<00:04:22.340> next<00:04:22.550> one<00:04:22.849> says<00:04:23.690> clear

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
again just go to the next one says clear

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.879 
again just go to the next one says clear
two<00:04:24.289> codes<00:04:24.590> just<00:04:25.630> puts<00:04:26.630> it<00:04:26.780> clear<00:04:27.319> they<00:04:27.710> ask

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
two codes just puts it clear they ask

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.189 
two codes just puts it clear they ask
you<00:04:28.039> are<00:04:28.130> you<00:04:28.220> sure<00:04:28.310> he<00:04:28.819> told<00:04:29.030> yes<00:04:31.900> then<00:04:32.900> I<00:04:32.930> want

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
you are you sure he told yes then I want

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:40.089 
you are you sure he told yes then I want
you<00:04:33.319> to<00:04:33.380> turn<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.770> key<00:04:33.979> off<00:04:38.949> hit<00:04:39.949> the

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099 
you to turn the key off hit the

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.409 
you to turn the key off hit the
checkmark<00:04:40.400> again<00:04:41.740> tells<00:04:42.740> you<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:42.919> wait<00:04:43.419> 15

seconds they want you to turn the key
back<00:04:57.740> on<00:05:01.780> then<00:05:02.780> you<00:05:02.900> push<00:05:03.139> the<00:05:03.319> check<00:05:03.650> again

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
back on then you push the check again

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.850 
back on then you push the check again
and<00:05:05.720> I<00:05:05.810> look<00:05:05.990> to<00:05:06.110> see<00:05:06.139> if<00:05:06.380> there's<00:05:06.560> any<00:05:06.710> more

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
and I look to see if there's any more

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:14.200 
and I look to see if there's any more
codes<00:05:07.190> in<00:05:07.400> there

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.670 

it's<00:05:15.210> been<00:05:15.360> cleared<00:05:15.720> you're<00:05:16.290> all<00:05:16.440> done<00:05:16.650> with

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
it's been cleared you're all done with

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.860 
it's been cleared you're all done with
that<00:05:16.980> if<00:05:17.730> you<00:05:17.850> had<00:05:17.940> a<00:05:17.970> list<00:05:18.210> of<00:05:18.360> codes<00:05:18.570> and<00:05:18.750> you

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
that if you had a list of codes and you

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.480 
that if you had a list of codes and you
did<00:05:19.050> clear<00:05:19.320> them<00:05:19.410> out<00:05:19.470> write<00:05:19.800> them<00:05:19.920> down<00:05:20.100> what

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
did clear them out write them down what

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.150 
did clear them out write them down what
I<00:05:20.520> would<00:05:20.760> do<00:05:20.880> is<00:05:21.000> road<00:05:21.300> test<00:05:21.600> the<00:05:21.780> car<00:05:22.160> retest

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
I would do is road test the car retest

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.570 
I would do is road test the car retest
again<00:05:23.490> and<00:05:23.640> see<00:05:23.790> which<00:05:23.970> one<00:05:24.210> comes<00:05:24.420> back<00:05:25.580> you

again and see which one comes back you

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.970 
again and see which one comes back you
