today I'm going to take a ride up to a

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.070 
today I'm going to take a ride up to a
little<00:00:08.130> amusement<00:00:08.370> park<00:00:09.000> that<00:00:09.240> was<00:00:09.389> shut<00:00:10.050> down

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
little amusement park that was shut down

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.770 
little amusement park that was shut down
about<00:00:11.120> two<00:00:12.120> years<00:00:12.330> ago<00:00:14.360> people<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.599> live<00:00:15.750> in

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
about two years ago people that live in

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.720 
about two years ago people that live in
Chicago<00:00:16.500> sometimes<00:00:17.010> we<00:00:17.190> bring<00:00:17.340> their<00:00:17.550> kids

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
Chicago sometimes we bring their kids

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.620 
Chicago sometimes we bring their kids
out<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.080> northwest<00:00:19.529> suburbs<00:00:20.270> to<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.300> little

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
out to the northwest suburbs to a little

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.519 
out to the northwest suburbs to a little
amusement<00:00:22.320> park<00:00:22.619> called<00:00:23.130> Santa's<00:00:23.670> Village

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
amusement park called Santa's Village

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.710 
amusement park called Santa's Village
and<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:26.130> believe<00:00:26.490> there<00:00:27.119> were<00:00:27.240> other<00:00:27.359> say<00:00:27.660> in

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
and I believe there were other say in

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.540 
and I believe there were other say in
those<00:00:27.840> villages<00:00:28.109> there<00:00:28.890> was<00:00:29.010> even<00:00:29.039> one<00:00:29.310> in

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
those villages there was even one in

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.109 
those villages there was even one in
California

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
California

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.119 
California
but<00:00:32.719> this<00:00:32.989> was<00:00:33.199> I<00:00:33.320> think<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.559> last<00:00:33.800> one<00:00:34.100> that

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
but this was I think the last one that

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.920 
but this was I think the last one that
still<00:00:34.520> stayed<00:00:34.789> open<00:00:34.969> and<00:00:35.270> it<00:00:35.329> was<00:00:35.449> open<00:00:35.809> all

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
still stayed open and it was open all

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.680 
still stayed open and it was open all
the<00:00:36.020> way<00:00:36.110> up<00:00:36.230> until<00:00:36.969> about<00:00:37.969> the<00:00:38.270> year<00:00:38.300> two

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
the way up until about the year two

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.860 
the way up until about the year two
thousand<00:00:39.230> six<00:00:39.879> and<00:00:40.879> then<00:00:41.269> I<00:00:41.570> don't<00:00:41.750> even

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
thousand six and then I don't even

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.479 
thousand six and then I don't even
really<00:00:42.140> remember<00:00:42.260> if<00:00:42.710> they<00:00:42.829> even<00:00:42.980> opened<00:00:43.399> it

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
really remember if they even opened it

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.360 
really remember if they even opened it
up<00:00:43.610> or<00:00:43.820> not<00:00:44.030> or<00:00:44.210> if<00:00:44.269> it<00:00:44.390> dysfunctions<00:00:44.989> for<00:00:45.370> part

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
up or not or if it dysfunctions for part

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.750 
up or not or if it dysfunctions for part
of<00:00:46.460> 2006<00:00:47.420> but<00:00:47.979> there<00:00:48.979> was<00:00:49.129> nothing<00:00:49.460> going<00:00:49.489> on

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
of 2006 but there was nothing going on

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.920 
of 2006 but there was nothing going on
last<00:00:50.059> year<00:00:50.769> in<00:00:51.769> fact<00:00:52.329> they<00:00:53.329> had<00:00:53.449> already<00:00:53.570> taken

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
last year in fact they had already taken

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.579 
last year in fact they had already taken
one<00:00:54.260> of<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:54.670> larger<00:00:55.670> rides<00:00:55.970> out<00:00:56.300> which<00:00:56.659> wasn't

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
one of the larger rides out which wasn't

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.670 
one of the larger rides out which wasn't
really<00:00:57.710> a<00:00:57.890> large<00:00:58.159> right<00:00:58.519> I<00:00:58.550> guess<00:00:58.940> but<00:00:59.180> for<00:00:59.420> a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
really a large right I guess but for a

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.110 
really a large right I guess but for a
small<00:01:00.680> kiddie<00:01:01.070> park<00:01:01.399> it<00:01:01.519> was<00:01:01.610> a<00:01:01.670> pretty<00:01:01.909> large

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
small kiddie park it was a pretty large

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.850 
small kiddie park it was a pretty large
right<00:01:02.510> it<00:01:02.540> was<00:01:02.750> a<00:01:02.780> roller<00:01:03.049> coaster<00:01:03.500> called<00:01:03.710> the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
right it was a roller coaster called the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.590 
right it was a roller coaster called the
typhoon<00:01:06.310> it's<00:01:07.310> mostly<00:01:07.759> an<00:01:07.880> amusement<00:01:08.330> parks

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
typhoon it's mostly an amusement parks

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.650 
typhoon it's mostly an amusement parks
were<00:01:08.750> probably<00:01:09.550> kids<00:01:10.550> an<00:01:10.729> age<00:01:10.910> range<00:01:11.210> of<00:01:11.420> about

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
were probably kids an age range of about

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.850 
were probably kids an age range of about
maybe<00:01:11.929> five<00:01:12.289> years<00:01:12.320> to<00:01:12.890> 11<00:01:13.580> years<00:01:13.759> old

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.440 

and<00:01:17.160> it's<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.670> little<00:01:17.910> ways<00:01:18.060> up<00:01:18.270> ahead

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
and it's just a little ways up ahead

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.220 
and it's just a little ways up ahead
here<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:20.990> guess<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.170> opened<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> late<00:01:22.710> 50s<00:01:23.430> I

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
here I guess it opened in the late 50s I

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
here I guess it opened in the late 50s I
moved<00:01:25.230> out<00:01:25.350> here<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.680> about<00:01:25.830> nineteen

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
moved out here in about nineteen

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.890 
moved out here in about nineteen
seventy-two<00:01:27.290> this<00:01:28.290> area<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:30.210> actually<00:01:30.390> even

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
seventy-two this area and actually even

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.280 
seventy-two this area and actually even
though<00:01:31.080> i<00:01:31.760> moved<00:01:32.760> here<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:32.940> 1970<00:01:33.930> i<00:01:33.960> think<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
though i moved here in 1970 i think the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.900 
though i moved here in 1970 i think the
first<00:01:34.470> time<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.710> ever<00:01:34.830> even<00:01:34.979> went<00:01:35.370> to<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.580> park

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
first time I ever even went to this park

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:42.260 
first time I ever even went to this park
was<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:37.400> 1985<00:01:39.500> friend<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.620> mine<00:01:40.880> was<00:01:41.880> taking

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
was a 1985 friend of mine was taking

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.630 
was a 1985 friend of mine was taking
your<00:01:42.390> kids<00:01:42.690> to<00:01:43.650> the<00:01:43.770> park<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.100> got<00:01:44.250> some<00:01:44.430> free

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
your kids to the park and got some free

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.570 
your kids to the park and got some free
tickets<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.330> we<00:01:45.660> went<00:01:46.650> along<00:01:46.890> with<00:01:47.100> her<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.550> I

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
tickets so we went along with her so I

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.700 
tickets so we went along with her so I
think<00:01:47.790> 1985<00:01:48.660> was<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> first<00:01:49.200> time<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.410> was<00:01:49.590> at

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
think 1985 was the first time I was at

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.200 
think 1985 was the first time I was at
the<00:01:49.740> park<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.280> think<00:01:51.470> maybe<00:01:52.580> 85<00:01:53.580> to<00:01:53.910> 95

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
the park and I think maybe 85 to 95

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.710 
the park and I think maybe 85 to 95
maybe<00:01:54.509> one<00:01:54.780> other<00:01:54.900> time<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.200> went<00:01:55.470> there

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.310 

and<00:02:00.230> then<00:02:00.350> later<00:02:00.560> on<00:02:00.710> I<00:02:01.720> think<00:02:02.720> sometime<00:02:03.200> in

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
and then later on I think sometime in

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.780 
and then later on I think sometime in
the<00:02:03.410> eighties<00:02:03.620> they<00:02:03.800> added<00:02:04.070> on<00:02:04.160> a<00:02:04.190> water<00:02:04.460> park

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
the eighties they added on a water park

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.380 
the eighties they added on a water park
right<00:02:05.420> next<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.840> it

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
right next to it

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.059 
right next to it
maybe<00:02:08.110> you'd<00:02:08.259> be<00:02:08.350> able<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.530> see<00:02:08.619> some<00:02:08.920> of<00:02:08.950> the

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
maybe you'd be able to see some of the

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.200 
maybe you'd be able to see some of the
water<00:02:09.250> park<00:02:09.520> up<00:02:09.670> its<00:02:09.819> still<00:02:10.030> left<00:02:10.270> there

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:22.640 

yeah<00:02:15.150> racing<00:02:16.150> Rapids<00:02:16.660> it's<00:02:16.870> called

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.619 

that<00:02:23.250> one<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.430> never<00:02:23.640> actually<00:02:23.819> even<00:02:24.150> got<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.390> be

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
that one I never actually even got to be

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.520 
that one I never actually even got to be
inside<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.110> go<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.500> one

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.020 

the<00:02:31.530> intersection<00:02:32.159> of<00:02:32.250> 72<00:02:33.000> 25

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
the intersection of 72 25

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
possibly have a chance of reopening but

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:39.380 
possibly have a chance of reopening but

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.350 

I<00:05:58.270> think<00:05:58.840> in<00:05:58.979> 2006<00:05:59.979> this<00:06:00.729> is<00:06:00.880> in<00:06:01.000> the<00:06:01.090> village

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
I think in 2006 this is in the village

I think in 2006 this is in the village
of<00:06:01.449> east<00:06:01.660> dundee<00:06:01.870> i<00:06:02.020> think<00:06:02.319> in<00:06:02.380> 2006<00:06:03.250> the<00:06:03.400> first

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
of east dundee i think in 2006 the first

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.700 
of east dundee i think in 2006 the first
trouble<00:06:04.030> that<00:06:04.150> it<00:06:04.240> had<00:06:04.419> was<00:06:04.630> I<00:06:04.900> think<00:06:05.590> they

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
trouble that it had was I think they

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.290 
trouble that it had was I think they
owed<00:06:05.830> one<00:06:05.979> hundred<00:06:06.220> and<00:06:06.250> something<00:06:06.699> thousand

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
owed one hundred and something thousand

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.930 
owed one hundred and something thousand
water<00:06:07.479> bill<00:06:08.039> to<00:06:09.039> the<00:06:09.069> village<00:06:09.400> of<00:06:09.550> east<00:06:09.699> dundee

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
water bill to the village of east dundee

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.100 
water bill to the village of east dundee
and<00:06:10.090> they<00:06:10.330> weren't<00:06:10.479> able<00:06:10.599> to<00:06:10.780> come<00:06:10.930> up<00:06:10.960> with

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.689 
and they weren't able to come up with
the<00:06:11.229> money<00:06:11.410> to<00:06:11.620> pay<00:06:11.770> for<00:06:11.800> it<00:06:14.460> so<00:06:15.460> i<00:06:15.490> think<00:06:15.610> that

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:15.699 
the money to pay for it so i think that
