00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
makes all the difference having a

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.020 
makes all the difference having a
polytunnel<00:03:31.760> especially<00:03:32.760> when<00:03:32.879> it's<00:03:32.970> raining

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
polytunnel especially when it's raining

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.409 
polytunnel especially when it's raining
or<00:03:33.750> just<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.530> get<00:03:34.650> out<00:03:34.799> a<00:03:34.829> wind<00:03:35.159> and<00:03:35.609> it's<00:03:36.180> so

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
or just to get out a wind and it's so

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.890 
or just to get out a wind and it's so
much<00:03:36.629> warmer<00:03:36.870> in<00:03:37.079> there<00:03:37.760> you<00:03:38.760> know<00:03:38.909> yesterday

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900

I think it was about 12 degrees outside
give<00:03:42.900> me<00:03:43.019> big<00:03:43.199> polytunnel<00:03:43.709> here<00:03:45.829> it<00:03:46.829> was<00:03:47.040> 27

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
give me big polytunnel here it was 27
