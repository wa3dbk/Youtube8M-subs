bigger now it's a few reasons why door
will<00:00:35.969> do<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:37.550> one<00:00:38.550> reason<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.180> door

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
will do this one reason is the door

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.670 
will do this one reason is the door
could<00:00:39.719> settle<00:00:40.190> it's<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.250> new<00:00:41.430> house<00:00:42.680> everything

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
could settle it's a new house everything

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.810 
could settle it's a new house everything
sells<00:00:45.140> second<00:00:46.140> reason<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.579> could

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
sells second reason that this could

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.029 
sells second reason that this could
happen<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.750> weight<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.170> door<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
happen is the weight of the door the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.279 
happen is the weight of the door the
weight<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.399> door<00:00:50.579> could<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.289> pushing

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
weight of the door could be just pushing

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.250 
weight of the door could be just pushing
it<00:00:52.410> down<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.860> way<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.340> screws<00:00:54.110> you<00:00:55.110> know

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
it down this way and the screws you know

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.639 
it down this way and the screws you know
aren't<00:00:55.890> holding<00:00:56.070> well<00:00:56.600> third<00:00:57.600> reason<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.199> your

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
aren't holding well third reason is your

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.360 
aren't holding well third reason is your
screws<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.190> your<00:00:59.340> hinge<00:01:00.379> could<00:01:01.379> be<00:01:01.530> simply

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
screws and your hinge could be simply

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.260 
screws and your hinge could be simply
just<00:01:02.579> loose<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:04.500> let's<00:01:04.710> go<00:01:04.890> ahead<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.939> open

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270
