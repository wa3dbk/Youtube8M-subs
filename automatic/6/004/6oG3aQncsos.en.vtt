00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.370
 this bar that is to strengthen the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.920

 it's going to come back strong will strengthen the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.740
 even a little thicker strand is going 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.890
 to love the truth so I'm going to 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.490
 show how it is done and how it is applied 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.260
 that we need a spoonful of oil 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.420
 coconut 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:03.020
 a spoonful of olive oil 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.490
 banana 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.200
 a whole egg and a quarter cup of 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.629
 Water 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.629
 and a spoonful of honey 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.120
 Y 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.909
 smell delights weapons 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.909
 all this we take to the blender 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.700
 good now that we have the mixture let's go 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.570
 to try our mask and we're going to 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.550
 place it not so stuck to the root to 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.520
 that this fat does not go to the leather 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.430
 scalp but let's calculate more or 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.850
 less from here about 6 centimeters 7 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.370
 centimeters of the scalp we're going 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.710
 throwing 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.710
 in small quantities 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.480
 trying to cover all the layers 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.920
 you always have to do as the 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.550
 we pull down because at the same 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.910
 time with that we're kind of combing 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:14.970
 the hair strand down and that 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.970
 It will also help us with the texture 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.540
 I feel like a hairdresser but an expert 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.239
 now 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.239
 we leave it for 15 to 20 minutes 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.569
 Well, it's been 20 minutes since 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.159

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.689

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:45.360
 can see the final result can see 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:49.980
 that the hair is with a super texture 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.750

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.100

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.800
 perfectly through it 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.240
 and also the smell is spectacular or 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.010

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.950
