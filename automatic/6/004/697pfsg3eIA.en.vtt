00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.790
 hello friends with your wife you are watching 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:20.410
 unpacking two asus wireless mice 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.240
 wt 425 and add 465 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.270
 not long ago I returned to the store 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.790
 wireless canyon mouse in defect 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.010
 it cost 10 and a half euros but 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.200
 its quality was low and basic 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.720
 the button was pressed instead of one 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.350
 times two three actually so i have her 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.120
 will return 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.040
 but in this video I want you 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.040
 tell about other mice bed 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.379
 wireless but asus i bought these 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.370
 by mouse for yourself and by request 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:50.949
 the first is a w wh 425 optical mouse with 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.440
 additional button to change the type 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.010
 and the price of this wireless mouse is local 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.699
 the store 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.930
 15 euros and 29 cents this mouse is packed in 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.729
 beautiful box 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.309
 on which are written all the main 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.560
 parameters inside the box except for the mouse we 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.100
 we can see the so-called T-shirts 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.600
 receiver AA battery and instruction 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.850
 Well, in general, all you need 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.890
 what I liked about this muscle guessing 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.960
 ergonomic shape and very nice 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.360
 snapping pads a little later i 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.520
 I will demonstrate the sound of clicking the mouse buttons 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.710
 compared to several other mice 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.170
 honestly i never met 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.299
 so quiet on shrinking in buttons in 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.590
 everything else is exactly the same as in any 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.450
 another standard mouse 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.969
 after i inserted the battery 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.969
 sensor lit up all the work 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.600
 the next mouse is this model w psy 465 she 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.200
 very similar 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.570
 let's 425 there is no separate button 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.490
 to change the type and it is more 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.619
 ergonomically in the hand of the poor and 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.750
 due to the fact that it is slightly larger in size 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.479
 was packed in a very similar box 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.520
 only the inscription is different to me immediately 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.250
 I did not like it because it is here 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.440
 brand top and buttons 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.970
 much louder click as well as in 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.209
 the first mouse here is bundled 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.550
 and north battery instruction under big 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.370
 finger on the mouse provides a nice 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.410
 rubber insert but this mouse I'll be back 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.680
 back shop because after that 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.239
 As I inserted the battery, the sensor does not 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.220
 lit up I thought that I inserted it 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.470
 on the contrary, but no, I did everything right 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.780
 Well, so that the mouth believes that the mouse 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.220
 really defective and left on 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.170
 on the receiver dishes s.b. 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.930
 and so it was buttons work a 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.880
 the sensor is not why i drove the store 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.000
 back and passed it as defective 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.660
 and the price of this mouse is 3 euro more than 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.120
 previous models 18 euros and 29 cents well 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:52.250
 And now let's take a quick look at 4 mice. 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.049
 asus let's 465 asus w go 425 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.560
 square m705 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.370
 and log house m 195 look at them a little 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.280
 a little closer 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.160
 choose the quietest and most comfortable 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.620
 my opinion of course 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.070
 let's get the 465 building brand 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:15.750
 push loud sensor doesn't work anymore 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.860
 let the body 425 is not very brand siltek 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.590
 nice and quiet 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.260
 The sensor works well, but with this mouse 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.680
 favor for a long time and I am a logitech mouse 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.200
 m705 to convenient button click loud 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.330
 life to launch the knife serves as faith and 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.960
 true well and the last thought is 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.980
 log house 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.690
 195 is not very convenient to click loudly in 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.790
 the last time sometimes refuses 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.870
 work at all my hand is best 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:46.230
 falls on addo will be 465 and m705 on 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.560
 second in the forehead then let's 420 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.290
