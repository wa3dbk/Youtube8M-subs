00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.100
 a completely different face 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.860

 offer equalization to valenciennes 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.840

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.760
 Valenciennes who remains last of the 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.130

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.870
 trust it is not a defeat 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.540
 the Reims on their side connects a 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.040
 sixth consecutive draw and wins 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.140
