00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.099
 I did I did all the prints 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.620
 crossing all of Brittany at night 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.560
 in the rain to ploufragan 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.630
 to go to morlaix and then 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.270
 to reindeer I think is important that she 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.770
 either 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.750
 for the visibility of the club they are 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.700
 represented that that would be they 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.770
 are known 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.840
 and so for known neither two 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.090
 league 2 so we got 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.120
 ok we have angers and laval after 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.600
 the wish of the players is 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.500
 to play 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.880
 to play a league 2 now 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.290
 we have a stage at our level so we are 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.940
 in onic health 2 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.010
 a national club we can not we can 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.240
 not play at home so we're small 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.620
 poucet but there is a new neighbor of 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.970
 baptize for example who are just a 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.840
 level above so so long of 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.840
 contest can play at home 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:28.110

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:52.930

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:59.630
 dance in 2004 if you come to me I announce 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:02.000
 a controversy is born in the plan 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.920
 similarly essential as a car 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.009
 the sail has been labeled since 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.440
 more this year and on the sixteen 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.530
 players who first tested for the 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.959
 seventh volume 9 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.390
 their alcohol songs from their partners 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.860
 to see oneself is francis these principles 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.860
 it depends on the opponent 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.840

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.200

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.110

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.590

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.750

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.540
