00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.850 
ebay and I think I really need to call
this<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.969> piece<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.540> clamp<00:00:36.860> because

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
back and then that cracked just from the

and i thought you know i'm not going to
use<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.159> much<00:02:05.299> it's<00:02:06.299> just<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.659> little

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
use it that much it's just a little

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.050 
use it that much it's just a little
clump<00:02:07.550> but<00:02:08.550> honestly<00:02:09.349> this<00:02:10.349> thing<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.860> just

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
clump but honestly this thing is just

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.059 
clump but honestly this thing is just
abysmal<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.840> mean<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.349> plastic<00:02:14.770> is<00:02:14.860> just

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
abysmal I mean the plastic is just

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.670 
abysmal I mean the plastic is just
really<00:02:15.280> bad<00:02:15.660> if<00:02:16.660> they'd<00:02:17.019> made<00:02:17.200> this<00:02:17.349> with<00:02:17.530> like

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
really bad if they'd made this with like

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.309 
really bad if they'd made this with like
really<00:02:17.800> solid<00:02:18.190> plastic<00:02:18.550> then<00:02:18.989> it'd<00:02:19.989> be<00:02:20.019> good

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
really solid plastic then it'd be good

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.869 
really solid plastic then it'd be good
and<00:02:20.590> it's<00:02:20.830> not<00:02:20.980> impossible<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.580> mean<00:02:21.730> this

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
and it's not impossible I mean this

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.710 
and it's not impossible I mean this
thing<00:02:22.090> cost<00:02:22.680> somewhere<00:02:23.680> around<00:02:23.769> five<00:02:24.190> pounds

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
thing cost somewhere around five pounds

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.009 
thing cost somewhere around five pounds
and<00:02:26.340> for<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:27.370> price<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:28.180> can<00:02:28.480> actually<00:02:28.840> get

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
and for that price you can actually get

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.520 
and for that price you can actually get
a<00:02:29.260> decent<00:02:30.720> clamp<00:02:31.720> I'll<00:02:31.930> show<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:32.170> in<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.349> sack

this if you only need a piece like this

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.680 
this if you only need a piece like this
though<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:00.069> can<00:03:00.310> search<00:03:00.549> for<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.790> CCTV<00:03:01.329> wall

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
though you can search for a CCTV wall

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.809 
though you can search for a CCTV wall
mount<00:03:01.989> and<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:02.950> comes<00:03:03.220> with<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.459> piece<00:03:03.670> like

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
mount and that comes with a piece like

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.259 
mount and that comes with a piece like
this<00:03:04.030> not<00:03:04.690> quite<00:03:04.870> as<00:03:04.989> nice<00:03:05.079> to<00:03:05.140> work<00:03:05.410> with<00:03:05.470> but

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
this not quite as nice to work with but

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.569 
this not quite as nice to work with but
because<00:03:07.269> it's<00:03:07.810> like<00:03:07.989> a<00:03:08.019> few<00:03:08.739> chunky<00:03:09.160> pieces<00:03:09.310> of

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
because it's like a few chunky pieces of

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.750 
because it's like a few chunky pieces of
metal<00:03:09.849> rather<00:03:10.540> than<00:03:10.750> nice<00:03:11.290> plastic<00:03:11.760> housing

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
metal rather than nice plastic housing

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.400 
metal rather than nice plastic housing
but<00:03:14.700> yeah<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:15.730> think<00:03:15.760> either<00:03:16.090> way<00:03:16.359> work<00:03:16.810> so<00:03:17.109> it's

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
but yeah I think either way work so it's

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.960 
but yeah I think either way work so it's
a<00:03:17.470> useful<00:03:17.650> little<00:03:17.980> thing<00:03:18.130> but<00:03:18.310> other<00:03:18.910> than

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
a useful little thing but other than

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.479 
a useful little thing but other than
that<00:03:19.090> this<00:03:19.420> thing<00:03:19.630> is<00:03:19.660> god<00:03:20.170> damn<00:03:20.380> useless<00:03:20.650> I

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
that this thing is god damn useless I

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.580

costs like a few pounds for a light but
most<00:03:39.400> lights<00:03:39.579> aren't<00:03:39.790> that<00:03:39.880> cheap<00:03:39.940> so<00:03:40.359> even

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
most lights aren't that cheap so even

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.180

light<00:03:40.959> i<00:03:40.989> went<00:03:41.319> ahead<00:03:41.440> definitely<00:03:41.950> wouldn't

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
light i went ahead definitely wouldn't

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.660

put any camera on here no go prone or
whatever<00:03:46.319> it<00:03:47.319> was<00:03:48.130> you<00:03:48.489> know<00:03:48.519> they<00:03:48.760> said<00:03:49.000> it's

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
rated up to 5 kilo bird and ain't it's

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.190 
rated up to 5 kilo bird and ain't it's
probably<00:03:54.519> it<00:03:54.880> barely<00:03:55.299> holds<00:03:55.599> its<00:03:55.720> own<00:03:55.840> way<00:03:56.049> up

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.790 
probably it barely holds its own way up
um<00:03:57.450> okay<00:03:58.450> so<00:03:58.480> i<00:03:59.019> will<00:03:59.769> show<00:04:00.099> you
