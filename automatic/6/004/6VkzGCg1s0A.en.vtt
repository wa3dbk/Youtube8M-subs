00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
to bring the knee forward at just 90

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.800 
to bring the knee forward at just 90
degrees<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.460> as<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.820> saw<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.030> ankles<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.689> go

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
degrees and as you saw the ankles can go

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.789 
degrees and as you saw the ankles can go
this<00:01:58.020> far<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.590> forward<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.969> back<00:02:00.799> however

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
this far and forward and back however

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.859 
this far and forward and back however
with<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> lack<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.490> free<00:02:02.909> moving<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.509> which<00:02:03.719> I

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
with the lack of free moving in which I

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.060 
with the lack of free moving in which I
mean<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.500> follow<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.829> clicks

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
mean you have to follow the clicks

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.990 
mean you have to follow the clicks
you're<00:02:05.250> only<00:02:05.369> going<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.729> three

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
you're only going to have three

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.210 
you're only going to have three
positions<00:02:06.509> there<00:02:06.659> for<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.899> ankles<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.590> off

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
positions there for the ankles and off

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.160 
positions there for the ankles and off
to<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.520> side<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:08.970> one<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.569> one<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.050> you're

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
to the side just one and one so you're

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.510 
to the side just one and one so you're
not<00:02:10.289> going<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.590> any<00:02:10.739> gradation<00:02:11.340> you

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
not going to have any gradation you

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.510 
not going to have any gradation you
either<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.270> been

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
either have to have it been

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.670 
either have to have it been
like<00:02:12.640> that<00:02:12.820> or<00:02:13.090> straight<00:02:13.840> on<00:02:14.050> there's<00:02:14.410> really

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
like that or straight on there's really

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.380 
like that or straight on there's really
nothing<00:02:15.220> in<00:02:15.310> between<00:02:15.460> unless<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.180> want<00:02:16.360> to

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
nothing in between unless you want to

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.190 
nothing in between unless you want to
try<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.660> cheat<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.800> poly<00:02:18.040> cap<00:02:18.340> on<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.670> inside

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
try to cheat the poly cap on the inside

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.330 
try to cheat the poly cap on the inside
for<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.260> upper-body<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:20.770> can<00:02:20.980> just<00:02:21.160> sort<00:02:21.250> of

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
for the upper-body I can just sort of

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.770 
for the upper-body I can just sort of
set<00:02:21.550> them<00:02:21.640> down<00:02:21.670> here<00:02:22.060> but<00:02:22.270> you're<00:02:22.450> going<00:02:22.630> to

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
set them down here but you're going to

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.140 
set them down here but you're going to
be<00:02:22.870> able<00:02:22.960> to<00:02:23.080> rotate<00:02:23.590> all<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.400> way<00:02:24.640> I<00:02:24.760> suppose

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
be able to rotate all the way I suppose

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.450 
be able to rotate all the way I suppose
as<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.630> pop<00:02:25.840> off<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.200> spoiler<00:02:26.590> there<00:02:26.770> that's

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
as I pop off the spoiler there that's

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.770 
as I pop off the spoiler there that's
probably<00:02:27.610> going<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:27.970> get<00:02:28.060> in<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.210> way<00:02:28.330> of<00:02:28.360> the

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
probably going to get in the way of the

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.930 
probably going to get in the way of the
arm<00:02:29.080> going<00:02:29.470> all<00:02:29.710> the<00:02:29.920> way<00:02:29.950> around<00:02:30.130> which<00:02:30.730> you'd

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
arm going all the way around which you'd

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.940 
arm going all the way around which you'd
expect<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.960> shoulder<00:02:32.320> is<00:02:32.440> going<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.710> rotate

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
expect the shoulder is going to rotate

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.460 
expect the shoulder is going to rotate
and<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.940> wrist<00:02:34.180> does<00:02:34.390> rotate<00:02:34.630> actually<00:02:35.350> as

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
and the wrist does rotate actually as

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.260 
and the wrist does rotate actually as
well<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:36.190> elbow<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.490> going<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:36.700> give<00:02:36.820> your<00:02:36.910> 90

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
well the elbow is going to give your 90

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.130 
well the elbow is going to give your 90
and<00:02:37.420> nothing<00:02:37.720> more

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
and nothing more

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.500 
and nothing more
so<00:02:38.500> don't<00:02:38.770> even<00:02:38.980> expect<00:02:39.280> him<00:02:39.520> to<00:02:39.550> be<00:02:40.240> able<00:02:40.330> to

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
so don't even expect him to be able to

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.450 
so don't even expect him to be able to
barely<00:02:40.780> reach<00:02:40.960> across<00:02:41.260> his<00:02:41.470> chest<00:02:41.740> never<00:02:42.160> mind

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
barely reach across his chest never mind

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.490 
barely reach across his chest never mind
get<00:02:42.640> across<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.210> the<00:02:43.300> other<00:02:43.450> arm<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:43.990> you

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
get across to the other arm and you

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.650 
get across to the other arm and you
really<00:02:44.740> do<00:02:44.890> notice<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:45.310> it's<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.850> you<00:02:46.480> of

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
really do notice that it's a you of

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.910 
really do notice that it's a you of
course<00:02:46.900> have<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.140> have<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.350> light<00:02:47.530> coming<00:02:47.740> up

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
course have to have the light coming up

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.560 
course have to have the light coming up
through<00:02:48.100> here<00:02:48.130> so<00:02:48.520> it's<00:02:48.700> makes<00:02:49.180> sense<00:02:49.450> that

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
through here so it's makes sense that

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.330 
through here so it's makes sense that
it's<00:02:49.690> going<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.960> be<00:02:50.050> a<00:02:50.080> stable<00:02:50.500> point<00:02:50.650> but

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
it's going to be a stable point but

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.470 
it's going to be a stable point but
having<00:02:51.580> those<00:02:51.700> two<00:02:51.910> points<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.330> articulation

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
having those two points of articulation

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.970 
having those two points of articulation
is<00:02:53.260> really<00:02:54.100> missing<00:02:54.520> here<00:02:55.590> I've<00:02:56.590> never<00:02:56.830> built

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
is really missing here I've never built

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.650 
is really missing here I've never built
to<00:02:57.160> get<00:02:57.310> this<00:02:57.520> large<00:02:57.790> before<00:02:58.000> so<00:02:58.360> I<00:02:58.420> didn't

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
to get this large before so I didn't

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.090 
to get this large before so I didn't
really<00:02:58.780> know<00:02:58.900> what<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.200> expect<00:02:59.350> I<00:02:59.830> built<00:03:00.010> a

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
really know what to expect I built a

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.370 
really know what to expect I built a
couple<00:03:00.280> once<00:03:00.580> or<00:03:00.820> 160th<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:01.990> a<00:03:02.050> couple<00:03:02.290> of

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
couple once or 160th and a couple of

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.590 
couple once or 160th and a couple of
perfect<00:03:02.740> grades<00:03:02.980> but<00:03:03.700> here<00:03:03.940> it<00:03:04.030> is<00:03:04.150> next<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.540> a

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
perfect grades but here it is next to a

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.930 
perfect grades but here it is next to a
one<00:03:04.840> 144th<00:03:05.560> it's<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:05.920> advanced<00:03:06.220> grade<00:03:06.610> and

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
one 144th it's the advanced grade and

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.760 
one 144th it's the advanced grade and
that's<00:03:07.690> what<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.960> front<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.380> their<00:03:08.500> toes

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
that's what the front of their toes

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.460 
that's what the front of their toes
their<00:03:09.490> toes<00:03:09.700> lined<00:03:10.090> up<00:03:10.300> yes<00:03:10.840> he<00:03:11.080> really<00:03:11.200> does

that<00:03:37.930> ends<00:03:38.170> up<00:03:38.200> looking<00:03:38.260> like<00:03:38.560> a<00:03:38.709> toy<00:03:38.980> it's

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
that ends up looking like a toy it's

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.190 
that ends up looking like a toy it's
only<00:03:39.790> once<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.090> get<00:03:40.270> up<00:03:40.360> close<00:03:40.600> or<00:03:40.930> when<00:03:41.140> you

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
only once you get up close or when you

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.330 
only once you get up close or when you
actually<00:03:41.470> try<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.620> pose<00:03:41.830> him<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.100> you<00:03:42.160> just

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
actually try to pose him and you just

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.890 
actually try to pose him and you just
see<00:03:42.490> how<00:03:42.640> many<00:03:42.700> moving<00:03:43.030> parts<00:03:43.270> there<00:03:43.540> are<00:03:43.570> that

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
see how many moving parts there are that

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.140 
see how many moving parts there are that
are<00:03:44.080> going<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.530> allow<00:03:45.250> him<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.550> fall<00:03:45.730> over<00:03:46.030> and

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
are going to allow him to fall over and

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.940 
are going to allow him to fall over and
many<00:03:46.330> many<00:03:46.510> times<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:47.440> you<00:03:47.590> start<00:03:47.830> to

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
many many times that you start to

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.800 
many many times that you start to
appreciate<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.610> differences<00:03:49.090> between<00:03:49.360> the

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
appreciate the differences between the

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.370 
appreciate the differences between the
two<00:03:50.020> and<00:03:51.450> here<00:03:52.450> I<00:03:52.480> have<00:03:52.780> him<00:03:52.930> next<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:53.290> the

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
two and here I have him next to the

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.960 
two and here I have him next to the
high-grade<00:03:53.830> and<00:03:53.860> instead<00:03:54.250> of<00:03:54.370> being<00:03:54.550> lined<00:03:54.790> up

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
high-grade and instead of being lined up

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.670 
high-grade and instead of being lined up
forward<00:03:55.480> with<00:03:55.690> their<00:03:55.840> toes<00:03:56.080> in<00:03:56.320> line<00:03:56.500> he's

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
forward with their toes in line he's

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.080 
forward with their toes in line he's
actually<00:03:57.100> back<00:03:57.250> in<00:03:57.459> line<00:03:57.610> with<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:57.880> legs

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
actually back in line with the legs

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.660 
actually back in line with the legs
which<00:03:58.480> just<00:03:58.840> makes<00:03:59.020> him<00:03:59.260> look<00:03:59.500> even<00:03:59.800> smaller

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
which just makes him look even smaller

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.280 
which just makes him look even smaller
the<00:04:01.209> Master<00:04:01.540> Grade<00:04:01.660> is<00:04:01.810> going<00:04:01.959> to<00:04:02.020> be<00:04:02.110> about

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
the Master Grade is going to be about

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.080 
the Master Grade is going to be about
the<00:04:02.440> same<00:04:02.620> size<00:04:02.680> as<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:03.280> double<00:04:03.550> O<00:04:03.670> Gundam

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
the same size as the double O Gundam

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.000 
the same size as the double O Gundam
which<00:04:04.750> is<00:04:04.930> still<00:04:05.140> going<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.410> be<00:04:05.500> a<00:04:05.620> tiny<00:04:05.890> little

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
which is still going to be a tiny little

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.370 
which is still going to be a tiny little
thing<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.580> compare<00:04:06.880> them<00:04:07.090> here<00:04:07.390> one<00:04:07.930> sixtieth

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
thing to compare them here one sixtieth

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.020 
thing to compare them here one sixtieth
would<00:04:08.620> be<00:04:08.739> nice<00:04:08.890> to<00:04:09.070> have<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.250> one<00:04:09.400> 144th

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
would be nice to have the one 144th

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.060 
would be nice to have the one 144th
1/100<00:04:10.810> one<00:04:10.989> sixtieth<00:04:11.410> and<00:04:11.620> one<00:04:11.739> forty<00:04:12.040> eight

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
1/100 one sixtieth and one forty eight

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.340 
1/100 one sixtieth and one forty eight
but<00:04:12.820> for<00:04:13.030> now<00:04:13.180> these<00:04:13.600> are<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.900> two<00:04:14.050> that<00:04:14.290> are

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
but for now these are the two that are

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.430 
but for now these are the two that are
going<00:04:14.440> to<00:04:14.860> have<00:04:15.040> to<00:04:15.280> do<00:04:15.959> forming<00:04:16.959> this<00:04:17.109> guy<00:04:17.260> up

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
going to have to do forming this guy up

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.590 
going to have to do forming this guy up
you<00:04:17.470> can<00:04:17.709> just<00:04:17.739> split<00:04:18.130> apart<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.850> hands<00:04:19.390> there

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
you can just split apart the hands there

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.180 
you can just split apart the hands there
and<00:04:19.780> then<00:04:20.049> you're<00:04:20.200> going<00:04:20.380> to<00:04:20.530> plug<00:04:20.739> this<00:04:20.919> part

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
and then you're going to plug this part

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.280 
and then you're going to plug this part
into<00:04:21.669> the<00:04:21.700> dog's<00:04:21.940> rifle<00:04:22.419> it's<00:04:22.900> going<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.140> sit

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
into the dog's rifle it's going to sit

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.010 
into the dog's rifle it's going to sit
in<00:04:23.380> there<00:04:23.500> pretty<00:04:23.680> securely<00:04:24.100> even<00:04:24.520> up<00:04:24.640> like

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
in there pretty securely even up like

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.990 
in there pretty securely even up like
this<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:25.379> if<00:04:26.039> you<00:04:26.129> want<00:04:26.160> to<00:04:26.370> plug<00:04:26.490> that<00:04:26.669> right

this and if you want to plug that right

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.659 
this and if you want to plug that right
in<00:04:27.180> you<00:04:27.750> can<00:04:27.780> put<00:04:28.080> it<00:04:28.169> on<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:28.379> Gundam<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:28.979> you

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
in you can put it on the Gundam and you

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.279 
in you can put it on the Gundam and you
can<00:04:29.819> rotate<00:04:30.030> this<00:04:30.569> part<00:04:30.810> of<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.020> forearm

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
can rotate this part of the forearm

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.499 
can rotate this part of the forearm
around<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.160> you're<00:04:32.789> just<00:04:32.819> going<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.180> plug<00:04:33.360> the

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
around and you're just going to plug the

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:37.790 
around and you're just going to plug the
shield<00:04:33.780> in<00:04:34.020> down<00:04:34.259> there<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:36.349> as<00:04:37.349> he<00:04:37.590> comes

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
shield in down there and as he comes

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:45.559 
shield in down there and as he comes
around<00:04:37.949> here<00:04:38.190> in<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.520> dark<00:04:44.360> that's<00:04:45.360> when<00:04:45.509> I

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:45.569 
around here in the dark that's when I

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:46.820 
around here in the dark that's when I
realized<00:04:45.900> I<00:04:46.020> might<00:04:46.139> as<00:04:46.259> well<00:04:46.319> keep<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.590> lights

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
realized I might as well keep the lights

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.279 
realized I might as well keep the lights
on<00:04:46.979> since<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.580> light<00:04:47.789> and<00:04:48.060> the<00:04:48.870> batteries<00:04:49.259> are

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
on since the light and the batteries are

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.749 
on since the light and the batteries are
going<00:04:49.590> to<00:04:49.680> be<00:04:49.770> included<00:04:50.129> everybody<00:04:50.370> has<00:04:50.639> the

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
going to be included everybody has the

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.850 
going to be included everybody has the
ability<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:51.060> light<00:04:51.300> this<00:04:51.449> up<00:04:51.509> so<00:04:52.379> here<00:04:52.620> it<00:04:52.740> is

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
ability to light this up so here it is

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.890 
ability to light this up so here it is
with<00:04:53.250> full<00:04:53.639> weapons<00:04:53.879> on<00:04:54.240> its<00:04:54.509> going<00:04:54.659> to<00:04:54.750> have

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
with full weapons on its going to have

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.270 
with full weapons on its going to have
the<00:04:54.990> shield<00:04:55.199> and<00:04:55.349> the<00:04:55.440> dots<00:04:55.620> rifle<00:04:56.009> which<00:04:56.129> are

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
the shield and the dots rifle which are

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.010 
the shield and the dots rifle which are
going<00:04:56.430> to<00:04:56.580> look<00:04:56.699> pretty<00:04:56.909> good<00:04:56.970> something<00:04:57.840> I

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
going to look pretty good something I

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.480 
going to look pretty good something I
didn't<00:04:58.259> really<00:04:58.440> realize<00:04:58.620> is<00:04:58.979> that<00:04:59.099> the<00:04:59.310> way

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
didn't really realize is that the way

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.820 
didn't really realize is that the way
the<00:04:59.970> shield<00:05:00.479> is<00:05:00.659> naturally<00:05:01.199> you<00:05:01.349> can<00:05:01.500> plug<00:05:01.710> it

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
the shield is naturally you can plug it

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.439 
the shield is naturally you can plug it
in<00:05:01.919> but<00:05:02.099> it's<00:05:02.220> going<00:05:02.370> to<00:05:02.460> go<00:05:02.610> into<00:05:02.849> the<00:05:02.940> back<00:05:03.150> of

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
in but it's going to go into the back of

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.300 
in but it's going to go into the back of
the<00:05:03.720> forearm<00:05:03.960> very<00:05:04.349> similar<00:05:04.710> to<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:04.919> V<00:05:05.039> Gundam

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
the forearm very similar to the V Gundam

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.499 
the forearm very similar to the V Gundam
which<00:05:05.400> I<00:05:05.520> always<00:05:05.699> like<00:05:05.819> to<00:05:05.849> make<00:05:06.030> fun<00:05:06.180> of<00:05:06.240> for

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
which I always like to make fun of for

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.420 
which I always like to make fun of for
that<00:05:06.599> but<00:05:07.500> when<00:05:07.650> you<00:05:07.740> twist<00:05:07.919> it<00:05:08.099> forward

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
that but when you twist it forward

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.499 
that but when you twist it forward
you're<00:05:08.550> actually<00:05:08.819> going<00:05:08.940> to<00:05:09.030> have<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.180> slant

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509 
you're actually going to have a slant

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:10.430 
you're actually going to have a slant
down<00:05:09.720> there<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:10.020> it<00:05:10.110> doesn't<00:05:10.259> look

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
down there and it doesn't look

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.409 
down there and it doesn't look
unattractive<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:11.130> way<00:05:11.220> it's<00:05:11.370> lined<00:05:11.610> up<00:05:11.789> not

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
unattractive the way it's lined up not

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:13.700 
unattractive the way it's lined up not
going<00:05:12.599> to<00:05:12.659> be<00:05:12.750> symmetrical<00:05:13.229> with<00:05:13.349> this<00:05:13.500> arm

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
going to be symmetrical with this arm

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.589 
going to be symmetrical with this arm
but<00:05:13.889> no<00:05:14.069> problems<00:05:14.490> there<00:05:14.699> the<00:05:14.880> dots<00:05:15.060> rifle<00:05:15.479> is

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
but no problems there the dots rifle is

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.870 
but no problems there the dots rifle is
the<00:05:15.630> right<00:05:15.870> size<00:05:16.139> as<00:05:16.469> is<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:16.949> shield<00:05:17.219> just

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
the right size as is the shield just

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.339 
the right size as is the shield just
again<00:05:18.210> a<00:05:18.240> little<00:05:18.509> bit<00:05:18.630> disappointing<00:05:19.229> that

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
again a little bit disappointing that

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:21.050 
again a little bit disappointing that
there<00:05:19.530> aren't<00:05:19.740> a<00:05:19.830> few<00:05:19.860> extra<00:05:20.550> color<00:05:20.759> apps

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
there aren't a few extra color apps

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.369 
there aren't a few extra color apps
there<00:05:21.419> on<00:05:21.630> the<00:05:22.349> inside<00:05:22.789> in<00:05:23.789> terms<00:05:24.750> of<00:05:24.930> dynamic

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:25.379 
there on the inside in terms of dynamic

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:27.080 
there on the inside in terms of dynamic
posing<00:05:25.770> don't<00:05:25.949> expect<00:05:26.280> much<00:05:26.520> more<00:05:26.580> than<00:05:26.969> this

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
posing don't expect much more than this

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.059 
posing don't expect much more than this
because<00:05:27.389> the<00:05:27.659> legs<00:05:27.870> as<00:05:28.199> I<00:05:28.379> mentioned<00:05:28.830> the

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
because the legs as I mentioned the

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:30.439 
because the legs as I mentioned the
ankles<00:05:29.400> aren't<00:05:29.550> going<00:05:29.699> to<00:05:29.759> move<00:05:29.880> very<00:05:29.909> much<00:05:30.150> so

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
ankles aren't going to move very much so

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:31.370 
ankles aren't going to move very much so
you're<00:05:30.599> not<00:05:30.690> going<00:05:30.900> to<00:05:30.960> have<00:05:31.050> a<00:05:31.110> lot<00:05:31.259> of

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
you're not going to have a lot of

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.629 
you're not going to have a lot of
options<00:05:31.770> in<00:05:31.889> terms<00:05:31.949> of<00:05:32.310> where<00:05:32.460> you're<00:05:32.610> going

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
options in terms of where you're going

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.430 
options in terms of where you're going
to<00:05:32.789> get<00:05:32.940> them<00:05:33.060> the<00:05:33.659> waist<00:05:33.870> is<00:05:34.050> going<00:05:34.229> to<00:05:34.289> turn

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
to get them the waist is going to turn

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.809 
to get them the waist is going to turn
which<00:05:34.620> is<00:05:34.740> pretty<00:05:34.889> good<00:05:35.099> and<00:05:35.250> that<00:05:35.340> arm<00:05:35.610> is

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:35.819 
which is pretty good and that arm is

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:37.279 
which is pretty good and that arm is
going<00:05:36.060> to<00:05:36.180> allow<00:05:36.389> the<00:05:36.449> beam<00:05:36.690> rifle<00:05:36.870> to<00:05:37.110> move

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
going to allow the beam rifle to move

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.230 
going to allow the beam rifle to move
wherever<00:05:37.590> you<00:05:37.710> want<00:05:37.919> it<00:05:38.039> pretty<00:05:38.219> much<00:05:38.430> but<00:05:39.120> the

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
wherever you want it pretty much but the

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.760 
wherever you want it pretty much but the
head<00:05:39.389> is<00:05:39.539> pretty<00:05:39.690> much<00:05:39.900> just<00:05:40.139> locked<00:05:40.380> on<00:05:40.560> there

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
head is pretty much just locked on there

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.189 
head is pretty much just locked on there
so<00:05:40.949> he<00:05:41.130> can<00:05:41.340> look<00:05:41.520> down<00:05:41.669> the<00:05:41.729> barrel<00:05:41.880> but<00:05:42.840> don't

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
so he can look down the barrel but don't

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.140 
so he can look down the barrel but don't
expect<00:05:43.349> much<00:05:43.860> more<00:05:43.919> than<00:05:44.729> what<00:05:44.940> you're<00:05:45.120> seeing

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
expect much more than what you're seeing

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.640 
expect much more than what you're seeing
here<00:05:45.449> and<00:05:45.690> if<00:05:45.779> you<00:05:45.870> try<00:05:46.020> to<00:05:46.080> fiddle<00:05:46.289> with<00:05:46.409> those

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
here and if you try to fiddle with those

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.450 
here and if you try to fiddle with those
legs<00:05:46.889> you<00:05:47.460> can<00:05:47.610> expect<00:05:47.969> them<00:05:48.120> to<00:05:48.150> topple<00:05:48.599> over

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
legs you can expect them to topple over

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.040 
legs you can expect them to topple over
the<00:05:50.460> effect<00:05:50.759> however<00:05:50.880> is<00:05:51.240> certainly<00:05:51.599> not<00:05:51.779> all

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
the effect however is certainly not all

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.170 
the effect however is certainly not all
that<00:05:52.349> bad<00:05:52.680> everything's<00:05:53.370> proportionate<00:05:54.060> and

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
that bad everything's proportionate and

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.779 
that bad everything's proportionate and
he<00:05:54.599> still<00:05:54.930> can<00:05:55.139> look<00:05:55.349> down<00:05:55.560> angrily<00:05:56.310> and

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
he still can look down angrily and

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:01.999 
he still can look down angrily and
menacing<00:05:57.449> Lee<00:05:57.630> when<00:05:58.500> called<00:05:58.830> upon<00:06:00.889> with<00:06:01.889> the

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:02.009 
menacing Lee when called upon with the

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:03.890 
menacing Lee when called upon with the
beam<00:06:02.159> sabers<00:06:02.550> in<00:06:02.580> hand<00:06:02.880> it's<00:06:03.120> worth<00:06:03.539> noting

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
beam sabers in hand it's worth noting

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.149 
beam sabers in hand it's worth noting
that<00:06:03.930> the<00:06:04.110> manipulators<00:06:04.620> when<00:06:04.770> you<00:06:04.830> pop<00:06:05.039> them

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
that the manipulators when you pop them

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:06.260 
that the manipulators when you pop them
out<00:06:05.310> they're<00:06:05.550> going<00:06:05.729> to<00:06:05.849> have<00:06:05.940> some<00:06:06.120> pretty

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
out they're going to have some pretty

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.939 
out they're going to have some pretty
good<00:06:06.360> suction<00:06:06.840> there<00:06:07.050> to<00:06:07.319> that<00:06:07.500> poly<00:06:07.710> cap

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
good suction there to that poly cap

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:10.519 
good suction there to that poly cap
that's<00:06:08.130> holding<00:06:08.460> them<00:06:08.550> in<00:06:08.729> at<00:06:09.270> the<00:06:09.840> wrist<00:06:10.229> and

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:10.529 
that's holding them in at the wrist and

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:12.439 
that's holding them in at the wrist and
so<00:06:11.190> far<00:06:11.430> my<00:06:11.610> impression<00:06:12.060> of<00:06:12.120> these<00:06:12.240> beam

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
so far my impression of these beam

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:13.790 
so far my impression of these beam
sabers<00:06:12.870> compared<00:06:13.229> to<00:06:13.319> some<00:06:13.500> of<00:06:13.560> the<00:06:13.620> things

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
sabers compared to some of the things

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.170 
sabers compared to some of the things
that<00:06:13.949> we're<00:06:14.069> seeing<00:06:14.099> with<00:06:14.340> newer<00:06:14.610> kits<00:06:14.909> like

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
that we're seeing with newer kits like

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.749 
that we're seeing with newer kits like
the<00:06:15.449> real<00:06:15.960> great<00:06:16.259> freedom<00:06:16.560> having<00:06:17.009> absolutely

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 
the real great freedom having absolutely

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.240 
the real great freedom having absolutely
oversized<00:06:18.330> beam<00:06:18.569> sabers<00:06:19.020> these<00:06:19.830> ones<00:06:20.069> aren't

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
oversized beam sabers these ones aren't

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.950 
oversized beam sabers these ones aren't
bad<00:06:20.490> but<00:06:20.789> they<00:06:20.880> do<00:06:20.940> come<00:06:21.210> across<00:06:21.330> as<00:06:21.750> being

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
bad but they do come across as being

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.959 
bad but they do come across as being
just<00:06:22.110> a<00:06:22.259> little<00:06:22.289> bit<00:06:22.590> smaller<00:06:22.800> so<00:06:23.580> I<00:06:23.610> really

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:23.969 
just a little bit smaller so I really

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:25.070 
just a little bit smaller so I really
should<00:06:24.120> have<00:06:24.150> looked<00:06:24.419> into<00:06:24.690> whether<00:06:24.870> these

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
should have looked into whether these

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.570 
should have looked into whether these
are<00:06:25.139> identical<00:06:25.830> to<00:06:25.979> what<00:06:26.009> you<00:06:26.250> get<00:06:26.370> with<00:06:26.490> the

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
are identical to what you get with the

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.909 
are identical to what you get with the
160th<00:06:27.440> hexia<00:06:30.020> the<00:06:31.020> daggers<00:06:31.409> look<00:06:31.560> like<00:06:31.710> butter

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
160th hexia the daggers look like butter

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.279 
160th hexia the daggers look like butter
knives<00:06:32.130> just<00:06:32.370> in<00:06:32.699> terms<00:06:32.880> of<00:06:33.120> size<00:06:33.330> but<00:06:33.360> is<00:06:34.050> sort

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
knives just in terms of size but is sort

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:35.719 
knives just in terms of size but is sort
of<00:06:34.349> cool<00:06:34.529> I<00:06:34.800> thought<00:06:35.250> that<00:06:35.370> this<00:06:35.490> trigger

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
of cool I thought that this trigger

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.159 
of cool I thought that this trigger
figure<00:06:36.060> sticking<00:06:36.449> out<00:06:36.570> would<00:06:36.779> be<00:06:36.810> a<00:06:36.930> little

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:37.169 
figure sticking out would be a little

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:38.570 
figure sticking out would be a little
bit<00:06:37.289> detrimental<00:06:37.800> but<00:06:37.949> it's<00:06:38.099> not<00:06:38.250> actually

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
bit detrimental but it's not actually

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.839 
bit detrimental but it's not actually
going<00:06:38.699> to

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
going to

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:41.059 
going to
all<00:06:39.119> that<00:06:39.479> bad<00:06:39.779> just<00:06:40.139> sort<00:06:40.740> of<00:06:40.770> looks<00:06:40.919> like

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:41.069 
all that bad just sort of looks like

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:42.169 
all that bad just sort of looks like
he's<00:06:41.219> getting<00:06:41.339> ready<00:06:41.490> but<00:06:41.879> it<00:06:41.969> would<00:06:42.089> have

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:42.179 
he's getting ready but it would have

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:44.119 
he's getting ready but it would have
been<00:06:42.270> nice<00:06:42.449> in<00:06:42.749> some<00:06:43.110> ways<00:06:43.289> to<00:06:43.319> at<00:06:43.679> least<00:06:43.830> have

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:44.129 
been nice in some ways to at least have

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:47.419 
been nice in some ways to at least have
a<00:06:44.159> custom<00:06:44.639> beam<00:06:44.849> saber<00:06:45.209> holding<00:06:45.719> hand<00:06:46.339> and<00:06:47.339> I

a custom beam saber holding hand and I

00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:48.889 
a custom beam saber holding hand and I
didn't<00:06:47.699> expect<00:06:47.759> him<00:06:48.119> to<00:06:48.179> be<00:06:48.330> able<00:06:48.419> to<00:06:48.569> do<00:06:48.749> it

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:48.899 
didn't expect him to be able to do it

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:50.659 
didn't expect him to be able to do it
considering<00:06:49.409> that<00:06:49.499> the<00:06:49.619> master<00:06:50.009> Grade<00:06:50.279> ground
