is ok I think that's fine wheat pinnable

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.070 
is ok I think that's fine wheat pinnable
after<00:05:45.910> you<00:05:46.030> a<00:05:46.060> piece<00:05:46.390> that's<00:05:46.510> not<00:05:46.720> nuclear

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
after you a piece that's not nuclear

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.270 
after you a piece that's not nuclear
okay<00:05:47.860> I<00:05:49.410> thought<00:05:50.410> the<00:05:50.560> brutal<00:05:50.920> metal<00:05:51.040> came

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280
