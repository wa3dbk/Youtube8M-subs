just a smidgen bit bigger than or longer
i<00:03:07.349> should<00:03:07.590> say<00:03:07.799> then<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.389> the<00:03:09.389> standard<00:03:09.870> one

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
i should say then the the standard one

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:15.199 
i should say then the the standard one
and<00:03:10.319> if<00:03:10.799> i'm<00:03:10.980> going<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.310> do<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.459> push<00:03:11.819> test<00:03:14.209> this

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
and if i'm going to do a push test this

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.140 
and if i'm going to do a push test this
goes<00:03:15.510> down<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.780> lot<00:03:16.319> easier<00:03:16.980> with<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:17.639> lot<00:03:17.910> less

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
goes down a lot easier with a lot less

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.500 
goes down a lot easier with a lot less
force<00:03:18.540> I'm<00:03:19.260> finding<00:03:19.829> it<00:03:20.340> also<00:03:20.609> came<00:03:20.910> with<00:03:20.970> a

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
force I'm finding it also came with a

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.129 
force I'm finding it also came with a
cable<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.680> plug<00:03:22.829> it<00:03:23.069> in<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.400> think<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.239> hooks

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
cable to plug it in I think it it hooks

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.809 
cable to plug it in I think it it hooks
up<00:03:25.290> with<00:03:25.349> nem<00:03:26.239> any<00:03:27.410> type<00:03:28.410> of<00:03:28.440> system<00:03:29.040> I<00:03:29.250> own<00:03:29.639> the

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
up with nem any type of system I own the

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.740 
up with nem any type of system I own the
ps3<00:03:30.480> version<00:03:30.950> so<00:03:31.950> um<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:33.090> don't<00:03:33.359> know<00:03:33.510> what<00:03:33.660> else

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
ps3 version so um I don't know what else

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.479 
ps3 version so um I don't know what else
to<00:03:33.840> say<00:03:34.109> we<00:03:34.380> should<00:03:34.410> just<00:03:34.709> like<00:03:34.919> plug<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.340> in

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
to say we should just like plug it in

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.550 
to say we should just like plug it in
and<00:03:35.609> give<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:35.880> shot<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:37.049> I<00:03:37.079> gets<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.440> one

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
and give it a shot so I gets the one

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.199 
and give it a shot so I gets the one
thing<00:03:37.799> I<00:03:37.919> was<00:03:38.069> kind<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.340> worried<00:03:38.609> about<00:03:38.669> was<00:03:39.060> it

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
thing I was kind of worried about was it

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.740 
thing I was kind of worried about was it
doesn't<00:03:39.510> have<00:03:39.720> any<00:03:39.930> of<00:03:40.079> those<00:03:41.180> little<00:03:42.180> you

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
doesn't have any of those little you

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.720 
doesn't have any of those little you
know<00:03:42.900> divots<00:03:43.410> in<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.769> front<00:03:44.130> of<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.310> so<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:44.579> can

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
know divots in the front of it so it can

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.120 
know divots in the front of it so it can
fit<00:03:44.760> over<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.419> top<00:03:45.660> of<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:46.109> the<00:03:46.620> bars<00:03:46.889> that

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
fit over the top of the the bars that

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.729 
fit over the top of the the bars that
are<00:03:47.190> at<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.370> bottom<00:03:47.609> but<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.030> think<00:03:48.530> having<00:03:49.530> it

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
are at the bottom but I think having it

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.800 
are at the bottom but I think having it
like<00:03:49.920> this<00:03:50.099> might<00:03:50.430> be<00:03:50.640> okay<00:03:51.000> set<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.420> up<00:03:51.659> I

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
like this might be okay set it up I

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.569 
like this might be okay set it up I
found<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:52.230> taking<00:03:52.620> away<00:03:52.980> one<00:03:53.189> of<00:03:53.219> the<00:03:53.370> bars

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
found that taking away one of the bars

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:54.260 
found that taking away one of the bars

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
ikea for a buck apiece and I just taped

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.050 
ikea for a buck apiece and I just taped
them<00:04:20.610> onto<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.060> bottom<00:04:21.840> there<00:04:23.000> dampens<00:04:24.000> the

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
them onto the bottom there dampens the

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.150 
them onto the bottom there dampens the
sound<00:04:24.450> gives<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:25.020> little<00:04:25.170> bit<00:04:25.290> more<00:04:25.530> bounce<00:04:25.830> so

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
sound gives a little bit more bounce so

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.490 
sound gives a little bit more bounce so
I<00:04:26.220> find<00:04:26.490> they<00:04:26.580> work<00:04:26.730> great<00:04:26.880> so<00:04:27.600> if<00:04:27.900> that's<00:04:28.440> a

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
I find they work great so if that's a

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.170 
I find they work great so if that's a
