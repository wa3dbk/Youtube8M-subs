00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.080
 how are they and well let's put the gta 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.170
 because I have a news for you, my 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.900
 gta unfortunately no longer serves as you see 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.990
 jala well start all the intro pretty 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.060
 well as how should you start but it happened 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.630
 something that later in the video 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.300
 I will explain how good it is that my gta is 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.579
 completely unusable as they see when 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.529
 already begins loading screen not 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.859
 good to see if it happens on the screen to 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.599
 Sometimes it's before or like that but good 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.129
 while it is loading while all 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.920
 those things are spinning suddenly 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:41.239
 point it gets stuck and it does not go from there 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.609
 so for my people he died so 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.010
 the gta videos will be postponed 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:48.440
 some days and the reasons for how 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.219
 was the disc not so check how 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.780
 was left 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.920
 and well you see how it worked so 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.320
 Now I'm going to show you how the 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.780
 disc see for some reason I brought 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.190
 the whole box because then I have the former 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.140
 mouth up and I did not want to just 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.149
 bring the disk so loose no plus me 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.510
 I think we observe professionals from a 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:09.240
 good place check there rayon 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.850
 see there with the light there you can see it that 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.530
 great circle that laser burn 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.680
 good has lots of scratches here has 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.930
 more and this chair all striped 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.060
 this happened because I was capturing not 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.340
 I was recording a gameplay in fact the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.900
 I was going to go up but well I could not 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.030
 because they had not recorded well in addition 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.580
 that because that's why I would be there as 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.710
 accommodate the catcher all that or in 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.320
 that very well little and xbox and while 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.100
 they played you can give us that ray all and the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.630
 laser did that trolls if you can call 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.420
 so I do not know if there really is that 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.670
 word but good as you can see there 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.440
 this was scratched in fact he kept running 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.830
 the game was not playing, keep playing 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.930
 and when I tried to keep it, I did not 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.229
 he left he did not tell me you do not know you have to 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.190
 reinstall what because it does not work anymore 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.810
 disk to clean it or something and then 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.580
 try to install it to see if it is already 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.820
 I could play but you can not cut 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.610
 lest a disc was completely left 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.350
 unusable and good these little stingrays 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.000
 I'm investigating yesterday and experts in the 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.700
 matter they told me that 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.290
 these little rays are made because such 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.210
 once the xbox is very dirty 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.060
 that has a lot of dust inside and you see 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.970
 that spin very fast the disc does not turn to 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.100
 many revolutions per second and 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.680
 obviously with the powder and with the 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.270
 fan all that falls here in the 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.590
 disc and with it is very dirty you can create 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.180
 these little streaks that do not affect 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.910
 for nothing the performance unless how 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.640
 goes this xbox and lasers 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.280
 as well as I also say this is not this 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.010
 video is also to tell them that no 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.600
 I will be able to upload gta in a while now 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.970
 I was investigating yesterday said yesterday and 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.040
 part of today had not risen anything because 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.830
 I'm investigating how you can 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.810
 fix this I saw that the disk can be 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.580
 fix but it must already be a job 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.930
 professional 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.750
 I can also repair it with a 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.950
 banana do not bananas and according to 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.940
 repair obviously I will not do that 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.650
 because he is very stupid so I need 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.310
 professional machines client that 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.230
 repair that type of discs and whatever 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.810
 I have some contacts that can help me 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.430
 enlist the gta as it can lend 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.210
 so that I do not install and 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.820
 practically runs again or 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.070
 install it from a usb again the 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.590
 game as is the saved data or 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.920
 nothing is saved on the disk all that not 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.720
 No problem but it will be 1 or 2 days 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.570
 maximum such 3 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.840
 It depends on the availability of 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.000
 other people so I'll just say 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.160
 this a warning not my people to that ray 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.020
 is dead 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.020
 he is completely dead he died 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:58.469
 well this will continue uploading videos of 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:04:01.469
 Whether it 's gears or some other game 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:03.510
 that I find myself lying there and then 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:05.099
 nothing more but I hope that I have 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.200
 liked that has been reported do not move 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.090
 never the xbox when I'm playing 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.370
 because this is going to happen to you and a 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.930
 game as valuable as this is the 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.039
 more expensive 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.139
 Well, it's not nice for you to pass not yes and 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.919
 also that yesterday was a bad day not very 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.500
 bad 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.690
 there are bad days and the day like yesterday 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.960
 so that would be everything and even the 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.960
 next
