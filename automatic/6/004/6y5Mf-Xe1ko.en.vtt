00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.099
 january new 2015 cost 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.960
 drugs became one of 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.510
 most discussed topics of the first working 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.100
 weeks of January numbers are voiced by different 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.100
 price increase in the commercial sector 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.090
 ranges from 10 to 25 percent 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.370
 depending on region and segment 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.899
 drugs social networks are actively 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.700
 discussed the case of absence in 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.180
 New Year holidays some price tags 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.399
 pharmacies 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.079
 in turn, the authorities of many regions 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.690
 countries have already made an official statement 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.449
 the intention to track prices in pharmacies and 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.820
 punish the guilty with real 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.010
 guilty will be difficult directly 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.620
 no one's pricing law 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.620
 breaks all recognize the rush of demand 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.100
 end of last year but no one recognizes 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.720
 which increased margins on drugs 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.180
 the problem will be different now and 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.520
 distributors and pharmacy chains are actively 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.420
 removed from active promotion drugs 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.180
 jane mlp 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.990
 where mark-up and prices are controlled 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.490
 most strictly therefore the struggle with prices 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.030
 soon go into battle with 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.030
 scarcity 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.750
 list change for nls program 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.609
 may adversely affect 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.920
 drug provision for beneficiaries in 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.119
 end of 2014 was approved 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.909
 updated list vital 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.770
 necessary and essential medicinal 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.530
 the government agreed on the lp list 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.119
 for programs of 7 nosologies he hp and 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.619
 minimum range of medicines for 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.780
 medical care 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.579
 however, experts pay attention to 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.679
 potential problem due to 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.840
 significant changes to the nls list 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.310
 some have already been purchased and medicines in 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.920
 Soon the beneficiaries will be 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.049
 You can not write a similar situation 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.880
 was two years ago in Kazakhstan 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.849
 when the company they had to fight 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.099
 not just for getting drugs in 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:09.179
 procurement but also for the fact that the drugs were 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.480
 timely 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.540
 discharged and divorced from stock question 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.480
 rather not even how much now 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.790
 drugs is in stock issue in 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.450
 for which period were implemented and 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.030
 purchases 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.790
 if they were implemented on a quarter 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.519
 this is not a problem if for a year this problem 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.950
 in any case, patients will have to 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.329
 adapt to the fact that yesterday they 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.160
 prescribed one drug 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.160
 tomorrow they will write another 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.360
 in January on the basis of St. Petersburg 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.230
 Pharm Academy will begin training 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.209
 production quality specialists 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.370
 medicines including 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.920
 state inspector project got green 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.900
 light of approval of the Ministry of Industry and Trade received 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.620
 training specialists under the jurisdiction 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.750
 institutions 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.300

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.959
 training quality specialists 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.880
 the production of the face of funds caused live 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.459
 interest from both business and 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.930
 specialized universities and and prospects and goals 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.019
 according to experts very 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.120
 ambiguous that we can observe what 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.280
 with some long term vacuum in 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.569
 the organization of the jeep control 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.030
 production quality 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.519
 there are forces that want and can 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.180
 act actively also we can 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.910
 watch 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.349
 that there are forces that claim that 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.349
 could do it more effectively 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.930
 Vladimir Putin signed a law in which 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.060

 will take effect at the end of January 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.950
 it involves tightening 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.870

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.709
