offer twice as much in interest for the

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.009 
offer twice as much in interest for the
same<00:01:01.369> level<00:01:01.610> of<00:01:01.790> borrowing<00:01:02.269> what<00:01:02.750> this<00:01:02.900> is

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
same level of borrowing what this is

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.210 
same level of borrowing what this is
doing<00:01:03.199> is<00:01:03.379> putting<00:01:03.500> pressure<00:01:03.769> on<00:01:04.010> their

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
doing is putting pressure on their

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.460 
doing is putting pressure on their
governments<00:01:04.699> to<00:01:05.059> even<00:01:05.360> borrow<00:01:05.630> more<00:01:05.990> money<00:01:06.020> in

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
governments to even borrow more money in

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.160 
governments to even borrow more money in
a<00:01:06.770> time<00:01:06.979> where<00:01:07.159> revenues<00:01:07.490> are<00:01:07.640> down<00:01:07.790> now<00:01:08.420> what

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
a time where revenues are down now what

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.380 
a time where revenues are down now what
we<00:01:09.350> see<00:01:09.530> here<00:01:09.830> is<00:01:09.890> that<00:01:10.189> not<00:01:10.430> only<00:01:10.580> has<00:01:10.909> the

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
we see here is that not only has the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.820 
we see here is that not only has the
United<00:01:11.659> States<00:01:11.840> government<00:01:11.900> have<00:01:12.380> more<00:01:12.619> debt

over 14 trillion dollars in debt but as

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.730 
over 14 trillion dollars in debt but as
these<00:01:16.549> interest<00:01:16.970> rates<00:01:17.060> rise<00:01:17.299> our<00:01:18.110> interest

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
these interest rates rise our interest

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.130 
these interest rates rise our interest
payments<00:01:19.070> continue<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:19.880> go<00:01:20.060> up<00:01:20.090> now<00:01:20.750> eighty

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140

five-year obligations are less so the

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.389 
five-year obligations are less so the

an interest rate environment is going to

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:31.599 
an interest rate environment is going to
even<00:01:29.990> be<00:01:30.109> more<00:01:30.350> exacerbated<00:01:31.159> in<00:01:31.219> the<00:01:31.310> United

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
even be more exacerbated in the United

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:32.950 
even be more exacerbated in the United
States<00:01:31.640> because<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.179> majority<00:01:32.359> of<00:01:32.600> our<00:01:32.719> debt

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
States because the majority of our debt

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.560 
States because the majority of our debt
is<00:01:33.109> financed<00:01:33.799> in<00:01:33.890> relatively<00:01:34.310> short<00:01:34.579> terms<00:01:34.909> so

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
is financed in relatively short terms so

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.179 
is financed in relatively short terms so
if<00:01:35.719> we<00:01:35.780> look<00:01:36.020> at<00:01:36.109> what's<00:01:36.289> going<00:01:36.350> on<00:01:36.649> a<00:01:36.710> 10-year

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189

if we look at what's going on a 10-year
yield<00:01:37.460> what<00:01:38.090> we're<00:01:38.240> seeing<00:01:38.390> is<00:01:38.570> a<00:01:38.600> potential

the Federal Reserve will have to
