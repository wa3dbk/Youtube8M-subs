00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
looks just like a triangle here where

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:37.020 
looks just like a triangle here where
your<00:00:35.170> arrow<00:00:35.379> sits<00:00:35.739> in<00:00:35.980> if<00:00:36.489> you<00:00:36.579> guys<00:00:36.730> could<00:00:36.969> see

to allow the arrow to fly through the

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.819 
to allow the arrow to fly through the
middle<00:01:07.630> here<00:01:07.869> where<00:01:08.320> you<00:01:08.409> don't<00:01:08.560> have<00:01:08.649> any

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:08.829 
middle here where you don't have any

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:11.310 
middle here where you don't have any
issues<00:01:09.219> one<00:01:09.789> thing<00:01:10.030> I<00:01:10.149> would<00:01:10.360> recommend<00:01:10.509> we're

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
issues one thing I would recommend we're

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.620 
issues one thing I would recommend we're
gonna<00:01:11.439> do<00:01:11.680> on<00:01:11.799> this<00:01:11.950> one<00:01:12.219> real<00:01:12.430> fast<00:01:12.640> set<00:01:13.360> it<00:01:13.479> so

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
gonna do on this one real fast set it so

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.599 
gonna do on this one real fast set it so
your<00:01:13.990> pane<00:01:14.259> is<00:01:14.439> facing<00:01:14.890> down<00:01:15.100> and<00:01:15.340> I

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
your pane is facing down and I

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:18.120 
your pane is facing down and I
state<00:01:15.880> that<00:01:15.909> just<00:01:16.329> because<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.810> top<00:01:17.079> is<00:01:17.469> flat

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
state that just because the top is flat

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.399 
state that just because the top is flat
the<00:01:18.880> bottom<00:01:19.270> is<00:01:19.450> at<00:01:19.570> a<00:01:19.600> triangular<00:01:20.200> portion

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
the bottom is at a triangular portion

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.349 
the bottom is at a triangular portion
therefore<00:01:21.070> allowing<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.939> where<00:01:22.060> your<00:01:22.180> arrow

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:22.359 
therefore allowing to where your arrow

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:23.639 
therefore allowing to where your arrow
can<00:01:22.570> go<00:01:22.689> through<00:01:22.930> without<00:01:23.140> any<00:01:23.200> kind<00:01:23.560> of

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
can go through without any kind of

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.160 
can go through without any kind of
fletching<00:01:24.009> contact<00:01:24.490> so<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.299> rest<00:01:25.600> in<00:01:25.840> itself

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
fletching contact so the rest in itself

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.310 
fletching contact so the rest in itself
very<00:01:26.829> simple<00:01:27.369> to<00:01:27.789> use<00:01:28.030> very<00:01:28.180> easy<00:01:28.479> to<00:01:28.990> put<00:01:29.200> on

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
very simple to use very easy to put on

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.740

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
explain it alright so I'm going to draw

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.860

the bow back and you guys are going to

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.020 
the bow back and you guys are going to
see<00:02:32.109> when<00:02:32.769> this<00:02:32.889> cable<00:02:33.340> moves<00:02:33.549> down<00:02:33.730> or<00:02:33.939> the

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
see when this cable moves down or the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.550 
see when this cable moves down or the
limbs<00:02:34.269> come<00:02:34.540> down<00:02:34.719> it<00:02:34.900> takes<00:02:35.049> the<00:02:35.290> tension

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
limbs come down it takes the tension

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.619 
limbs come down it takes the tension
because<00:02:35.859> this<00:02:36.010> is<00:02:36.159> a<00:02:36.189> reverse<00:02:36.670> spring<00:02:37.090> system

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
because this is a reverse spring system

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.629

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
older version they had to put it into

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.059 
older version they had to put it into
the<00:02:45.700> downward<00:02:45.969> cable<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:46.959> allow<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.650> cable
