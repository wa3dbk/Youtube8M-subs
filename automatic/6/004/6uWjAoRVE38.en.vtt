here's<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.139> nice<00:00:10.410> two<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:10.830> one<00:00:11.040> peach<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:11.820> a

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
here's a nice two in one peach this is a

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.879 
here's a nice two in one peach this is a
mid<00:00:12.450> pride<00:00:12.780> in<00:00:12.990> Saturn<00:00:13.440> which<00:00:13.590> are<00:00:13.740> both

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
mid pride in Saturn which are both

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.090 
mid pride in Saturn which are both
double<00:00:14.519> pink<00:00:15.269> flowering<00:00:15.780> varieties<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.890> mid

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
double pink flowering varieties the mid

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.529 
double pink flowering varieties the mid
pride<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.460> gonna<00:00:17.609> ripen<00:00:17.820> up<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.210> July<00:00:18.359> the

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
pride is gonna ripen up in July the

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.269 
pride is gonna ripen up in July the
Saturn<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.109> gonna<00:00:19.260> ripen<00:00:19.470> up<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:19.830> August<00:00:20.189> so

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
Saturn is gonna ripen up in August so

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.370 
Saturn is gonna ripen up in August so
there's<00:00:20.460> successive<00:00:20.939> ripening<00:00:21.300> varieties<00:00:21.750> so

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
there's successive ripening varieties so

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.710 
there's successive ripening varieties so
here's<00:00:22.949> our<00:00:23.070> divide<00:00:23.400> right<00:00:23.730> here<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.330> this

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
here's our divide right here this this

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.230 
here's our divide right here this this
side<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.109> mid<00:00:25.289> pride<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:26.400> side<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.849> Saturn

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
side is mid pride this side is Saturn

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.750 
side is mid pride this side is Saturn
the<00:00:27.840> Saturn<00:00:28.260> maybe<00:00:28.439> just<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.859> slightly<00:00:29.400> more

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
the Saturn maybe just a slightly more

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.569 
the Saturn maybe just a slightly more
aggressive<00:00:30.119> variety<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:32.070> do<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> little

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
aggressive variety so I can do a little

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.130 
aggressive variety so I can do a little
bit<00:00:32.700> more<00:00:32.880> work<00:00:33.120> on<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> Saturn<00:00:33.750> side<00:00:33.960> but

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
bit more work on the Saturn side but

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.530 
bit more work on the Saturn side but
they're<00:00:34.260> pretty<00:00:34.469> well<00:00:34.620> balanced<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.190> think<00:00:35.540> I'm

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
they're pretty well balanced I think I'm

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.209 
they're pretty well balanced I think I'm
gonna<00:00:36.660> make<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.899> couple<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.440> cuts<00:00:37.680> here<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.040> don't

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
gonna make a couple of cuts here I don't

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.600 
gonna make a couple of cuts here I don't
really<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:39.920> branch<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.430> come

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
really like this branch that can come

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.569 
really like this branch that can come
off<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.120> think<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:42.870> come<00:00:43.079> off<00:00:43.579> so

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
off and I think this can come off so

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.209 
off and I think this can come off so
we'll<00:00:44.730> take<00:00:44.910> those<00:00:45.149> out<00:00:45.680> but<00:00:46.680> then<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.890> want<00:00:47.129> to

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
we'll take those out but then I want to

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.270 
we'll take those out but then I want to
come<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:48.200> from<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.350> center<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.739> just<00:00:50.010> want<00:00:50.190> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
come in from the center I just want to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.250 
come in from the center I just want to
open<00:00:50.309> up<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.820> Saturn<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.360> little<00:00:51.719> bit<00:00:51.870> more<00:00:52.110> to

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
open up this Saturn a little bit more to

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.229 
open up this Saturn a little bit more to
take<00:00:52.469> out<00:00:52.649> some<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.699> growth<00:00:54.000> that's

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
take out some of this growth that's

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.270 
take out some of this growth that's
growing<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.780> toward<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.199> mid<00:00:55.469> pride<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
growing in toward the mid pride the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.099 
growing in toward the mid pride the
Saturn<00:00:56.699> has<00:00:56.879> more<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.239> west<00:00:57.449> face<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:57.960> it's

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
Saturn has more the west face so it's

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.750 
Saturn has more the west face so it's
going<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.289> be<00:00:58.440> more<00:00:58.649> aggressive<00:00:58.890> anyway<00:00:59.489> I

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
going to be more aggressive anyway I

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.639 
going to be more aggressive anyway I
don't<00:01:00.180> want<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.510> shade<00:01:00.719> out<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.930> mid<00:01:01.199> pride<00:01:01.440> so

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
don't want to shade out the mid pride so

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.290 
don't want to shade out the mid pride so
I'm<00:01:01.739> gonna<00:01:01.859> open<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.910> little<00:01:02.940> bit

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
I'm gonna open this up just a little bit

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.899 
I'm gonna open this up just a little bit
more<00:01:03.500> for<00:01:04.500> light<00:01:04.680> exposure<00:01:05.070> next<00:01:05.519> summer

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
more for light exposure next summer

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.969 
more for light exposure next summer
I<00:01:06.110> think<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.320> cut<00:01:07.590> right<00:01:07.860> here<00:01:09.830> that's<00:01:10.830> a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
I think this cut right here that's a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.680 
I think this cut right here that's a
nice<00:01:12.650> balancing<00:01:13.650> cut

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.750 

you<00:01:17.110> can<00:01:17.290> probably<00:01:17.830> lighten<00:01:18.130> this<00:01:18.400> one<00:01:18.610> up

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
you can probably lighten this one up

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.630 
you can probably lighten this one up
just<00:01:18.790> a<00:01:19.090> little<00:01:19.120> bit<00:01:19.540> by<00:01:19.690> taking<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:21.400> out

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
just a little bit by taking this out

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.980 
just a little bit by taking this out
completely<00:01:23.940> and<00:01:24.940> then<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.450> rest<00:01:25.660> of<00:01:25.810> our<00:01:25.930> work

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
completely and then the rest of our work

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.340 
completely and then the rest of our work
is<00:01:26.380> going<00:01:26.440> to<00:01:26.590> be<00:01:26.650> just<00:01:27.160> some<00:01:27.960> some<00:01:28.960> tipping

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
is going to be just some some tipping

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.560 
is going to be just some some tipping
back<00:01:32.490> opening<00:01:33.490> up<00:01:33.670> some<00:01:33.880> of<00:01:33.970> these<00:01:34.060> forks<00:01:34.480> a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
back opening up some of these forks a

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.430 
back opening up some of these forks a
little<00:01:34.810> bit<00:01:35.220> taking<00:01:36.220> out<00:01:36.340> some<00:01:36.610> of<00:01:36.700> this

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
little bit taking out some of this

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.660 
little bit taking out some of this
interior<00:01:38.440> growth<00:01:38.890> that<00:01:39.100> we<00:01:39.190> really<00:01:39.520> don't

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
interior growth that we really don't

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.040 
interior growth that we really don't
need<00:01:41.550> and<00:01:42.550> just<00:01:43.120> keeping<00:01:43.390> everything<00:01:43.540> pruned

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
need and just keeping everything pruned

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.020 
need and just keeping everything pruned
back<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.380> a<00:01:44.410> nice<00:01:46.170> well-balanced<00:01:47.170> size<00:01:48.030> Saturn

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
back to a nice well-balanced size Saturn

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.050 
back to a nice well-balanced size Saturn

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
pride is one of the one of the best

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
peaches you'll ever find in Southern

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.830 
peaches you'll ever find in Southern
California<00:02:03.490> or<00:02:04.030> even<00:02:04.300> anywhere<00:02:04.720> in

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.350 

I<00:02:13.560> think<00:02:14.100> I'll<00:02:14.220> stop<00:02:14.490> there<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.790> certainly

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
I think I'll stop there I certainly

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.630 
I think I'll stop there I certainly
could<00:02:15.600> be<00:02:15.780> more<00:02:15.990> aggressive<00:02:16.560> but<00:02:16.800> this<00:02:17.460> is

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
could be more aggressive but this is

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.520 
could be more aggressive but this is
such<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.880> beautiful<00:02:18.600> variety<00:02:18.780> when<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.320> flowers

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
such a beautiful variety when it flowers

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.170 
such a beautiful variety when it flowers
I<00:02:19.890> want<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.130> take<00:02:20.280> advantage<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.970> full

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
I want to take advantage of the full

I want to take advantage of the full
flower<00:02:21.540> set<00:02:21.960> if<00:02:22.650> we<00:02:22.890> need<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.160> do<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.280> little<00:02:23.550> bit

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
flower set if we need to do a little bit

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.400 
flower set if we need to do a little bit
more<00:02:23.850> work<00:02:24.060> on<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.300> after<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.720> sets<00:02:24.960> fruit<00:02:25.200> will

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
more work on it after it sets fruit will

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.560 
more work on it after it sets fruit will
thin<00:02:25.650> pretty<00:02:25.860> aggressively<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:26.760> we<00:02:27.210> may<00:02:27.390> do<00:02:27.540> a

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
thin pretty aggressively and we may do a

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.240 
thin pretty aggressively and we may do a
little<00:02:27.810> bit<00:02:27.960> more<00:02:27.990> pruning<00:02:28.560> later<00:02:28.740> on<00:02:28.950> here's

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
little bit more pruning later on here's

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.100 
little bit more pruning later on here's
our<00:02:29.430> two-in-one<00:02:29.880> pluot<00:02:30.270> combination<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.050> is

two-in-one on citation so being that

two-in-one on citation so being that
it's<00:02:37.260> on<00:02:37.380> citation<00:02:38.010> it's<00:02:38.160> shut<00:02:38.370> down<00:02:38.400> fairly

it's on citation it's shut down fairly

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.460 
it's on citation it's shut down fairly
early<00:02:39.120> in<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.450> season<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:39.960> when<00:02:40.140> we<00:02:40.260> did<00:02:40.440> our

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
early in the season so when we did our

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.190 
early in the season so when we did our
summer<00:02:40.830> pruning<00:02:41.070> back<00:02:41.940> in<00:02:42.240> August<00:02:43.050> and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
summer pruning back in August and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.530 
summer pruning back in August and
September<00:02:43.490> this<00:02:44.490> pretty<00:02:45.030> much<00:02:45.180> shut<00:02:45.390> down

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
September this pretty much shut down

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.810 
September this pretty much shut down
from<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:45.870> point<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:46.500> when<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.220> look<00:02:47.459> at<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.580> tree

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
from that point so when I look at a tree

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.920 
from that point so when I look at a tree
like<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.180> there<00:02:48.360> really<00:02:48.480> isn't<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.840> much

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
like this there really isn't that much

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.410 
like this there really isn't that much
to<00:02:49.230> do<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.100> center<00:02:50.820> is<00:02:50.880> open<00:02:51.270> the

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
to do the the center is open the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.600 
to do the the center is open the
branching<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:51.990> nice<00:02:52.200> there's<00:02:52.830> lots<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.430> nice

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
branching is nice there's lots of nice

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.000 
branching is nice there's lots of nice
spur<00:02:54.000> wood<00:02:54.240> on<00:02:54.390> this<00:02:54.570> tree<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:55.830> see

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
spur wood on this tree so you can see

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.949 
spur wood on this tree so you can see
the<00:02:56.160> difference<00:02:56.550> here<00:02:56.610> in<00:02:57.000> where<00:02:57.540> your<00:02:57.690> fruits

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
the difference here in where your fruits

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.960 
the difference here in where your fruits
going<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.200> come<00:02:58.410> from<00:02:58.740> and<00:02:59.010> where<00:02:59.550> your<00:02:59.700> vigor

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
going to come from and where your vigor

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.440 
going to come from and where your vigor
is<00:03:00.209> take<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.080> close-up<00:03:01.380> here<00:03:01.650> Mike<00:03:02.150> this<00:03:03.150> type

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
is take a close-up here Mike this type

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.150 
is take a close-up here Mike this type
of<00:03:03.630> wood<00:03:03.840> right<00:03:03.870> here<00:03:04.140> these<00:03:04.560> little<00:03:04.860> short

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
of wood right here these little short

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.970 
of wood right here these little short
Spurs<00:03:05.580> this<00:03:06.150> is<00:03:06.330> fruiting<00:03:06.690> wood<00:03:06.720> this<00:03:07.500> more

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
Spurs this is fruiting wood this more

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.980 
Spurs this is fruiting wood this more
elongated<00:03:08.430> growth<00:03:09.060> that's<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.540> little<00:03:09.780> thicker

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
elongated growth that's a little thicker

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.660 
elongated growth that's a little thicker
and<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.230> little<00:03:10.260> more<00:03:10.560> vigorous<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.490> is

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
and a little more vigorous this is

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.760 
and a little more vigorous this is
vegetative<00:03:12.300> wood<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:12.840> this<00:03:13.350> isn't<00:03:13.650> really

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
vegetative wood so this isn't really

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.110 
vegetative wood so this isn't really
going<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.040> produce<00:03:14.250> much<00:03:14.580> fruit<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:14.880> flower

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
going to produce much fruit and flower

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.460 
going to produce much fruit and flower
this<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.510> where<00:03:15.810> we're<00:03:15.900> gonna<00:03:15.959> get<00:03:16.140> our<00:03:16.200> fruit

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
this is where we're gonna get our fruit

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.590 
this is where we're gonna get our fruit
and<00:03:16.500> flower<00:03:16.770> so<00:03:17.160> if<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:17.820> want<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.060> do<00:03:18.150> anything

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
and flower so if you want to do anything

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.630 
and flower so if you want to do anything
you<00:03:18.720> can<00:03:18.870> eliminate<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.350> little<00:03:19.650> bit<00:03:19.800> of<00:03:19.980> this

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
you can eliminate a little bit of this

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.759 
you can eliminate a little bit of this
aggressive<00:03:21.150> vegetative<00:03:21.750> growth<00:03:21.780> but<00:03:22.470> try<00:03:22.709> and

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
aggressive vegetative growth but try and

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.320 
aggressive vegetative growth but try and
leave<00:03:23.040> these<00:03:23.310> nice<00:03:23.489> little<00:03:23.790> fruiting<00:03:24.209> and

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
leave these nice little fruiting and

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.880 
leave these nice little fruiting and
flowering<00:03:24.660> Spurs<00:03:24.989> in<00:03:25.170> here<00:03:25.320> because<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:25.709> is

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
flowering Spurs in here because this is

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.640 
flowering Spurs in here because this is
where<00:03:26.040> your<00:03:26.160> fruits<00:03:26.370> going<00:03:26.550> to<00:03:26.610> come<00:03:26.790> from

00:06:58.809 --> 00:06:58.819 
balance I don't want any one variety to

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:00.309 
balance I don't want any one variety to
get<00:06:58.999> heavy<00:06:59.270> we<00:06:59.539> may<00:06:59.719> have<00:06:59.839> one<00:07:00.050> or<00:07:00.169> two

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 
get heavy we may have one or two

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:01.600 
get heavy we may have one or two
varieties<00:07:00.499> that<00:07:00.770> are<00:07:00.919> get<00:07:01.039> a<00:07:01.069> heavier<00:07:01.310> fruit

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610 
varieties that are get a heavier fruit

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.670 
varieties that are get a heavier fruit
set<00:07:01.939> than<00:07:02.569> others<00:07:02.839> so<00:07:03.080> this<00:07:03.199> is<00:07:03.379> one<00:07:03.529> where
