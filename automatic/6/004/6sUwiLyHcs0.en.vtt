plasma something something reinforced
glass<00:01:00.960> art<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.070> need<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.640> reinforced

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
glass art so you need to have reinforced

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.100 
glass art so you need to have reinforced
glass<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:04.970> have<00:01:05.970> no<00:01:06.240> idea<00:01:06.270> how<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.659> create<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
glass I have no idea how to create the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.360 
glass I have no idea how to create the
snap

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
snap

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.890 
snap
something<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.870> I<00:01:10.350> do<00:01:10.740> believe<00:01:11.450> yes<00:01:12.450> we

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
something like this I do believe yes we

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.630 
something like this I do believe yes we
can<00:01:13.110> make<00:01:13.650> an<00:01:13.860> empty<00:01:14.310> vial<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.050> is<00:01:16.640> so

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
can make an empty vial and that is so

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.290 
can make an empty vial and that is so
far<00:01:17.910> what<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.660> create<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.670> if<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:20.880> go<00:01:21.270> down

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
far what we can create and if we go down

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.700 
far what we can create and if we go down
I<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.260> found<00:01:22.650> some<00:01:23.130> plasma<00:01:23.760> craft<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.260> do

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
I have found some plasma craft and I do

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.190 
I have found some plasma craft and I do
not<00:01:26.070> want<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.490> do<00:01:26.730> this<00:01:26.940> in<00:01:27.210> my<00:01:27.570> life<00:01:27.780> stream

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
not want to do this in my life stream

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.280 
not want to do this in my life stream

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
deep drops of how am I gonna get there I

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.240 
deep drops of how am I gonna get there I
have<00:01:53.160> to<00:01:53.460> cut<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.150> crap<00:01:54.480> we<00:01:54.930> cut<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.350> spill

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
have to cut this crap we cut this spill

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.970 
have to cut this crap we cut this spill
right<00:01:56.460> here<00:01:56.700> Oh<00:01:59.840> some<00:02:00.840> light<00:02:01.110> over<00:02:01.410> there<00:02:01.560> may

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
right here Oh some light over there may

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.910 
right here Oh some light over there may
be<00:02:02.010> some<00:02:02.310> lava<00:02:02.580> like<00:02:03.510> over<00:02:03.810> here<00:02:04.050> but<00:02:04.410> let's<00:02:04.710> go

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
be some lava like over here but let's go

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.020 
be some lava like over here but let's go
collect<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:07.010> plasma<00:02:08.010> something<00:02:08.820> or<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.420> I

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
collect this plasma something or I I

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.600 
collect this plasma something or I I
wonder<00:02:12.030> what<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.510> would<00:02:12.690> be<00:02:13.220> it's<00:02:14.220> hard<00:02:14.489> to

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
wonder what it would be it's hard to

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.410 
wonder what it would be it's hard to
break<00:02:15.410> what's<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.560> called<00:02:16.860> it's<00:02:17.760> called<00:02:18.060> the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
break what's a called it's called the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.000 
break what's a called it's called the
radio<00:02:19.110> night<00:02:19.440> or<00:02:19.940> never<00:02:20.940> heard<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.739> but<00:02:22.739> um

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
radio night or never heard of it but um

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.580 
radio night or never heard of it but um
most<00:02:23.550> likely<00:02:23.700> my<00:02:24.330> science<00:02:24.900> teacher<00:02:25.170> would

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
most likely my science teacher would

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.320 
most likely my science teacher would
have<00:02:25.620> heard<00:02:25.890> about<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.130> all<00:02:26.670> right<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.030> it

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
have heard about it all right and it

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
just random cave holding shift nothing

just random cave holding shift nothing
that<00:02:40.350> we<00:02:40.440> can<00:02:40.819> scavenge<00:02:41.819> look<00:02:42.090> along<00:02:42.360> with

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
that we can scavenge look along with

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.890 
that we can scavenge look along with
ceilings<00:02:43.130> nothing<00:02:44.240> right<00:02:45.240> so<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.480> am<00:02:45.630> playing

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
ceilings nothing right so I am playing

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.290

to<00:02:46.170> make<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.319> longer<00:02:46.709> video<00:02:47.010> but<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:47.610> depends

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
to make a longer video but that depends

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.300 
to make a longer video but that depends
on<00:02:49.850> how<00:02:50.850> much<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.780> think<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.620> video<00:02:52.770> is<00:02:52.890> boring

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
on how much I think the video is boring

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.430 
on how much I think the video is boring
so<00:02:53.610> let's<00:02:53.640> see<00:02:54.030> what's<00:02:54.240> bob<00:02:54.420> who<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:55.020> green
