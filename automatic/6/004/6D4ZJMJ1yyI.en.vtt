 I do not know what this trunk business is 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.080
 concrete around you love contact 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:32.030

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.970

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.930
 carton xx that is used by the star of 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.489
 globe starts punk né then other tags 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.769
 You only think it was the same. 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.440
 only location you will have to come to 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.910
 from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.130
 afternoon it's good 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.190
 seeing you have to come at this time 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.570
 hour and it may not be raining and the fpm 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.299
 if all goes well you will have these two 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.600
 Guys plus another nephew then you 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.519
 pick up smet and point the guy's shirt 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.450
 on the shirt will have there revealed some 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.790
 ripper thing 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.580
 this is like a plagiarism in quotation marks 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.610
 of the tennis player t-shirt 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.579
 w I wished he used it more or 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.280
 less so the t-shirt and it looks like basketball 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:19.190
 I think our cause of optimism is there 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.780
 so I decided to bring those with this 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.060
 compiled here then I hope you guys 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.010
 have liked it is not the first floor 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.990
 and there are not only these top ten 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.940
 games bring several videos let's say 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.370
 each has its own taste and I decide 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.320
 bring these tires here because it was ten 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.750
 What else does it hit the house and I said our 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.010

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.510

 also leave a really cool comment 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.919

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.280
