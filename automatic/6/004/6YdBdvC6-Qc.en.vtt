00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
YouTube wouldn't accept it so this is

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.279 
YouTube wouldn't accept it so this is
about<00:00:26.310> three<00:00:26.939> feet<00:00:27.810> with<00:00:29.779> what<00:00:30.779> i<00:00:30.810> did<00:00:31.019> was<00:00:31.230> i

Ethan<00:00:48.660> stylist<00:00:49.940> equated<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> pink<00:00:51.480> is

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
Ethan stylist equated to the pink is

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.689 
Ethan stylist equated to the pink is
much<00:00:52.079> stronger<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.860> like<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.399> love<00:00:53.640> it

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
much stronger and I like it I love it

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:10.590 
much stronger and I like it I love it
actually<00:00:57.680> hope<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.829> can<00:00:59.010> see<00:00:59.280> this<00:01:05.780> thing

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.640 

okay<00:01:11.409> um<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:13.390> that<00:01:13.540> size<00:01:13.750> is

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.940 

but<00:01:17.540> some<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.660> it<00:01:18.780> wasn't<00:01:21.260> twisting<00:01:22.260> like<00:01:22.470> I've

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
but some of it wasn't twisting like I've

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.930 
but some of it wasn't twisting like I've
had<00:01:23.130> some<00:01:23.400> areas<00:01:23.760> of<00:01:23.940> your<00:01:24.060> hair<00:01:24.300> that<00:01:24.570> feels

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
had some areas of your hair that feels

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.290 
had some areas of your hair that feels
that<00:01:26.940> it's<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.470> curls<00:01:28.470> or<00:01:28.740> something<00:01:29.300> so

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
that it's not curls or something so

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.270 
that it's not curls or something so
that's<00:01:30.720> what<00:01:30.870> I<00:01:30.900> did<00:01:30.930> with<00:01:31.200> these<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.620> re

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
that's what I did with these I re

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.570 
that's what I did with these I re
twisted<00:01:32.520> lead<00:01:33.410> with<00:01:34.410> the<00:01:34.440> eco<00:01:34.830> styler<00:01:35.130> in

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
twisted lead with the eco styler in

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.840 
twisted lead with the eco styler in
olive<00:01:35.940> oil<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.750> take<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.170> right<00:01:37.410> now<00:01:37.850> and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
olive oil and take that right now and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:48.290 
olive oil and take that right now and
for<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> other<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:39.570> my<00:01:39.840> hands<00:01:40.050> again<00:01:47.210> here<00:01:48.210> we

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
for the other one my hands again here we

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:55.719 
for the other one my hands again here we
go<00:01:49.430> so<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.580> one<00:01:50.790> won't<00:01:51.000> be<00:01:51.119> too<00:01:51.270> long<00:01:52.400> and

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.770 

probably<00:01:56.729> some<00:01:57.420> more<00:01:57.740> equal<00:01:58.740> power<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.750> set<00:02:00.750> a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
probably some more equal power to set a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.070 
probably some more equal power to set a
little<00:02:00.960> house<00:02:01.110> will<00:02:01.380> come<00:02:01.530> out<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:02.160> I<00:02:02.369> said

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
little house will come out like I said

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.370 
little house will come out like I said
these<00:02:04.080> are<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.320> areas<00:02:04.440> i<00:02:04.830> had<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.070> do<00:02:05.220> over

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
these are the areas i had to do over

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.270 
these are the areas i had to do over
well<00:02:07.380> they<00:02:07.500> were<00:02:07.619> just<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.860> little<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.250> little

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
well they were just a little a little

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:22.400 
well they were just a little a little
bit<00:02:11.570> undone<00:02:13.580> okay

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.930 

again<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.490> have<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.730> eco<00:02:24.060> styler<00:02:24.240> lance<00:02:24.800> and

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
again I have the eco styler lance and

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:44.860 
again I have the eco styler lance and
olive<00:02:26.940> oil<00:02:28.610> and

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.850 

and<00:02:45.409> then<00:02:45.620> some<00:02:45.860> area<00:02:46.280> like<00:02:46.549> the<00:02:47.090> front<00:02:47.860> the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
and then some area like the front the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:03:01.700 
and then some area like the front the
back<00:02:49.010> was<00:02:49.250> fine<00:02:49.519> set<00:02:49.970> following<00:02:50.180> piece

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.650 

again<00:03:02.550> I'm<00:03:03.060> just<00:03:03.590> going<00:03:04.590> along<00:03:04.740> it<00:03:05.130> with<00:03:05.660> the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
again I'm just going along it with the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:20.750 
again I'm just going along it with the
eco<00:03:06.960> styler

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:29.550 

girl

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.309 

who

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
who

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.090 
who
of<00:03:31.709> course<00:03:31.980> I'm<00:03:32.099> going<00:03:32.249> to<00:03:32.370> fix<00:03:32.549> it

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.830 

probably<00:03:35.820> so<00:03:35.970> different<00:03:36.450> smaller<00:03:37.640> but<00:03:38.840> this

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
probably so different smaller but this

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.580 
probably so different smaller but this
is<00:03:39.990> a<00:03:40.020> process<00:03:40.290> for<00:03:41.750> natural<00:03:42.750> period<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.380> time

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
is a process for natural period of time

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.420 
is a process for natural period of time
such<00:03:47.630> as<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:48.840> equals<00:03:49.230> Commerce<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.190> lower

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
such as it equals Commerce the lower

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.830 
such as it equals Commerce the lower
hand<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:53.730> i<00:03:53.880> said<00:03:54.030> i<00:03:54.120> will<00:03:54.300> do<00:03:54.450> it<00:03:54.660> is<00:03:54.810> a

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
hand and i said i will do it is a

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.700 
hand and i said i will do it is a
reckless<00:03:55.320> without<00:03:55.740> to<00:03:56.900> roll<00:03:57.900> across<00:03:57.990> it<00:03:58.500> with

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
reckless without to roll across it with

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:07.760 
reckless without to roll across it with
the<00:03:58.860> equal<00:03:59.100> smaller<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.610> i'm<00:03:59.730> taking<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.120> out

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:15.610 

and<00:04:08.250> I<00:04:08.580> will<00:04:08.760> of<00:04:08.910> course<00:04:09.060> list<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:09.990> seal<00:04:10.230> it

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.520 

this<00:04:16.310> is<00:04:16.430> another<00:04:16.609> problem<00:04:16.850> areas

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.920 

the<00:04:21.070> front<00:04:21.400> is<00:04:21.459> probably<00:04:21.790> more<00:04:22.720> it<00:04:22.840> in

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
the front is probably more it in

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:41.310 
the front is probably more it in
the<00:04:23.020> bag<00:04:23.230> but<00:04:23.530> that's<00:04:24.040> okay

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.290 

it's<00:04:41.650> time<00:04:41.920> to<00:04:41.950> trim<00:04:42.870> on<00:04:43.870> my<00:04:44.200> end<00:04:44.730> see<00:04:45.730> the<00:04:45.910> ends

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
it's time to trim on my end see the ends

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.170 
it's time to trim on my end see the ends
that's<00:04:46.480> not<00:04:46.690> curly<00:04:49.080> when<00:04:50.080> I<00:04:50.200> cut<00:04:50.410> my<00:04:50.590> own<00:04:51.180> item

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
that's not curly when I cut my own item

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.770 
that's not curly when I cut my own item
