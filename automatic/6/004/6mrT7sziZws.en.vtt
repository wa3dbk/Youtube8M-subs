a couple times we kind of had a false
recovery<00:03:53.940> after<00:03:54.870> Ohio<00:03:55.110> State<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:56.160> then<00:03:56.310> we

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
recovery after Ohio State and then we

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.720 
recovery after Ohio State and then we
had<00:03:56.580> a<00:03:57.260> bed<00:03:58.260> penalty<00:03:59.190> game<00:03:59.570> against<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:00.870> film

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.760 
had a bed penalty game against the film
so<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:03.300> just<00:04:03.810> kind<00:04:04.020> of<00:04:04.080> temper<00:04:04.350> mind<00:04:04.560> my

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
so I just kind of temper mind my

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.290 
so I just kind of temper mind my
thoughts<00:04:05.010> there<00:04:05.220> on<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.490> penalties<00:04:05.820> we're

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
thoughts there on the penalties we're

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.430 
thoughts there on the penalties we're
going<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.450> have<00:04:06.570> to<00:04:06.630> be<00:04:06.690> really<00:04:06.990> good<00:04:07.140> against

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
going to have to be really good against

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.110 
going to have to be really good against
this<00:04:07.530> group<00:04:07.710> I<00:04:07.860> think<00:04:07.890> they're<00:04:08.220> 40<00:04:08.790> yards<00:04:09.060> a

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
this group I think they're 40 yards a

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.920 
this group I think they're 40 yards a
game<00:04:09.150> which<00:04:10.110> is<00:04:10.140> excellent<00:04:10.910> turnovers<00:04:11.930> we're

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
game which is excellent turnovers we're

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.360 
game which is excellent turnovers we're
moving<00:04:13.350> in<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.470> positive<00:04:13.650> direction<00:04:13.890> but<00:04:14.280> we

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
moving in a positive direction but we

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.250 
moving in a positive direction but we
still<00:04:14.520> need<00:04:14.700> more<00:04:14.910> takeaways<00:04:15.510> on<00:04:15.780> defense<00:04:16.140> I

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
still need more takeaways on defense I

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.990 
still need more takeaways on defense I
think<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:16.680> would<00:04:16.800> all<00:04:16.920> agree<00:04:17.130> we<00:04:17.970> need

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
think you would all agree we need

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.310 
think you would all agree we need
interceptions<00:04:18.720> we're<00:04:18.870> not<00:04:18.960> get<00:04:19.110> enough

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
interceptions we're not get enough

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.020 
interceptions we're not get enough
interceptions<00:04:19.920> right<00:04:20.100> now<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:21.590> and<00:04:22.590> then

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.030 

yeah<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.060> think<00:04:27.150> that's<00:04:27.420> about<00:04:27.510> it<00:04:27.860> cooked<00:04:28.860> with

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
yeah I think that's about it cooked with

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.590 
yeah I think that's about it cooked with
the<00:04:29.160> interception<00:04:29.550> so<00:04:29.880> what<00:04:30.240> kind<00:04:30.420> of<00:04:30.480> is

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
the interception so what kind of is

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.630 
the interception so what kind of is
t'keyah<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:31.260> we<00:04:31.500> were<00:04:31.590> particularly<00:04:32.400> the

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
t'keyah and we were particularly the

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.580 
t'keyah and we were particularly the
secondary<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.540> don't<00:04:33.780> want<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:33.960> compress<00:04:34.260> for

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
secondary I don't want to compress for

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.010 
secondary I don't want to compress for
them<00:04:34.710> but<00:04:34.890> how<00:04:35.880> would<00:04:35.940> that<00:04:36.300> improve<00:04:36.540> that

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
them but how would that improve that

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.960 
them but how would that improve that
number<00:04:37.380> there<00:04:37.560> well<00:04:37.920> i<00:04:37.950> think<00:04:38.130> again<00:04:38.670> i<00:04:38.730> think

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
number there well i think again i think

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.670 
number there well i think again i think
it's<00:04:39.090> i<00:04:39.300> think<00:04:39.330> it's<00:04:39.690> going<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:40.080> improve<00:04:40.230> just

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
it's i think it's going to improve just

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.320 
it's i think it's going to improve just
because<00:04:40.920> we<00:04:40.950> have<00:04:41.220> stability<00:04:41.400> now<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:42.000> it's

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
because we have stability now and it's

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.390 
because we have stability now and it's
the<00:04:42.420> same<00:04:42.630> guys<00:04:43.110> playing<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.770> same<00:04:43.950> position

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
the same guys playing the same position

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.250 
the same guys playing the same position
now<00:04:44.550> for<00:04:44.820> multiple<00:04:45.180> week<00:04:45.360> so<00:04:45.600> i<00:04:45.630> think<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.080> will

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
now for multiple week so i think it will

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.230 
now for multiple week so i think it will
improve<00:04:46.640> we're<00:04:47.640> getting<00:04:47.730> our<00:04:47.880> hands<00:04:48.060> on<00:04:48.180> a

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
improve we're getting our hands on a

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.760 
improve we're getting our hands on a
couple<00:04:48.570> balls<00:04:48.750> better<00:04:49.050> we're<00:04:49.350> breaking<00:04:49.680> on

what i mean but we had success last week
as<00:05:00.570> a<00:05:00.600> defense<00:05:01.020> because<00:05:01.200> everybody<00:05:01.560> did<00:05:01.770> their

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
as a defense because everybody did their

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.620 
as a defense because everybody did their
job<00:05:02.100> but<00:05:02.340> it<00:05:02.460> was<00:05:02.580> in<00:05:02.670> the<00:05:02.730> right<00:05:02.850> spot<00:05:02.910> coach

job but it was in the right spot coach

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.630 
job but it was in the right spot coach
is<00:05:03.780> difficult<00:05:04.290> to<00:05:04.380> emphasize<00:05:04.830> takeaways<00:05:05.370> when

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
is difficult to emphasize takeaways when

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.760 
is difficult to emphasize takeaways when
a<00:05:05.820> big<00:05:06.390> key<00:05:06.630> right<00:05:06.810> now<00:05:06.840> is<00:05:06.960> everybody<00:05:07.290> same<00:05:07.620> as

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
a big key right now is everybody same as

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.830 
a big key right now is everybody same as
discipline<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:08.700> sometimes<00:05:09.630> there's<00:05:09.780> a

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
discipline and sometimes there's a

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.600 
discipline and sometimes there's a
little<00:05:09.870> element<00:05:10.470> of<00:05:10.530> risk<00:05:10.770> one<00:05:11.130> going<00:05:11.400> for<00:05:11.430> the

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
little element of risk one going for the

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.460 
little element of risk one going for the
takeaway<00:05:11.970> yeah<00:05:12.720> I<00:05:12.780> don't<00:05:12.870> I<00:05:13.080> don't<00:05:13.110> I<00:05:13.380> don't

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
takeaway yeah I don't I don't I don't

takeaway yeah I don't I don't I don't
know<00:05:13.680> if<00:05:13.740> I<00:05:13.800> drew<00:05:14.040> that<00:05:14.310> I<00:05:14.460> think<00:05:14.880> you<00:05:15.390> have<00:05:15.570> to

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
know if I drew that I think you have to

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.920 
know if I drew that I think you have to
prepare<00:05:15.840> so<00:05:16.410> hard<00:05:16.820> during<00:05:17.820> the<00:05:17.970> week<00:05:18.060> that's

prepare so hard during the week that's

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.540 
prepare so hard during the week that's
the<00:05:19.110> discipline<00:05:19.560> of<00:05:19.620> preparing<00:05:20.190> that's<00:05:20.400> the

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
the discipline of preparing that's the

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.800 
the discipline of preparing that's the
habit<00:05:20.880> that<00:05:20.910> will<00:05:21.030> try<00:05:21.330> and<00:05:21.390> do<00:05:21.570> we<00:05:21.690> always

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:27.760 
think the competition at every spot is

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.640 
think the competition at every spot is
good<00:07:28.180> for<00:07:28.390> our<00:07:28.450> team<00:07:28.660> unique<00:07:29.080> getting<00:07:29.500> there's

no more safe spot the spot school on the

played<00:07:37.440> some<00:07:37.680> cornerback<00:07:38.160> and<00:07:38.310> it's<00:07:39.060> still

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 
played some cornerback and it's still

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.640 
played some cornerback and it's still
going<00:07:39.330> to<00:07:39.450> be<00:07:39.690> that<00:07:39.840> with<00:07:39.990> the<00:07:40.170> things<00:07:40.350> i'll<00:07:40.530> be

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:40.650 
going to be that with the things i'll be

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.620 
going to be that with the things i'll be
i<00:07:40.830> think<00:07:41.040> so<00:07:41.310> it<00:07:41.490> might<00:07:41.790> be<00:07:41.820> that<00:07:41.970> be<00:07:42.360> that<00:07:42.510> the

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:42.630 
i think so it might be that be that the

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.580 
i think so it might be that be that the
rest<00:07:42.810> of<00:07:42.900> the<00:07:42.990> way<00:07:43.050> against<00:07:43.410> them<00:07:43.710> it's<00:07:45.590> gift

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:46.590 
rest of the way against them it's gift

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.420 
rest of the way against them it's gift
that<00:07:47.040> if<00:07:47.220> two<00:07:47.910> other<00:07:48.120> safeties<00:07:48.570> emerge<00:07:48.900> and

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:49.430 
that if two other safeties emerge and

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.500 
that if two other safeties emerge and
end<00:07:50.430> up<00:07:50.550> being<00:07:50.790> better<00:07:50.940> than<00:07:51.060> mine<00:07:51.330> safety

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:51.510 
end up being better than mine safety

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.420 
end up being better than mine safety
then<00:07:51.870> we'll<00:07:52.020> then<00:07:52.320> we'll<00:07:52.650> find<00:07:52.890> a<00:07:53.010> marijuana

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:53.430

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:55.350 
but right now he's one of the best

Williams<00:08:02.220> has<00:08:02.340> been<00:08:02.490> solid<00:08:02.730> this<00:08:03.120> will<00:08:03.300> be<00:08:03.390> a

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:03.420 
Williams has been solid this will be a

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.200 
Williams has been solid this will be a
great<00:08:03.540> test<00:08:04.410> for<00:08:04.560> them<00:08:04.800> this<00:08:05.010> week<00:08:05.250> terms<00:08:06.030> of

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:06.210 
great test for them this week terms of

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.720 
great test for them this week terms of
supporting<00:08:06.900> a<00:08:06.990> run<00:08:07.170> and<00:08:07.490> defending<00:08:08.490> the<00:08:08.580> deep

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:08.730 
supporting a run and defending the deep

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.940 
supporting a run and defending the deep
ball<00:08:08.990> but<00:08:09.990> again<00:08:10.170> that's<00:08:10.350> got<00:08:10.470> to<00:08:10.560> be<00:08:10.620> a<00:08:10.650> fluid

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:10.950 
ball but again that's got to be a fluid

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.190 
ball but again that's got to be a fluid
situation<00:08:10.980> until<00:08:11.820> it<00:08:12.450> absolutely<00:08:12.810> just<00:08:13.080> says

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:13.200 
situation until it absolutely just says

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.540 
situation until it absolutely just says
okay<00:08:13.410> these<00:08:13.530> are<00:08:13.680> the<00:08:13.740> best<00:08:13.920> forward<00:08:14.250> and

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:14.550 
okay these are the best forward and

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.520 
okay these are the best forward and
right<00:08:14.670> now<00:08:14.850> we<00:08:15.360> feel<00:08:15.390> rotation<00:08:16.140> is<00:08:16.230> the<00:08:16.350> best

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:16.530 
right now we feel rotation is the best

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:21.350 
right now we feel rotation is the best
way<00:08:16.710> to<00:08:17.780> ok<00:08:18.780> guys<00:08:18.960> thanks
