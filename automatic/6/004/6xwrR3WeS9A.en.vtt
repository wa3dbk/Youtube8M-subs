00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.370 
for example today we've looked at the
present<00:03:45.120> perfect<00:03:45.270> which<00:03:45.720> can<00:03:45.960> be<00:03:46.080> easily

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
present perfect which can be easily

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.850 
present perfect which can be easily
represented<00:03:47.310> by<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:47.880> phrase<00:03:48.150> up<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.960> now<00:03:49.140> it's

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
represented by the phrase up to now it's

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.710 
represented by the phrase up to now it's
in<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.130> strong<00:03:50.430> relationship<00:03:50.820> with<00:03:51.450> the

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
in a strong relationship with the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.850 
in a strong relationship with the
present<00:03:52.580> also<00:03:53.580> for<00:03:54.480> example<00:03:54.900> with<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.260> past

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
present also for example with the past

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.540 
present also for example with the past
perfect<00:03:56.330> its<00:03:57.410> predecessor<00:03:58.460> can<00:03:59.460> be

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
perfect its predecessor can be

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.770 
perfect its predecessor can be
represented<00:04:00.150> by<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.720> expression<00:04:01.080> up<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:02.100> then

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
represented by the expression up to then

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.780 
represented by the expression up to then
but<00:04:03.780> don't<00:04:04.020> get<00:04:04.140> confused<00:04:04.430> we<00:04:05.430> look<00:04:05.610> at<00:04:05.730> the

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
but don't get confused we look at the

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.470 
but don't get confused we look at the
past<00:04:05.970> perfect<00:04:06.209> in<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:07.020> next<00:04:07.290> video<00:04:08.270> we<00:04:09.270> also

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
past perfect in the next video we also

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.380 
past perfect in the next video we also
have<00:04:09.630> another<00:04:10.620> past<00:04:10.950> tense<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.850> past<00:04:12.120> simple

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
have another past tense the past simple

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.740 
have another past tense the past simple
a<00:04:13.130> simple<00:04:14.130> would<00:04:14.640> probably<00:04:15.180> be<00:04:15.300> one<00:04:15.540> of<00:04:15.570> the

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
a simple would probably be one of the

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.659 
a simple would probably be one of the
first<00:04:16.020> ones<00:04:16.290> that<00:04:16.470> you'll<00:04:16.620> learn<00:04:16.859> of<00:04:17.190> these

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
first ones that you'll learn of these

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.330 
first ones that you'll learn of these
three<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.239> that<00:04:19.109> is<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.410> do<00:04:19.590> with<00:04:19.739> finished

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
three and that is to do with finished

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.570 
three and that is to do with finished
actions<00:04:20.790> in<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.450> past<00:04:21.950> again<00:04:22.950> it's<00:04:23.400> another

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
actions in the past again it's another

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.090 
actions in the past again it's another
viewpoint<00:04:24.419> it's<00:04:25.080> another<00:04:25.260> way<00:04:25.530> of<00:04:25.560> looking<00:04:25.680> at

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
viewpoint it's another way of looking at

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.730 
viewpoint it's another way of looking at
the<00:04:26.400> past<00:04:26.610> these<00:04:27.600> other<00:04:27.930> ones<00:04:28.230> we<00:04:28.440> will<00:04:28.620> look

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
the past these other ones we will look

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.120 
the past these other ones we will look
at<00:04:28.919> in<00:04:29.130> our<00:04:29.400> next<00:04:29.760> videos
