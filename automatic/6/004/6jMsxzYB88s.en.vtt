 around 1 4 percent for their money 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.139
 because other media said that they were just before the line 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.139
 Georg Kiesinger was our idea pulls the 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:17.649
 under it were several hundred 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.260
 and added smiling help Paulis coach gorgeous certainly can not

 Problems of their contracts, meanwhile, around 290 low level Mirko Henel 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.260
 I dont know 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.050
 The changes 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.480
 rating 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.170
 as a percent so this is about seeing in the 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.390
 Euro Wookey Cardozo they are missing so you can see 15 percent 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.610
 People that's been Mr Barcelona at the Sonar Closing Ceremony 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.180
 2006 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.090
 and Ricardo was working with Syria back then, you can 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.340
 maybe explain it better sooner 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.640
 if one counts now these crowds then sees percent sets 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.250
 that, of course, unlocks incredible associations 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.310
 and that's what the film is all about in the movie as well 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.670
 Friends quite well 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.030
 can be now 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.370
 uncomfortable 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.920
 around 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.650
 next to her what's not fat 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.600
 to explain it for example 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.100
 that Ricardo did that two years ago 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.980
 that is, in electronic music 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.630
 two years already unbelievable past shows she had after 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.730
 represents the game 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.240
 and 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.500
 and and that you really prefer something from two years ago 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.500
 he talks like Peter snaking water 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.890
 he can also explain quite well that was just what it is today 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.490
 No friend says that 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.750
 Thankfully, the musicians is the toll back 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.820
 that's just another aspect of his work, so to speak 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.919
 so the sirens are of course they are called it could be like that 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.409

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.519
 in a fix place percent of Adriano Celentano or or by author 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:24.879
 it's easy to open in exchange and watch how it ends up in the evening 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.449
 massive parameters react 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.689
 for example, on one of possible would not dare me 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.239
 Percent as Westlake in Japan to play a siren because 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.689
 four or more or less Turks Vivaldi understand the contours little 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.599
 because you had to carry an atomic bomb on your head 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.109
 and because we could not defeat her 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.930
 and that is why it is difficult so both in the German for example 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.999
 will serve the German audience though as well as the sirens 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:57.689
 it is so that percent and the German audience is constant of that 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.659
 I tried to liberate what the past or the responsibility 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.829
 from National Socialism and such 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.839
 under and that is actually what we do also a specially for 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:12.079
 symbolic a liberation guessed from all this Bernd Schuldt 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.680
 all those things you always had to do in society and stuff 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.439
 called 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.449
 and that's why you can see the area as being in Germany as one 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.149
 satire 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:28.189
 and you can also play around strangely numbered and I would be me 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.419
 By the way, today would also be the siren 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:35.119
 Now play it if it fits it is a very strong expression 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:37.399
 it must also be true sometimes 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:41.209
 while that shocks me asking people so much who come then and protest 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.989
 want an angry siren game 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.989
 but exactly the opposite 

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:51.149
 who move there
