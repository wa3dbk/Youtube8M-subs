 evening and it was morning day 1 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.780
 anti-semitism 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.840
 so the story of the jews began babylon in 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.330
 the day when one merchant 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.980

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.590
 Abraham was called mad as his shop 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.060
 then from born Jewry 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.669
 [music] 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.260
 but the world is built on balance love is not 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.030
 exists without hate 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:43.640
 plus no minus hot no cold 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.640
 writer without a reader is true 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.710
 that's what for example talk about a dream not 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.350
 anti-semitism shadow of the Jewish people i 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.540

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.820
 the thing casts a shadow a shadow which 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.600
 throws my people away 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.280
 Anti-Semitism I have a question let's you 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.990
 writes that after Abraham 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.120
 the creator opened he could no longer 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:12.670
 stay in babylon is not clear 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.510
 completely incomprehensible that prevents him and 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.280
 go ahead with your leaf clearly 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.860
 continue profitable business to use 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.750
 counting multiply acquired completely 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.590
 faithful family tradition 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.550
 help the poor if necessary and just live 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.550
 you cannot live in peace or 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.550
 why 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.640
 just don't tell me that ordered so 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:45.080
 to him the creator and because so ordered him 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.420
 Creator before gram forget order templates 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.670
 gave not some kind of powerful person 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.970
 whose creator Abraham discovered is 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.590
 the law of nature is as absolute as 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.680
 law of attraction is his only 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.070
 property is the desire to give 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.530
 gratuitous infinitely altruism or 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.170
 sorry for the worn out word love and 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.660
 this love is like any other light 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.000
 distributed and the one to whom 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.739
 pass this message never learn 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.200
 that such peace therefore abraham was 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:22.750
 forced to wander to gather disciples 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:28.489
 and so forth yes it is slavery it is a service 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:30.200
 if not if i don't want i do n't want all of you 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.670
 mean if the messenger suddenly 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.010
 refuses to use his hit 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:39.410
 purpose and hides somewhere among 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.970
 nobel laureates or at least just 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.780
 lives 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.780
 lives and everything 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:56.800
 nessa nessa is what one of 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.800
 the greatest kabbalists of bar sul history 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.140
 if we say that everything that happens to 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.150
 us this is the case and the blind fate that 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.830
 innumerable disasters are sent to us 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.850
 they will show us that this is not the case 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.630
 and inevitable above and control all 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.790
 story 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.560
 all that happened next to the group 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:35.249
 Abraham proves the truth of these words 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:35.249
