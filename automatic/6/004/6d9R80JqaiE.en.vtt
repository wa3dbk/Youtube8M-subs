for<00:00:55.620> an<00:00:55.710> early<00:00:55.920> pool<00:00:56.130> I'm<00:00:57.000> after<00:00:57.300> partying<00:00:57.630> is

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690

probably<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.050> played<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.380> very<00:00:58.800> often<00:00:59.280> they

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
probably not played a very often they

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.340 
probably not played a very often they
consider<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.090> since<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.450> a<00:01:00.540> good<00:01:00.780> Dirk<00:01:01.110> map

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
consider that since it's a good Dirk map

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.020 
consider that since it's a good Dirk map
for<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.770> matchup<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.820> map<00:01:03.000> is

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
for this matchup and this map is

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.960 
for this matchup and this map is
basically<00:01:03.660> only<00:01:03.840> used<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.350> GST<00:01:04.649> l<00:01:04.970> know

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
basically only used in GST l know

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.999 
basically only used in GST l know
there's<00:01:06.420> no<00:01:06.659> prosper<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.380> would<00:01:07.470> ever<00:01:07.530> play

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
there's no prosper that would ever play

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.410 
there's no prosper that would ever play
on<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.369> map<00:01:08.579> if<00:01:08.790> they<00:01:08.909> were<00:01:08.970> given<00:01:09.329> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
on this map if they were given the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.210 
on this map if they were given the
choice<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.050> that's<00:01:10.440> why<00:01:10.620> you<00:01:10.680> don't<00:01:10.830> see<00:01:11.100> any

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
choice so that's why you don't see any

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.830 
choice so that's why you don't see any
stats<00:01:11.550> really<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.120> you<00:01:12.300> know<00:01:12.420> what<00:01:12.570> we<00:01:12.659> also

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
stats really and you know what we also

scouts on the scouting probes and he has

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.520 
scouts on the scouting probes and he has
no<00:01:25.590> idea<00:01:25.950> yeah<00:01:26.430> not<00:01:27.240> at<00:01:27.390> all<00:01:27.479> neste<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.350> goes

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
no idea yeah not at all neste it goes

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.440 
no idea yeah not at all neste it goes
for<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.010> overlord<00:01:29.460> by<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.670> way<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:29.940> he<00:01:30.240> goes

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
for the overlord by the way so he goes

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.660 
for the overlord by the way so he goes
for<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.290> 8th<00:01:31.470> drone<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.100> it's<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.310> slightly

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
for the 8th drone so it's a slightly

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.649 
for the 8th drone so it's a slightly
more<00:01:33.120> economic<00:01:33.810> version<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.260> the<00:01:34.350> bill<00:01:34.500> yeah

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
more economic version of the bill yeah

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.210 
more economic version of the bill yeah
six<00:01:36.659> links<00:01:36.930> started<00:01:37.170> immediately<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:38.010> big

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
six links started immediately the big

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.010 
six links started immediately the big
difference<00:01:38.520> between<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:39.090> 6-pole<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.780> 7-pole

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
difference between as 6-pole and 7-pole

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.590 
difference between as 6-pole and 7-pole
is<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.860> with<00:01:41.010> a<00:01:41.040> 7-pole<00:01:41.760> if<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.030> execute<00:01:42.299> it

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
is that with a 7-pole if you execute it

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.060 
is that with a 7-pole if you execute it
well<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> constant<00:01:43.740> number<00:01:43.770> of

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
well you have a constant number of

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.710 
well you have a constant number of
circling<00:01:44.549> start<00:01:44.820> streaming<00:01:45.180> towards<00:01:45.540> your

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
circling start streaming towards your

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.260 
circling start streaming towards your
opponent<00:01:45.750> space<00:01:46.320> if<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.680> fully<00:01:46.979> commit<00:01:47.580> with

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
opponent space if you fully commit with

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.630 
opponent space if you fully commit with
a<00:01:48.299> six<00:01:48.869> pool<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:50.400> all<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
a six pool you have you get all the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.670 
a six pool you have you get all the
weaker<00:01:51.000> well<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.689> have<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.840> gap<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.380> arrive

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
weaker well you have this gap you arrive

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.109 
weaker well you have this gap you arrive
a<00:01:52.710> little<00:01:52.950> bit<00:01:53.340> faster<00:01:53.670> but<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:54.000> this

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
a little bit faster but you have this

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.450 
a little bit faster but you have this
gap<00:01:54.390> between<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.290> initial<00:01:55.619> zerglings<00:01:56.280> that

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
gap between the initial zerglings that

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.969 
gap between the initial zerglings that
will<00:01:56.640> attack<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.330> then<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.840> second<00:01:58.200> wave<00:01:58.350> so

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
will attack and then the second wave so

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.460 
will attack and then the second wave so
