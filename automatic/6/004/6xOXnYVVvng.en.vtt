00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.040 
animation for it though so yeah kind of
like<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.310> mo<00:03:47.519> moves<00:03:47.760> all<00:03:47.970> except<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:48.780> know<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:48.989> a

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
like a mo moves all except you know in a

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.590 
like a mo moves all except you know in a
cone<00:03:49.260> said<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.739> circle<00:03:50.070> power<00:03:51.030> cord<00:03:51.420> after

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
cone said that circle power cord after

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.540 
cone said that circle power cord after
casting<00:03:52.500> three<00:03:52.709> spell<00:03:52.950> she<00:03:53.100> deals<00:03:53.280> bonus

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
casting three spell she deals bonus

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.949 
casting three spell she deals bonus
magic<00:03:53.850> damage<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:54.360> I<00:03:54.390> imagine<00:03:54.660> it's<00:03:54.780> a<00:03:54.810> little

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
magic damage so I imagine it's a little

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.300 
magic damage so I imagine it's a little
bit<00:03:55.050> of<00:03:55.110> a<00:03:55.170> pick-me-up<00:03:55.590> since<00:03:55.920> she<00:03:56.040> only<00:03:56.160> has

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
bit of a pick-me-up since she only has

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.360 
bit of a pick-me-up since she only has
one<00:03:56.340> damaging<00:03:57.150> ability<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.769> of<00:03:58.769> course<00:03:59.010> it

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
one damaging ability and of course it

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.670 
one damaging ability and of course it
also<00:04:00.239> makes<00:04:00.540> her<00:04:00.660> auras<00:04:00.930> persist<00:04:01.320> for<00:04:01.530> three

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
also makes her auras persist for three

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.160 
also makes her auras persist for three
seconds<00:04:02.010> after<00:04:02.459> deactivation<00:04:03.300> so<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:03.900> think<00:04:03.959> it

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
seconds after deactivation so I think it

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.840 
seconds after deactivation so I think it
lets<00:04:04.350> her<00:04:04.470> jungle<00:04:04.860> Aurora's<00:04:05.459> kind<00:04:05.700> of<00:04:05.760> like

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
lets her jungle Aurora's kind of like

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.479 
lets her jungle Aurora's kind of like
you<00:04:06.000> would<00:04:06.150> do<00:04:06.269> with<00:04:06.480> old<00:04:06.690> ears<00:04:06.930> stances<00:04:07.560> and

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
you would do with old ears stances and

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.790 
you would do with old ears stances and
that<00:04:08.970> saw<00:04:09.239> no<00:04:09.300> really<00:04:09.720> sounds<00:04:10.530> like<00:04:10.590> she's

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
that saw no really sounds like she's

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.380 
that saw no really sounds like she's
going<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:10.950> be<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.100> very<00:04:11.340> fun<00:04:11.670> support<00:04:12.090> champion

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
going to be a very fun support champion

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.360 
going to be a very fun support champion
to<00:04:12.480> play<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:13.080> synergize<00:04:13.680> well<00:04:13.950> with<00:04:14.100> a<00:04:14.130> lot<00:04:14.340> of

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
to play to synergize well with a lot of

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.610 
to play to synergize well with a lot of
items<00:04:14.700> but<00:04:15.360> I<00:04:15.390> imagine<00:04:15.780> she'll<00:04:15.989> get<00:04:16.140> banned<00:04:16.440> a

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
items but I imagine she'll get banned a

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.470 
items but I imagine she'll get banned a
lot<00:04:16.830> inch<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.609> doesn't<00:04:18.000> look<00:04:18.060> like<00:04:18.120> she<00:04:18.359> has

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
lot inch it doesn't look like she has

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.930 
lot inch it doesn't look like she has
very<00:04:18.600> many<00:04:18.810> escape<00:04:19.140> mechanisms<00:04:19.940> mechanisms

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
very many escape mechanisms mechanisms

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.760 
very many escape mechanisms mechanisms
outside<00:04:21.450> of<00:04:21.570> song<00:04:21.780> as<00:04:21.930> hilarity<00:04:22.350> so<00:04:22.560> should<00:04:22.710> I

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
outside of song as hilarity so should I

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.040 
outside of song as hilarity so should I
met<00:04:22.950> she'll<00:04:23.310> probably<00:04:23.700> be<00:04:23.910> very<00:04:24.210> easy<00:04:24.510> to<00:04:24.750> shut

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
met she'll probably be very easy to shut

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.200 
met she'll probably be very easy to shut
down<00:04:25.080> if<00:04:25.620> you<00:04:26.370> gank<00:04:26.669> a

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
down if you gank a

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.870 
down if you gank a
brettly<00:04:27.870> and<00:04:28.280> i<00:04:29.280> think<00:04:29.490> that's<00:04:29.639> about<00:04:29.729> it

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
brettly and i think that's about it

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.969 
brettly and i think that's about it
we're<00:04:30.509> gonna<00:04:30.600> hope<00:04:30.960> that<00:04:31.259> this<00:04:31.560> one<00:04:31.770> works
