photos by just want to play around with
it<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.279> little<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:22.250> let<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.640> see<00:00:23.970> how<00:00:24.810> we<00:00:24.869> can

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
it a little and let you see how we can

it a little and let you see how we can
do<00:00:25.439> some<00:00:26.210> detail<00:00:27.260> enhancement<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:29.269> photo

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
do some detail enhancement on a photo

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.370 
do some detail enhancement on a photo
and<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.650> let's<00:00:32.219> get<00:00:32.460> started<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.180> let's<00:00:33.660> see

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
and so let's get started and let's see

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.069 
and so let's get started and let's see
what<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.250> will<00:00:35.550> make<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.480> random

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
what this will make of this random

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.880 
what this will make of this random
street<00:00:37.649> shot<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.250> choose<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:40.170> we

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
start with making a copy of our layer

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.500 
start with making a copy of our layer
with<00:00:44.700> ctrl<00:00:45.329> J<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.930> then<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:46.980> are<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:48.210> hit

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
with ctrl J and then we are going to hit

ctrl I to in verse that layer after we
did<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:55.170> go<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.500> set<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:59.899> layer<00:01:00.899> style<00:01:01.590> of

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:15.170 

and<00:01:09.110> then<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.320> go<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.479> filters<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:14.180> we

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
and then we go to the filters and we

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
and then we go to the filters and we
shoes<00:01:15.920> blur<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.369> here<00:01:17.790> we<00:01:17.850> go<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.200> surface

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
shoes blur and here we go to surface

image<00:01:35.759> we<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.180> created<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:38.060> throw

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
image we just created so we can throw

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.660 
image we just created so we can throw
away<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.659> layer<00:01:39.930> we<00:01:40.500> first<00:01:40.860> created<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.640> that

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
away the layer we first created so that

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.819 
away the layer we first created so that
you<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.479> know<00:01:42.659> layer<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.619> can

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
you have you know layer to you can

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.340 
you have you know layer to you can
rename<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.549> however<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.149> want<00:01:45.420> no<00:01:45.750> problem<00:01:46.229> at

rename it however you want no problem at

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.179 
rename it however you want no problem at
all<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:49.130> we<00:01:50.130> want<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.939> turn<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:52.189> ctrl

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
all and we want to turn this with ctrl

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.719 
all and we want to turn this with ctrl
shift<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.619> into<00:01:55.619> black<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.860> white<00:01:56.159> get

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
shift and you into black and white get

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.679 
shift and you into black and white get
the<00:01:57.000> color<00:01:57.450> out<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:59.119> the<00:02:00.119> next<00:02:00.479> step<00:02:00.630> is

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
the color out of this the next step is

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:07.180 
the color out of this the next step is
we<00:02:00.990> go<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.250> filters<00:02:02.630> blur<00:02:05.060> Gaussian<00:02:06.060> blur<00:02:06.360> and

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
we go to filters blur Gaussian blur and

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.880 
we go to filters blur Gaussian blur and
then<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.459> have<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.330> have<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.539> look

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:23.600 

think<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.640> we<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:16.020> do<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:22.340> keep<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.460> at

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
think that we can do it I keep it at

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:31.400 
think that we can do it I keep it at
three<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.980> then<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.100> say<00:02:26.370> okay<00:02:30.020> what<00:02:31.020> we<00:02:31.290> have

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
three and then I say okay what we have

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.090 
three and then I say okay what we have
to<00:02:31.590> do<00:02:31.800> now<00:02:31.830> is<00:02:32.070> going<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.690> layer<00:02:34.590> mode<00:02:34.890> of

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
to do now is going to the layer mode of

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:43.120 
to do now is going to the layer mode of
this<00:02:35.370> layer<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:37.040> then<00:02:38.040> we<00:02:38.370> going<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:40.370> choose

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
this layer and then we going to choose

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.770 
this layer and then we going to choose
soft<00:02:44.130> light<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:45.650> this<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.950> result<00:02:47.130> of

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
soft light and this is the result of

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.860 
soft light and this is the result of
this<00:02:50.150> whole<00:02:51.500> image<00:02:52.500> thing<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.330> let's<00:02:54.330> have<00:02:54.570> a

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
this whole image thing so let's have a

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.500 
this whole image thing so let's have a
little<00:02:55.670> comparison<00:03:00.320> so<00:03:01.320> here<00:03:01.680> we<00:03:01.709> have<00:03:01.860> T<00:03:02.250> to

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
little comparison so here we have T to

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.250 
little comparison so here we have T to
results<00:03:03.510> besides<00:03:04.640> beside<00:03:05.640> each<00:03:05.850> other<00:03:06.260> before

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
results besides beside each other before

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.360 
results besides beside each other before
and<00:03:07.820> after<00:03:08.820> adding<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:11.690> detailed

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
and after adding this detailed

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.850 
and after adding this detailed
enhancements<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:17.630> choose<00:03:18.630> for<00:03:18.840> yourself<00:03:19.200> the
