the TV if you do not see a light in the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.749 
the TV if you do not see a light in the
front<00:01:21.210> then<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.750> do<00:01:21.900> not<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.290> standby<00:01:22.770> if

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
front then you do not have standby if

have<00:01:26.400> standby<00:01:27.030> then<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.689> problem<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.229> most

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
have standby then the problem is most

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.920 
have standby then the problem is most
likely<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.250> either<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.729> power<00:01:29.939> supply<00:01:30.450> or

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
likely with either the power supply or

look at the bottom side of the board you

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.740 
look at the bottom side of the board you
would<00:02:22.890> simply<00:02:23.280> just<00:02:23.310> need<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.910> disconnect<00:02:24.390> all

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
would simply just need to disconnect all

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.020 
would simply just need to disconnect all
the<00:02:24.810> cables<00:02:25.349> and<00:02:25.590> then<00:02:26.160> remove<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.520> screws

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030

when disconnecting cables and removing
screws<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.489> you<00:02:32.610> take<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.819> picture<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.480> what

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
screws that you take a picture of what

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.780 
screws that you take a picture of what
the<00:02:34.080> board<00:02:34.350> looks<00:02:34.590> like<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.280> original

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
the board looks like in the original

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.699 
the board looks like in the original
state<00:02:36.030> with<00:02:36.270> all<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.569> cables<00:02:36.959> connected<00:02:37.530> and

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
state with all the cables connected and

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.680 
state with all the cables connected and
then<00:02:38.280> you'll<00:02:38.430> have<00:02:38.550> a<00:02:38.610> reference<00:02:38.910> for<00:02:39.540> when

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
then you'll have a reference for when

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.470 
then you'll have a reference for when
you<00:02:39.810> reconnect<00:02:40.440> all<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.980> cables<00:02:41.370> here<00:02:42.300> is<00:02:42.450> a

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
you reconnect all the cables here is a

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.690 
you reconnect all the cables here is a
close-up<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.260> main<00:02:43.440> board<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:44.370> can<00:02:44.550> look

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
close-up of the main board you can look

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.100 
close-up of the main board you can look
over<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:45.060> board<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.480> do<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.690> visual

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
over the board and do a visual

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.620 
over the board and do a visual
inspection<00:02:46.170> again<00:02:47.100> looking<00:02:47.850> for<00:02:48.030> any<00:02:48.120> damaged

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
inspection again looking for any damaged

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.080 
inspection again looking for any damaged
components<00:02:48.720> if<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:50.310> have<00:02:50.519> any<00:02:50.700> damaged

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
components if you have any damaged

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.880 
components if you have any damaged
components<00:02:51.120> then<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.110> should<00:02:52.260> replace<00:02:52.590> that

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
components then you should replace that

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.120 
components then you should replace that
board<00:02:53.250> if<00:02:53.989> you<00:02:54.989> do<00:02:55.140> not<00:02:55.319> see<00:02:55.560> any<00:02:55.709> damaged

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.130 
board if you do not see any damaged
components<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.970> next<00:02:57.269> step<00:02:57.480> would<00:02:57.930> be<00:02:57.989> to

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
components the next step would be to

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.440 
components the next step would be to
check<00:02:58.290> voltages<00:02:58.680> on<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.549> power<00:02:59.760> supply<00:03:00.239> and
