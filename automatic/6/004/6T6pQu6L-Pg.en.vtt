00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
wood bracelet and this I actually found

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.810 
wood bracelet and this I actually found
in<00:00:55.080> the<00:00:55.110> studio<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.920> one<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.580> the<00:00:56.700> other

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
in the studio that one of the other

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.810 
in the studio that one of the other
designers<00:00:57.680> must<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.890> been<00:00:59.100> creating<00:00:59.700> at

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
designers must have been creating at

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.180 
designers must have been creating at
some<00:01:00.060> point<00:01:00.329> but<00:01:00.480> they<00:01:00.630> never<00:01:00.810> finished<00:01:01.290> it<00:01:01.590> so

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
some point but they never finished it so

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.009 
some point but they never finished it so
I<00:01:02.550> thought<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.270> would<00:01:03.450> be<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> great<00:01:03.810> way<00:01:03.990> to

I thought this would be a great way to

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.399 
I thought this would be a great way to
show<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.379> how<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:05.189> upcycle<00:01:05.700> other

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
together because they will separate as

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.020 
together because they will separate as

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
earrings to the same shape we're going

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.219 
earrings to the same shape we're going
to<00:04:45.530> go<00:04:45.650> ahead<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:46.070> start<00:04:46.340> wrapping<00:04:46.639> our<00:04:47.360> first

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
to go ahead and start wrapping our first

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.740 
to go ahead and start wrapping our first
earring<00:04:48.650> and<00:04:48.860> I<00:04:49.490> leave<00:04:49.669> a<00:04:49.699> little<00:04:49.940> tail<00:04:50.270> on<00:04:50.300> my

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
earring and I leave a little tail on my

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.400 
earring and I leave a little tail on my
yarn<00:04:51.050> and<00:04:51.490> put<00:04:52.490> that<00:04:52.639> up<00:04:52.880> towards<00:04:53.330> the<00:04:53.539> top<00:04:53.570> and

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
yarn and put that up towards the top and

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.100 
yarn and put that up towards the top and
then<00:04:55.340> you<00:04:55.490> just<00:04:55.759> start<00:04:56.060> wrapping<00:04:56.419> and<00:04:56.930> each

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
then you just start wrapping and each

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.700 
then you just start wrapping and each
time<00:04:57.410> you<00:04:57.560> wrap<00:04:57.770> around<00:04:57.800> you're<00:04:58.400> going<00:04:58.610> to

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
time you wrap around you're going to

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.760 
time you wrap around you're going to
just<00:05:00.710> tuck<00:05:01.070> that<00:05:01.100> yarn<00:05:01.760> into<00:05:02.750> one<00:05:03.440> of<00:05:03.590> those

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
just tuck that yarn into one of those

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.540 
just tuck that yarn into one of those
coils<00:05:05.260> now<00:05:06.260> it<00:05:06.350> doesn't<00:05:06.560> matter<00:05:06.889> if<00:05:07.100> the<00:05:07.280> yarn

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
coils now it doesn't matter if the yarn

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.110 
coils now it doesn't matter if the yarn
splits<00:05:08.389> at<00:05:09.289> this<00:05:09.590> point<00:05:09.949> just<00:05:10.490> be<00:05:10.699> sure<00:05:10.940> that

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
splits at this point just be sure that

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.680 
splits at this point just be sure that
you<00:05:11.180> have<00:05:11.210> a<00:05:11.419> solid<00:05:11.870> coverage<00:05:12.740> of<00:05:13.070> yarn<00:05:13.789> also

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
you have a solid coverage of yarn also

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.930 
you have a solid coverage of yarn also
sometimes<00:05:15.110> I'll<00:05:15.440> go<00:05:15.680> back<00:05:15.979> into<00:05:16.430> the<00:05:16.699> same

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
sometimes I'll go back into the same

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.469 
sometimes I'll go back into the same
coil<00:05:17.389> if<00:05:17.750> it<00:05:18.710> looks<00:05:19.070> like<00:05:19.160> my<00:05:19.669> yarn<00:05:20.030> is

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
coil if it looks like my yarn is

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.320 
coil if it looks like my yarn is
starting<00:05:20.900> to<00:05:21.080> go<00:05:21.260> crooked<00:05:21.889> just<00:05:22.669> double<00:05:23.060> it<00:05:23.150> up

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
starting to go crooked just double it up

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.480 
starting to go crooked just double it up
so<00:05:23.570> that<00:05:23.599> you<00:05:23.810> have<00:05:23.990> a<00:05:24.020> straight<00:05:24.470> line<00:05:24.530> of<00:05:25.160> yarn

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
so that you have a straight line of yarn

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.200 
so that you have a straight line of yarn
all<00:05:25.910> the<00:05:26.120> way<00:05:26.270> down<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:27.229> center<00:05:27.910> so<00:05:28.910> keep

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
all the way down the center so keep

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.980 
all the way down the center so keep
wrapping<00:05:29.780> until<00:05:30.020> you<00:05:30.740> reach<00:05:30.919> the<00:05:31.160> bottom<00:05:31.550> as<00:05:31.990> I

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
wrapping until you reach the bottom as I

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.779 
wrapping until you reach the bottom as I
explained<00:05:33.500> when<00:05:33.919> you<00:05:34.039> are<00:05:34.160> wrapping<00:05:34.639> your

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
explained when you are wrapping your

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:37.210 
explained when you are wrapping your
yarn<00:05:35.090> down<00:05:35.449> you<00:05:36.020> can<00:05:36.229> see<00:05:36.410> that<00:05:36.590> it<00:05:36.710> turns<00:05:36.949> into

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
yarn down you can see that it turns into

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.969 
yarn down you can see that it turns into
more<00:05:37.550> of<00:05:37.610> a<00:05:37.849> teardrop<00:05:38.380> from<00:05:39.380> its<00:05:39.650> initial

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
more of a teardrop from its initial

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.580 
more of a teardrop from its initial
petal<00:05:40.699> shape<00:05:41.000> so<00:05:41.360> keep<00:05:41.630> that<00:05:41.810> in<00:05:41.930> mind<00:05:42.139> when

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
petal shape so keep that in mind when

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.950 
petal shape so keep that in mind when
you're<00:05:42.710> deciding<00:05:43.159> what<00:05:43.280> shape<00:05:43.550> that<00:05:43.729> you<00:05:43.849> want

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
you're deciding what shape that you want

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.210 
you're deciding what shape that you want
now<00:05:44.960> that<00:05:45.169> I've<00:05:45.260> reached<00:05:45.409> the<00:05:45.620> bottom<00:05:45.770> I'm

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
now that I've reached the bottom I'm

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.320 
now that I've reached the bottom I'm
going<00:05:46.669> to<00:05:46.849> loop<00:05:47.210> it<00:05:48.130> into<00:05:49.130> the<00:05:49.340> very<00:05:49.880> bottom

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
going to loop it into the very bottom

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.310 
going to loop it into the very bottom
coil<00:05:50.979> and<00:05:52.180> then<00:05:53.180> I'll<00:05:53.360> just<00:05:53.539> bring<00:05:53.720> the<00:05:53.870> excess

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
coil and then I'll just bring the excess

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.899 
coil and then I'll just bring the excess
up<00:05:54.590> the<00:05:54.770> back<00:05:54.979> now<00:05:55.789> if<00:05:56.060> you<00:05:56.210> have<00:05:56.479> a<00:05:56.750> large

up the back now if you have a large
needle<00:05:58.909> you<00:05:59.419> could<00:05:59.690> thread<00:05:59.990> this<00:06:00.139> through<00:06:00.380> and

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
needle you could thread this through and

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.200 
needle you could thread this through and
actually<00:06:00.680> stitch<00:06:01.310> it<00:06:01.490> right<00:06:01.520> through<00:06:02.030> the

actually stitch it right through the

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.810 
actually stitch it right through the
center<00:06:02.419> or<00:06:02.870> I'm<00:06:03.409> just<00:06:03.440> going<00:06:03.770> to<00:06:03.800> use<00:06:04.039> my<00:06:04.280> turbo

back<00:06:11.169> when<00:06:12.169> you<00:06:12.260> reach<00:06:12.409> the<00:06:12.680> top<00:06:13.150> you<00:06:14.150> can<00:06:14.389> wrap

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
back when you reach the top you can wrap

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.439 
back when you reach the top you can wrap
that<00:06:14.990> piece<00:06:15.680> around<00:06:16.070> a<00:06:16.310> couple<00:06:16.520> of<00:06:16.760> times<00:06:17.060> and

that piece around a couple of times and

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.140 
that piece around a couple of times and
then<00:06:17.690> you're<00:06:17.840> going<00:06:17.930> to<00:06:17.990> tie<00:06:18.380> it<00:06:18.639> back<00:06:19.639> with

then you're going to tie it back with
the<00:06:20.659> end<00:06:21.110> of<00:06:21.590> the<00:06:21.770> first<00:06:22.360> piece<00:06:23.360> here<00:06:23.900> and<00:06:24.199> just

wire<00:06:28.159> I<00:06:29.080> also<00:06:30.080> like<00:06:30.380> to<00:06:30.530> put<00:06:30.680> another<00:06:30.889> little

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
wire I also like to put another little

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:38.820 
dab of my aleene's turbo tacky in that
knot<00:06:34.400> so<00:06:34.760> it<00:06:34.909> holds<00:06:35.210> very<00:06:35.779> firmly

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.049

00:06:41.049 --> 00:06:41.059 
when the glue is dry then you can cut

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:43.779 
when the glue is dry then you can cut
off<00:06:41.240> these<00:06:41.509> ends<00:06:42.039> keep<00:06:43.039> in<00:06:43.219> mind<00:06:43.429> when<00:06:43.639> you're

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:46.359 
off these ends keep in mind when you're
using<00:06:43.819> variegated<00:06:44.749> colored<00:06:45.139> yarn<00:06:45.469> that<00:06:45.949> you

using variegated colored yarn that you

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:48.399 
using variegated colored yarn that you
will<00:06:46.849> get<00:06:47.089> two<00:06:47.360> different<00:06:47.749> colored<00:06:48.020> earrings

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:48.409
