00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.069
 the savage 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.089
 dear batista70phone friends today vi 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.609
 I present an unboxing of a product 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:24.779
 much anticipated or the galaxy s 4 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:29.820
 this is the black distribution version 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:33.210
 from April 27th and then this one 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.540
 coloring in particular that I have chosen 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.500
 on purpose because the white but more not me 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.540
 here it was, here we begin to see the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.180
 so what package does it contain we have 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.680
 the galaxy s 4 that we now put one 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.750
 part obviously his begin at 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.260
 arrive notifications we continue to 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.820
 open we have next year beds 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.530
 destruction 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:02.780
 we have the micro usb usb cable we have 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.549
 the power supply with this side socket 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:11.250
 we have headphones in ear with this 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:16.650
 new flat type cable is clearly 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:23.759
 even with the small controller e 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:27.990
 we have replacement rubber pads for the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:31.680
 headphones then I wanted to give you mine too 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.619
 impressions after almost a day of 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.759
 use of the device that maybe they are 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:42.060
 most important of a thousand characteristics 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.890
 so meanwhile I have to say that I do 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.729
 I was expecting a greater resemblance 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.090
 compared to axis 3 instead I noticed 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.210
 different differences hardware solutions a 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.210
 little 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.660
 different than what was the 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.200
 previous too wide range of samsung 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.380
 then meanwhile the design was a bit 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.520
 revised we are a little back almost to a s 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.070
 ii as a more squared line 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.810
 definitely the side girl like 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.760
 see you walk with it 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.870
 size all the edge of the phone 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.320
 in all of them the sides is something else 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.620
 which I have always noticed doing an excursus 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.230
 on the hardware side the button 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.450
 stand by and has grown so it's more 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.650
 large and wider as a button 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.180
 respect first and even a little more 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.730
 resistant so you have to do one 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.040
 pressure slightly higher than 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.930
 to them 3 1 2 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.980
 the premise is that I arrive from all over the world 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.370
 family al galaxy so ss2 not 1 s 38 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.500
 2 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.590
 so I can tell you a little 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.380
 impressions from samsung of st 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.630
 so let's put it in the upper part we have 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.840
 the novelty of the infrared sensor that 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.600
 this in addition to the second microphone at 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.940
 headphone jack on the left side 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.260
 as you can see we have the usual barbell 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:14.220
 of the volume and in the lower part which is the 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.450
 microphone and classic USB socket 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.890
 we see 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.930
 what struck me most in this in 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.730
 this day of use 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.420
 then surely the first thing 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:32.750
 the eye is really the display 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:37.600
 really nice a full hd 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:41.270
 with a truly fantastic rendition not 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.450
 you know nothing to say and myself 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:48.650
 comes from a known two so not from 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:53.720
 base band the fluidity clearly to 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:56.959
 excellent levels are not there are not 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.250
 teething there is no lake or at least 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:03.709
 there are not large obvious at least 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:07.010
 so far I haven't seen the software 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.410
 I must say that it has been improved not 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.640
 revolutionized but has improved in many 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.620
 this is not the case in many small aspects 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.100
 this is the place to make an examination of 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:24.650
 all s4 software is used to 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:27.340
 a s312 will see several small ones 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:32.800
 differences 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:35.830
 starting from sensor management 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.830
 passing to 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.660
 other things other typical features 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.240
 in short, being things that have been 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.139
 implemented on this version of 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.139
 TouchWiz 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:56.620
 enough to say my advice 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.880
 advice is to look carefully at the version 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.950
 white the black version because less 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.139
 which is not really for fans 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.750
 in my opinion the white version 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:11.710
 black is really much more accurate 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:15.389
 it has a really very under texture 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.389
 very beautiful e 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.550
 this dark blue with the display also 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.370
 off contrasts a lot 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.010
 better second but compared to la 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.680
 white version 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:33.250
 now the question is better this or better 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.580
 htc one to answer I will do another 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.580
 focus
