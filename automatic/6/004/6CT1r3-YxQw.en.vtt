00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.930 
enjoyed it and it was kind of a
different<00:00:08.950> thing<00:00:08.980> that<00:00:09.309> I<00:00:09.339> normally<00:00:09.730> do<00:00:09.910> and

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:11.919 
because of that I felt like it would be

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:14.310 
because of that I felt like it would be
cool<00:00:12.190> to<00:00:12.219> kind<00:00:12.549> of<00:00:12.750> write<00:00:13.750> since<00:00:13.990> I<00:00:14.080> just

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.509 
finished doing it I want to do kind of a
walk<00:00:16.779> through<00:00:17.019> what<00:00:17.350> exactly<00:00:17.769> I<00:00:17.830> did<00:00:18.100> and<00:00:18.369> what

to talk about a few other things first I

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.479 
to talk about a few other things first I
am<00:00:41.260> using<00:00:41.500> Logic<00:00:42.250> Pro<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:43.329> record<00:00:43.809> this<00:00:43.930> and

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
am using Logic Pro to record this and

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.889 
am using Logic Pro to record this and
I'm<00:00:45.489> using<00:00:45.730> it<00:00:45.879> right<00:00:46.000> now<00:00:46.059> to<00:00:46.210> record<00:00:46.719> this

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
I'm using it right now to record this

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.900 
I'm using it right now to record this
audio<00:00:47.230> so<00:00:47.440> I<00:00:47.469> can't<00:00:47.710> really<00:00:47.949> like<00:00:48.100> dive<00:00:48.640> in<00:00:48.789> and

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
audio so I can't really like dive in and

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.479 
audio so I can't really like dive in and
show<00:00:49.149> you<00:00:49.210> what's<00:00:49.570> going<00:00:49.780> on<00:00:49.840> but<00:00:50.079> I<00:00:50.860> had

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
show you what's going on but I had

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.729 
show you what's going on but I had
mapped<00:00:51.760> out<00:00:52.030> that<00:00:52.359> drum<00:00:52.690> part<00:00:52.989> first<00:00:53.350> so<00:00:53.590> I<00:00:53.620> was

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
mapped out that drum part first so I was

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.459 
mapped out that drum part first so I was
actually<00:00:53.829> playing<00:00:54.309> to<00:00:54.489> that<00:00:54.640> drum<00:00:54.910> part<00:00:55.120> and

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
actually playing to that drum part and

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.950 
actually playing to that drum part and
one<00:00:56.469> of<00:00:56.590> the<00:00:56.680> cool<00:00:56.859> things<00:00:57.160> that<00:00:57.280> I<00:00:57.370> did<00:00:57.730> was<00:00:57.969> I

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
one of the cool things that I did was I

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.299 
one of the cool things that I did was I
don't<00:00:59.350> know<00:00:59.440> if<00:00:59.500> you<00:00:59.590> can<00:00:59.710> see<00:00:59.920> in<00:01:00.039> the<00:01:00.100> shot

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
don't know if you can see in the shot

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.250 
don't know if you can see in the shot
this<00:01:00.579> little<00:01:01.559> MIDI<00:01:02.640> USB<00:01:03.640> MIDI<00:01:03.879> hub<00:01:04.540> thing<00:01:04.960> and

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
this little MIDI USB MIDI hub thing and

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.770 
this little MIDI USB MIDI hub thing and
I<00:01:05.770> used<00:01:05.980> it<00:01:06.190> to<00:01:06.400> send<00:01:06.640> a<00:01:06.730> clock<00:01:06.970> signal<00:01:07.270> to<00:01:07.630> my

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
I used it to send a clock signal to my

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.740 
I used it to send a clock signal to my
looper<00:01:08.200> so<00:01:08.470> as<00:01:08.800> I<00:01:09.310> was<00:01:09.490> recording<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:10.210> song<00:01:10.450> I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
looper so as I was recording the song I

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.230 
looper so as I was recording the song I
was<00:01:11.680> hearing<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.250> drum<00:01:12.460> track<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:12.910> the<00:01:13.000> click

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
was hearing the drum track and the click

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.930 
was hearing the drum track and the click
obviously<00:01:13.980> and<00:01:14.980> I<00:01:15.160> was<00:01:15.190> getting<00:01:15.550> a<00:01:15.580> signal

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
obviously and I was getting a signal

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.640 
obviously and I was getting a signal
sent<00:01:16.150> to<00:01:16.270> my<00:01:16.360> looper<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:16.810> that<00:01:17.050> was<00:01:17.230> keeping

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
sent to my looper and that was keeping

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.680 
sent to my looper and that was keeping
my<00:01:17.770> looper<00:01:18.160> in<00:01:18.280> time<00:01:18.460> so<00:01:18.700> that<00:01:18.850> first<00:01:19.090> loop<00:01:19.360> and

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
my looper in time so that first loop and

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.260 
my looper in time so that first loop and
there's<00:01:19.930> three<00:01:20.110> different<00:01:20.200> loops<00:01:20.560> I<00:01:20.740> did<00:01:20.920> but

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
there's three different loops I did but

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.580 
there's three different loops I did but
that's<00:01:22.270> how<00:01:22.480> they<00:01:22.660> all<00:01:22.750> were<00:01:22.960> able<00:01:23.230> to<00:01:23.260> stay<00:01:23.560> in

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
that's how they all were able to stay in

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.650 
that's how they all were able to stay in
time<00:01:24.010> the<00:01:24.310> whole<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:25.150> whole<00:01:25.270> time<00:01:25.450> through

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
time the whole the whole time through

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.020 
time the whole the whole time through
and<00:01:25.960> I<00:01:26.770> thought<00:01:27.370> that<00:01:27.520> was<00:01:27.610> pretty<00:01:27.730> cool<00:01:27.880> had

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
and I thought that was pretty cool had

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.060 
and I thought that was pretty cool had
never<00:01:28.210> done<00:01:28.330> that<00:01:28.480> before<00:01:28.810> with<00:01:29.410> logic<00:01:29.800> anyway

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
never done that before with logic anyway

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.620 
never done that before with logic anyway
so<00:01:30.370> um<00:01:31.410> and<00:01:32.410> that<00:01:32.770> was<00:01:32.800> with<00:01:33.420> what<00:01:34.420> did<00:01:34.480> I<00:01:34.600> use

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
so um and that was with what did I use

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.890 
so um and that was with what did I use
Native<00:01:35.110> Instruments<00:01:36.420> what<00:01:37.420> is<00:01:37.540> it<00:01:37.660> called

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900

use<00:01:46.120> this<00:01:46.360> guy<00:01:46.570> which<00:01:46.810> is<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:47.460> fender<00:01:48.460> rode<00:01:48.910> worn

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
use this guy which is a fender rode worn

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.860 
use this guy which is a fender rode worn
jazz<00:01:49.780> bass<00:01:50.850> which<00:01:51.850> is<00:01:51.970> cool<00:01:52.240> I<00:01:52.450> actually

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
jazz bass which is cool I actually

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.230 
jazz bass which is cool I actually
recorded<00:01:53.440> scratch<00:01:53.800> bass<00:01:54.160> first<00:01:54.490> then

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
recorded scratch bass first then

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.810 
recorded scratch bass first then
recorded<00:01:55.870> the<00:01:56.080> guitar<00:01:56.440> loop<00:01:56.710> stuff<00:01:57.100> then<00:01:57.580> went

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
recorded the guitar loop stuff then went

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.770 
recorded the guitar loop stuff then went
back<00:01:57.940> and<00:01:58.150> recorded<00:01:58.690> like<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:59.110> real<00:01:59.320> bass<00:02:00.780> so

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
back and recorded like the real bass so

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.750 
back and recorded like the real bass so
that's<00:02:02.560> how<00:02:02.710> that<00:02:02.770> worked<00:02:03.100> anyway

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
that's how that worked anyway

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.940 
that's how that worked anyway
now<00:02:04.240> let's<00:02:05.140> talk<00:02:05.290> about<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.560> pedals<00:02:05.800> real

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
now let's talk about the pedals real

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.910 
now let's talk about the pedals real
quick<00:02:06.100> okay<00:02:06.400> here<00:02:06.730> we<00:02:06.820> go<00:02:07.229> alright<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:08.590> here's

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
quick okay here we go alright so here's

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.430 
quick okay here we go alright so here's
the<00:02:08.979> pedals<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:10.780> can<00:02:10.869> see<00:02:10.990> it<00:02:11.050> has<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.170> bunch<00:02:11.320> of

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
the pedals you can see it has a bunch of

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.220 
the pedals you can see it has a bunch of
crap

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
crap

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.130 
crap
my<00:02:12.709> boomerang<00:02:13.069> here<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.610> looper<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:15.050> I

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
my boomerang here is the looper and I

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.509 
my boomerang here is the looper and I
guess<00:02:15.319> I'll<00:02:15.500> just<00:02:15.590> start<00:02:15.890> with<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.190> way<00:02:16.340> the

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
guess I'll just start with the way the

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.940 
guess I'll just start with the way the
song<00:02:16.760> went<00:02:17.209> so<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.920> start<00:02:19.250> off<00:02:19.489> all<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.060> had<00:02:20.510> was

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
song went so to start off all I had was

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.009 
song went so to start off all I had was
clean<00:02:21.950> sound<00:02:22.310> with<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.849> carbon<00:02:23.390> copy<00:02:23.720> on<00:02:23.810> so

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
clean sound with the carbon copy on so

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.740 
clean sound with the carbon copy on so
that<00:02:24.170> was<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.470> first<00:02:24.709> little<00:02:25.160> uh<00:02:25.720> yeah<00:02:26.720> a

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
that was that first little uh yeah a

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.509 
that was that first little uh yeah a
little<00:02:26.870> it's<00:02:27.590> an<00:02:27.709> acoustic<00:02:27.920> guitar<00:02:28.129> on<00:02:28.430> the

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
little it's an acoustic guitar on the

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:34.120 
little it's an acoustic guitar on the
actual<00:02:28.760> song<00:02:29.000> but<00:02:29.269> it<00:02:29.360> sounds<00:02:29.569> like<00:02:29.599> this<00:02:33.130> so

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
actual song but it sounds like this so

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.820 
actual song but it sounds like this so
that's<00:02:34.250> just<00:02:34.489> a<00:02:34.640> carbon<00:02:34.880> copy<00:02:35.120> on<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:36.110> then<00:02:36.800> I

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
that's just a carbon copy on and then I

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.289 
that's just a carbon copy on and then I
put<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:37.370> in<00:02:37.670> loop<00:02:37.849> 3<00:02:38.239> which<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.910> that<00:02:41.150> one

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
put that in loop 3 which is that one

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.720 
put that in loop 3 which is that one
right<00:02:41.450> there<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:42.349> I<00:02:43.129> don't<00:02:43.190> know<00:02:43.280> if<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:43.519> care

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
right there and I don't know if you care

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.820 
right there and I don't know if you care
go<00:02:43.940> into<00:02:44.120> details<00:02:44.510> of<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.750> boomerang<00:02:45.110> but<00:02:45.349> I'm

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
go into details of the boomerang but I'm

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.820 
go into details of the boomerang but I'm
in<00:02:47.530> sync

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
in sync

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.250 
in sync
no<00:02:49.190> I'm<00:02:49.340> in<00:02:49.370> free<00:02:49.760> mode<00:02:50.030> but<00:02:50.930> it's<00:02:51.079> still

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
no I'm in free mode but it's still

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.520 
no I'm in free mode but it's still
syncing<00:02:51.650> up<00:02:51.799> so<00:02:52.040> when<00:02:52.489> I<00:02:52.519> moved<00:02:52.819> to<00:02:52.910> free<00:02:53.209> mode

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
syncing up so when I moved to free mode

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.229 
syncing up so when I moved to free mode
you<00:02:54.530> have<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.799> start<00:02:55.190> with<00:02:55.280> loop<00:02:55.519> 3<00:02:55.849> in<00:02:56.090> order

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
you have to start with loop 3 in order

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.140 
you have to start with loop 3 in order
to<00:02:56.420> keep<00:02:56.599> all<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.959> other<00:02:57.110> loops<00:02:57.349> in<00:02:57.590> sync<00:02:57.890> so

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
to keep all the other loops in sync so

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.400 
to keep all the other loops in sync so
you<00:02:59.150> can<00:02:59.269> do<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.420> play<00:02:59.989> all<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.200> loops

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
you can do a play all the loops

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.780 
you can do a play all the loops
simultaneously<00:03:01.130> which<00:03:01.250> is<00:03:01.370> what<00:03:01.489> I<00:03:01.549> want<00:03:01.700> but

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
simultaneously which is what I want but

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.100 
simultaneously which is what I want but
they<00:03:01.880> will<00:03:02.030> also<00:03:02.150> stay<00:03:02.450> in<00:03:02.480> sync<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:02.959> that's

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
they will also stay in sync so that's

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
they will also stay in sync so that's
how<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.590> had<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.280> set<00:03:04.579> that<00:03:04.730> up<00:03:04.790> so<00:03:05.860> once<00:03:06.860> I<00:03:06.980> got

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
how I had to set that up so once I got

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.120 
how I had to set that up so once I got
that<00:03:07.280> first<00:03:07.489> loop<00:03:07.760> going<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.980> turned<00:03:09.980> on<00:03:10.099> a

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
that first loop going I turned on a

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.589 
that first loop going I turned on a
bunch<00:03:10.370> of<00:03:10.459> pedals

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
bunch of pedals

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.100 
bunch of pedals
the<00:03:12.940> first<00:03:13.940> well<00:03:14.329> one<00:03:14.540> of<00:03:14.599> the<00:03:14.660> more<00:03:14.810> important

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
the first well one of the more important

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.569 
the first well one of the more important
ones<00:03:15.260> being<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.530> bit<00:03:15.799> commander<00:03:16.280> from

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
ones being the bit commander from

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.340 
ones being the bit commander from
Earthquaker<00:03:17.180> devices<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:17.959> is<00:03:18.139> what

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
Earthquaker devices and this is what

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.960 
Earthquaker devices and this is what
this<00:03:18.859> is<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.100> pedal<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:19.519> kind<00:03:19.730> of<00:03:19.790> like

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
this is the pedal that kind of like

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.140 
this is the pedal that kind of like
inspired<00:03:20.329> me<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:20.930> do<00:03:21.079> this<00:03:21.200> cover<00:03:21.850> this<00:03:22.850> and

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
inspired me to do this cover this and

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.259 
inspired me to do this cover this and
one<00:03:23.660> other<00:03:23.840> one<00:03:24.139> but<00:03:24.350> it's<00:03:24.560> uh<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.400> don't<00:03:26.150> know

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
one other one but it's uh I don't know

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.340 
one other one but it's uh I don't know
how<00:03:26.359> to<00:03:26.450> describe<00:03:26.569> it<00:03:26.840> it's<00:03:26.959> got<00:03:27.079> four

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
how to describe it it's got four

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.430 
how to describe it it's got four
different<00:03:27.829> like<00:03:28.180> synth<00:03:29.180> type<00:03:29.870> sounds<00:03:30.319> and

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
different like synth type sounds and

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.349 
different like synth type sounds and
this<00:03:30.560> is<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:30.889> sound<00:03:31.130> without<00:03:31.489> any<00:03:31.850> other<00:03:32.060> crap

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
this is the sound without any other crap

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:42.339 
this is the sound without any other crap
on<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:32.840> sounds<00:03:33.799> like<00:03:33.920> this

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.709 

so<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:43.069> carbon<00:03:43.280> copy<00:03:43.549> I<00:03:43.700> left<00:03:43.939> on<00:03:44.150> it<00:03:44.420> gives<00:03:44.569> it

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:44.719 
so the carbon copy I left on it gives it

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.319 
so the carbon copy I left on it gives it
kind<00:03:44.930> of<00:03:44.989> that<00:03:45.140> wash<00:03:45.620> enos<00:03:46.010> but<00:03:46.310> uh<00:03:46.340> so<00:03:47.180> that's

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
kind of that wash enos but uh so that's

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.819 
kind of that wash enos but uh so that's
kind<00:03:47.689> of<00:03:47.749> the<00:03:47.930> that's<00:03:48.109> the<00:03:48.290> sound<00:03:48.469> I<00:03:48.590> got<00:03:48.709> from

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
kind of the that's the sound I got from

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.440 
kind of the that's the sound I got from
the<00:03:48.920> bit<00:03:49.069> commander<00:03:49.519> and<00:03:49.700> as<00:03:49.849> I<00:03:50.060> was<00:03:50.180> playing

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
the bit commander and as I was playing

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.959 
the bit commander and as I was playing
with<00:03:50.510> that<00:03:50.629> I<00:03:51.430> thought<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:52.549> would<00:03:52.639> be<00:03:52.700> fun<00:03:52.939> to

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:52.969 
with that I thought it would be fun to

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:54.940 
with that I thought it would be fun to
combine<00:03:53.389> it<00:03:53.540> with<00:03:53.569> the<00:03:53.870> low<00:03:54.109> file<00:03:54.349> OOP<00:03:54.560> chunky

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
combine it with the low file OOP chunky

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.449 
combine it with the low file OOP chunky
from<00:03:55.129> zvex<00:03:55.840> and<00:03:56.840> so<00:03:57.019> I<00:03:57.049> turned<00:03:57.769> this<00:03:57.980> on<00:03:58.189> and

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
from zvex and so I turned this on and

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.250 
from zvex and so I turned this on and
makes<00:03:58.609> it<00:03:58.790> more<00:03:58.969> lo-fi<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.510> gives<00:03:59.900> it<00:04:00.019> kind<00:04:00.139> of

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
makes it more lo-fi and gives it kind of

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.869 
makes it more lo-fi and gives it kind of
more<00:04:00.560> of<00:04:00.650> a<00:04:00.739> warbling<00:04:01.159> sound<00:04:01.370> which<00:04:01.549> is<00:04:01.609> kind

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
more of a warbling sound which is kind

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:10.570 
more of a warbling sound which is kind
of<00:04:01.939> that<00:04:02.060> signature<00:04:02.650> taiko<00:04:03.650> Sonya

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.760 

so<00:04:11.150> it<00:04:11.240> kind<00:04:11.420> of<00:04:11.480> warms<00:04:11.720> it<00:04:11.990> up<00:04:12.110> and<00:04:12.380> it<00:04:12.470> kind<00:04:12.680> of

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
so it kind of warms it up and it kind of

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.250 
so it kind of warms it up and it kind of
you<00:04:13.550> know<00:04:13.670> it<00:04:13.820> D<00:04:14.300> tunes<00:04:14.570> it<00:04:14.780> a<00:04:14.810> little<00:04:15.020> bit<00:04:15.110> too

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
you know it D tunes it a little bit too

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.870 
you know it D tunes it a little bit too
which<00:04:15.410> is<00:04:15.560> awesome

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
which is awesome

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.539 
which is awesome
the<00:04:17.330> last<00:04:17.600> one<00:04:18.440> last<00:04:18.650> pieces<00:04:18.920> of<00:04:19.070> it<00:04:19.220> is<00:04:19.310> just<00:04:19.489> a

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
the last one last pieces of it is just a

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.400 
the last one last pieces of it is just a
little<00:04:19.760> bit<00:04:19.880> of<00:04:19.970> reverb<00:04:20.269> from<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.810> big<00:04:21.110> sky

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
little bit of reverb from the big sky

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.070 
little bit of reverb from the big sky
here<00:04:24.880> just<00:04:25.880> to<00:04:25.970> give<00:04:26.150> us<00:04:26.180> some<00:04:26.300> more<00:04:26.510> space<00:04:26.810> so

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
here just to give us some more space so

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.990 
here just to give us some more space so
that<00:04:27.110> I<00:04:27.290> mean<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:27.620> reverb<00:04:27.890> itself<00:04:28.310> sounds

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
that I mean the reverb itself sounds

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.830 
that I mean the reverb itself sounds
like<00:04:29.120> this<00:04:33.280> so<00:04:34.280> it's<00:04:34.430> kind<00:04:34.670> of<00:04:34.790> big<00:04:35.330> I<00:04:35.660> don't

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
like this so it's kind of big I don't

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.790 
like this so it's kind of big I don't
know<00:04:35.930> medium<00:04:36.410> reverb<00:04:38.110> and<00:04:39.110> then<00:04:39.350> but<00:04:39.590> one<00:04:39.770> of

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
know medium reverb and then but one of

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.800 
know medium reverb and then but one of
the<00:04:39.920> last<00:04:40.130> pieces<00:04:40.370> there<00:04:41.150> were<00:04:41.240> a<00:04:41.270> few<00:04:41.570> notes

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
the last pieces there were a few notes

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.420 
the last pieces there were a few notes
that<00:04:41.960> I<00:04:42.080> couldn't<00:04:42.410> actually<00:04:42.560> reach<00:04:43.010> on<00:04:43.280> my

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
that I couldn't actually reach on my

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.900 
that I couldn't actually reach on my
guitar<00:04:43.990> with<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.170> way<00:04:45.290> that<00:04:45.470> synth<00:04:45.770> sound<00:04:46.130> was

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
guitar with the way that synth sound was

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.420 
guitar with the way that synth sound was
so<00:04:47.240> I<00:04:47.330> used<00:04:47.810> my<00:04:47.900> micro<00:04:48.410> pog<00:04:48.620> to<00:04:48.830> have<00:04:48.980> an<00:04:49.100> octave

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
so I used my micro pog to have an octave

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.820 
so I used my micro pog to have an octave
up<00:04:49.610> like<00:04:50.030> those<00:04:50.330> first<00:04:50.660> very<00:04:51.050> first<00:04:51.080> two<00:04:51.530> since

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
up like those first very first two since

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.670 
up like those first very first two since
the<00:04:51.920> notes<00:04:52.100> I<00:04:52.250> played<00:04:52.490> I<00:04:55.510> had<00:04:56.510> the<00:04:57.200> micro<00:04:57.500> pog

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
the notes I played I had the micro pog

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.670 
the notes I played I had the micro pog
is<00:04:57.830> said<00:04:58.010> to<00:04:58.130> be<00:04:58.220> just<00:04:58.250> an<00:04:58.640> octave<00:04:58.910> up<00:04:59.140> and<00:05:00.140> then

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
is said to be just an octave up and then

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.150 
is said to be just an octave up and then
towards<00:05:01.070> the<00:05:01.100> end<00:05:01.190> one<00:05:01.580> of<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:01.790> last<00:05:02.000> few<00:05:03.160> the

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
towards the end one of the last few the

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.370 
towards the end one of the last few the
last<00:05:04.400> loop<00:05:04.640> I<00:05:04.760> did<00:05:04.970> I<00:05:05.210> had<00:05:05.570> the<00:05:05.720> micro<00:05:06.020> pog<00:05:06.200> on

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
last loop I did I had the micro pog on

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.220 
last loop I did I had the micro pog on
so<00:05:06.620> the<00:05:06.800> the<00:05:07.100> second<00:05:07.810> actually<00:05:08.810> the<00:05:09.050> first

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
so the the second actually the first

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:18.530 
so the the second actually the first
synth<00:05:09.590> loop<00:05:09.830> was<00:05:10.010> this<00:05:10.220> guy

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:29.429 

and<00:05:19.440> then<00:05:20.190> the<00:05:20.700> third<00:05:20.940> one<00:05:21.120> was<00:05:21.270> this<00:05:21.420> guy

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:29.439 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:32.020 

it's<00:05:30.439> time<00:05:30.590> pretty<00:05:30.800> cool<00:05:31.009> together<00:05:31.340> I'll<00:05:31.759> let

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
it's time pretty cool together I'll let

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:51.370 
it's time pretty cool together I'll let
it<00:05:32.060> suck<00:05:32.780> it<00:05:32.900> won't<00:05:33.050> apply<00:05:33.199> to

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.560 

so<00:05:52.380> that's<00:05:52.590> pretty<00:05:52.800> much<00:05:52.920> it<00:05:53.220> you<00:05:53.820> can<00:05:54.330> see

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
so that's pretty much it you can see

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.210 
so that's pretty much it you can see
like<00:05:54.990> I<00:05:55.110> mentioned<00:05:55.440> before<00:05:55.680> you<00:05:55.800> can<00:05:55.830> see<00:05:56.070> that

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
like I mentioned before you can see that

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.680 
like I mentioned before you can see that
little<00:05:56.400> sync<00:05:56.760> button<00:05:57.000> blinking<00:05:57.480> on<00:05:57.570> the

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
little sync button blinking on the

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.800 
little sync button blinking on the
boomerang<00:05:58.100> I<00:05:59.100> know<00:06:00.060> you<00:06:00.210> can't<00:06:00.420> see<00:06:00.630> that's

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
boomerang I know you can't see that's

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.200 
boomerang I know you can't see that's
just<00:06:01.290> outside<00:06:01.680> of<00:06:01.860> your<00:06:02.040> visible<00:06:02.820> range<00:06:03.000> but

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
just outside of your visible range but

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.340 
just outside of your visible range but
there's<00:06:03.480> a<00:06:03.540> MIDI<00:06:04.530> cable<00:06:04.920> plugged<00:06:05.250> into<00:06:05.400> my

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
there's a MIDI cable plugged into my

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.870 
there's a MIDI cable plugged into my
sidecar<00:06:07.350> for<00:06:08.070> the<00:06:08.190> boomerang<00:06:08.490> which<00:06:08.730> is

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
sidecar for the boomerang which is

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.210 
sidecar for the boomerang which is
receiving<00:06:09.240> MIDI<00:06:10.080> clock<00:06:10.290> signal<00:06:10.680> from<00:06:10.800> logic

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
receiving MIDI clock signal from logic

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.600 
receiving MIDI clock signal from logic
and<00:06:11.550> is<00:06:12.140> syncing<00:06:13.140> everything<00:06:13.530> up<00:06:13.680> nicely<00:06:14.220> so

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
and is syncing everything up nicely so

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.580 
and is syncing everything up nicely so
that's<00:06:15.540> pretty<00:06:15.750> much<00:06:15.840> it<00:06:15.960> if<00:06:16.200> you've<00:06:16.320> got<00:06:16.440> more

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
that's pretty much it if you've got more

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:17.780 
that's pretty much it if you've got more
questions<00:06:17.040> I'd<00:06:17.190> love<00:06:17.280> for<00:06:17.340> you<00:06:17.490> to<00:06:17.550> come<00:06:17.670> over
