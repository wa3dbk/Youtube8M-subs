00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
get a different one down the road as

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.390 
get a different one down the road as
well<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.780> go<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.409> that's<00:01:29.280> neither

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
well to go with it but that's neither

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.830 
well to go with it but that's neither
here<00:01:29.520> nor<00:01:29.670> there<00:01:29.850> okay<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.450> when<00:01:30.750> you're

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
here nor there okay so when you're

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.920 
here nor there okay so when you're
making<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.110> button<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.640> four<00:01:33.509> parts

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
making a button you have four parts

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.800 
making a button you have four parts
technically<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.799> your<00:01:34.979> button<00:01:35.250> itself<00:01:35.810> so

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
technically to your button itself so

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.980 
technically to your button itself so
your<00:01:37.110> first<00:01:37.320> part<00:01:37.530> would<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.220> shelf<00:01:38.990> you

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
your first part would be the shelf you

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.389 
your first part would be the shelf you
guys<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.350> see<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:41.659> I'm<00:01:42.659> using<00:01:42.990> my<00:01:43.259> phone<00:01:43.500> to

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
guys can see that I'm using my phone to

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
film this I made a little tripod for it

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.300 
film this I made a little tripod for it
so<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.579> kind<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.880> test<00:01:48.119> run

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
so this is kind of a test run

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.920 
so this is kind of a test run
yeah<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.759> your<00:01:50.909> shell<00:01:51.119> that's<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.600> first

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
yeah so this your shell that's the first

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.510 
yeah so this your shell that's the first
part<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.200> put<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.530> your<00:01:52.740> machine<00:01:53.040> that's<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
part you put in your machine that's the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.899 
part you put in your machine that's the
part<00:01:53.729> where<00:01:53.880> your<00:01:54.149> design<00:01:54.829> overlaps<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:56.700> is

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
part where your design overlaps this is

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.310 
part where your design overlaps this is
essentially<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.570> core<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.020> front<00:01:58.229> of

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
essentially the core of the front of

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.639 
essentially the core of the front of
your<00:01:58.409> button<00:01:59.780> the<00:02:00.780> back<00:02:01.219> has<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:03.810> pin<00:02:04.409> back

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
your button the back has the pin back

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.540 
your button the back has the pin back
hopefully<00:02:05.219> my<00:02:05.670> camera<00:02:06.090> will<00:02:06.210> focus<00:02:07.280> which<00:02:08.280> is

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
hopefully my camera will focus which is

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.630 
hopefully my camera will focus which is
exactly<00:02:09.179> what<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.479> does<00:02:09.690> as<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.860> pin<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
exactly what it does as the pin in the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.710 
exactly what it does as the pin in the
back<00:02:12.650> next<00:02:13.650> part<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.069> your<00:02:14.370> mylar<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:15.510> might

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
back next part is your mylar this might

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.270 
back next part is your mylar this might
be<00:02:15.810> able<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.020> harder<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.379> see<00:02:16.530> but<00:02:17.099> it's<00:02:17.220> a

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
be able to harder to see but it's a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.610 
be able to harder to see but it's a
little<00:02:17.459> pre-punched<00:02:18.150> sheet<00:02:18.569> of<00:02:18.840> plastic<00:02:19.230> that

little pre-punched sheet of plastic that

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.979 
little pre-punched sheet of plastic that
covers<00:02:20.129> your<00:02:20.280> design<00:02:20.640> protects<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.660> from<00:02:21.690> wear

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
covers your design protects it from wear

covers your design protects it from wear
and<00:02:22.170> tear<00:02:22.349> damage<00:02:23.150> they<00:02:24.150> usually<00:02:24.300> come<00:02:24.720> in

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
and tear damage they usually come in

these<00:02:25.489> stacks<00:02:26.489> that<00:02:26.760> are<00:02:26.910> wrapped<00:02:27.420> in<00:02:27.660> shrink

when<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.519> buy<00:02:41.670> your<00:02:41.819> buttons<00:02:42.209> they<00:02:42.420> usually

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
when you buy your buttons they usually

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.860 
when you buy your buttons they usually
come<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:43.290> giant<00:02:43.769> sacks<00:02:44.099> of<00:02:44.340> either<00:02:44.580> one

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
cavernous part of the dark you take your

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.789 
cavernous part of the dark you take your
design<00:03:31.409> and<00:03:31.860> your<00:03:32.549> mylar<00:03:33.049> and<00:03:34.049> put<00:03:34.650> them

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
design and your mylar and put them

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.380 
design and your mylar and put them
together<00:03:34.920> now<00:03:35.370> if<00:03:35.580> you<00:03:35.700> were<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.819> have<00:03:36.030> one<00:03:36.269> of

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
together now if you were to have one of

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.660 
together now if you were to have one of
the<00:03:36.480> tack<00:03:36.659> or<00:03:36.840> made<00:03:36.989> graphic<00:03:37.560> punches<00:03:37.920> the

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
the tack or made graphic punches the

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.820 
the tack or made graphic punches the
size<00:03:38.909> of<00:03:39.030> your<00:03:39.150> design<00:03:39.480> your<00:03:39.959> cut<00:03:40.200> design<00:03:40.500> and

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
size of your design your cut design and

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.830 
size of your design your cut design and
your<00:03:40.980> mylar<00:03:41.310> would<00:03:41.519> pretty<00:03:41.879> much<00:03:41.970> be<00:03:42.150> exactly

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
your mylar would pretty much be exactly

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.750 
your mylar would pretty much be exactly
the<00:03:42.989> same<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:44.010> one<00:03:44.159> I<00:03:44.190> use<00:03:44.459> is<00:03:44.610> a<00:03:44.640> little

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
the same the one I use is a little

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.280 
the same the one I use is a little
Fiskars<00:03:45.239> punch<00:03:45.510> because<00:03:45.659> it's<00:03:45.840> a<00:03:45.930> lot<00:03:46.049> cheaper

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
Fiskars punch because it's a lot cheaper

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.160 
Fiskars punch because it's a lot cheaper
and<00:03:46.970> it's<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.330> little<00:03:48.659> easier<00:03:49.019> on<00:03:49.080> my<00:03:49.379> poor

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
and it's a little easier on my poor

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.949 
and it's a little easier on my poor
miserable<00:03:52.170> wrists

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
miserable wrists

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.030 
miserable wrists
that's<00:03:54.959> why<00:03:55.170> he's<00:03:55.290> that<00:03:55.470> it's<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.799> little<00:03:55.950> bit

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
that's why he's that it's a little bit

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.320 
that's why he's that it's a little bit
smaller<00:03:56.400> you<00:03:56.489> just<00:03:56.790> kind<00:03:56.970> of<00:03:57.000> have<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.239> learn

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
smaller you just kind of have to learn

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.429 
smaller you just kind of have to learn
how<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.540> Center<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:57.959> you<00:03:58.049> get<00:03:58.170> used<00:03:58.319> to<00:03:58.379> it

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 
how to Center it you get used to it

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:03.369 
how to Center it you get used to it
really<00:03:58.560> fast<00:03:58.890> so<00:03:59.580> then<00:03:59.700> you<00:03:59.790> spin<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.090> die

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.770 

don't<00:04:04.379> mind<00:04:04.620> my<00:04:04.739> desk<00:04:04.980> wiggling<00:04:05.340> now<00:04:06.269> in<00:04:06.629> the

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
don't mind my desk wiggling now in the

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.539 
don't mind my desk wiggling now in the
die<00:04:06.930> that<00:04:07.110> you<00:04:07.170> just<00:04:07.319> pulled<00:04:07.560> forward<00:04:07.890> you<00:04:08.370> put

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
die that you just pulled forward you put

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.009 
die that you just pulled forward you put
your<00:04:08.700> ping<00:04:08.849> back<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.629> put<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:09.900> with<00:04:09.959> the
