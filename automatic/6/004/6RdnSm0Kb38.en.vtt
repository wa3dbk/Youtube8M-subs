the<00:01:18.990> night<00:01:19.200> they<00:01:20.040> are<00:01:20.070> saturated<00:01:21.030> with

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
the night they are saturated with

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.609 
the night they are saturated with
speeches<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.320> know<00:01:22.409> they<00:01:22.530> will

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
speeches and I just you know they will

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.630 
speeches and I just you know they will
have<00:01:22.680> already<00:01:23.040> haven't<00:01:23.400> been<00:01:23.520> an

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
have already haven't been an

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.420 
have already haven't been an
introduction<00:01:24.180> won't<00:01:24.659> know<00:01:24.869> with<00:01:24.990> all<00:01:25.430> about

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
introduction won't know with all about

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.980 
introduction won't know with all about
so<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.850> think<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.210> speed<00:01:27.420> it's<00:01:27.659> not<00:01:27.810> going<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
so I think the speed it's not going to

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.810 
so I think the speed it's not going to
be<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> long<00:01:28.229> speech<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.549> gonna<00:01:29.670> be

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
be a long speech and it's just gonna be

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.450 
be a long speech and it's just gonna be
