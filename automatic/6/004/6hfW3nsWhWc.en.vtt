perfectly and it's quiet and I like it

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.140

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
pretty silent once you put it all

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.410 
pretty silent once you put it all

because<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.899> don't<00:01:49.590> want<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.770> spend<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.100> extra

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
because I don't want to spend the extra

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.789 
because I don't want to spend the extra
money<00:01:51.210> going<00:01:51.540> for<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.689> modular<00:01:52.049> one<00:01:52.200> since<00:01:52.530> most

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
money going for a modular one since most

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.380 
money going for a modular one since most
of<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> cables<00:01:53.280> use<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.640> be<00:01:53.670> tucked<00:01:54.210> back

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
of the cables use can be tucked back

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.719 
of the cables use can be tucked back
there<00:01:54.570> anyway<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.070> since<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.250> case<00:01:56.490> there's

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
there anyway and since the case there's

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.639 
there anyway and since the case there's
another<00:01:56.880> side<00:01:57.180> panel<00:01:57.479> look<00:01:57.689> hurt<00:01:58.020> no<00:01:58.259> not<00:01:58.530> that

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
another side panel look hurt no not that

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.690 
another side panel look hurt no not that
there's<00:01:58.799> no<00:01:58.890> second<00:01:59.219> all<00:01:59.280> since<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.549> doesn't

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
there's no second all since it doesn't

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.709 
there's no second all since it doesn't
have<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.880> window<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:01.049> kind<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:02.719> it

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
have a window it's just kind of this it

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.179 
have a window it's just kind of this it
didn't<00:02:03.990> really<00:02:04.170> matter<00:02:04.320> how<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.680> insides

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
didn't really matter how the insides

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.240 
didn't really matter how the insides
look<00:02:05.430> as<00:02:05.820> long<00:02:06.030> as<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.329> functional<00:02:07.099> so<00:02:08.099> yeah

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
look as long as it's functional so yeah

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.350 
look as long as it's functional so yeah
all<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.610> cables<00:02:08.940> are<00:02:09.000> kind<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.179> going

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
all the cables are kind of going

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.300 
all the cables are kind of going
everywhere<00:02:09.629> but<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.869> works<00:02:10.099> except<00:02:11.099> for<00:02:11.220> this

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
everywhere but it works except for this

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.619 
everywhere but it works except for this
cable<00:02:11.580> right<00:02:11.640> here<00:02:11.760> there's<00:02:12.120> some<00:02:12.239> stretches

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
cable right here there's some stretches

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.839 
cable right here there's some stretches
across<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:13.050> CPU<00:02:13.410> fan

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
across the CPU fan

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.819 
across the CPU fan
and<00:02:15.180> I'm<00:02:15.510> scared<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:15.930> one<00:02:16.140> day<00:02:16.170> it's<00:02:16.530> going

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
and I'm scared that one day it's going

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:21.110 
and I'm scared that one day it's going
to<00:02:17.299> drop<00:02:18.299> into<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.719> little<00:02:19.640> fan<00:02:20.640> blades<00:02:20.909> and

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
to drop into the little fan blades and

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.660 
to drop into the little fan blades and
stop<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.989> CPUs<00:02:22.349> fan<00:02:22.560> fan<00:02:22.890> from<00:02:23.069> spinning<00:02:23.340> so

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
stop the CPUs fan fan from spinning so

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.490 
stop the CPUs fan fan from spinning so
I'm<00:02:24.120> gonna<00:02:24.329> have<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.569> like<00:02:24.719> tape<00:02:24.989> it<00:02:25.140> down<00:02:25.290> or

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
I'm gonna have to like tape it down or

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.670 
I'm gonna have to like tape it down or
something<00:02:25.799> cuz<00:02:26.400> it's<00:02:26.489> like<00:02:26.670> it's<00:02:27.569> like

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
something cuz it's like it's like

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.780 
something cuz it's like it's like
stretched<00:02:28.680> across<00:02:28.829> there<00:02:29.219> oh<00:02:30.139> also<00:02:31.549> as<00:02:32.549> for

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
stretched across there oh also as for

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.759 
stretched across there oh also as for
the<00:02:32.849> motherboard<00:02:33.239> it's<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.569> z77<00:02:34.230> gigabyte

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
the motherboard it's a z77 gigabyte

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:35.839 
the motherboard it's a z77 gigabyte
board<00:02:34.799> I<00:02:35.069> don't<00:02:35.219> know<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.400> actual<00:02:35.670> name

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
board I don't know the actual name

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.729 
board I don't know the actual name
though<00:02:36.060> cuz<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.590> name<00:02:37.769> always<00:02:37.920> escapes<00:02:38.400> me<00:02:38.609> uh

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
though cuz the name always escapes me uh

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.629 
though cuz the name always escapes me uh
yeah<00:02:40.739> that's<00:02:40.859> basically<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.280> didn't<00:02:41.579> do

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
yeah that's basically I didn't do

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.369 
yeah that's basically I didn't do
anything<00:02:41.939> crazy<00:02:42.120> like<00:02:42.329> water<00:02:42.780> cooling<00:02:43.260> or

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
anything crazy like water cooling or

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:44.690 
anything crazy like water cooling or
anything<00:02:43.530> like<00:02:43.799> that<00:02:43.829> since<00:02:44.219> she's<00:02:44.519> gonna

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
anything like that since she's gonna

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.449 
anything like that since she's gonna
basically<00:02:44.969> just<00:02:45.239> be<00:02:45.540> using<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:45.930> for<00:02:46.169> uh<00:02:46.459> just

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
basically just be using it for uh just

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.789 
basically just be using it for uh just
random<00:02:47.939> programs<00:02:48.780> on<00:02:48.959> her<00:02:49.049> computer<00:02:49.439> and<00:02:49.590> web

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
random programs on her computer and web

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.069

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
browsing things like that so there's no

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.649 
browsing things like that so there's no
need<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.379> go<00:02:52.530> overboard<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.400> had<00:02:53.519> a<00:02:53.659> around

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
need to go overboard and I had a around

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:55.970 
need to go overboard and I had a around
a<00:02:54.720> five<00:02:54.900> six<00:02:55.139> hundred<00:02:55.349> dollar<00:02:55.470> budget<00:02:55.769> so<00:02:55.919> I

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
a five six hundred dollar budget so I

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.500 
a five six hundred dollar budget so I
worked<00:02:56.189> with<00:02:56.310> what<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.489> could<00:02:56.609> I<00:02:57.000> went<00:02:57.359> a<00:02:57.480> little

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
worked with what I could I went a little

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.059 
worked with what I could I went a little
bit<00:02:57.689> over<00:02:57.959> though<00:02:58.079> since<00:02:58.379> we<00:02:58.500> took<00:02:58.919> high

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
bit over though since we took high

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.339 
bit over though since we took high
Windows<00:02:59.400> 7<00:02:59.700> for<00:02:59.730> her<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.209> originally<00:03:01.019> was<00:03:01.139> going

Windows 7 for her I originally was going
to<00:03:01.409> pirate<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.799> but<00:03:02.010> she<00:03:02.519> didn't<00:03:02.700> want<00:03:02.819> it

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
to pirate it but she didn't want it

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.509 
to pirate it but she didn't want it
pirated<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:04.139> I<00:03:04.409> I<00:03:04.769> have<00:03:05.010> these<00:03:05.159> two<00:03:05.280> extra

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
pirated so I I have these two extra

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.039 
pirated so I I have these two extra
keyboards<00:03:05.849> that<00:03:05.909> I<00:03:06.030> gave<00:03:06.209> her<00:03:06.329> but<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.780> works

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
really proud of this building I didn't

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.449 
really proud of this building I didn't
think<00:03:27.690> once<00:03:28.139> I<00:03:28.260> put<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:28.620> all<00:03:28.709> together<00:03:28.919> since

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
think once I put it all together since

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:34.939 
it is my first build I spent I'd say

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.780 
it is my first build I spent I'd say
quite<00:03:35.939> a<00:03:36.060> quite<00:03:36.629> a<00:03:36.659> while<00:03:36.900> over<00:03:37.199> the<00:03:37.439> summer

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.159 
quite a quite a while over the summer
learning<00:03:38.790> how<00:03:38.909> learning<00:03:39.419> all<00:03:39.629> the<00:03:39.720> parts<00:03:40.019> of

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
learning how learning all the parts of

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.319 
learning how learning all the parts of
computers<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:40.859> getting<00:03:41.699> really<00:03:41.909> interested

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
computers and getting really interested

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.569 
computers and getting really interested
in<00:03:42.419> in<00:03:42.629> them<00:03:43.699> and<00:03:44.699> then<00:03:45.689> well<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:46.889> didn't<00:03:47.340> really

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
in in them and then well I didn't really

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.280 
in in them and then well I didn't really
think<00:03:47.609> it<00:03:47.819> would<00:03:47.939> work<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.599> first<00:03:49.019> time<00:03:49.139> I<00:03:49.199> put

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
think it would work the first time I put

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.749 
think it would work the first time I put
it<00:03:49.379> together<00:03:49.500> cuz<00:03:49.799> I<00:03:49.859> put<00:03:50.009> all<00:03:50.099> the<00:03:50.189> parts<00:03:50.340> in<00:03:50.579> I

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:50.759 
it together cuz I put all the parts in I

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.969 
it together cuz I put all the parts in I
did<00:03:51.569> everything<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:52.199> read<00:03:52.409> all<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.620> manuals

around so you could see the back cable

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.969 
around so you could see the back cable
management<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:24.330> little<00:04:24.539> that<00:04:24.719> I<00:04:24.750> did<00:04:24.960> so<00:04:25.440> I'll

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.270 

okay<00:04:30.780> so<00:04:30.840> as<00:04:31.050> for<00:04:31.230> the<00:04:31.290> back<00:04:31.470> disregarding

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
okay so as for the back disregarding

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.770 
okay so as for the back disregarding
these<00:04:32.430> cables<00:04:32.880> because<00:04:33.030> these<00:04:33.270> kind<00:04:33.510> of<00:04:33.600> just

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
these cables because these kind of just

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.850 
these cables because these kind of just
went<00:04:33.930> around<00:04:35.750> my<00:04:36.750> cable<00:04:37.050> management<00:04:37.350> could<00:04:37.710> be

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
went around my cable management could be

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.920 
went around my cable management could be
better<00:04:38.010> but<00:04:38.130> still<00:04:38.570> it<00:04:39.570> doesn't<00:04:39.840> really

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
better but still it doesn't really

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.600 
better but still it doesn't really
matter<00:04:40.140> since<00:04:40.470> no<00:04:40.680> one's<00:04:40.830> looking<00:04:41.130> inside<00:04:41.460> the

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
matter since no one's looking inside the

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.850 
matter since no one's looking inside the
case<00:04:41.790> at<00:04:42.000> all<00:04:42.090> it's<00:04:42.810> so<00:04:43.140> there's<00:04:43.500> like<00:04:43.680> this

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
case at all it's so there's like this

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.570 
case at all it's so there's like this
random<00:04:44.330> 4<00:04:45.330> pin<00:04:45.570> connector<00:04:46.400> speaking<00:04:47.400> through

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
random 4 pin connector speaking through

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.200 
random 4 pin connector speaking through
and<00:04:48.230> yeah<00:04:49.230> I<00:04:49.500> didn't<00:04:50.490> do<00:04:50.580> all<00:04:50.730> too<00:04:50.880> much<00:04:51.030> in

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
and yeah I didn't do all too much in

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.090 
and yeah I didn't do all too much in
terms<00:04:51.420> of<00:04:51.570> cable<00:04:51.840> management<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:52.830> doesn't

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
terms of cable management it doesn't

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.200 
terms of cable management it doesn't
really<00:04:53.190> matter<00:04:53.400> for<00:04:53.520> this<00:04:53.790> build

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
really matter for this build

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.730 
really matter for this build
maybe<00:04:54.600> if<00:04:54.720> I<00:04:54.780> were<00:04:54.900> to<00:04:54.990> build<00:04:55.080> another<00:04:55.320> one<00:04:55.410> I

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
maybe if I were to build another one I

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.210 
maybe if I were to build another one I
would<00:04:55.830> I<00:04:56.460> would<00:04:57.150> do<00:04:57.510> a<00:04:57.540> little<00:04:57.840> bit<00:04:57.930> more<00:04:59.870> but

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
would I would do a little bit more but

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.040 
would I would do a little bit more but
still<00:05:02.220> airflow<00:05:03.120> airflow<00:05:03.540> is<00:05:03.630> pretty<00:05:03.840> good<00:05:03.990> I

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
still airflow airflow is pretty good I

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.630
