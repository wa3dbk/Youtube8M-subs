00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
have our fresh clams now you don't have

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.520 
have our fresh clams now you don't have
the<00:01:53.880> clams<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.450> til<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> potatoes<00:01:55.200> are<00:01:55.350> soft

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the clams on til the potatoes are soft

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.020 
the clams on til the potatoes are soft
because<00:01:55.829> our<00:01:56.790> clams<00:01:57.119> cook<00:01:57.420> very<00:01:57.630> quickly

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
because our clams cook very quickly

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.930 

and<00:02:00.570> as<00:02:00.900> you<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.140> see<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:02.070> clams<00:02:02.370> also

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
and as you can see that the clams also

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.410 
and as you can see that the clams also
that<00:02:03.830> adds<00:02:04.830> a<00:02:05.040> lot<00:02:05.190> of<00:02:05.250> flavor<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.820> our<00:02:05.970> stock

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
that adds a lot of flavor to our stock

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.900 
that adds a lot of flavor to our stock
and<00:02:06.690> which<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.200> essence<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:08.100> our

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
and which is the essence of that our

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.420 
and which is the essence of that our
clam<00:02:09.270> chowder<00:02:09.630> we<00:02:10.440> tend<00:02:10.740> to<00:02:10.800> put<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> lot<00:02:11.280> of

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
clam chowder we tend to put a lot of

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.220 
clam chowder we tend to put a lot of
clams<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:12.000> their<00:02:12.150> chowder<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.780> we<00:02:12.870> think<00:02:13.110> we

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
clams in their chowder and we think we

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.260 
clams in their chowder and we think we
should<00:02:13.410> rename<00:02:13.740> a<00:02:13.800> clam<00:02:14.160> chowder<00:02:14.640> because<00:02:14.910> we

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
should rename a clam chowder because we

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.199 
should rename a clam chowder because we
we<00:02:15.990> tend<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.380> we're<00:02:16.740> fine<00:02:17.459> that's<00:02:17.730> one<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.090> our

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
we tend to we're fine that's one of our

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.420 
we tend to we're fine that's one of our
secrets<00:02:18.420> we<00:02:18.840> use<00:02:19.080> plenty<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.650> clams<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.220> can
