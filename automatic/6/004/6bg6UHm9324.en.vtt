00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.649
 tiles measuring 12 by 6 centimeters and 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.270
 one cage depicts flowers and butterflies 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:34.010
 on 2 pallets bunnies chickens testicles common 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.340
 all that is connected with the pasch 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.840
 on each cell is pasted protective 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.050
 film which before use 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.120
 you need to effectively remove it so bright 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.880
 that it's hard not to notice 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.280
 so you see what pattern comes out with 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.110
 butterflies 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.050
 you can do it on any absolutely 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.530
 lacquers but surfing after all 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.020
 visit varnishes so more dense 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.620
 more saturated and pigmented 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.869
 Now I will show you how I am 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.790

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:13.220
 I just simply put on the tiles with 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.249

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.600
 with a brush and a special lacquer nanoshu 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.070
 on the tile 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.670
 for example black shade then 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.899
 gently going through the scraper 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:41.470
