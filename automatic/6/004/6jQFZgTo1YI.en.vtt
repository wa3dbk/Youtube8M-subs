00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.230
 under the feet on the fence still without 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.010

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.910
 for the motorcycle water race case 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.350
 I think it's the talk that I bring to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.370
 channel and the truth that I wanted to 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.600

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.750
 possible but good anyway I'm going to spend 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.920
