00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:09.130
 Yes complex of re-confirmation to continue and it looks like in the next for the complex of agreements in this case 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:13.990
 Try to find the complex conjugate of 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.910
 And this is actually already done in the numbers, but maybe some people watch the video 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.960
 There may be no need at all 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.440
 If you know how to ask for the number of clothes in the agreement , it's just not necessary 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.700
 Well look at this problem 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.950
 I think that it need not be seen splashing are wondering can also This is a little know such of q 1 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:33.080
 Let's check again for 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:35.270
 What did the complex number of the agreement do? Z later Raiders bi ne 3 +2 etc 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.330
 When it is such a feeling 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:43.610
 a-bi This is the opposite 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:48.050
 It is said that this imaginary part's coefficient reverse plus and minus are reversed and this is to be dressed as a convention 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:53.510
 It is and it sounds I was also doing important Toko of Tteyuu I represent in the z-bar 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.290
 So, for example, z = 2 + 3 Ai At the agreement of clothes software say Do what did it 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.280
 What's the costume 2 z bar of the agreement 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:02.760
 It's was washed and it is 2 - 3 Eye 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:08.490
 Ne this was reversed 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.890
 That's it. Z = 3- If you meet the source of agreement and agreement 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:18.180
 z bar's 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:21.270
 + To and will meet for the I It is much here in the opposite this is I was doing complex of agreements 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:27.210
 Well it's just a matter of checking it 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:30.909
 So the complex of this I will continue to do immediately parentheses City 3-2 i + 1+ I this of agreement 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:37.179
 You and now you have to anymore simplest also calculated Find 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:38.049
 And it is dressed the number of which the agreement has resulted 4 dance of calculation it a answer 4 - to 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:43.630
 To love 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:45.130
 That 's right of course Of course each of these has been asked to buy the agreement Naxos 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.659
 Even good burns 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.900
 I'm another person of this is the simple So first organized in the 4 + when such from in the house 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.330
 Baking naxos 4-2 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:02:01.930
 It is good with the idea that here is overturned 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.290
 Next is the second multiplication, which is also calculated and then calculated to give a complex number of agreement 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.890
 When 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:12.520
 In other words, I 'm going to expand this all the way with Omotei 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:15.350
 2 - Concern + suits and made to the square of the -3 position and and that I mean riding 2 of this love this 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:20.470
 From this I -1 -32 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:23.770
 When is the No. 2 +3 because I'm made to eventually +'s because Joe 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.490
 In issue - is to let I love oh my 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.660
 It is a flow that the complex number of agreement is understood No. Pla site 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:36.290
 Of course buy this 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:39.920
 It is okay to expand this from the complex tail of the agreement, but in fact it is one city of municipality 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:45.860
 Next in the reach- match that Siepsuraser 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:48.140
 - is to issue Tassa When will you ne This was calculated always to not be out do burns properly 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.650
 I Fair also um anymore 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.579
 Expand it's agreement 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:57.090
 I think it is certain that you think of the number of fucking 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:03:02.610
 I studied about the complex number of agreement here with yes 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:06.329
 It was already easy anyway anyway this + the complexity of the piano agreement z represented by a bar it is a 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.670
 It was said that minus di would be reversed 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.700
 To get used to this let's find Ueda and practice well 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.700
 Oh
