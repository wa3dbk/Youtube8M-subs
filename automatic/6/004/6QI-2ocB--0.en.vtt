00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:08.950
 Today at 11:30 am Hook University 9 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:13.600
 Beophwang before the building was hit college student who hyped campus shuttle 3 products 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:15.610
 The truck that sold a glance at dmb on the National Highway in Gyeongbuk Province 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.579
 We hit the players 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.869
 Accident for recent disintegration 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:25.089
 We walked the road and we drove, and one of us 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:30.599
 It could be much more dangerous. 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:30.599
 It was covered by a dangerous digital device that could lead to an accident. 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.430
 A lot of people 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.820
 As smartphones become more popular, more and more people are using smartphones . 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.820
 There is 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.210
 Citizens really do not think so and walk the way with smartphone 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.829
 4 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.540
 Oh rattling jjikja as earphones when one elf I encourage other interior haejugo 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.400
 You did it . 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:18.000
 A lot of drivers, who love cars, are also dangerous while driving. 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.150
 And smart instruments built during driving can lead to various accidents immediately 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.150
 There is 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.910
 U 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.420
 According to a statistic, the traffic accidents among the Korean people are the highest in the world 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.420
 It's level. 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.770
 Also , more than half of domestic drivers had experience watching dmb during driving 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.750
 Smart shows the experiment directly after the smartphone while walking how dangerous 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.750
 I saw it. 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:54.040
 I crossed the pedestrian crosswalk with my smartphone's eyes fixed. 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:02:01.600
 It was big because I could not find anyone who came face to face . 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:04.380
 It is not only that the wealth of others has become stronger, 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.380
 Sometimes it hits. 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.170
 How about crossing the crosswalk ? 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.720
 I compared it with normal walking . 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:22.080
 First, when a top young 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.080
 The time it took to get to the board was only 13. 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:36.130
 It drew me closer to a whopping 22 times when cold, using a smartphone 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:41.290
 There's more than 8 extra differences. 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:44.830
 If you are using a smart device that is a cheap kind of mon roll , smart 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:50.019
 The device is now very powerful and pretty in focus. 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:54.670
 That does not look at the front well dageona conflict or track, or another growth 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:56.420
 It is possible to be exposed to a variety of various incidents such as unauthorized crossing 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.590
 I will. 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.420
 It is a black box video that experienced an accident crisis during actual walking . 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.420
 It's really worth seeing. 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.420
 That is reportedly more surveyed in the United States with a smart device during walking 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.470
 Here 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:19.060
 Approximately 1,150 people were involved in a traffic accident 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:24.730
 The day of worship in the past seven years have increased by about Nishi survey Lighthouse 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:27.760
 In Korea, there are books and increased the proportion of eggs to buy this smart grid v 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:33.310
 I'm afraid it's because of the device. 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:37.980
 Let's see. How about a smart device in driving? 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.980
 I looked at the following about the sudden appearance of an obstacle. 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.810
 First, lowering the normal running speed of one to hang chanya 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.840
 This time, when using smart devices, 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.840
 U 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:01.050
 But if you were in a real situation , 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.050
 I went on. 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:15.000
 When you touch a smart device or start dmb or watch while driving 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:20.500
 Forward-looking glass fell to 50% level and alcohol concentration was lowered to 0.1 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.949
 I've found that it's falling ahead of the driver . 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:29.070
 A terrible accident caused by the use of smart devices while driving 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:29.070
 It is true that it is not the talk of others at all. 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:39.420
 In some states of the genius and I'm walking on the use of smart devices 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:43.730
 New Jersey Riho $ 85 in noses tree-shi 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.730
 Less money for $ 50 in Utah 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.930
 I am also prohibited from filling in problems even in affluence 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:58.879
 If you send a text or view a map or video 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:00.080
 It is safe to stop and use where it is not disturbed by others 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:04.939
 I wish 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:09.229
 Also, if you listen to music, take a ride on a vehicle or bicycle 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:11.650
 If you listen to the music inevitably, one ear is better than others. 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.650
 I thought 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.909
 It flew ttoreureu use of dangerous driving smart kick in now to refrain themselves 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:24.289
 It is time. 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:24.289
 It's a way to keep you safe as well as others. 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.530
 Ah ah ah ah ah
