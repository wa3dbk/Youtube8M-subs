00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
is the 1982 206 and about two years ago

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.360 
is the 1982 206 and about two years ago
we<00:00:38.820> replaced<00:00:39.300> our<00:00:39.600> 520<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.710> our<00:00:40.890> McCauley

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
we replaced our 520 and our McCauley

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.650 
we replaced our 520 and our McCauley
prop<00:00:41.730> with<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> new<00:00:42.780> 550<00:00:43.469> Continental<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.309> the

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
prop with a new 550 Continental and the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.220 
prop with a new 550 Continental and the
Buccaneer<00:00:45.890> scimitar<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.930> it<00:00:48.930> really

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
Buccaneer scimitar and it really

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.860 
Buccaneer scimitar and it really
improved<00:00:49.590> our<00:00:49.800> rate<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.219> climb<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:51.420> went<00:00:51.719> from

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
improved our rate of climb we went from

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.889 
improved our rate of climb we went from
about<00:00:52.129> 600<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.250> 700<00:00:53.579> feet<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.000> minute<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.629> about

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
about 600 to 700 feet a minute to about

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.380 
about 600 to 700 feet a minute to about
800<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> thousand<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:57.239> though

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
800 to a thousand and just though

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.439 
800 to a thousand and just though
problem<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.100> engine<00:00:59.520> just<00:00:59.760> runs<00:01:00.149> so

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
problem and and the engine just runs so

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.900 
problem and and the engine just runs so
much<00:01:00.629> smoother<00:01:01.109> than<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.440> older<00:01:01.829> 520<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.789> we

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
much smoother than the older 520 that we

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.780 
much smoother than the older 520 that we
had<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.930> our<00:01:04.739> rate<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.250> speed<00:01:05.519> actually

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
had and our rate of speed actually

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.789 
had and our rate of speed actually
picked<00:01:06.240> up<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.540> were<00:01:06.659> really<00:01:06.930> surprised<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
picked up we were really surprised and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.980 
picked up we were really surprised and
it's<00:01:07.950> picked<00:01:08.220> up<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.640> about<00:01:08.820> 8<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.240> 10<00:01:09.450> miles<00:01:09.689> an

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
it's picked up to about 8 to 10 miles an

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.760 
it's picked up to about 8 to 10 miles an
hour<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.920> really<00:01:11.250> noticed<00:01:12.290> it<00:01:13.290> picking<00:01:13.619> up

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
hour and we really noticed it picking up

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.969 
hour and we really noticed it picking up
speed<00:01:13.920> when<00:01:14.340> we're<00:01:14.549> into<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> headwind<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:16.799> we

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
speed when we're into a headwind so we

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.590 
speed when we're into a headwind so we
were<00:01:17.189> really<00:01:17.340> pleased<00:01:17.759> with<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> service<00:01:18.299> we

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
got here it takes the skyways and they

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.300 
got here it takes the skyways and they
just<00:01:21.330> did<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> wonderful<00:01:21.750> job<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.619> right<00:01:23.070> now

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
I have a 1962 6 9 182 and a few years

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.670 
I have a 1962 6 9 182 and a few years
ago<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.909> replaced<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.570> old<00:01:33.750> 470<00:01:34.259> engine<00:01:34.500> with

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
ago we replaced the old 470 engine with

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.730 
ago we replaced the old 470 engine with
six<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.979> skyways<00:01:35.369> conversion<00:01:36.000> Oh<00:01:36.180> 520<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
six of skyways conversion Oh 520 the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.929 
six of skyways conversion Oh 520 the
cruise<00:01:39.560> speed<00:01:40.560> increase<00:01:41.100> was<00:01:41.280> about<00:01:41.520> 25<00:01:41.909> knots

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
cruise speed increase was about 25 knots

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.929 
cruise speed increase was about 25 knots
which<00:01:42.540> i<00:01:42.659> think<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.899> excellent<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:44.009> do<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.820> lot<00:01:44.909> of

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
which i think is excellent I do a lot of

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.639 
which i think is excellent I do a lot of
air<00:01:45.090> photography<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.840> vibration<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.500> big

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
air photography so vibration is a big

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.460 
air photography so vibration is a big
issue<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.670> new<00:01:47.939> scimitar<00:01:48.899> 3<00:01:49.170> blade

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
issue and so this new scimitar 3 blade

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.700 
issue and so this new scimitar 3 blade
prop<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:50.369> very<00:01:50.700> good<00:01:51.110> also<00:01:52.110> with<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.439> engine

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
prop is very good also with the engine

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.740 
prop is very good also with the engine
we<00:01:52.829> bought<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.280> total<00:01:54.149> drain<00:01:54.450> some

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
we bought the total drain some

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.650 
we bought the total drain some
and<00:01:55.870> I<00:01:56.500> used<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:57.010> pay<00:01:57.280> for<00:01:57.850> oil<00:01:57.880> changes<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.540> be

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
and I used to pay for oil changes to be

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.810 
and I used to pay for oil changes to be
done<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:59.080> local<00:01:59.380> shop<00:01:59.590> now<00:02:00.130> I'm<00:02:00.400> changed<00:02:00.730> my

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
done the local shop now I'm changed my

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.030 
done the local shop now I'm changed my
own<00:02:00.970> oil<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:01.630> so<00:02:01.810> I<00:02:01.840> only<00:02:02.020> costed<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.650> cost<00:02:02.860> of

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
own oil and so I only costed the cost of

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.540 
own oil and so I only costed the cost of
the<00:02:03.130> oil<00:02:03.160> in<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.460> filter<00:02:04.410> that's<00:02:05.410> it<00:02:05.920> paid<00:02:06.340> for

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
the oil in the filter that's it paid for

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.300 
the oil in the filter that's it paid for

I've had for Texas skyways engines the
performance<00:02:13.120> upgrade<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:13.990> just<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.530> best

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
performance upgrade is just the best

the rate of climb is in the 1500 foot
range<00:02:27.430> which<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.790> double<00:02:28.720> what<00:02:28.870> we<00:02:29.080> used<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.320> do
