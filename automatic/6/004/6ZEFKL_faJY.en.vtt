hey what's up guys this is Dom from AK
mixing<00:00:09.540> comm<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.260> right<00:00:10.980> now<00:00:11.099> we're<00:00:11.219> going<00:00:11.309> to

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
mixing comm and right now we're going to

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.270 
mixing comm and right now we're going to
do<00:00:11.550> some<00:00:11.790> benchmark<00:00:12.240> tests<00:00:12.599> on<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:13.290> 2012

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
here so let's go ahead and get geek

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.850 
here so let's go ahead and get geek
bench<00:00:33.300> open<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.930> well<00:00:34.050> I'll<00:00:34.200> do<00:00:34.380> Nova<00:00:34.680> bench

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
bench open and well I'll do Nova bench

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.010 
bench open and well I'll do Nova bench
as<00:00:35.070> well<00:00:35.250> as<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.640> see<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:35.940> geek<00:00:36.840> bench

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
as well as you can see I have geek bench

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.799 
as well as you can see I have geek bench
and<00:00:37.320> Nova<00:00:37.800> bench<00:00:37.980> both<00:00:38.370> right<00:00:38.730> here<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.480> I'll

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
and Nova bench both right here so I'll

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.660 
and Nova bench both right here so I'll
be<00:00:39.930> doing<00:00:40.200> both<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.379> these<00:00:40.620> actually<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.430> let's

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
be doing both of these actually so let's

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.209 
be doing both of these actually so let's
do<00:00:41.910> geek<00:00:42.180> bench<00:00:42.329> first<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.200> as<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.160> see

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
do geek bench first and as you can see

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.610 
do geek bench first and as you can see
we<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:44.610> geek<00:00:44.850> bench<00:00:45.030> I'm<00:00:45.239> going<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.450> do

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
we have geek bench I'm going to do

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.389 
we have geek bench I'm going to do
64-bit<00:00:46.620> right<00:00:46.920> there

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
64-bit right there

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.350 
64-bit right there
and<00:00:47.489> let's<00:00:48.180> go<00:00:48.329> ahead<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.870> run<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.379> benchmark

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.490 

once<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> benchmark<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.020> done<00:00:55.170> we'll<00:00:55.320> be<00:00:55.350> able

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
once the benchmark is done we'll be able

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.549 
once the benchmark is done we'll be able
to<00:00:55.739> directly<00:00:56.399> compare<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:58.320> MacBook

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
to directly compare this to this MacBook

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.099 
to directly compare this to this MacBook
once<00:00:59.190> I've<00:00:59.430> installed<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.059> 16<00:01:00.510> gigs<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.899> ram

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.060 
in normal bench here we got a ten ninety
two<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.640> I'm<00:01:54.210> not<00:01:54.899> really<00:01:55.140> sure<00:01:55.259> how<00:01:55.619> Nova

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
two and I'm not really sure how Nova

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.550 
two and I'm not really sure how Nova
Bench<00:01:56.250> has<00:01:56.880> their<00:01:57.149> score<00:01:57.509> rated<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.229> whatnot

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
Bench has their score rated and whatnot

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.069 
Bench has their score rated and whatnot
but<00:01:58.799> we<00:01:58.979> can<00:01:59.100> go<00:01:59.189> ahead<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.490> save<00:01:59.759> this<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.390> we

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
but we can go ahead and save this and we

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.260 
but we can go ahead and save this and we
can<00:02:01.259> compare<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.680> later<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.100> we'll<00:02:02.640> save<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.090> as

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
can compare it later so we'll save it as

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.929 
can compare it later so we'll save it as
MacBook<00:02:03.869> Pro<00:02:04.140> or<00:02:04.500> gigabytes<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.399> then<00:02:05.759> we<00:02:05.850> can

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
MacBook Pro or gigabytes and then we can

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.789 
MacBook Pro or gigabytes and then we can
go<00:02:06.030> ahead<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.270> compare<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.899> later<00:02:07.200> after<00:02:07.649> we

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
go ahead and compare this later after we

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.520 
go ahead and compare this later after we
have<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.399> RAM<00:02:08.940> installed<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.750> hold<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.319> I'm

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
have the RAM installed so hold on I'm

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.990 
have the RAM installed so hold on I'm
going<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.709> do<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.950> other<00:02:10.979> video<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.640> then

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
going to do the other video and then

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.979 
going to do the other video and then
I'll<00:02:12.090> come<00:02:12.239> back<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.660> one

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
I'll come back to this one

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.910 
I'll come back to this one
alright<00:02:13.349> guys<00:02:13.470> so

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
alright guys so

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.040 
alright guys so
we<00:02:13.980> are<00:02:14.160> back<00:02:14.430> now<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.120> as<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.420> can<00:02:15.540> see<00:02:15.720> here

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
we are back now and as you can see here

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.110 
we are back now and as you can see here
we<00:02:16.290> have<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.740> 16<00:02:17.250> gigabytes<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.849> RAM

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
we have the 16 gigabytes of RAM

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.330 
we have the 16 gigabytes of RAM
installed<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.260> let's<00:02:19.500> go<00:02:19.620> ahead<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:19.950> run<00:02:20.099> some

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
installed so let's go ahead and run some

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.729 
installed so let's go ahead and run some
benchmarks<00:02:20.489> right<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.750> first<00:02:22.200> let's<00:02:22.500> go<00:02:22.709> ahead

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
benchmarks right so first let's go ahead

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.510 
benchmarks right so first let's go ahead
and<00:02:23.400> open<00:02:23.819> up<00:02:24.360> Geekbench<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.410> we<00:02:26.040> will<00:02:26.190> see

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
and open up Geekbench and we will see

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.640 
and open up Geekbench and we will see
how<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:26.970> performs<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.870> then<00:02:28.260> we'll<00:02:28.410> be<00:02:28.530> able

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
how this performs and then we'll be able

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.770 
how this performs and then we'll be able
to<00:02:28.890> directly<00:02:29.280> compare<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.849> to<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.300> last<00:02:30.330> score

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
to directly compare it to the last score

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.830 
to directly compare it to the last score
that<00:02:30.930> we<00:02:31.020> took<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:31.650> let's<00:02:31.890> go<00:02:35.330> all<00:02:36.330> right<00:02:36.390> here

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
that we took so let's go all right here

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.260 
that we took so let's go all right here
and<00:02:37.050> as<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.560> can<00:02:37.650> see<00:02:37.830> here<00:02:38.069> we<00:02:38.220> have<00:02:38.489> twelve

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
and as you can see here we have twelve

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.920 
and as you can see here we have twelve
thousand<00:02:39.840> eleven<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:40.739> let's<00:02:41.459> go<00:02:41.580> ahead<00:02:41.700> and

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
thousand eleven so let's go ahead and

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.750 
thousand eleven so let's go ahead and
upload<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.410> compare<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.580> last

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
upload that and compare it to the last

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.520 
upload that and compare it to the last
result<00:02:45.120> all<00:02:45.660> right<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:45.900> if<00:02:46.110> we<00:02:46.140> go<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.380> my

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
result all right so if we go to my

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.259 
result all right so if we go to my
profile<00:02:46.920> page<00:02:47.100> here<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.519> can<00:02:47.550> see<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.060> we

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
profile page here you can see that we

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.540 
profile page here you can see that we
got<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.840> pretty<00:02:49.200> substantial<00:02:49.440> little<00:02:50.100> jump<00:02:50.340> out

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
got a pretty substantial little jump out

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.729 
got a pretty substantial little jump out
of<00:02:50.580> that<00:02:50.730> there<00:02:51.239> just<00:02:51.540> goes<00:02:52.049> to<00:02:52.170> show<00:02:52.350> you<00:02:52.410> how

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
of that there just goes to show you how

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.309 
of that there just goes to show you how
much<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.040> little<00:02:53.549> investment<00:02:53.940> can<00:02:54.209> do<00:02:54.480> for<00:02:55.140> your

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
much a little investment can do for your

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.740 
much a little investment can do for your
MacBook<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:56.040> if<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.150> install<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.600> RAM

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
MacBook and if you install the RAM

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.270 
MacBook and if you install the RAM
correctly<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.470> get<00:02:58.739> everything<00:02:58.980> going

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
correctly and get everything going

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.090 
correctly and get everything going

please leave a comment below and let me
know<00:03:02.220> how<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.850> worked<00:03:03.060> out<00:03:03.209> for<00:03:03.269> you<00:03:03.660> let's

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
know how that worked out for you let's

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.830 
know how that worked out for you let's
go<00:03:04.200> ahead<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:04.769> run<00:03:05.040> nova<00:03:05.850> bench<00:03:06.090> now<00:03:06.450> it's

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
go ahead and run nova bench now it's

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.539 
go ahead and run nova bench now it's
another<00:03:07.080> benchmark<00:03:07.590> program<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.250> we<00:03:08.340> used

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
another benchmark program that we used

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.460 
another benchmark program that we used
earlier<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.209> we're<00:03:09.750> going<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:09.959> go<00:03:10.080> ahead<00:03:10.200> and

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
earlier and we're going to go ahead and

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.009 
earlier and we're going to go ahead and
test<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:10.980> compare<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.549> scores<00:03:11.670> between<00:03:12.360> the

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
test and compare the scores between the

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.750 
test and compare the scores between the
two<00:03:13.170> nova<00:03:13.440> bench<00:03:13.620> scores<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.069> we<00:03:14.190> got<00:03:14.370> make

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
two nova bench scores that we got make

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.400 
two nova bench scores that we got make
sure<00:03:14.910> nova<00:03:15.209> bench<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.720> only<00:03:15.930> app<00:03:16.049> running

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
sure nova bench is the only app running

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.190 
sure nova bench is the only app running
and<00:03:17.329> so<00:03:18.329> just<00:03:18.510> kind<00:03:18.660> of<00:03:18.690> let<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.840> do<00:03:19.019> its<00:03:19.049> thing

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
and so just kind of let it do its thing

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.710 
and so just kind of let it do its thing
it's<00:03:19.650> doing<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.430> benchmark<00:03:20.820> tests<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.450> i'll

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
it's doing the benchmark tests and i'll

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.120 
it's doing the benchmark tests and i'll
start<00:03:21.900> testing<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.320> graphics<00:03:22.709> card<00:03:22.950> here

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
start testing the graphics card here

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.470 
start testing the graphics card here
pretty<00:03:23.310> soon<00:03:23.400> as<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:24.450> can<00:03:24.570> see<00:03:25.579> and<00:03:26.579> as<00:03:27.329> soon

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
pretty soon as you can see and as soon

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.210 
pretty soon as you can see and as soon
as<00:03:27.570> that's<00:03:27.660> finished<00:03:27.780> we'll<00:03:28.170> be<00:03:28.320> able<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.739> open

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
as that's finished we'll be able to open

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.310 
as that's finished we'll be able to open
up<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.640> compare<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.720> last<00:03:30.870> score<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.260> we

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
up and compare the last score that we

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.380 
up and compare the last score that we
got<00:03:31.470> with<00:03:31.650> four<00:03:31.890> gigabytes<00:03:32.280> are<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.120> guys<00:03:33.239> so

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
got with four gigabytes are you guys so

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.210 
got with four gigabytes are you guys so
as<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.690> can<00:03:33.810> see<00:03:33.930> here<00:03:34.049> on<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.230> left<00:03:34.500> this<00:03:34.829> was

what we had when we were running four
gigabytes<00:03:37.530> of<00:03:37.650> ram<00:03:37.829> that<00:03:38.100> was<00:03:38.280> at<00:03:38.400> 1092<00:03:38.880> and

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
gigabytes of ram that was at 1092 and

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.930 
gigabytes of ram that was at 1092 and
now<00:03:39.570> with<00:03:39.870> 16<00:03:40.170> we're<00:03:40.470> at<00:03:40.560> 12:04<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:41.670> we<00:03:41.790> got<00:03:41.910> a

pretty significant bump they're putting
in<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.790> extra<00:03:44.970> ram<00:03:45.359> and<00:03:45.630> also<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.350> will

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
in that extra ram and also that will

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.840
