 neptalÃ­ york 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.969
 since I saw things in 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:33.089

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.779
 We are in a box inc 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:42.329
 vigo 6 2 in 1 oct courtesy of sony 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:45.839

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:53.829
 Georgia sweeney 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.579
 we want 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.579
 the port 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.349
 justified carlos with one hand 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.079
 once for all 1 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.840
 but before entering 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.669
 because it 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.189
 port 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:26.300
 so it was decided only has 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.090
 equatorial entries and video grosjean 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.490

 common despite toti wine 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.419
 and theoretically with this 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:43.900
 Computer 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.889
 honda movies and videos to television 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.909
