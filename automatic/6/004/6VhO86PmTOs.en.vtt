mode the slag has been improved greatly

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:16.160 
mode the slag has been improved greatly
which<00:01:14.279> means<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.969> does<00:01:15.539> like<00:01:15.719> triple<00:01:16.079> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
which means it does like triple the

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:21.029 
or when you snag someone you can cause

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:22.459 
or when you snag someone you can cause
