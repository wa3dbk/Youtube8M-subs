00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
think it's very important when you're

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.770 
think it's very important when you're
young<00:03:38.460> when<00:03:38.490> you<00:03:38.880> start<00:03:39.180> in<00:03:39.300> something<00:03:39.750> that

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
young when you start in something that

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.990 
young when you start in something that
you<00:03:40.260> can<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.740> know<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.220> people<00:03:41.520> back<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:41.820> up
