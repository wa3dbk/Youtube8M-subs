a nikon camera is more of an extension

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.719 
a nikon camera is more of an extension
of<00:01:15.210> my<00:01:15.390> hand<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.400> know<00:01:17.490> exactly

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
of my hand and I can just I know exactly

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.999 
of my hand and I can just I know exactly
where<00:01:18.330> everything<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.590> set<00:01:19.740> up<00:01:19.799> in

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
where everything is I have it set up in

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.039 
where everything is I have it set up in
my<00:01:20.189> own<00:01:20.369> way<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.420> feels<00:01:21.630> really

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
my own way and it just feels really

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.749 
my own way and it just feels really
really<00:01:22.350> good<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:23.130> makes<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.490> big<00:01:23.729> difference

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
really good that makes a big difference

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.730 
really good that makes a big difference
if<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.630> camera<00:01:24.840> doesn't<00:01:24.990> feel<00:01:25.320> right<00:01:25.530> doesn't

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
if the camera doesn't feel right doesn't

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.830 
if the camera doesn't feel right doesn't
fit<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.700> probably<00:01:26.939> won't<00:01:27.240> shoot<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.720> as

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
fit you probably won't shoot with it as

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.160 
fit you probably won't shoot with it as
much<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.680> that's<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.979> big<00:01:29.189> thing<00:01:30.020> next<00:01:31.020> then

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
much so that's a big thing next then

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.859 
much so that's a big thing next then
consider<00:01:31.560> its<00:01:31.710> lifespan<00:01:32.509> how<00:01:33.509> long<00:01:33.720> are<00:01:33.780> you

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
consider its lifespan how long are you

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.270 
consider its lifespan how long are you
going<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.560> also<00:01:34.710> kind<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.159> goes

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
going to have it and also kind of goes

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.910 
going to have it and also kind of goes
into<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.670> other<00:01:35.850> upgrade<00:01:36.630> plan<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.799> know

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
into the other upgrade plan you know

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.649 
into the other upgrade plan you know
when<00:01:38.369> are<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.520> planning<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.909> upgrading<00:01:39.090> it

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
when are you planning on upgrading it

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.410 
when are you planning on upgrading it
how<00:01:40.020> long<00:01:40.290> are<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.530> going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.770> have<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.420> you

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
how long are you going to have it you

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.330 
how long are you going to have it you
know<00:01:42.509> if<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.869> would<00:01:42.990> consider<00:01:43.259> say<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.220> know

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
know if you would consider say you know

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.760 
know if you would consider say you know
at<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.610> 90<00:01:45.149> right<00:01:45.329> now<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:46.290> then<00:01:46.409> maybe<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
at the 90 right now but then maybe the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.319 
at the 90 right now but then maybe the
next<00:01:46.950> time<00:01:47.100> you're<00:01:47.610> going<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.000> probably

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
next time you're going to you probably

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.580 
next time you're going to you probably
want<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.600> upgrade<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.049> full-frame<00:01:49.530> camera

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
want to upgrade to a full-frame camera

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.980 
want to upgrade to a full-frame camera
if<00:01:50.159> that's<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.820> case<00:01:51.030> then<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.750> probably

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
if that's the case then you probably

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.710 
if that's the case then you probably

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
really aren't going to change for

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.150 
really aren't going to change for
example<00:02:45.980> from<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.490> d3<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.660> a<00:02:47.690> d3s<00:02:48.380> there

example from the d3 to a d3s there

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.010 
example from the d3 to a d3s there
aren't<00:02:49.460> really<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:49.970> ton<00:02:50.330> of<00:02:50.360> things<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.930> are

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
aren't really a ton of things that are

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.930 
aren't really a ton of things that are
going<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.230> be<00:02:51.320> different<00:02:51.680> in<00:02:52.160> between<00:02:52.730> those

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
going to be different in between those

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.030 
going to be different in between those
two<00:02:53.210> models<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:54.080> buttons<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.680> lot<00:02:54.860> of<00:02:54.950> the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
two models the buttons a lot of the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.950 
two models the buttons a lot of the
things<00:02:55.250> are<00:02:55.400> still<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.670> same<00:02:55.910> so<00:02:56.180> you

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
things are still the same so you

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.450 
things are still the same so you
probably<00:02:57.170> don't<00:02:57.470> have<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.770> do<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.160> lot<00:02:58.400> of

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
probably don't have to do a lot of

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.530 
probably don't have to do a lot of
things<00:02:58.760> read<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.300> freaking<00:02:59.720> manual<00:03:01.540> next
