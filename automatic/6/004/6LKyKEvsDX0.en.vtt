00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.900 

why

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.190 

nicole<00:00:06.910> scott<00:00:07.000> removal<00:00:07.480> gigs<00:00:07.660> and<00:00:07.870> here<00:00:08.080> we

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:08.200 
nicole scott removal gigs and here we

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.680 
nicole scott removal gigs and here we
are<00:00:08.380> at<00:00:08.530> IDF<00:00:08.950> 2013<00:00:09.760> and<00:00:10.030> what<00:00:10.180> I'm<00:00:10.300> taking<00:00:10.600> a

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 
are at IDF 2013 and what I'm taking a

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.830 
are at IDF 2013 and what I'm taking a
look<00:00:10.840> at<00:00:11.020> is<00:00:11.170> a<00:00:11.309> reference<00:00:12.309> design<00:00:12.639> from<00:00:13.180> Intel

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
look at is a reference design from Intel

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.750 
look at is a reference design from Intel
so<00:00:14.260> this<00:00:14.350> is<00:00:14.440> an<00:00:14.590> Android<00:00:15.040> android-based

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760 
so this is an Android android-based

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.010 
so this is an Android android-based
tablet<00:00:16.750> running<00:00:17.400> obviously<00:00:18.840> Android<00:00:19.840> let's

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
tablet running obviously Android let's

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.490 
tablet running obviously Android let's
check<00:00:20.230> it<00:00:20.349> out

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.470 

4.3<00:00:24.500> now<00:00:25.009> this<00:00:25.160> is<00:00:25.369> running<00:00:25.849> a<00:00:26.029> bay<00:00:26.240> trail

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
4.3 now this is running a bay trail

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.370 
4.3 now this is running a bay trail
processor<00:00:27.099> and<00:00:28.099> I<00:00:28.220> believe<00:00:28.550> it<00:00:28.730> is<00:00:28.910> the<00:00:29.380> 3770

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
processor and I believe it is the 3770

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.260 
processor and I believe it is the 3770
running<00:00:30.740> out<00:00:30.859> probably<00:00:31.070> 1.5<00:00:31.520> year<00:00:31.970> hurts<00:00:32.180> I

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
running out probably 1.5 year hurts I

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.630 
running out probably 1.5 year hurts I
believe<00:00:32.480> it<00:00:32.629> can<00:00:32.809> go<00:00:32.930> up<00:00:32.960> to<00:00:33.170> 1.8<00:00:33.920> now<00:00:34.460> this<00:00:34.579> is

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
believe it can go up to 1.8 now this is

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.830 
believe it can go up to 1.8 now this is
on<00:00:34.820> the<00:00:34.910> high<00:00:35.059> end<00:00:35.090> of<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:35.480> bay<00:00:35.600> trail

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
on the high end of the bay trail

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.840 
on the high end of the bay trail
processor<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:36.829> ones<00:00:37.010> that<00:00:37.190> I've<00:00:37.280> had<00:00:37.519> to<00:00:37.670> add

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
processor the ones that I've had to add

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.770 
processor the ones that I've had to add
the<00:00:37.970> opportunity<00:00:38.300> to<00:00:38.360> have<00:00:38.480> hands<00:00:38.720> on

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
the opportunity to have hands on

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.890 
the opportunity to have hands on
previously<00:00:39.410> on<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:39.710> Encore<00:00:40.100> was<00:00:40.489> a<00:00:40.519> 37<00:00:41.120> 40<00:00:41.809> now

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
previously on the Encore was a 37 40 now

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.299 
previously on the Encore was a 37 40 now
for<00:00:42.050> take<00:00:42.199> a<00:00:42.230> quick<00:00:42.409> look<00:00:42.530> around<00:00:42.650> here<00:00:42.980> you

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
for take a quick look around here you

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.240 
for take a quick look around here you
can<00:00:43.430> see<00:00:43.550> that<00:00:43.579> we<00:00:43.850> have<00:00:43.879> dual<00:00:44.239> speakers<00:00:45.250> and

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
can see that we have dual speakers and

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.829 
can see that we have dual speakers and
around<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.670> top<00:00:46.879> we<00:00:47.059> have<00:00:47.089> a<00:00:47.180> volume<00:00:47.449> rocker

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
around the top we have a volume rocker

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.810 
around the top we have a volume rocker
there<00:00:48.170> there's<00:00:48.769> a<00:00:48.860> headphone<00:00:49.220> jack<00:00:49.519> and<00:00:49.550> a

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
there there's a headphone jack and a

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.149 
there there's a headphone jack and a
power<00:00:50.150> button<00:00:50.420> now<00:00:51.110> you<00:00:51.170> can<00:00:51.440> see<00:00:51.680> that<00:00:51.890> the

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
power button now you can see that the

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.380 
power button now you can see that the
camera<00:00:52.850> is<00:00:53.979> orientated<00:00:54.979> for<00:00:55.309> portrait<00:00:55.850> just

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
camera is orientated for portrait just

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.450 
camera is orientated for portrait just
like<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.659> front-facing<00:00:56.989> camera<00:00:57.559> here<00:00:58.220> also

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
like the front-facing camera here also

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.929 
like the front-facing camera here also
for<00:00:59.170> portrait<00:01:00.170> now<00:01:00.290> this<00:01:00.470> is<00:01:00.619> an<00:01:00.739> HD<00:01:01.100> to<00:01:01.220> HD

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:01.939 
for portrait now this is an HD to HD

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:04.390 
for portrait now this is an HD to HD
display<00:01:02.540> now<00:01:03.049> this<00:01:03.170> is<00:01:03.229> a<00:01:03.379> prototype<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:04.280> a

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
display now this is a prototype and a

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.730 
display now this is a prototype and a
reference<00:01:04.850> design<00:01:05.119> so<00:01:05.390> things<00:01:06.350> are<00:01:06.500> a<00:01:06.530> little

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
reference design so things are a little

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.590 
reference design so things are a little
jumpy<00:01:07.460> right<00:01:07.640> now<00:01:07.850> but<00:01:08.060> right<00:01:08.090> here<00:01:08.390> on<00:01:08.509> the

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
jumpy right now but right here on the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.020 
jumpy right now but right here on the
bottom<00:01:08.720> we<00:01:09.020> have<00:01:09.049> a<00:01:09.280> mini<00:01:10.280> disc<00:01:10.520> or<00:01:10.759> micro

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
bottom we have a mini disc or micro

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.920 
bottom we have a mini disc or micro
DisplayPort<00:01:11.689> and<00:01:11.930> micro<00:01:12.350> USB<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.600> not<00:01:14.600> too

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
DisplayPort and micro USB and not too

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.100 
DisplayPort and micro USB and not too
much<00:01:15.110> else<00:01:15.470> in<00:01:16.460> terms<00:01:16.790> of<00:01:16.939> connectivity<00:01:17.659> so

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
much else in terms of connectivity so

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.749 
much else in terms of connectivity so
I'm<00:01:18.439> wondering<00:01:18.770> if<00:01:19.100> we're<00:01:19.250> not<00:01:19.400> going<00:01:19.580> to<00:01:19.640> be

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
I'm wondering if we're not going to be

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.039 
I'm wondering if we're not going to be
seeing<00:01:20.090> any<00:01:20.270> any<00:01:21.170> 3g<00:01:22.210> options<00:01:23.210> on<00:01:23.450> this<00:01:23.659> tablet

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
seeing any any 3g options on this tablet

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.590 
seeing any any 3g options on this tablet
here<00:01:24.799> but<00:01:25.520> like<00:01:25.640> I<00:01:25.759> mentioned<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:26.150> display<00:01:26.420> is

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
here but like I mentioned the display is

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.810 
here but like I mentioned the display is
1080p<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.770> is<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.040> get<00:01:28.159> a<00:01:28.220> quick<00:01:28.370> look<00:01:28.580> at<00:01:28.700> the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
1080p and is to get a quick look at the

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.870 
1080p and is to get a quick look at the
performance<00:01:29.890> so<00:01:30.890> let's<00:01:31.040> play<00:01:31.190> in<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.400> tropics

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
performance so let's play in the tropics

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.920 
performance so let's play in the tropics
here

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:44.200 

there<00:01:35.560> we<00:01:35.710> go

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.840 

we<00:01:44.900> went<00:01:45.140> through<00:01:45.260> the<00:01:45.350> briefing<00:01:45.740> all<00:01:46.640> right

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
we went through the briefing all right

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.840 
we went through the briefing all right
let's<00:01:47.030> tap<00:01:47.240> on<00:01:47.450> through

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.460 

so<00:01:52.420> one<00:01:52.570> of<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.750> things<00:01:52.810> that<00:01:53.049> they<00:01:53.439> are

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
so one of the things that they are

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.760 
so one of the things that they are
talking<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.950> lot<00:01:54.130> about<00:01:54.189> for<00:01:55.500> Bay<00:01:56.500> Trail

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
talking a lot about for Bay Trail

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.190 
talking a lot about for Bay Trail
tablets<00:01:57.250> is<00:01:57.369> that<00:01:57.549> they<00:01:57.700> are<00:01:57.909> able<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.900> handle

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
tablets is that they are able to handle

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.410 
tablets is that they are able to handle
very<00:02:00.100> high<00:02:00.340> graphics<00:02:00.640> one<00:02:01.119> of<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.299> other

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
very high graphics one of the other

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
very high graphics one of the other
demos<00:02:01.840> that<00:02:01.869> we<00:02:02.619> saw<00:02:02.860> was<00:02:03.369> a<00:02:03.670> halo<00:02:04.540> demo<00:02:04.780> demo

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
demos that we saw was a halo demo demo

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.190 
demos that we saw was a halo demo demo
and<00:02:05.799> an<00:02:05.890> asphalt<00:02:06.460> 8<00:02:06.850> I<00:02:09.569> have<00:02:10.569> no<00:02:10.750> idea<00:02:10.869> how<00:02:11.140> to

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
and an asphalt 8 I have no idea how to

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.440 
and an asphalt 8 I have no idea how to
play<00:02:11.380> this<00:02:11.530> game<00:02:11.739> oh<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.100> just<00:02:12.220> point<00:02:12.610> tap<00:02:13.300> at

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
play this game oh I just point tap at

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.270 
play this game oh I just point tap at
him<00:02:13.569> it's<00:02:14.230> probably<00:02:14.500> not<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.709> graphically

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
him it's probably not that graphically
