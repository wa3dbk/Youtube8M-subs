00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
forward to that and then I've also

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.640 
forward to that and then I've also
started<00:04:30.750> recording<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:32.080> new<00:04:32.230> game<00:04:32.440> that<00:04:32.470> I

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
started recording the new game that I

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.740 
started recording the new game that I
wanted<00:04:33.010> to<00:04:33.070> start<00:04:33.310> recording<00:04:33.520> what<00:04:34.300> least<00:04:34.480> one

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
wanted to start recording what least one

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.510 
wanted to start recording what least one
of<00:04:34.780> them<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.350> it's<00:04:35.860> going<00:04:36.040> reasonably<00:04:36.460> well

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
of them and it's going reasonably well

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.350 
of them and it's going reasonably well
I'm<00:04:36.940> happy<00:04:37.630> with<00:04:37.810> it<00:04:37.990> so<00:04:38.020> far<00:04:38.170> I<00:04:38.650> am<00:04:39.250> gonna<00:04:39.850> try

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
I'm happy with it so far I am gonna try

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.110 
I'm happy with it so far I am gonna try
record<00:04:41.170> the<00:04:41.350> entirety<00:04:42.040> of<00:04:42.070> it<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:42.700> it's<00:04:43.030> a

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
record the entirety of it and it's a

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.850 
record the entirety of it and it's a
weird<00:04:43.330> way<00:04:43.480> of<00:04:43.510> doing<00:04:43.840> things<00:04:43.990> i'll<00:04:44.230> just<00:04:44.410> say

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
weird way of doing things i'll just say

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.340 
weird way of doing things i'll just say
that<00:04:45.070> again<00:04:45.220> put<00:04:45.910> it<00:04:46.030> out<00:04:46.150> there<00:04:46.420> I<00:04:46.600> know<00:04:46.690> it<00:04:47.140> is

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
that again put it out there I know it is

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.610 
that again put it out there I know it is
because<00:04:48.100> I<00:04:48.160> kind<00:04:48.400> of<00:04:48.520> tend<00:04:49.330> to<00:04:49.510> prefer<00:04:49.780> getting

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
because I kind of tend to prefer getting

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.250 
because I kind of tend to prefer getting
