 It takes about 20 minutes just for that long 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.160
 how to cook the spaghetti al dente 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:28.160

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.610
 At least it should be known of chili tomatoes 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:39.520

 Garlic is not so much garlic 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.390
 take the capping here as well 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.300
 By the way , it is already less 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.730
 two people and each black olives 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.560
 must pay attention to it though black 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.820
 Olives buys them for the most part 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.590
 not really mature 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.650
 olives but are just kinda 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.049
 dyed with what and what were those with 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.509
 Stones I have turned off but so 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.700
 There are already some we are already 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.000
 small, I can say that I save the work 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.790
 here as a job because many let the 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.850
 me because they dissolve anyway 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.280
 when they come to the polling stations and 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.220
 here the parsley just so small 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:45.049
 Cut and now start with us 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.939
 to court and gemeinhardt in the pot have 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.610
 I already have plenty of water for the spaghetti 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:53.000
 I have already turned it on and it 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.969
 is getting hot and here ours can 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.630
 The order also make time and indeed to 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.630
 good job 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.440
 I have something in the pan 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.440
 olive oil 21 times until it's really hot like that 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:15.560
 the oil is hot i start with one 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:17.690
 global wants about a minute 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.690
 and then come the other ingredients 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.570
 to it on it has already got color 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:34.750
 now the policing comes in 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:34.750
 The cappings and the teenie band are preparing 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.280
 minute comes to the table fourth with 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.709
 a bit hard 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:53.909
 there you can really watch as yourself 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:57.500
 they could for a minute now 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.500
 here already the passed tomatoes at 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.470
 so can be at low heat 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.150
 just simmer 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.600
 if the sauce is a few minutes 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:21.170
 There was always something to shake 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:24.170
 parsley rhine not as much as you do 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.140
 but now sees the noodle water now 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.800
 you have to salt a lot and that first 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.830
 now if it does not cook from where 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.190
 Noodle water must be so salted that 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:40.209
 Let's try it tastes like one 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.940
 swallow more water then it's perfect 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:46.010
 can already our feintool and that 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.209
 It was not possible to do that back then 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.570
 fly together 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.930
 they also take in hand and turn 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.800
 Maybe you just see it 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.890
 twist like that 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.450
 in pot 1 and then let it fall 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.730
 catch so be ready 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.010
 and now nothing does not bother me so 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.090
 Call time to put those on the pack 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.680
 how long does the spaghetti say so 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.200
 I'll just let it cook in now 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.810
 I wait until now there are and start 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.620
 heard here as you can see it's like 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.350
 by itself 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.019
 in no case for the cooking water oil 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.639
 stir the rhine now and then 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.970
 then everything goes well then they stick too 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:31.199
 not together the spaghetti is ready 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.240
 I just turn it off and was 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:37.370
 Once upon a time I fish it just like that 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:41.000
 out and rudi with some cooking water 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.000
 just in the sauce 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.469
 mix floating sauce 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.990
 This is how it often looks like a finished dish 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.870
 something garnished with fresh parsley 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.430
 tastes pretty good anyway and now 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.590
 I wish you much success in 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:14.020
 Of course cooking was good 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.020
 and see you next time
