00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:10.940
 [Music] 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.530
 Mr. Youtube welcome first word today 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.360
 I want you sees the ex network 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.000
 introduce nik software 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.500
 this is a photo editing sap and 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.540
 First of all she really is really 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.120
 Well 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:26.420
 Let's take a look at it all here 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.770
 is the app and you see it here 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.260
 For example, we want that now 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:35.589
 not use but we take us 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.969
 a picture here from our mediathek 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:39.850
 and you already see the florianturm 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.069
 in the westfalenpark dortmund 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.149
 Now there are different things here 

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:47.749
 which one can adjust for example 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.010
 there is an automatic possibility then 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:50.449
 you have already been here automatically 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.819
 we can do that with the 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.089
 compare original and it insists 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:57.019
 you can leave a minimal difference 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.729
 we can now also with the finger 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.780
 go right or left here around the 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:05.500
 Contrast even further then change 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.410
 put up or here also the color 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.520
 to correct even more 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.290
 okay, even if that's funny 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.490
 looks how small we can do that and you 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.500
 see it is processed relatively quickly 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.080
 and the whole thing is done now is the 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.820
 sky a bit bright not so nice 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.340
 dark so we'll do it right now 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.020
 intense blue but we want the leftovers 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.420
 have maintained and that goes with it 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.010
 selective just and that is a feature 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.490
 which I just love 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:38.810
 I'm against him add and you miss it 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:42.740
 in the circle that means brightness and we 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.080
 but not ready now 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.330
 but have a situation 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.480
 and when we see it pull apart 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.600
 we already have everything a similar color 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.060
 like we clicked on that 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.020
 is now marked in red and if we 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.290
 that right now 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.650
 because they cause the sky to the sky 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.400
 put on the blue or bluish 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.890
 can also have a date 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.679
 we add here we do it 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.270
 same again here we enlarge 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.760
 the whole a bit and 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.760
 Also every ten we serve the color 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.890
 Maybe we should have the brightness 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.890
 take it out a bit more 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:32.300
 then acts the gray what canada yet so 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.300
 small 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.870
 finished here, too, of course you can 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.610
 still with the original change us 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.530
 look at that 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.640
 looks quite different here can 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.100
 We now also the usual things 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.180
 make as straight as we can 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:54.209
 to try a little here 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:59.030
 So individual topics against that so 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:02.209
 But we do not want we can here 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:06.780
 also adjust all other things like 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:13.230
 overall brightness of the image change 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:15.630
 a bit of depth of field or something 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.250
 bring in papers contrast of course 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.380
 increase or decrease a bit 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.610
 more color pure and note compensation 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:30.030
 Alessandro was a bit like that again 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.260
 and is able to trim it 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.140
 I also need all that 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.600
 Do not show now and then you'll see 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.209
 some filters on the one hand are black here 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.980
 and white , of course, does just that 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.370
 what they say to them does it 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.739
 black we know we can still 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.980
 Let's change the brightness again 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:53.400
 contrast and a bit like that 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.910
 we want to make whole grainy now 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.269
 but not back then there is also here 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.989
 so skilful vintage image have the like 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.880
 I see her again the texture quite 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.930
 high but light texture above 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.200
 We could still be there 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.370
 choose different looks again 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.400
 yes quite funny that you can do that 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.220
 a bit antiquated and here we can 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.750
 the arbitrary things still simple and 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:25.460
 Add two or take away 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.460
 drama is also quite nice as a filter 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:32.410
 stay this bill relatively fast 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.860
 but it still lasts, of course 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.639
 a little bit know the corners and 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.190
 make sharp 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.060
 Here we see how the radius projects 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.300
 want to use 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.139
 so now we have it all down here 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.650
 look around a bit 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.340
 here too we can get the strength 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.380
 so if we do not quite do that 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.460
 was so strong wanted 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.750
 now is very strong and you do not know 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:04.030
 quite so by valentin so relative 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:05.460
 far back that was the way it is there 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.520
 to that grant 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.740
 Here you can really shorten if in 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.740
 style just change the cd and also 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.810
 almost everything wants in the bars now 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.520
 shuffle also gives us a few 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.650
 possibilities that we do not have over 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.090
 diarrhea, but just have to 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.460
 good luck that leave no text is 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.560
 but also change 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:31.630
 whichever pleases me sees the 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.729
 but very good lead and if we can 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.820
 we can still have everything in a frame 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.590
 to set and this frame is the 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.199
 Well, there is not much 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:44.139
 selection 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:45.780
 that is already and you can now one 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.460
 change a bit so you can we 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:52.060
 the frame so far further inward 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.860
 hollow or outward and we can 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:06:01.030
 look thicker or thinner 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:03.840
 so it can actually go away and 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.770
 Now we have the finished picture here 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.069
 if we just got a Us 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.039
 comparison to look at before is yet 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:13.750
 to recognize a huge difference 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:15.430
 the app is impeccable you can almost 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.520
 it all makes foreign things different 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:21.099
 to create teachers and if there is still one 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.169
 maybe some more frames would give 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:25.599
 a few more filters then that would be 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:28.719
 even better, but she is like that 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:30.560
 really good for 93 and really 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:32.000
 It even supports raw files 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.830
 with the camera connection kit one 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.389
 would like to connect digital camera and the 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.800
 edit pictures directly on the ipad 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:39.290
 He wants to do that very well and then 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.650
 does not have to be in jpeg or png file first 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.030
 to transform the whole 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.560
 that is now going net but i hope so 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.850
 you liked the review and we did 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.260
 See you again soon makes it good 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.260
 until then and bye
