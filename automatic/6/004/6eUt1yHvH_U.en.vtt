00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
can look at when I'm rotating the camera

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.279 
can look at when I'm rotating the camera
around<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.520> or<00:00:20.699> looking<00:00:21.570> around<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.050> scene

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
around it or looking around the scene

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.580 
around it or looking around the scene
with<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.560> camera<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.570> I<00:00:24.570> don't<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:25.050> anything

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
with the camera so I don't have anything

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.730 
with the camera so I don't have anything
imported<00:00:26.310> yet<00:00:26.699> I've<00:00:26.789> only<00:00:27.260> manually<00:00:28.260> created

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
imported yet I've only manually created

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.420

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
sphere and plane they're the only things

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.420 
sphere and plane they're the only things
that<00:00:36.630> I've<00:00:36.750> made<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.200> scene<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.680> I've

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
that I've made in the scene and I've

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.080 
that I've made in the scene and I've
left<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.879> default<00:00:39.329> camera<00:00:39.600> sitting<00:00:40.379> here<00:00:41.090> so

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
left the default camera sitting here so

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.330 
left the default camera sitting here so
what<00:00:42.930> you'll<00:00:43.079> notice<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.980> if<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.219> hit

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
what you'll notice is that if we hit

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.740 
what you'll notice is that if we hit
play<00:00:45.440> we<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.649> see<00:00:46.829> everything<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.370> scene

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
play we can see everything in the scene

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.389 
play we can see everything in the scene
but<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.500> know<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.710> can't<00:00:50.039> move<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> camera

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
but you know you can't move the camera

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.979 
but you know you can't move the camera
around<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:51.030> need<00:00:51.449> some<00:00:51.719> sort<00:00:51.870> of

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
around you need some sort of

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.600 
around you need some sort of
interactivity<00:00:52.620> for<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> become

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
interactivity for it to become

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.689 
interactivity for it to become
interesting<00:00:54.920> so<00:00:55.920> what<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.270> do<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:58.699> import

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
interesting so what we can do is import

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.410 
interesting so what we can do is import
a<00:00:59.940> script<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.989> default<00:01:01.739> script<00:01:02.070> for<00:01:02.219> unity<00:01:02.609> that

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
a script a default script for unity that

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.990 
a script a default script for unity that
lets<00:01:03.660> us<00:01:04.010> orbit<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> camera<00:01:05.339> around<00:01:05.670> an

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
lets us orbit the camera around an

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.750 
lets us orbit the camera around an
object<00:01:06.180> sort<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.869> like<00:01:07.020> how<00:01:07.260> Sketchup<00:01:08.100> 3ds<00:01:08.460> Max

so<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.790> next<00:02:24.000> step<00:02:24.269> we<00:02:24.450> need<00:02:24.629> to<00:02:24.780> follow<00:02:24.989> to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
so the next step we need to follow to

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.380

to the left you know that the script
doesn't<00:02:41.190> know<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.610> until<00:02:41.909> we<00:02:42.090> tell<00:02:42.299> it<00:02:42.500> so

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
doesn't know that until we tell it so

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.990 
doesn't know that until we tell it so
what<00:02:43.709> we'll<00:02:43.860> do<00:02:44.069> is<00:02:44.280> we'll<00:02:44.400> make<00:02:44.549> it<00:02:44.610> rotate

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
what we'll do is we'll make it rotate

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.559 
what we'll do is we'll make it rotate
around<00:02:45.359> this<00:02:45.810> cube<00:02:46.319> here<00:02:46.910> now<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:47.970> way<00:02:48.209> we<00:02:48.390> do

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
around this cube here now the way we do

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.330 
around this cube here now the way we do
that<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:48.930> similar<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.410> how<00:02:49.560> we<00:02:49.590> attach<00:02:50.069> the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
that is similar to how we attach the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.849 
that is similar to how we attach the
script<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.090> camera<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:52.349> select<00:02:52.709> the

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
script to the camera you select the

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.309 
script to the camera you select the
camera<00:02:53.250> either<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.910> scene<00:02:54.180> or<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:55.230> the

camera either in the scene or in the
hierarchy<00:02:55.920> tab<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:56.780> then<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.810> can<00:02:58.230> find<00:02:59.010> the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
hierarchy tab and then you can find the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.089 
hierarchy tab and then you can find the
object<00:02:59.609> that<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.909> want<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.920> have<00:03:01.920> as<00:03:02.069> a

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
object that you want it to have as a

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.729 
object that you want it to have as a
target<00:03:02.640> so<00:03:02.940> we'll<00:03:03.780> just<00:03:03.989> click<00:03:04.290> on<00:03:04.530> one<00:03:04.560> of

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
find out yes that's the right cube or or

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.430 
find out yes that's the right cube or or
whatever<00:03:34.370> so<00:03:35.370> now<00:03:35.750> now<00:03:36.750> we've<00:03:36.959> set<00:03:37.230> up<00:03:37.260> our

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
whatever so now now we've set up our

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.509 
whatever so now now we've set up our
camera<00:03:38.780> so<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:39.930> can<00:03:40.079> orbit<00:03:40.349> around<00:03:40.650> this<00:03:41.099> cube

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
camera so it can orbit around this cube

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.460 
camera so it can orbit around this cube
so<00:03:41.730> if<00:03:41.849> I<00:03:42.000> hit<00:03:42.120> play<00:03:44.810> wait<00:03:45.810> a<00:03:45.840> second<00:03:46.290> for<00:03:46.319> it<00:03:46.410> to

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
so if I hit play wait a second for it to

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.330 
so if I hit play wait a second for it to
pop<00:03:46.739> up<00:03:47.180> move<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.389> mouse<00:03:48.599> around<00:03:49.099> you'll<00:03:50.099> see

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
pop up move the mouse around you'll see

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.180 
pop up move the mouse around you'll see

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
and moving the mouse up and down rotates

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.580 
and moving the mouse up and down rotates
it<00:04:01.739> up<00:04:01.889> and<00:04:02.099> down<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.870> a<00:04:03.870> handy<00:04:04.349> little<00:04:04.500> thing

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
it up and down and a handy little thing

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.229 
it up and down and a handy little thing
that<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.949> script<00:04:05.250> is<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.639> limits<00:04:05.849> how

accidentally flip over it and you know

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.229 
accidentally flip over it and you know
have<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.739> camera<00:04:14.069> upside<00:04:14.489> down<00:04:14.760> in<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.000> scene

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
have the camera upside down in the scene

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.279 
have the camera upside down in the scene
or<00:04:15.419> anything<00:04:15.480> like<00:04:15.870> that

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
or anything like that

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.500 
or anything like that
so<00:04:17.010> it's<00:04:17.160> great<00:04:17.370> if<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.699> want<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.389> do

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
so it's great if you want to do

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.969 
so it's great if you want to do
something<00:04:18.840> like<00:04:18.959> have<00:04:19.169> an<00:04:19.260> object<00:04:19.410> sitting<00:04:19.889> on

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
something like have an object sitting on

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.430 
something like have an object sitting on
a<00:04:20.010> desk<00:04:20.220> that<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:20.609> can<00:04:20.699> look<00:04:21.060> at<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.450> orbit

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
a desk that you can look at and orbit

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.020 
a desk that you can look at and orbit
around<00:04:22.560> while<00:04:23.039> it's<00:04:23.190> animating

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
around while it's animating

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.910 
around while it's animating
something<00:04:24.420> like<00:04:24.600> that<00:04:26.240> now<00:04:27.240> the<00:04:27.900> other<00:04:28.050> simple

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
something like that now the other simple

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.840 
something like that now the other simple
way<00:04:29.040> to<00:04:29.070> get<00:04:29.430> a<00:04:30.000> camera<00:04:31.130> moving<00:04:32.130> around<00:04:32.490> in<00:04:32.730> the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
way to get a camera moving around in the

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.680 
way to get a camera moving around in the
scene<00:04:33.120> is<00:04:33.800> to<00:04:34.800> use<00:04:35.669> one<00:04:35.970> of<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.150> scripts<00:04:36.480> that

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
scene is to use one of the scripts that

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.830 
scene is to use one of the scripts that
comes<00:04:36.930> with<00:04:37.139> the<00:04:37.260> character<00:04:37.770> controller

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
comes with the character controller

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.690 
comes with the character controller
asset<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.620> what<00:04:40.770> I'll<00:04:40.889> do<00:04:41.040> is<00:04:41.160> I'll<00:04:41.310> remove

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
asset so what I'll do is I'll remove

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.700 
asset so what I'll do is I'll remove
this<00:04:41.970> mouse<00:04:42.270> orbit<00:04:42.690> script<00:04:43.050> from<00:04:43.290> this<00:04:43.470> camera

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
this mouse orbit script from this camera

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.180 
this mouse orbit script from this camera
by<00:04:44.150> selecting<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.300> camera<00:04:45.620> hovering<00:04:46.620> over

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
by selecting the camera hovering over

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.150 
by selecting the camera hovering over
the<00:04:47.310> title<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:48.030> this<00:04:48.330> component<00:04:49.130> you<00:04:50.130> can

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
the title of this component you can

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.030 
the title of this component you can
right<00:04:50.580> click<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:51.120> click<00:04:51.690> remove<00:04:52.200> component

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
right click and click remove component

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.060 
right click and click remove component
and<00:04:53.190> that'll<00:04:53.550> get<00:04:53.880> rid<00:04:53.910> of<00:04:54.090> it<00:04:54.830> you<00:04:55.830> can<00:04:55.950> do

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
and that'll get rid of it you can do

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.650 
and that'll get rid of it you can do
that<00:04:56.190> to<00:04:56.340> remove<00:04:56.580> any<00:04:56.760> component<00:04:57.360> by<00:04:57.419> the<00:04:57.480> way

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
that to remove any component by the way

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.290 
that to remove any component by the way
except<00:04:58.080> for<00:04:58.140> I<00:04:58.320> think<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.740> transform<00:04:59.520> which

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
except for I think the transform which

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.140 
except for I think the transform which
has<00:05:00.570> to<00:05:00.690> be<00:05:00.810> there<00:05:00.990> by<00:05:01.140> default<00:05:04.550> so<00:05:05.550> what<00:05:05.940> we'll

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
has to be there by default so what we'll

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.530 
has to be there by default so what we'll
do<00:05:06.360> now<00:05:06.570> is<00:05:06.600> we'll<00:05:07.110> import<00:05:07.380> another<00:05:07.560> asset

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
do now is we'll import another asset

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.420

wait a little while for the scripts to

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.330 
wait a little while for the scripts to
compile<00:05:17.370> and<00:05:17.760> all<00:05:18.090> that<00:05:18.360> sort<00:05:18.600> of<00:05:18.630> stuff<00:05:18.690> and

compile and all that sort of stuff and

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.070

the new folder appears under the project

controller<00:05:32.190> and<00:05:32.940> if<00:05:33.060> we<00:05:33.180> expand<00:05:33.660> sources<00:05:34.380> and

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740

scripts<00:05:35.450> we'll<00:05:36.450> see<00:05:36.720> a<00:05:36.750> script<00:05:37.140> called

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
scripts we'll see a script called

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.510 
scripts we'll see a script called
mouselook<00:05:38.600> which<00:05:39.600> lets<00:05:40.110> you<00:05:40.490> set<00:05:41.490> the

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
mouselook which lets you set the

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.670 
mouselook which lets you set the
rotation<00:05:42.270> of<00:05:42.390> an<00:05:42.539> object<00:05:42.630> by<00:05:43.110> moving<00:05:43.560> the

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
rotation of an object by moving the

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.420 
rotation of an object by moving the
mouse<00:05:43.800> around<00:05:44.630> and<00:05:45.740> most<00:05:46.740> of<00:05:46.890> the<00:05:46.950> time<00:05:47.190> you'll

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
mouse around and most of the time you'll

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.409 
mouse around and most of the time you'll
you'll<00:05:47.669> be<00:05:47.850> doing<00:05:48.090> that<00:05:48.289> for<00:05:49.289> a<00:05:49.350> camera<00:05:49.910> so<00:05:50.910> the

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
you'll be doing that for a camera so the

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.840 
you'll be doing that for a camera so the
law<00:05:51.810> will<00:05:52.200> apply<00:05:52.320> the<00:05:52.530> script<00:05:52.979> to<00:05:53.130> the<00:05:53.430> camera

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
law will apply the script to the camera

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.190 
law will apply the script to the camera
the<00:05:53.970> same<00:05:54.120> way<00:05:54.330> make<00:05:54.600> sure<00:05:54.780> the<00:05:54.900> camera<00:05:55.169> is

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
the same way make sure the camera is

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.190 
the same way make sure the camera is
selected<00:05:55.740> then<00:05:56.520> click<00:05:56.880> and<00:05:57.030> drag<00:05:57.150> the<00:05:57.750> script

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
selected then click and drag the script

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.219 
selected then click and drag the script
from<00:05:58.860> the<00:05:58.979> project<00:05:59.430> tab<00:05:59.760> over<00:06:00.690> to<00:06:00.960> the

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
from the project tab over to the

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:06.560 
from the project tab over to the
inspector<00:06:01.500> tab<00:06:01.950> and<00:06:02.400> let<00:06:03.240> go<00:06:03.450> and<00:06:05.539> the<00:06:06.539> the

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
inspector tab and let go and the the

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.029 
inspector tab and let go and the the
difference<00:06:07.080> of<00:06:07.229> this<00:06:07.320> script<00:06:07.590> as<00:06:07.740> well<00:06:07.770> is

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
difference of this script as well is

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:09.409 
difference of this script as well is
that<00:06:08.190> it<00:06:08.280> you<00:06:08.460> don't<00:06:08.640> need<00:06:08.760> to<00:06:08.820> tell<00:06:09.120> it<00:06:09.150> what

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
that it you don't need to tell it what

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.750 
that it you don't need to tell it what
object<00:06:09.840> to<00:06:09.960> rotate<00:06:10.140> around<00:06:10.440> because<00:06:11.010> it's

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
object to rotate around because it's

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.560 
object to rotate around because it's
rotating<00:06:12.570> around<00:06:12.660> the<00:06:12.960> cameras<00:06:13.470> position

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
rotating around the cameras position

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.360 
rotating around the cameras position
rather<00:06:15.570> than<00:06:15.870> a<00:06:15.900> position<00:06:16.770> that's<00:06:16.979> somewhere

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
rather than a position that's somewhere

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.920 
rather than a position that's somewhere
else<00:06:17.550> that<00:06:17.880> it<00:06:18.150> doesn't<00:06:18.390> know<00:06:18.479> about

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
else that it doesn't know about

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.110 
else that it doesn't know about
so<00:06:19.710> this<00:06:19.890> script<00:06:20.250> is<00:06:20.370> actually<00:06:20.700> good<00:06:20.850> to<00:06:20.970> go

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
so this script is actually good to go

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.450 
so this script is actually good to go
from<00:06:21.479> the<00:06:22.169> start<00:06:22.470> so<00:06:22.710> we'll<00:06:22.800> move<00:06:22.979> the<00:06:23.160> camera

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
from the start so we'll move the camera

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.900 
from the start so we'll move the camera
over<00:06:23.789> into<00:06:24.120> the<00:06:24.240> scene<00:06:25.310> somewhere<00:06:26.310> you<00:06:26.789> know

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
over into the scene somewhere you know

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.640 
over into the scene somewhere you know
kind<00:06:27.270> of<00:06:27.330> interesting<00:06:27.870> maybe<00:06:28.050> like<00:06:28.289> right<00:06:28.500> in

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 
to get a point of view like a

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.620 
to get a point of view like a
first-person<00:06:54.880> point<00:06:55.420> of<00:06:55.600> view<00:06:55.840> in<00:06:56.050> the<00:06:56.170> level

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:57.630 
first-person point of view in the level

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.170 
first-person point of view in the level
and<00:06:58.630> then<00:06:58.750> matter<00:06:59.080> of<00:06:59.260> fact<00:06:59.470> these<00:06:59.940> the<00:07:00.940> the

first-person<00:07:01.720> controller<00:07:02.440> prefab<00:07:03.070> just<00:07:03.700> down

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:03.910 
first-person controller prefab just down

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.430 
first-person controller prefab just down
here<00:07:04.890> uses<00:07:05.890> that<00:07:06.210> this<00:07:07.210> script<00:07:07.630> to<00:07:07.960> to<00:07:08.200> let<00:07:08.350> you

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440 
here uses that this script to to let you

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.750 
here uses that this script to to let you
look<00:07:08.620> around<00:07:09.330> so<00:07:10.330> just<00:07:10.990> stop<00:07:11.970> playing<00:07:12.970> and

yeah that that pretty much covers the

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.530 
yeah that that pretty much covers the
basics<00:07:18.160> of<00:07:18.310> how<00:07:18.370> to<00:07:18.700> make<00:07:18.910> a<00:07:18.940> camera<00:07:19.390> look

around without needing to get too much

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.920 
around without needing to get too much
into<00:07:21.490> scripting<00:07:21.970> or<00:07:22.120> anything<00:07:22.300> like<00:07:22.540> that<00:07:22.600> at
