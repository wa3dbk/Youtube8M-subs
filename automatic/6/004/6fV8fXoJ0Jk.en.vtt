00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
that the LEDs have stopped flashing and

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.920 
that the LEDs have stopped flashing and
also<00:02:31.980> there's<00:02:32.310> no<00:02:32.489> sound<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:38.750> just<00:02:39.750> stopped

also there's no sound I just stopped

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.830 
also there's no sound I just stopped
that<00:02:40.080> track<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:40.830> on<00:02:41.330> channel<00:02:42.330> one<00:02:42.540> will<00:02:42.720> look

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
that track so on channel one will look

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.990 
that track so on channel one will look
at<00:02:42.959> channel<00:02:43.200> one<00:02:43.500> channel<00:02:43.709> two<00:02:44.430> three<00:02:44.820> and

at channel one channel two three and
four<00:02:45.269> near<00:02:45.900> enough<00:02:46.080> exactly<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.709> same<00:02:46.950> but<00:02:46.980> i

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
four near enough exactly the same but i

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.949 
four near enough exactly the same but i
will<00:02:47.400> be<00:02:47.430> explaining<00:02:47.640> how<00:02:48.209> they<00:02:48.330> are<00:02:48.480> slightly

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
will be explaining how they are slightly

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.300 
will be explaining how they are slightly

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.090 
above the mid above that we have trim
above<00:03:12.360> that<00:03:12.540> we<00:03:12.720> have<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> switch<00:03:13.290> this<00:03:13.890> will

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
above that we have a switch this will

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.180 
above that we have a switch this will
enable<00:03:14.340> us<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.730> use<00:03:15.510> different<00:03:16.170> music<00:03:16.739> sources

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
in this one channel so if we switch that

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.370 
in this one channel so if we switch that
all<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.579> way<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.940> left<00:03:21.150> we<00:03:21.870> can<00:03:22.049> have<00:03:22.230> a

on it now again I will be explaining in
future<00:04:45.280> tutorials<00:04:45.490> how<00:04:46.090> we<00:04:46.150> can<00:04:46.390> use<00:04:46.600> that<00:04:46.810> to

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
future tutorials how we can use that to

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.350
