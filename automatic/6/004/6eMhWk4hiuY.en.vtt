now<00:00:00.179> here<00:00:00.480> we<00:00:00.599> have<00:00:00.750> a<00:00:00.780> cell<00:00:01.429> by<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.490> way<00:00:02.700> we're

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
now here we have a cell by the way we're

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.940 
now here we have a cell by the way we're
only<00:00:03.060> talking<00:00:03.330> about<00:00:03.570> one<00:00:03.720> cell<00:00:04.259> in<00:00:04.290> this<00:00:04.680> case

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
only talking about one cell in this case

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.930 
only talking about one cell in this case
because<00:00:05.279> we<00:00:05.759> have<00:00:05.910> two<00:00:06.180> electrodes<00:00:07.250> so<00:00:08.250> one

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
because we have two electrodes so one

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.660 
because we have two electrodes so one
cell<00:00:09.290> here<00:00:10.290> we<00:00:10.410> have<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.559> cell<00:00:10.889> which<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.370> under

cell here we have a cell which is under
non<00:00:12.139> standard<00:00:15.800> conditions<00:00:16.800> we<00:00:17.039> see<00:00:17.310> that

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
non standard conditions we see that

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.779 
non standard conditions we see that
right<00:00:17.760> away<00:00:21.650> the<00:00:22.650> concentrations<00:00:23.550> are

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
right away the concentrations are

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.170 
right away the concentrations are
non-standard<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.800> immediately<00:00:26.609> drives

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180
