 do not know I'm there youtuber and 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.680
 more time and I put some 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.410
 youtube videos surely there finally on 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.090
 youtube in front of each other sometimes I do 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.359
 often lamented the absence is gone I 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.279
 were playing with acm 1920 otherwise I 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.989
 would change big capacity but of any 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.950
 how you will have as usual 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.219
 the class on the screen now and so 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.950
 here 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.540
 in this gameplay I was playing at the beginning at the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.350
 mcc will want globe I tried to do 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.610
 love with its overarming mistakes 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.289
 what I managed my brakes in this 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.120
 gameplay but arrives on terminal which 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.280
 will come soon christmas and this part 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.379
 it's a second or third time 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.300
 I had after my return from a month 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.239
 and a half without playing and without diving 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:07.439
 completely not at all in my room 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:09.090
 so I was a little unheated we're going 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.530
 to say and if I do weird things 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.380
 I completely remove it next to a 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.439
 riser like that it's normal is that 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.430
 I was more used to playing all the 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:24.750
 time so the mouse will talk to you a little 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.369
 of what will happen there in this 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.829
 year on this year I think and we 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.210
 will see the new year 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.540
 So school as I said in an ai 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.920
 previous video we will have a new I 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.840
 I have a new verse to do in 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.840
 kind of have a new mindset I 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.060
 do a new age and ask a guy 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.549
 ex out of you make a new step of 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.110
 salt grain outreau 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.750
 olympio is a little bit east to 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.280
 the videos to make everything new and I 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.020
 you like someone to make a 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.130
 intro but a nice intro with the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.140
 quality because the antechamber 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.229
 it's very important to the video and a 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.090
 once a really a nice intro I get 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.729
 am already subscribing to just channels 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.280
 for the intro because I found 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.700
 she was really cool 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.830
 finally I wanted to tell you there is 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.420
 lots of people wondering if I 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.040
 will always make videos every day 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.720
 months every day and all because 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.480
 that it's a little full there 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.830
 have really found that I am and 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.510
 guess where every day it really is 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.760
 something very different than 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.890
 I was really subscribed for that so 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.660
 as you see I make videos 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.500

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.900

 psychology and yes I will live everything 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.880
 alone there I could make videos 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.190
 when I actually play because nobody 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.510
 do not have one I'm really really 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.889
 happy to go there alone because 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.810
 that it's really an experience that 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.819
 I want to know der 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.440
 do not we like this one 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:49.319
 the words before assistance 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.299
 it's so good finally short so I 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.920
 live alone 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.799
 I would have more my parents my brother where 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.590
 I do not know who my dog ​​for 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:03.080
 interrupt job as interest 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.340
 and that's why for 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.430
 the moment I can not say too much video 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.870
 since I am I am going to move I 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.269
 to take no papers and all 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.769
 so I have a lot of stuff to do my 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.160
 father made me for the horsehair 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:18.290
 lots of stuff to do so it's for 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.190
 this is how I do the 10-15 not I 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.870
 can not make videos every 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.760
 days I think once I'll be 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.160
 well installed I will have a good 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.449
 Internet connection 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.370
 I could make videos every 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.660
 days but still need I have the 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.770
 good internet connection there because 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.090
 that I do not know how internet is going 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.130
 to be I hope it's going to be worse 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.900
 that here even if the asse has improved 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.840
 after the holidays I complained 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.810
 abandoned to have a single connection 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.510

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.780
 income a little bit like before like you 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.110
 this income well so that's the end of the 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.870
