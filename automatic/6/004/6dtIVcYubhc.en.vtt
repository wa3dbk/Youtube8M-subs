00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
would be a great knife now keep in mind

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.420 
would be a great knife now keep in mind
that<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.690> price<00:03:57.989> is<00:03:58.019> going<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.650> be<00:03:58.860> quite<00:03:59.400> a

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
that the price is going to be quite a

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.020 
that the price is going to be quite a
bit<00:03:59.640> more<00:03:59.880> as<00:04:00.180> well<00:04:00.450> I<00:04:00.720> think<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:02.040> MSRP<00:04:02.760> on

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
bit more as well I think the MSRP on

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.030 
bit more as well I think the MSRP on
this<00:04:03.360> knife<00:04:03.600> right<00:04:03.989> now<00:04:04.380> is<00:04:05.090> around<00:04:06.380> 180<00:04:07.380> 190

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
this knife right now is around 180 190

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.410 
this knife right now is around 180 190
to<00:04:08.340> somewhere<00:04:08.850> in<00:04:08.910> there<00:04:10.670> but<00:04:11.670> I<00:04:11.700> I<00:04:12.120> know<00:04:12.239> you

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
to somewhere in there but I I know you

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.890 
to somewhere in there but I I know you
can<00:04:12.780> find<00:04:13.110> it<00:04:13.260> for<00:04:13.290> cheaper<00:04:14.120> it's<00:04:15.120> really<00:04:15.660> up

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
can find it for cheaper it's really up

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.690 
can find it for cheaper it's really up
to<00:04:16.049> where<00:04:16.200> you<00:04:16.350> get<00:04:16.560> your<00:04:16.650> knives<00:04:16.890> I<00:04:17.310> always

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
to where you get your knives I always

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.180 
to where you get your knives I always
try<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.150> cut<00:04:18.390> myself<00:04:18.979> and<00:04:19.979> it<00:04:20.640> is<00:04:20.880> very<00:04:20.910> sharp

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
try to cut myself and it is very sharp

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.860 
try to cut myself and it is very sharp
so<00:04:23.190> we<00:04:23.370> may<00:04:23.550> find<00:04:23.880> a<00:04:24.030> little<00:04:24.300> cut<00:04:24.539> on<00:04:24.570> her

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
so we may find a little cut on her

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.360 
so we may find a little cut on her
finger<00:04:25.229> later

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
finger later

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.189 
finger later
no<00:04:26.729> I'm<00:04:26.850> good<00:04:27.060> I'm<00:04:27.540> good<00:04:27.600> folks<00:04:28.880> know<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.240> it

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
no I'm good I'm good folks know the it

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.770 
no I'm good I'm good folks know the it
is<00:04:31.830> put<00:04:32.100> together<00:04:32.220> with<00:04:32.639> torque<00:04:33.000> bit<00:04:33.210> that's

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
is put together with torque bit that's

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.300 
is put together with torque bit that's
something<00:04:34.169> that<00:04:34.199> bench<00:04:34.560> May<00:04:34.800> does<00:04:35.040> pretty

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
something that bench May does pretty

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.879 
something that bench May does pretty
standard<00:04:35.850> so<00:04:36.330> it's<00:04:36.510> real<00:04:36.720> easy<00:04:36.750> to<00:04:37.139> adjust<00:04:37.440> if

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
standard so it's real easy to adjust if

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.250 
standard so it's real easy to adjust if
