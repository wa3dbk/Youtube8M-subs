thought would happen

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.429 
thought would happen
I'm<00:01:40.320> not<00:01:40.619> sure<00:01:41.210> if<00:01:42.210> they<00:01:42.450> would<00:01:42.600> tech<00:01:42.869> into

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
I'm not sure if they would tech into

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:52.660 
I'm not sure if they would tech into
witches<00:01:43.619> would<00:01:43.950> technically<00:01:44.520> winner<00:01:44.909> or<00:01:45.149> not

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.440 

okay<00:01:53.670> if<00:01:54.509> all<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.990> all<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.310> mobs<00:01:56.549> tell<00:01:57.000> all

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
okay if all the all the mobs tell all

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.139 
okay if all the all the mobs tell all
the<00:01:57.630> energies<00:01:58.159> teleport<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.250> out<00:01:59.430> I'm<00:01:59.850> not

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
the energies teleport it out I'm not

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:08.919 
the energies teleport it out I'm not
sure<00:02:00.420> what<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.810> would<00:02:00.930> count<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.619> as

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.100 

well<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.250> guess<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.489> can<00:02:11.700> count<00:02:12.209> for<00:02:12.450> yourself

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
well I guess you can count for yourself

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.010 
well I guess you can count for yourself
both<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.190> mobs<00:02:14.459> are<00:02:14.730> still<00:02:14.970> alive<00:02:15.569> they

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
both of the mobs are still alive they

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.720 
both of the mobs are still alive they
cannot<00:02:16.440> attack<00:02:16.860> each<00:02:17.069> other<00:02:17.220> though<00:02:18.770> so<00:02:19.770> you

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
cannot attack each other though so you

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.479 
cannot attack each other though so you
will<00:02:20.849> get<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.180> decide<00:02:21.569> who<00:02:21.989> has<00:02:22.200> one<00:02:25.489> thanks

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489
