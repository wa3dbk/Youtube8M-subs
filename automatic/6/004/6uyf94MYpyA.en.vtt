00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:13.009
 hi everyone decided to make a video about how 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:18.740
 poison knives ready a lot of videos about 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:22.130
 etching, I decided to remove one more to that 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.400
 as there is quite a bit of these 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.400
 innovations 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.890
 I will begin to talk about the principle in which 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.260
 much was told maybe something 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.330
 someone that someone who does not know someone 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.430
 I saw for the first time show 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:46.820
 normal cellular charging is taken 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:50.120
 phone or is there some water? 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.290
 poured into the water tank should be 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:59.239
 salt very little water pinch 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:05.840
 a couple of salt salt dissolves what else 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:11.090
 we will need to take such a wadded 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.130
 innovation wand my little thing but 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.770
 someone can help me from nails 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.890
 I'm not in an apartment in a town not in a village 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:24.130
 time in all of our city was found here 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:26.540
 such is one needle stuck in the court side 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:33.320
 attached here minus it usually 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:38.210
 white here attached to the nose 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:42.490
 always plus plus usually red 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:46.520
 remember this important fact + red 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:50.780
 hardens on the knife here I am to my baku 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.090
 attached here so here what else we 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:58.520
 We need it even happens to me 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:01.720
 what else is needed first let's say need 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.380
 such a varnish is the cheapest most ordinary 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.840
 nail polish 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.200
 worth 21 rubles in any store 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.599
 cosmetics for sale 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.959
 there we buy a liquid to remove 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.959
 varnish 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:22.000
 stimulus can use acetone not 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:28.450
 itâ€™s important that this lacquer dissolve 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.069
 then take the varnish on the cartoon on the knife 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.769
 pre-need to degrease 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:38.860
 surely that is, we take a cotton pad 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:43.690
 we are wetting in acetone we wipe the knife 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:47.079
 dries quickly and then we apply varnish varnish 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.470
 dries within 50 minutes depending 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:53.079
 from the quality of varnish 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:57.910
 need not to be hard and soft 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:03:00.900
 so here was the topic 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.230
 clean up but I've decided to clean it 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:09.390
 toothpick trite toothpick of all 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:14.819
 Misha eats at home 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:18.790
 the toothpick removes the varnish thereby 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:23.079
 some kind of drawing i am here 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:29.319
 tried to make a dragon here 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:33.819
 I'll show you some money but I will 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:36.670
 draw a name not really put it to me 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.630
 it turned itself there the second time I 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.630
 just harassing 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:53.639
 moto decided not to do it 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:55.500
 blanks initials on the knife of such 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.820
 dirty 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:04.280
 she clean up 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:10.930
 well, etches dirt very iron 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.930
 very much we take it all so 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.190
 we put 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.580
 there is such a hiss quieter pini you 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:32.430
 going on means all right and 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:36.060
 fine this morning pours in such 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.300
 introduce all the blacks little by little if spikes 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.690
 doesn't happen for metal happens but 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.550
 doesn't squeeze out so black 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:50.039
 so you have a minus on the knife most likely 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:55.860
 she can up plus put it like this 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:05:03.530
 then to know this most important thing here 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:08.180
 I managed this well, as it means eagle 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:12.800
 this is the first lesson here is something turned out 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:16.680
 Of course, not extreme ugly nickname 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:21.539
 drawing a little clumsy but I principle you 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:24.090
 showed a small innovation 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:27.080
 so that you can use the needle it 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:34.199
 bills volume have toothpick 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:37.110
 can someone help this but also 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:42.110
 thought sat what to take something to take someone 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:44.520
 the bucket there is completely knife lowers i'm here 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:50.159
 decided to take a banal cap 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:53.970
 from under the jar and everything turned out great 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:57.470
