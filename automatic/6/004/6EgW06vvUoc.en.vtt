beginners<00:00:23.460> spin<00:00:24.300> pull<00:00:26.539> the<00:00:27.539> pencil<00:00:27.960> because

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
beginners spin pull the pencil because

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.470 
beginners spin pull the pencil because
it's<00:00:28.529> really<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.250> how<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:30.210> need<00:00:30.420> to

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
it's really to just you how you need to

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.319 
it's really to just you how you need to
use<00:00:30.599> your<00:00:30.810> core<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.380> whole<00:00:31.740> upper<00:00:32.040> body

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
use your core and whole upper body

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.940 
use your core and whole upper body
especially<00:00:33.329> your<00:00:33.570> back<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.170> really<00:00:34.559> control

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
especially your back to really control

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.139 
especially your back to really control
your<00:00:34.980> spin<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:36.800> let's<00:00:37.800> start<00:00:38.040> with<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.670> basic

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
your spin so let's start with a basic

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.690 
your spin so let's start with a basic
chair<00:00:39.710> just<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> get<00:00:40.950> back<00:00:41.100> together<00:00:41.250> with

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
chair just to get back together with

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.729 
chair just to get back together with
momentum<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.780> your<00:00:42.899> inside<00:00:43.200> arm<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.440> fully

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
momentum so your inside arm is fully

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.369 
momentum so your inside arm is fully
extended<00:00:43.890> when<00:00:44.850> we<00:00:44.969> go<00:00:45.239> into<00:00:45.420> our<00:00:45.539> spins<00:00:45.989> we

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
extended when we go into our spins we

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.260 
extended when we go into our spins we
want<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.800> use<00:00:47.010> our<00:00:47.190> outside<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.940> push<00:00:48.120> away

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
want to use our outside and to push away

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.170 
want to use our outside and to push away
at<00:00:48.809> armpit<00:00:49.440> height<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.489> I'm<00:00:50.760> going<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.969> go<00:00:51.059> into

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
at armpit height so I'm going to go into

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:02.680 
at armpit height so I'm going to go into
modify<00:00:51.570> chair<00:01:01.039> pushing<00:01:02.039> my<00:01:02.160> hips<00:01:02.399> back

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
modify chair pushing my hips back

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.670 
modify chair pushing my hips back
because<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.809> want<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.220> control<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:06.680> momentum

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
because I want to control the momentum

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.410 
because I want to control the momentum
the<00:01:07.770> way<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.950> wants<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> pull<00:01:08.460> my<00:01:08.610> hips<00:01:08.850> forward

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the way it wants to pull my hips forward

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.270 
the way it wants to pull my hips forward
so<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.689> don't<00:01:09.869> want<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.080> go<00:01:10.170> into<00:01:10.380> salon<00:01:11.100> just

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
so you don't want to go into salon just

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.380 
so you don't want to go into salon just
spin<00:01:11.520> pull<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> weight<00:01:12.000> weight<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
spin pull the weight weight on the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.300 
spin pull the weight weight on the
static<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.140> need<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.439> pull<00:01:13.650> back<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.250> I'm

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
static so you need to pull back so I'm

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.420 
static so you need to pull back so I'm
hiking<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.820> little<00:01:15.030> bit<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.630> control<00:01:16.080> that

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
hiking a little bit to control that

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.760 
hiking a little bit to control that
momentum<00:01:17.430> forward<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:19.229> if<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.380> watch<00:01:19.560> one

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
momentum forward so if you watch one

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.860 
momentum forward so if you watch one
more<00:01:19.860> time

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
more time

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.470 
more time
I'm<00:01:22.020> gonna<00:01:22.140> push<00:01:22.380> my<00:01:22.530> hips<00:01:22.680> back<00:01:23.300> extend<00:01:24.300> my

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
I'm gonna push my hips back extend my

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.530 
I'm gonna push my hips back extend my
outside<00:01:24.900> leg<00:01:25.110> my<00:01:25.590> inside<00:01:26.010> knee<00:01:26.430> as<00:01:27.150> friends

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
outside leg my inside knee as friends

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.630 
outside leg my inside knee as friends
it's<00:01:27.690> just<00:01:27.750> for<00:01:28.050> style<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:29.160> can<00:01:29.310> do<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.490> with

way<00:01:31.830> our<00:01:32.100> hiking<00:01:32.730> so<00:01:32.880> I'll<00:01:32.970> show<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.390> as

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
way our hiking so I'll show you it as

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.810 
way our hiking so I'll show you it as
I'm<00:01:33.720> spinning<00:01:34.140> changing<00:01:34.980> the<00:01:35.490> different

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
I'm spinning changing the different

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:48.140 
I'm spinning changing the different
options<00:01:45.290> with<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.430> you'll<00:01:47.430> notice<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.700> I

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
options with that you'll notice that I

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.610 
options with that you'll notice that I
have<00:01:48.360> distance<00:01:48.930> from<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.140> pole

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
have distance from the pole

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.670 
have distance from the pole
I'm<00:01:50.160> not<00:01:50.460> letting<00:01:50.760> myself<00:01:50.910> come<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.870> so<00:01:52.470> when<00:01:52.650> I

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
I'm not letting myself come in so when I

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.430 
I'm not letting myself come in so when I
push<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.310> off<00:01:53.550> into<00:01:53.940> this<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.390> definitely<00:01:55.320> want

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
push it off into this I definitely want

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.290 
push it off into this I definitely want
to<00:01:55.470> maintain<00:01:55.860> my<00:01:56.010> distance<00:01:56.400> by<00:01:56.640> using<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:57.060> hand

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
to maintain my distance by using a hand

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.630 
to maintain my distance by using a hand
to<00:01:57.450> help<00:01:57.600> push<00:01:57.840> away<00:01:57.990> I'm<00:01:58.620> squeezing<00:01:58.980> into<00:01:59.310> my

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
to help push away I'm squeezing into my

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.660 
to help push away I'm squeezing into my
back<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.240> utilize<00:02:00.600> my<00:02:01.080> back<00:02:01.260> muscles<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.890> help

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
back to utilize my back muscles to help

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.190 
back to utilize my back muscles to help
support<00:02:03.000> my<00:02:03.180> shoulders<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.750> don't<00:02:03.930> want<00:02:04.050> to<00:02:04.110> be

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
support my shoulders I don't want to be

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.050 
support my shoulders I don't want to be
hanging<00:02:04.710> from<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.950> pole<00:02:05.190> and<00:02:05.430> then<00:02:05.910> I'm

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
hanging from the pole and then I'm

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.270 
hanging from the pole and then I'm
holding<00:02:06.480> my<00:02:06.570> core<00:02:06.870> really<00:02:07.620> tightly<00:02:07.980> to

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
holding my core really tightly to

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.380 
holding my core really tightly to
control<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.760> whole<00:02:08.820> movement<00:02:09.380> so<00:02:11.210> those<00:02:12.210> are

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
control this whole movement so those are

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.600 
control this whole movement so those are
one<00:02:12.630> basic<00:02:13.370> combination<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:15.260> practice

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
one basic combination for practice

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.490 
one basic combination for practice
momentum<00:02:17.610> feels<00:02:17.910> pulling<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.260> your

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
momentum feels pulling it to your

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.520 
momentum feels pulling it to your
distance<00:02:19.890> at<00:02:20.070> cetera<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.900> second<00:02:22.290> thing<00:02:22.440> I'm

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
distance at cetera the second thing I'm

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.370 
distance at cetera the second thing I'm
going<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.680> show<00:02:22.740> you

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
going to show you

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:40.760 
going to show you
earlier<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.950> pencil<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:39.560> you'll<00:02:40.560> notice

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
earlier is the pencil so you'll notice

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.729 
earlier is the pencil so you'll notice
that<00:02:40.890> I'm<00:02:41.459> holding<00:02:41.520> into<00:02:42.510> my<00:02:42.630> back<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.170> when<00:02:43.709> I

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
that I'm holding into my back so when I

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.760 
that I'm holding into my back so when I
turned<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.819> enter<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.630> spin<00:02:45.930> I'm<00:02:46.530> going<00:02:46.709> to

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
turned to enter the spin I'm going to

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.400 
turned to enter the spin I'm going to
step<00:02:46.980> on<00:02:47.100> my<00:02:47.220> inside<00:02:47.610> foot<00:02:47.910> pivot<00:02:48.840> on<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.230> to

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
step on my inside foot pivot on it to

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.680 
step on my inside foot pivot on it to
look<00:02:49.620> at<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.830> pole<00:02:50.100> my<00:02:50.850> life<00:02:53.540> means<00:02:54.540> the

look at the pole my life means the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.660 
look at the pole my life means the
distance<00:02:55.019> of<00:02:55.470> at<00:02:55.620> least<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:56.010> foot<00:02:56.310> from<00:02:56.580> the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
distance of at least a foot from the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.210 
distance of at least a foot from the
pole<00:02:56.940> as<00:02:57.660> soon<00:02:57.870> as<00:02:57.989> I<00:02:58.110> do<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.500> push<00:02:58.830> off<00:02:59.040> to

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
pole as soon as I do that I push off to

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.699 
pole as soon as I do that I push off to
lift<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.670> squeeze<00:03:00.150> into<00:03:00.480> my<00:03:00.630> back<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.470> pull

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
lift and squeeze into my back to pull

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.640 
lift and squeeze into my back to pull
myself<00:03:01.920> up<00:03:02.340> trying<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.360> get<00:03:03.510> my<00:03:03.630> face<00:03:03.900> in<00:03:04.140> line

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
people when they try this and this one's

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.740 
people when they try this and this one's
been<00:03:39.269> pull<00:03:39.540> what<00:03:40.530> tends<00:03:40.739> to<00:03:40.859> happen<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.310> people

been pull what tends to happen is people
will<00:03:42.750> get<00:03:42.870> up<00:03:43.109> nice<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:43.560> straight<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.220> all<00:03:44.400> of

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.130 
will get up nice and straight and all of
a<00:03:44.519> sudden<00:03:44.690> whatever<00:03:45.690> direction<00:03:45.870> you're

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
a sudden whatever direction you're

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.110 
a sudden whatever direction you're
spinning<00:03:46.440> in<00:03:46.739> is<00:03:46.859> somehow<00:03:47.220> your<00:03:47.489> hips<00:03:47.700> started

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
spinning in is somehow your hips started

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.870 
spinning in is somehow your hips started
to<00:03:48.180> turn<00:03:48.329> open<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:48.900> pull<00:03:49.079> you<00:03:49.170> forward<00:03:49.880> facing

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
to turn open and pull you forward facing

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.580 
to turn open and pull you forward facing
the<00:03:51.299> direction<00:03:51.450> you're<00:03:51.750> spinning<00:03:51.959> when<00:03:52.500> you

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
the direction you're spinning when you

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.979 
the direction you're spinning when you
want<00:03:52.829> to<00:03:52.920> maintain<00:03:53.420> being<00:03:54.420> centered<00:03:54.780> on<00:03:54.900> the

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
want to maintain being centered on the

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.770 
want to maintain being centered on the
pole<00:03:55.200> so<00:03:56.010> a<00:03:56.370> little<00:03:56.880> trick<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.209> helps<00:03:57.510> with

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
pole so a little trick that helps with

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.080 
pole so a little trick that helps with
that<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:58.370> while<00:03:59.370> you're<00:03:59.609> flexing<00:04:00.060> your

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
that is while you're flexing your

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.289 
that is while you're flexing your
abdominals<00:04:00.500> to<00:04:01.500> maintain<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.250> strong<00:04:02.489> straight

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
abdominals to maintain a strong straight

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.330 
abdominals to maintain a strong straight
posture<00:04:03.600> you're<00:04:04.440> also<00:04:04.590> going<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:04.950> take<00:04:05.160> the

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
posture you're also going to take the

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.449 
posture you're also going to take the
hip<00:04:05.640> that's<00:04:06.630> that's<00:04:07.350> going<00:04:08.190> in<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.310> direction

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
hip that's that's going in the direction

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.920 
hip that's that's going in the direction
you're<00:04:08.730> spinning<00:04:08.970> so<00:04:09.180> if<00:04:09.239> I'm<00:04:09.390> spinning

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
you're spinning so if I'm spinning

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.440 
you're spinning so if I'm spinning
clockwise<00:04:10.459> my<00:04:11.459> left<00:04:11.760> hip<00:04:12.030> is<00:04:12.150> going<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.359> be

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
clockwise my left hip is going to be

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.150 
clockwise my left hip is going to be
leading<00:04:12.660> so<00:04:13.410> I'm<00:04:13.470> going<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.680> want<00:04:13.769> to<00:04:13.829> take<00:04:14.010> my
