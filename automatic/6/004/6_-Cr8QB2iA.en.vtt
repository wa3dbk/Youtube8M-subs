00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
as far as skill wise I mean I think Carl

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.110 
as far as skill wise I mean I think Carl
Froch<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:56.219> know<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.430> think<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:56.820> gonna<00:00:56.940> be<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
Froch you know I think it's gonna be a

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.510 
Froch you know I think it's gonna be a
good<00:00:57.360> fight<00:00:57.890> but<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.920> think<00:00:59.190> overall<00:01:01.520> Andre

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
good fight but I think overall Andre

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.200 
good fight but I think overall Andre
Ward<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.409> just<00:01:04.409> too<00:01:04.650> poised<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.580> too<00:01:06.030> much

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
Ward is just too poised to too much

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.490 
Ward is just too poised to too much
skills<00:01:07.790> speed<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.619> I<00:01:10.619> think<00:01:11.130> he's<00:01:11.280> gonna<00:01:11.430> just

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
skills speed and I think he's gonna just

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.859 
skills speed and I think he's gonna just
outbox<00:01:13.500> Carl<00:01:13.860> Froch<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:15.210> know<00:01:15.390> not<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.720> take

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
outbox Carl Froch you know not to take

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.230

nothing<00:01:16.229> away<00:01:16.290> from<00:01:16.439> Carl<00:01:16.830> Froch<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.250> think<00:01:17.460> I

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
nothing away from Carl Froch I think I

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.929 
nothing away from Carl Froch I think I
think<00:01:18.450> he's<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> great<00:01:18.930> fighter<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:19.729> I<00:01:20.729> just

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
think he's a great fighter but I just

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.380 
think he's a great fighter but I just
think<00:01:21.500> mind<00:01:22.500> reward<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:23.340> too<00:01:24.119> hungry

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
think mind reward is just too hungry

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.289 
think mind reward is just too hungry
right<00:01:24.720> now<00:01:24.750> he's<00:01:25.170> undefeated<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:27.119> this

right now he's undefeated and not this

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.469 
right now he's undefeated and not this
is<00:01:27.570> very<00:01:28.080> difficult<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:29.030> be<00:01:30.030> someone<00:01:30.390> with

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
is very difficult to be someone with

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.740 
is very difficult to be someone with
that<00:01:30.540> type<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.900> skills<00:01:31.640> who<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.790> undefeated<00:01:33.090> I

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that type of skills who is undefeated I

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.840 
that type of skills who is undefeated I
