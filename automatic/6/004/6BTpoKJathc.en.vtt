 women - they are like this 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.199

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.420

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.220
 of course, mimic wrinkles around the eyes 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.130
 can you somehow help 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.430
 myself in a situation of course always 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.379
 easier to warn and always better 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.800
 prevention and treatment with what we have 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.960
 wrinkles are around the eyes then from and 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.940
 what do not appear when we smile 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.579
 such mimic wrinkles from all 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.010
 with our eyes from here we have yes here and 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.109
 here's the crow's feet at Cyne and the paws 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.350
 the so-called they appear in humans 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:01.890
 which, for example, see poorly by the way 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.350
 young girls 16 18 year see 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.600
 I already had my girlfriend wrinkles 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.190
 the institute studied together what's there 16 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.810
 she told me that when I was 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.120
 five years she first went with 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.120
 parents on the sea so here's a child so 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.670
 rejoiced so she enjoyed the sea 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.070
 that when she came home and just 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.290
 sat seriously he here here were not 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.930
 tanned skin particles all on 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.520
 greenish tanned and maybe it 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.890
 mean mimic wrinkles 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.780
 are formed by people at any age 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.940
 even at any age 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.730
 is it really necessary like this aaa 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.710
 actually my grandmother taught me 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.570
 just the smallest childhood with like 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.170
 correctly girls should laugh during 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.660
 first they are girls and so they don’t 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.200
 must laugh there boys refined 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.720
 when women should laugh she should 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.230
 emit they produce up impressions 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.230
 Sun 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.840
 mouth and not eyes 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.579
 need to rehearse to train already 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.649
 not ready often but still 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.930
 old age you wanna look warn 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.929
 please be careful the matter is 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.270
 that wrinkle cream should be the most 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.610
 the most expensive why the fact is that 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.180
 this percentage is incredibly important 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.519
 the ratio of the correct gradients in the cream 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.769
 if a person can still survive that area 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.750
 around the eyes, you can make yourself a cream not 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.130
 just wrinkles and make about chicks and 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.230
 for example, so I have to 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.780
 blepharoplasty do for example what is it 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.660
 and this eyelid correction it is no no 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.850
 we will mean if the cream for the area 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.799
 around the eyes it is only qualitative and 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.600
 this and expensive is 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.519
 aid that today 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.280
 it also teaches us how to cook at home 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.260
 look at the next moment do not buy 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.799
 please eye cream which 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.080
 contains lanolin glycerin and I said 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.170
 acid for some reason you what's the matter is that 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.120
 these products they pull water yes and 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.180
 therefore it turns out dries the skin somewhat 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.700
 wrinkles swell up 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.280
 but then it’s as if it’s blown away 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.290
 ball and the skin will be more wrinkled 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.510
 when I saw you several years ago 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.010
 the plot on tv and the oldest 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.049
 woman who lived there in some 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.910
 the provinces of Italy and here they take it 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.910
 mean interview and she is still so good 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.890
 looks at its 90 than there years well 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.049
 what means did you use for 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.239
 always being so young 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:28.380
 beautiful olive oil eyes 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.989
 wiped and I did not wrinkles 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.940
 formed language but probably because really 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.620
 yes it is absolutely true it 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.620
 really so uniqueness to 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.569
 important for skin of eyes due to skin of eyelids 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.780
 best to buy cosmetic 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.359
 olive oil why is she the most 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.670
 light peeled refined first 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.850
 spin and what other oils that 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:55.260
 great fit for the century area this 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:58.160
 almond oil and avocado oil and so 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:04.400
 tablespoon of olive oil 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:06.620
 one tablespoon of avocado oil well 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:12.100
 we add our favorite essential oils 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.100
 4 droplets 23 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.040
 farther 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.580
 fennel oil fennel great 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:24.020
 tighten the skin just add 4 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:30.860
 droplets and lavender oil we put 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:33.440
 also 4 drops and it turns out very 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.100
 very much we get this oil very 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:40.370
 lonely to fragrant buttery if 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.380
 you are allergic indeed and with 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.190
 work hard to carry all sorts of flavors 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.260
 then avocado oil is best with 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.850
 olive oil and add there only 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:55.010
 about 5 7 drops of lavender oil 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.590
 that is, then in this mix we 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.350
 use a completely simple close 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.410
 jar store this jar we are very 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.690
 such oils are usually very long 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.450
 stored for a long time and the main thing that was 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.540
 dark glass cool place closed 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:15.200
 condition for example in the evening once took off 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.660
 Cosmetics must necessarily washed up 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.169
 of how you apply cream 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.440
 faces 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:24.340
 you dip your fingers dip the middle 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.780
 index and ring fingers 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.510
 slightly so that the oil is not in any way 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.370
 the case did not flow well of course 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.470
 I do not have cosmetics now 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.600
 shoot dingo fence to pick up but in the hands of 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.970
 so this is also so let's see here 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.480
 so that's enough here you have a lot 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.730
 anna gavalda let's deal with me 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.460
 back ideological lilies that is should not 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.650
 should be wet fingers but no 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.530
 should the oil drain on what are we 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.630
 we start doing all 3 fingers 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.970
 we put 1 finger on the lower eyelid 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.700
 us inside it a little bit of a hole 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:01.580
 middle and third u externally ugly 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:05.120
 eye and lungs clamp 7 such 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.480
 movements we apply oils to on the bottom 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.480
 eyelid up 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.780
 then put the fingers horizontally 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:17.310
 along our crows feet and in the same way 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:20.370
 do somewhere around 50 pressing it here 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.620
 this way we close our eyes and lungs 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.419
 patting the tips of the pads 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.940
 fingers a little bit slightly over it 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:30.240
 eyelids were a little bit strange and not much 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:33.449
 Then they took our thin ones 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:37.770
 fingers attached to the upper eyelid mode 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:40.289
 and cleaned and held this butter all this 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:43.919
 enough held this oil about 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:47.520
 10-15 minutes no more then they took in 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:50.840
 napkin in one layer and just 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:55.409
 neatly wet not wipe a 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.360
 blotted shut our oils a little bit 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:07:00.030
 drank some warm herbal 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.280
 tea and went to bed and wake up in the morning 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.860
 Beautiful and healthy because it is convenient 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.440
 song is also very, very important for beauty 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.240
 our eyes and beauty captured and another 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:13.289
 never use the moment 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:15.240
 cream which is for face especially 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:17.389
 do not leave the cream and a large amount 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.880
 oils on the upper eyelids because in the morning 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:22.409
 Cream can pull water overkill and you 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.780
 wake up with swelling 

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:26.820
 well here today perhaps 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.250
 delicate topic that concerns beauty 

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:32.009
 of our face we will still smile 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.330
 true to each other smile because u 

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:35.849
 we have such a magic tool 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:39.530
 helping to care for our eyes 

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:39.530
 thank you metrocard antenna
