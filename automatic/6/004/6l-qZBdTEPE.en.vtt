package<00:00:57.299> of<00:00:57.629> two<00:00:57.659> I<00:00:58.080> don't<00:00:58.409> know<00:00:58.559> why<00:00:58.739> they

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
package of two I don't know why they

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.039 
package of two I don't know why they
just<00:00:59.489> do<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.909> guess<00:01:00.180> that's<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.510> get<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.900> buy

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:01.049 
just do I guess that's to get you to buy

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:04.100 
just do I guess that's to get you to buy
twice<00:01:01.470> as<00:01:01.530> much<00:01:02.150> so<00:01:03.150> what<00:01:03.330> we've<00:01:03.449> got<00:01:03.659> is<00:01:03.960> some

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
twice as much so what we've got is some

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.410 
twice as much so what we've got is some
bacon<00:01:04.619> everything<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.700> obviously<00:01:06.180> good

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
bacon everything is obviously good

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.719 
bacon everything is obviously good
wrapped<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.840> bacon<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.350> I've<00:01:07.979> got<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> dry<00:01:08.460> rub

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
I'll see if I can make a video on how to

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.179 
I'll see if I can make a video on how to
do<00:01:27.539> it<00:01:27.659> but<00:01:27.749> any<00:01:27.929> kind<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.320> dry<00:01:28.590> rub<00:01:28.859> that<00:01:29.039> you

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
do it but any kind of a dry rub that you

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.639 
do it but any kind of a dry rub that you
like<00:01:29.460> would<00:01:30.359> go<00:01:30.630> very<00:01:30.990> well<00:01:31.049> with<00:01:31.439> this

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
like would go very well with this

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.489 
like would go very well with this
because<00:01:31.890> pork<00:01:32.399> by<00:01:32.609> kind<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.659> by<00:01:33.719> definition<00:01:34.109> is

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:34.499 
because pork by kind of by definition is

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:37.669 
because pork by kind of by definition is
a<00:01:34.530> very<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.549> wouldn't<00:01:36.509> say<00:01:36.659> mild<00:01:37.049> meat<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.590> it

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
a very I wouldn't say mild meat but it

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.800 
a very I wouldn't say mild meat but it
just<00:01:37.829> doesn't<00:01:38.039> have<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> big<00:01:38.670> hearty<00:01:39.119> flavor<00:01:39.479> to

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
just doesn't have a big hearty flavor to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.499 
just doesn't have a big hearty flavor to
it<00:01:40.039> it's<00:01:41.039> kind<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.399> a<00:01:41.490> canvas<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.329> can

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
it it's kind of like a canvas so you can

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.300 
it it's kind of like a canvas so you can
really<00:01:42.630> impart<00:01:43.200> any<00:01:43.380> sort<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.710> flavors<00:01:44.100> that

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
really impart any sort of flavors that

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.219 
really impart any sort of flavors that
you'd<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.060> we're<00:01:45.749> going<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.929> go<00:01:46.079> ahead

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
you'd like so we're going to go ahead

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.819 
you'd like so we're going to go ahead
and<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:47.569> liberally<00:01:48.569> sprinkle<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
and just liberally sprinkle the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.340 
and just liberally sprinkle the
tenderloin<00:01:50.689> with<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.840> rub

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
tenderloin with the rub

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.340 
tenderloin with the rub
some<00:01:53.310> people<00:01:53.639> put<00:01:53.999> olive<00:01:54.420> oil<00:01:54.569> on<00:01:54.960> at<00:01:55.200> this

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
some people put olive oil on at this

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.730 
some people put olive oil on at this
point<00:01:55.679> so<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.249> it<00:01:57.119> helps<00:01:57.539> cause<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.590> adhere

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
point so it it helps cause it to adhere

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.580 
point so it it helps cause it to adhere
a<00:01:59.009> little<00:01:59.249> bit<00:01:59.369> better<00:01:59.549> I've<00:01:59.880> never<00:02:00.469> felt<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
a little bit better I've never felt the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.559 
a little bit better I've never felt the
need<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.770> do<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.159> also<00:02:02.789> some<00:02:03.090> people<00:02:03.420> will

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
need to do that also some people will

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
they've breeded these pigs so that

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.140 
they've breeded these pigs so that
there's<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.530> lot<00:04:16.829> less<00:04:17.159> fat<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.729> them<00:04:17.880> which<00:04:18.030> is

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
there's a lot less fat to them which is

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.370 
there's a lot less fat to them which is
one<00:04:18.299> of<00:04:18.389> the<00:04:18.449> reasons<00:04:18.780> we're<00:04:18.930> putting<00:04:19.199> bacon

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
one of the reasons we're putting bacon

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.330 
one of the reasons we're putting bacon
around<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:19.829> because<00:04:19.979> we're<00:04:20.130> kind<00:04:20.220> of

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
around it because we're kind of

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.629 
around it because we're kind of
reintroducing<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:22.440> fat<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.250> flavor

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
reintroducing that the fat to the flavor

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.420 
reintroducing that the fat to the flavor
so<00:04:24.060> put<00:04:24.900> it<00:04:25.020> in<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.139> oven<00:04:25.289> and<00:04:25.500> we'll<00:04:25.650> low<00:04:25.889> show

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
so put it in the oven and we'll low show

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.710 
so put it in the oven and we'll low show
you<00:04:26.520> what<00:04:26.669> it<00:04:26.729> looks<00:04:26.880> like<00:04:27.090> when<00:04:27.300> we<00:04:27.330> carve
