the wall in any particular direction
they<00:02:09.080> can<00:02:09.290> even<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.980> for<00:02:10.220> example<00:02:10.700> collect

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
they can even you for example collect

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.790 
they can even you for example collect
something<00:02:11.300> on<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.720> wall<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.140> feed<00:02:12.380> it<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.680> the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
something on the wall and feed it to the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.740 
something on the wall and feed it to the
beaver<00:02:13.010> so<00:02:13.610> these<00:02:13.760> are<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.090> things<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.540> are

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
beaver so these are the things that are

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.210 
beaver so these are the things that are
possible<00:02:15.230> with<00:02:15.410> this<00:02:15.560> kind<00:02:15.830> of<00:02:15.890> technology

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
possible with this kind of technology

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.670 
possible with this kind of technology
and<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.790> third<00:02:17.030> one<00:02:17.209> that<00:02:17.450> we<00:02:18.290> really

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
and the third one that we really

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.610 
and the third one that we really
specialize<00:02:18.920> in<00:02:19.490> is<00:02:19.820> gesture<00:02:20.480> recognition<00:02:20.900> so

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
specialize in is gesture recognition so

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.040 
specialize in is gesture recognition so
beaver<00:02:22.190> can<00:02:22.910> understand<00:02:23.420> now<00:02:23.660> how<00:02:23.870> many

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
beaver can understand now how many

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.440 
beaver can understand now how many
people<00:02:24.440> are<00:02:24.830> standing<00:02:25.340> around<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:26.000> hologram

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
people are standing around the hologram

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.030 
people are standing around the hologram
hound<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:26.810> how<00:02:27.020> many<00:02:27.200> people<00:02:27.470> are<00:02:27.590> running<00:02:27.770> in

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
hound and how many people are running in

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.770 
hound and how many people are running in
what<00:02:28.190> direction<00:02:28.370> beaver<00:02:29.270> will<00:02:29.450> have<00:02:29.630> this

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
what direction beaver will have this

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.420 
what direction beaver will have this
more<00:02:30.020> sense<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.739> environment<00:02:31.250> through

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
more sense of the environment through

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.850 
more sense of the environment through
this<00:02:31.580> technologies<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.810> ease<00:02:33.020> of<00:02:33.590> working

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
this technologies the ease of working

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.580 
this technologies the ease of working
with<00:02:34.250> H+<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:35.150> team<00:02:35.360> has<00:02:35.720> really<00:02:35.959> been<00:02:36.260> a

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
with H+ and the team has really been a

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.070 
with H+ and the team has really been a
treat<00:02:36.910> just<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:38.000> magical<00:02:38.450> place<00:02:38.660> for<00:02:38.900> them<00:02:39.050> I

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
treat just a magical place for them I

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.930 
treat just a magical place for them I
think<00:02:39.230> they<00:02:39.920> wouldn't<00:02:40.190> fall<00:02:40.370> asleep<00:02:40.670> in<00:02:40.790> that

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
think they wouldn't fall asleep in that

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.570 
think they wouldn't fall asleep in that
room

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
room

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.810 
room
whoa<00:02:43.340> thanks<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.460> lot<00:02:44.820> for<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.450> show
