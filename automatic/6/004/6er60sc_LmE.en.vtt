00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
 Tulip fried chicken wings 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.260
 This time, I will make fried chicken wings. I came up with this idea from the menu of a restaurant in Oita 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.940
 Making tulip wings very simple This dish is very delicious, please try. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.800
 Prepared chicken wings 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.780
 The skin around the chicken wing joint, only cuts the skin 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.200
 Reversing joints 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.060
 Pull out half of the meat 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.080
 Later. Keep pulling that meat upside down. 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.460
 Eliminate bone finer 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.560
 Cut off the wing tip 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.920
 Create a tulip shape 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.920
 Looks like this. 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.980
 Tulip chicken wings are finished 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.740
 The bone and wing tips can be used to cook soup 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.780
 Salted and lightly mixed. 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.000
 Make chicken marinade (for 500g chicken) 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.860
 Smooth a small piece of ginger 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.440
 Grated garlic 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.980
 1.5 tablespoons of soy sauce

 1/2 spoon of salt 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.540
 Add 1 tablespoon apple juice 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.540
 Can use smooth cell apples instead 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.500
 Apples help the chicken be softer and tastier 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.880
 Add ginger and garlic 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.720
 Add a little sesame oil 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.940
 A little chili powder 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.180
 Mix 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.440
 Pour into a sealed bag with chicken and mix well 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.900
 Remove all steam bubbles from the bag so that the chicken is mixed well 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.120
 Marinate chicken for 2-3 hours 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.080
 After 3 hours. 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.440
 Pour chicken out of a strainer. 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.720
 Leave the chicken on the sieve for a while to return the chicken to room temperature 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.380
 5 tablespoons of potato starch. 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.340
 1 tablespoon corn starch. 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.680
 Adding corn flour will make the dish more crispy. 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.360
 Roll chicken over flour, shake off excess flour. 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.260
 A thin layer of powder will make the dish more crispy. 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.340
 Chicken frying. 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.980
 It is rumored that the new oil phase with about 30% of the old oil will make the fried dish more delicious. 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.640
 Deep-frying at 180 ° C (356 F) 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.020
 Leave the chicken unchanged for the first 1 minute. 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.000
 30 seconds ... 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.560
 After frying for about 1 minute, pick up the chicken for air exposure. 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.820
 In this way, pieces of chicken will be easier to get rid of moisture and brittle. 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.100
 Fry for 2 minutes, take out. Drain oil. 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.040
 Chicken cooked very quickly due to the inside of the chicken pieces. 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.480
 Place chicken on a plate. 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.480
 Garnish with tomato and lemon.
