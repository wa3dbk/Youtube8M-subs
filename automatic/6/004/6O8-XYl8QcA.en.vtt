a sock you ask that is a very simple

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.060 
a sock you ask that is a very simple
question<00:01:23.270> all<00:01:23.600> you<00:01:23.720> do<00:01:23.870> is<00:01:24.049> you<00:01:24.350> get<00:01:24.710> two<00:01:24.920> pairs

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
question all you do is you get two pairs

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.640 
question all you do is you get two pairs
of<00:01:25.220> socks<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:25.880> you<00:01:26.120> layer<00:01:26.390> them<00:01:26.420> in<00:01:26.930> inside<00:01:27.560> of

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
of socks and you layer them in inside of

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.000 
of socks and you layer them in inside of
each<00:01:27.770> other<00:01:27.970> you<00:01:28.970> cut<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.299> tip<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:29.810> then<00:01:30.799> you

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
each other you cut the tip and then you

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.480 
each other you cut the tip and then you
roll<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:31.600> so<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:32.659> create<00:01:33.200> that<00:01:33.440> donut<00:01:34.190> shape

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
roll it so you create that donut shape

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.830 
roll it so you create that donut shape
that<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:36.170> chignon<00:01:36.440> has<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.540> just<00:01:38.540> like<00:01:38.810> the

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
that the chignon has so just like the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.640 
that the chignon has so just like the
Shenyang<00:01:39.909> it's<00:01:40.909> just<00:01:41.210> a<00:01:41.360> donut<00:01:41.750> now<00:01:42.260> the

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
Shenyang it's just a donut now the

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.070 
Shenyang it's just a donut now the
thicker<00:01:42.920> your<00:01:43.190> sock<00:01:43.490> is<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.540> longer<00:01:44.930> your

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
thicker your sock is and the longer your

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.070 
thicker your sock is and the longer your
sock<00:01:45.290> is<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:46.190> more<00:01:46.670> full<00:01:47.360> of<00:01:47.390> your<00:01:47.630> bun<00:01:47.869> will

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
sock is the more full of your bun will

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.929 
sock is the more full of your bun will
look<00:01:48.320> but<00:01:48.650> the<00:01:48.860> reason<00:01:49.070> why<00:01:49.310> I<00:01:49.340> don't<00:01:49.670> like<00:01:49.790> the

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
look but the reason why I don't like the

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.179 
look but the reason why I don't like the
sock<00:01:50.210> is<00:01:50.510> because<00:01:50.930> it's<00:01:51.619> a<00:01:51.799> cloth<00:01:52.010> material

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
sock is because it's a cloth material

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.280 
sock is because it's a cloth material
and<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.700> bobby<00:01:52.880> pin<00:01:53.150> won't<00:01:53.420> actually<00:01:53.689> go

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
and the bobby pin won't actually go

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.679 
and the bobby pin won't actually go
through<00:01:54.320> it<00:01:55.070> when<00:01:55.549> you're<00:01:55.670> trying<00:01:55.909> to<00:01:56.030> secure

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
through it when you're trying to secure

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.260 
through it when you're trying to secure
your<00:01:56.780> hair<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:57.860> what<00:01:58.430> I<00:01:58.460> mean<00:01:58.670> by<00:01:58.729> that<00:01:58.939> is<00:01:59.150> when

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
your hair so what I mean by that is when

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.810 
your hair so what I mean by that is when
I<00:01:59.330> put<00:01:59.600> it<00:01:59.689> through<00:01:59.840> the<00:01:59.869> chignon<00:02:00.820> because

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
I put it through the chignon because

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.390 
I put it through the chignon because
it's<00:02:01.970> a<00:02:02.030> mesh<00:02:02.210> material<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.900> stays<00:02:03.290> so<00:02:04.070> that's

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
it's a mesh material it stays so that's

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.820 
it's a mesh material it stays so that's
