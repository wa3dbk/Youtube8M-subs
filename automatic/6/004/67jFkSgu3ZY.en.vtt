00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.529
 to be a citizen of good 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.710
 It is one of our hands to demand his right to run for the Senate. 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:24.829

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.019

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.020
 five more 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.970
 It was another game that took a long tiuÃ­ 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.640
 let's kids 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.490
 in suzuka putting this together 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.550
 in floor 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.010
 Everyone's time and no class. 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.980

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.370

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.350
 to inhabit and says dani of you where you are 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.700
 the arbitration 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.030
 This is something that you do not know by the way. 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.410
 It's the same as education 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.649
 No, it's not quite the same thing. 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.540
 but having citizenship is just as important as having a wedding 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.160
 a person had access to citizenship did not waste water did not come only interest 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.619
 I'm not in a hurry Public phones throw garbage on the street so 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.730
 no way 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.670
 this time the boys 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.720
 this one accept a brush on the grass do not handle in paulo after the holidays 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.609
 day 27 the index of rebellions and artistic 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:15.219
 I do not know if it is the juca already the screening of living in the world where people do 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:18.689
 everything they want without respecting the rights of others 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:21.060
 I think that what started 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.849
 Who is waiting too? 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.939
 given a good one so I say who it is 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.189
 without giving any 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.909
 it is the achievement of the rights that the fulfillment of the duties and rights 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.299
 duties 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.299
 becoming increasingly complicated 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:41.749
 I also understood mother very well. 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:43.070
 all people 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.330
 have a lot of rights and duties, but they are citizens or only those who 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.770
 exercising citizenship sought to conquer their rights and fulfilled their duties 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:57.589
 and how do I know my rights and duties 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:01.549
 Let's go home and I'll show you something super important to you. 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:11.329
 helly 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.089
 maximum esteem 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:18.079
 is the constitution of Brazil, this is the most important law of our country 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.389
 it speaks of our rights and duties 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.779
 and respecting the laws is the main duty of the citizen 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.999
 have more others defend sharply 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.790
 takes care of public goods 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.079
 is another important duty of citizenship 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.919
 and still in public is all that is had to the people and that is bought with money 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.919
 of the people 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:45.369
 but if it is not bought with government money 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.009
 haiti where you think that there is money to govern it to buy all these 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.819
 things 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.509
 act I never thought of it 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:57.149
 then know that the money the government spends to make roads 

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:58.199
 squares 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.359
 garden 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:04.849
 in schools the hospital paid salaries all this comes from taxes that 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.509
 we pay the government 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:07.999
 be a little bit 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:11.010
 I said it was complicating what is attribute 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.220
 was love 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.989
 What are they doing for children? 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.549
 there and here 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:20.549
 year later 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.080
 designated as being the citizens was wanted 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.159
 could you explain to them what you assign 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:31.509
 Of course I can come, children. I'll tell you a story. 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.280
 in the past he at a distance man was very different from what he is today 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.210
 we face 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.199
 many difficulties 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.529
 the biggest 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:43.569
 the fact of living alone 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:44.860
 living alone 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.270
 the man could not count on the help 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.279
 between periods 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:52.710
 I am your intelligence 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.710
 di has been transforming nature to your benefit 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.499
 the great discovery of man happened 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:02.289
 when he learned to live in a group 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:03.420
 slowly 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.540
 the groups began to gather 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:12.070
 forming the first tribes where all lived helping to use others 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:15.559
 about 30 the leader 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:19.740
 its mission was to protect that it takes care of the tribe 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.560
 in thanksgiving the tribes presented their chief with food weapons with 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.830
 belize animals these gifts will be called the word tributes that 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.420
 means what is divided by taxes 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.900
 but time was passing and men were evolving 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:41.340
 in day 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.639
 they made a discovery that changed their lives 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.190
 the four men discovered how to facilitate but the Bahian team 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.770
 these weapons they could create with other tributes 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:57.339
 in March the teams 

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:06.039
 the sic found in the conquered lands 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:07.930
 surrender as 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:08.369
 to the thigh
