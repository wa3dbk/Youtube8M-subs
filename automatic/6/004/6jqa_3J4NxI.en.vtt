00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
out some of the reviews about those

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.130 
out some of the reviews about those
products<00:02:37.159> on<00:02:37.390> certain<00:02:38.390> blogs<00:02:38.689> and<00:02:38.959> they

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
products on certain blogs and they

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.050 
products on certain blogs and they
normally<00:02:39.739> say<00:02:39.980> that<00:02:40.189> this<00:02:40.370> color<00:02:40.670> kind<00:02:40.939> of

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
normally say that this color kind of

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.020 
normally say that this color kind of
drains<00:02:41.329> out<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.720> color<00:02:41.959> of<00:02:42.079> their<00:02:42.379> skin<00:02:42.439> but<00:02:43.030> I

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
drains out the color of their skin but I

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.229 
drains out the color of their skin but I
think<00:02:44.599> it<00:02:44.720> is<00:02:44.750> very<00:02:44.930> dark<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.489> think<00:02:47.120> I

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
think it is very dark and I think I

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.660 
think it is very dark and I think I
would<00:02:47.390> like<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.659> a<00:02:47.900> little<00:02:48.079> bit<00:02:48.349> more<00:02:48.670> little

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
would like it a little bit more little

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.789 
would like it a little bit more little
bit<00:02:49.909> lighter<00:02:50.180> I<00:02:50.390> suppose<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:50.930> what<00:02:51.349> I<00:02:51.379> wanted<00:02:51.739> to

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
bit lighter I suppose I what I wanted to

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.559 
bit lighter I suppose I what I wanted to
say<00:02:52.099> about<00:02:52.250> those<00:02:52.549> products<00:02:53.150> is<00:02:53.269> that<00:02:53.329> they

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
say about those products is that they

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.910 
say about those products is that they
are<00:02:54.019> super<00:02:54.620> long<00:02:54.920> wearing<00:02:55.329> they<00:02:56.329> are<00:02:56.920> they

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
are super long wearing they are they

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.250 
are super long wearing they are they
they<00:02:58.430> do<00:02:58.489> feel<00:02:59.090> slightly<00:02:59.480> drawing<00:02:59.900> on<00:03:00.139> the

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
they do feel slightly drawing on the

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.800 
they do feel slightly drawing on the
lips<00:03:00.470> but<00:03:00.650> that's<00:03:01.220> only<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.579> initial<00:03:02.269> feeling

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
lips but that's only the initial feeling

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.690 
lips but that's only the initial feeling
and<00:03:03.019> then<00:03:03.440> once<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:03.769> get<00:03:03.950> used<00:03:04.129> to<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.340> they

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
and then once you get used to it they

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.289 
and then once you get used to it they
don't<00:03:04.940> really<00:03:05.090> dry<00:03:05.389> your<00:03:05.569> lips<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:07.670> yes

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
I'm really really happy about it I've

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.800 
I'm really really happy about it I've
got<00:03:10.549> some<00:03:11.000> chapped<00:03:11.299> lips<00:03:11.569> now<00:03:11.810> but<00:03:12.049> they<00:03:12.230> don't

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
got some chapped lips now but they don't

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.500 
got some chapped lips now but they don't
accentuate<00:03:14.810> they<00:03:15.680> don't<00:03:16.010> show<00:03:16.639> any<00:03:16.970> kind<00:03:17.389> of

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
accentuate they don't show any kind of

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.569 
accentuate they don't show any kind of
dryness<00:03:17.780> on<00:03:18.109> the<00:03:18.290> lips<00:03:18.500> you<00:03:18.680> know<00:03:18.739> some<00:03:19.099> some

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
dryness on the lips you know some some

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.819 
dryness on the lips you know some some
mad<00:03:20.000> products<00:03:20.510> can<00:03:20.720> look<00:03:20.930> really<00:03:21.260> patchy<00:03:21.560> and

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
mad products can look really patchy and

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.020 
mad products can look really patchy and
horrible<00:03:22.280> but<00:03:22.879> these<00:03:23.180> don't<00:03:23.540> they<00:03:24.439> apply

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
horrible but these don't they apply

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.910 
horrible but these don't they apply
beautifully<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.299> smoothly<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.319> they're

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
beautifully and smoothly and they're

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.080 
beautifully and smoothly and they're
super<00:03:28.340> pigmented<00:03:28.670> they<00:03:29.180> stay<00:03:29.449> on<00:03:29.480> forever<00:03:29.840> and

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
super pigmented they stay on forever and

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.059 
super pigmented they stay on forever and
the<00:03:32.090> only<00:03:32.419> downside<00:03:33.019> is<00:03:33.230> that<00:03:33.319> if<00:03:33.650> you<00:03:33.769> want<00:03:33.799> to

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
the only downside is that if you want to

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.819 
the only downside is that if you want to
remove<00:03:34.370> them<00:03:34.669> it<00:03:34.849> takes<00:03:34.879> a<00:03:35.329> lot<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:36.199> remove<00:03:36.560> I

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
remove them it takes a lot to remove I

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.280 
remove them it takes a lot to remove I
think<00:03:37.069> oil-based<00:03:37.910> will<00:03:38.269> make<00:03:38.660> up<00:03:38.840> removers

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
think oil-based will make up removers

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.289 
think oil-based will make up removers
are<00:03:39.470> better<00:03:39.739> for<00:03:40.040> this<00:03:40.250> kind<00:03:40.519> of<00:03:40.639> product<00:03:41.000> and

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
are better for this kind of product and

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.319 
are better for this kind of product and
but<00:03:42.260> then<00:03:42.409> it<00:03:42.530> just<00:03:42.709> shows<00:03:42.980> that<00:03:43.250> it<00:03:43.730> is<00:03:43.940> a

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
but then it just shows that it is a

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.059 
but then it just shows that it is a
really<00:03:44.690> long<00:03:44.720> wearing<00:03:45.109> product<00:03:45.620> so<00:03:45.859> you're

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
really long wearing product so you're

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.680 
really long wearing product so you're
you're<00:03:46.370> not<00:03:46.579> going<00:03:46.819> to<00:03:47.030> go<00:03:47.180> wrong<00:03:47.389> with<00:03:47.540> that

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
you're not going to go wrong with that

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.069 
you're not going to go wrong with that
and<00:03:48.099> so<00:03:49.099> yes<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.519> color<00:03:49.760> choice<00:03:50.120> is<00:03:50.449> quite<00:03:50.780> an

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
and so yes the color choice is quite an

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.869 
and so yes the color choice is quite an
you<00:03:51.379> know<00:03:51.470> it's<00:03:51.680> a<00:03:51.769> nice<00:03:51.949> ride<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.280> get<00:03:52.669> to

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
you know it's a nice ride you get to

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.500 
you know it's a nice ride you get to
kind<00:03:53.150> of<00:03:53.829> 22<00:03:54.829> ready<00:03:55.159> once<00:03:55.489> to<00:03:55.790> pinky<00:03:56.150> ones<00:03:56.329> and

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
kind of 22 ready once to pinky ones and

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.080 
kind of 22 ready once to pinky ones and
one<00:03:56.629> purple<00:03:57.049> but<00:03:57.590> I<00:03:57.620> think<00:03:57.979> kind<00:03:58.699> of<00:03:58.790> lighter

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
one purple but I think kind of lighter

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.569 
one purple but I think kind of lighter
colors<00:03:59.540> would<00:03:59.720> be<00:03:59.900> nice<00:04:00.079> as<00:04:00.290> well<00:04:00.440> in<00:04:01.370> the

colors would be nice as well in the

colors would be nice as well in the
range<00:04:01.819> especially<00:04:02.000> for<00:04:02.479> people<00:04:02.599> that<00:04:02.989> don't

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
range especially for people that don't

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.839 
range especially for people that don't
like<00:04:03.409> wearing<00:04:03.829> bright<00:04:04.159> colors<00:04:04.190> on<00:04:04.609> everyday

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
like wearing bright colors on everyday

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.039 
like wearing bright colors on everyday
basis<00:04:05.389> and<00:04:06.129> it<00:04:07.129> is<00:04:07.459> a<00:04:07.669> product<00:04:08.120> that<00:04:08.269> really

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
basis and it is a product that really
