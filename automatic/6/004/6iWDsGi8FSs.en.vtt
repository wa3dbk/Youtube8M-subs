long<00:02:03.529> do<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:03.799> keep<00:02:04.899> birds<00:02:05.899> in<00:02:06.289> the<00:02:06.649> nest<00:02:06.829> boxes

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
long do you keep birds in the nest boxes

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.390 
long do you keep birds in the nest boxes
so<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.479> thing<00:02:09.659> is<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.950> wanna<00:02:11.099> keep<00:02:11.220> them

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.979 
so the thing is that you wanna keep them
dis<00:02:11.670> boxes<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.360> guess<00:02:13.819> I<00:02:14.819> don't<00:02:15.510> know<00:02:15.629> how<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.870> I

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
dis boxes I guess I don't know how to I

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.399 
dis boxes I guess I don't know how to I
said<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.409> won't<00:02:16.530> really<00:02:16.799> but<00:02:17.690> if<00:02:18.690> they<00:02:19.019> are<00:02:19.170> not

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
said I won't really but if they are not

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.240 
said I won't really but if they are not
a<00:02:19.440> made<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.220> here<00:02:21.060> there<00:02:21.920> don't<00:02:22.920> belong

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
a made it here there don't belong

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.920 
a made it here there don't belong
together<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:23.849> if<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.269> starting<00:02:24.780> up<00:02:24.930> here

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
together and if you starting up here

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.930 
together and if you starting up here
it's<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.140> way<00:02:28.349> to<00:02:28.379> introduce<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:29.250> verse<00:02:29.549> or<00:02:29.879> I

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
it's a way to introduce the verse or I

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.140 
it's a way to introduce the verse or I
guess<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.480> way<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.200> do<00:02:31.379> it<00:02:31.700> but<00:02:32.700> they<00:02:33.000> are

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
guess a way that I do it but they are

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.809 
guess a way that I do it but they are
made<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.720> they<00:02:34.560> belong<00:02:34.980> together<00:02:35.160> they're<00:02:35.670> up

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
made it they belong together they're up

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
box and there were some other boxes to

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.530 
box and there were some other boxes to
me<00:02:40.650> is<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.489> other<00:02:41.610> birds<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.060> double

me is that the other birds like double

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.350 
me is that the other birds like double
flying<00:02:42.810> right<00:02:43.019> there<00:02:43.549> is<00:02:44.549> not<00:02:45.000> going<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.180> come

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
flying right there is not going to come

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.240 
flying right there is not going to come
and<00:02:45.510> bother<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:46.110> there<00:02:46.410> because<00:02:46.829> this<00:02:47.040> is

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
and bother this there because this is

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.330 
and bother this there because this is
time<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:49.140> they<00:02:49.260> can<00:02:49.470> have<00:02:49.650> some<00:02:49.890> babies

time to that they can have some babies

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.729 
time to that they can have some babies
and<00:02:50.579> they're<00:02:51.209> going<00:02:51.329> to<00:02:51.420> be<00:02:51.510> disturbed<00:02:52.200> too

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
and they're going to be disturbed too

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.640 
and they're going to be disturbed too
much<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.489> it'll<00:02:54.450> just<00:02:54.810> mess<00:02:55.109> up<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.470> whole

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
much and it'll just mess up the whole

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.940 
much and it'll just mess up the whole
process<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.930> so<00:02:57.930> it'll<00:02:58.049> be<00:02:58.230> better<00:02:58.500> if<00:02:58.769> they

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
process of it so it'll be better if they

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.830 
process of it so it'll be better if they
are<00:02:59.180> on<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.209> box

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
are on a box

to<00:03:48.780> them<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:50.130> nest<00:03:50.430> but<00:03:51.359> by<00:03:51.780> mistake<00:03:52.019> another

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
to them the nest but by mistake another

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.280 
to them the nest but by mistake another
one<00:03:52.919> can<00:03:53.129> come<00:03:53.340> in<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.810> they<00:03:54.810> start<00:03:54.870> fighting

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
one can come in and they start fighting

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.900 
one can come in and they start fighting
with<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.680> other<00:03:55.859> one<00:03:56.069> just<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.579> avoid<00:03:56.849> that

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
with the other one just to avoid that

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.490 
with the other one just to avoid that
because<00:03:57.329> you<00:03:57.450> can<00:03:57.599> keep<00:03:57.989> it<00:03:58.139> closed<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.319> little

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
because you can keep it closed a little

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.530 
because you can keep it closed a little
longer<00:03:58.799> you<00:03:59.069> can<00:03:59.220> just<00:03:59.430> leave<00:03:59.639> it<00:03:59.790> open<00:03:59.910> if

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
longer you can just leave it open if

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.449 
longer you can just leave it open if
they<00:04:00.750> belong<00:04:01.049> together<00:04:01.290> dust<00:04:01.829> they're<00:04:02.190> all

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
they belong together dust they're all

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.449 
they belong together dust they're all
pair<00:04:02.760> up<00:04:02.940> I<00:04:03.329> guess<00:04:04.230> on<00:04:04.940> it<00:04:05.940> they're<00:04:06.299> all<00:04:06.690> peers

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
pair up I guess on it they're all peers

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.710 
pair up I guess on it they're all peers
you<00:04:08.459> don't<00:04:08.609> really<00:04:08.849> have<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.120> close<00:04:09.359> the<00:04:09.510> door

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
you don't really have to close the door

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.629 
you don't really have to close the door
I<00:04:09.750> guess<00:04:10.169> they<00:04:10.410> already<00:04:10.709> know<00:04:11.010> what<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.400> nice

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
I guess they already know what a nice

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.150 
I guess they already know what a nice
they're<00:04:11.819> gonna<00:04:11.940> go<00:04:12.209> in<00:04:12.389> now<00:04:13.290> which<00:04:13.919> one<00:04:14.129> is

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
they're gonna go in now which one is

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.020 
they're gonna go in now which one is
their<00:04:14.489> mate

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
their mate

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.920 
their mate
so<00:04:15.599> I<00:04:15.919> guess<00:04:16.919> that's<00:04:17.099> up<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:17.940> you<00:04:18.150> really<00:04:18.450> up<00:04:18.870> to

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
so I guess that's up to you really up to

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.580 
so I guess that's up to you really up to
the<00:04:19.500> pier

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
the pier

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.150 
the pier
they<00:04:21.130> already<00:04:21.280> there<00:04:21.730> got<00:04:22.120> a<00:04:22.150> nest<00:04:23.160> they're

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
they already there got a nest they're

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160 
they already there got a nest they're
going<00:04:24.310> to<00:04:24.370> go<00:04:24.460> back<00:04:24.490> to<00:04:24.639> their<00:04:24.910> names<00:04:25.120> but<00:04:26.050> if

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
going to go back to their names but if

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.900 
going to go back to their names but if
you<00:04:26.320> want<00:04:26.590> don't<00:04:26.920> want<00:04:27.070> nobody<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.730> bother

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
you want don't want nobody to bother

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.710 
you want don't want nobody to bother
them<00:04:28.300> just<00:04:28.810> keep<00:04:28.990> it<00:04:29.110> close<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:31.090> guess

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
them just keep it close and I guess

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.190 
them just keep it close and I guess
that's<00:04:31.900> how<00:04:33.000> we<00:04:34.000> can<00:04:34.150> answer<00:04:34.330> a<00:04:34.510> question<00:04:35.050> it

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
that's how we can answer a question it

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.230 
that's how we can answer a question it
or<00:04:35.410> depend<00:04:35.740> up<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:36.010> you<00:04:36.160> puke<00:04:36.490> like<00:04:36.610> me<00:04:36.910> I<00:04:36.940> got

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
this separation here only one bird there

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.460 
this separation here only one bird there
because<00:04:40.210> I'm<00:04:40.389> not<00:04:40.510> gonna<00:04:40.660> burn<00:04:40.900> her<00:04:41.110> so<00:04:41.320> I'll

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
because I'm not gonna burn her so I'll

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.810 
because I'm not gonna burn her so I'll
leave<00:04:41.590> her<00:04:41.770> out<00:04:42.100> and<00:04:42.400> um<00:04:43.360> I<00:04:44.220> can<00:04:45.220> also<00:04:45.370> put<00:04:45.639> her

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
on the other law but um I guess that'll

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.590 
on the other law but um I guess that'll
be<00:04:50.680> up<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:51.040> you<00:04:51.450> but<00:04:52.450> they're<00:04:52.720> pair<00:04:53.050> up<00:04:53.200> and
