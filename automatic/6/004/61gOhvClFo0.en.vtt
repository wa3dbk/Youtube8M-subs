this<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.320> 25<00:00:13.860> men<00:00:14.099> reason<00:00:14.639> for<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.179> it

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
this on 25 men reason for that is it

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.830 
this on 25 men reason for that is it
tinman<00:00:16.949> I'll<00:00:17.190> pretty<00:00:17.550> much<00:00:17.640> do<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.449> won't

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
tinman I'll pretty much do it I won't

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.080 
tinman I'll pretty much do it I won't
even<00:00:19.140> pay<00:00:19.350> attention<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.890> anything<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.609> it

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
even pay attention to anything and so it

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.580 
even pay attention to anything and so it
really<00:00:21.210> won't<00:00:21.449> be<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> good<00:00:21.840> guide<00:00:22.050> for<00:00:22.080> most

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
really won't be a good guide for most

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.019 
really won't be a good guide for most
people<00:00:22.830> because<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.130> won't<00:00:23.430> show<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.789> things

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
people because I won't show the things

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.970 
people because I won't show the things
that<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.330> don't<00:00:25.109> know<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.199> guess<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.470> kind<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.830> have

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
that I don't know I guess I kind of have

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.640 
that I don't know I guess I kind of have
trouble<00:00:26.279> with<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.359> maybe<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:27.810> 25<00:00:28.230> men<00:00:28.439> it

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
trouble with and so maybe on 25 men it

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.169 
trouble with and so maybe on 25 men it
would<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.859> more<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> challenge<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.970> kind

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
would be more of a challenge and it kind

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.470 
would be more of a challenge and it kind
of<00:00:30.240> was<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.750> almost<00:00:31.050> died<00:00:31.439> but<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.579> kind<00:00:33.420> of

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
of was I almost died but I kind of

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.850 
of was I almost died but I kind of
played<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> little<00:00:33.960> bit<00:00:34.110> wrong<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.680> did

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
played a little bit wrong and I did

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.610 
played a little bit wrong and I did
really<00:00:35.070> sloppy<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.899> think<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.500> it's

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
really sloppy and so I I think that it's

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.830 
really sloppy and so I I think that it's
kind<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.010> possible<00:00:38.399> but<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:38.610> 25<00:00:39.090> men<00:00:39.329> you

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
kind of possible but for 25 men you

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.060 
kind of possible but for 25 men you
probably<00:00:40.079> gonna<00:00:40.170> have<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.379> bad<00:00:40.530> time<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:40.950> you're

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
probably gonna have a bad time if you're

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.530 
probably gonna have a bad time if you're
trying<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.309> do<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.640> as<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.059> warrior<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.420> was

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
trying to do this as a warrior it was

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.549 
trying to do this as a warrior it was
kind<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.690> easy<00:00:42.840> for<00:00:43.140> me<00:00:43.230> because<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.440> have

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
kind of easy for me because I have

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.279 
kind of easy for me because I have
second<00:00:43.860> wind<00:00:44.040> now<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.270> idea<00:00:45.600> here<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.050> you

him<00:01:29.159> with<00:01:29.310> more<00:01:29.520> than<00:01:29.700> 20<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.420> time<00:01:30.659> okay<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
him with more than 20 of time okay the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.380 
him with more than 20 of time okay the
reason<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:32.009> point<00:01:32.220> em<00:01:32.490> along<00:01:32.729> first<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.240> because

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
reason I point em along first is because

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.260 
reason I point em along first is because
m1<00:01:33.930> doesn't<00:01:34.259> do<00:01:34.380> more<00:01:34.590> damage<00:01:34.829> over<00:01:35.250> time<00:01:35.520> Koro

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
m1 doesn't do more damage over time Koro

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.480 
m1 doesn't do more damage over time Koro
undoes<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.110> reason<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.409> don't<00:01:37.560> pull<00:01:37.799> are<00:01:38.250> come

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
undoes the reason I don't pull are come

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.800 
undoes the reason I don't pull are come
on<00:01:38.610> first<00:01:38.880> who<00:01:39.119> actually<00:01:39.270> does<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.659> least

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
on first who actually does the least

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.630 
on first who actually does the least
amount<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.079> damage<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.500> because<00:01:41.100> our<00:01:41.340> coupon

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
amount of damage is because our coupon

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.969 
amount of damage is because our coupon
eats<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.150> basically<00:01:42.750> whenever<00:01:43.290> he<00:01:43.530> eats<00:01:43.799> you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
eats you basically whenever he eats you

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.310 
eats you basically whenever he eats you
it<00:01:44.250> resets<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.970> other<00:01:45.119> two<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.930> don't

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
it resets the other two and so you don't

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.260 
it resets the other two and so you don't
want<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.740> him<00:01:46.950> eat<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:48.090> really

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
want to have him eat you and it really

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.910 
want to have him eat you and it really
causes<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.689> lot<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.930> trouble<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.829> don't

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
causes a lot of trouble and so you don't

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.620 
causes a lot of trouble and so you don't
want<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.159> have<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.280> happen<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.880> what<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.149> what

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
want to have that happen so what I what

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.770 
want to have that happen so what I what
I<00:01:51.659> opted<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.110> do<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.610> pull<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.850> pull<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> two

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
I opted to do is I pull the pull the two

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.569 
I opted to do is I pull the pull the two
of<00:01:54.930> them<00:01:55.079> over<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.619> our<00:01:55.710> Kevon<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.070> burned<00:01:56.460> down

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
of them over to our Kevon I burned down

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.300 
of them over to our Kevon I burned down
our<00:01:56.790> coupon<00:01:57.060> now<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.020> saw<00:01:58.229> there<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.649> had<00:01:59.280> to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
our coupon now as you saw there I had to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.850 
our coupon now as you saw there I had to
kill<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> trash<00:01:59.939> with<00:02:00.299> m1<00:02:00.630> attacking<00:02:01.110> me<00:02:01.200> that

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
kill the trash with m1 attacking me that

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.679 
kill the trash with m1 attacking me that
was<00:02:02.070> because<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.430> was<00:02:02.700> not<00:02:03.180> really<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.540> hurry

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
was because I was not really in a hurry

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.179 
was because I was not really in a hurry
but<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.049> just<00:02:04.290> didn't<00:02:04.530> want<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.740> waste<00:02:04.920> time

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
but I just didn't want to waste time

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.399 
but I just didn't want to waste time
doing<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.390> don't<00:02:06.990> really<00:02:07.200> have

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
doing this and so you don't really have

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.529 
doing this and so you don't really have
to<00:02:07.560> do<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:08.910> go<00:02:09.030> ahead<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.390> kill

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
to do that and you can go ahead and kill

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.750 
to do that and you can go ahead and kill
the<00:02:09.629> trash<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.229> obviously<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.610> probably

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
the trash and obviously you probably

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.490 
the trash and obviously you probably
want<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.150> do<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.599> was<00:02:12.690> stupid<00:02:12.870> for<00:02:13.260> me<00:02:13.290> not

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
want to do that it was stupid for me not

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.870 
want to do that it was stupid for me not
to

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
to

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.010 
to
but<00:02:14.030> I<00:02:14.090> thought<00:02:14.240> I'd<00:02:14.390> be<00:02:14.540> able<00:02:14.630> to<00:02:14.720> do<00:02:14.870> it

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
but I thought I'd be able to do it

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.530 
but I thought I'd be able to do it
anyway<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:16.070> actually<00:02:16.190> was<00:02:16.550> but<00:02:16.910> again<00:02:17.360> you

want<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.750> be<00:02:17.810> careful<00:02:18.050> because<00:02:18.410> they<00:02:19.310> can<00:02:19.610> they

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
want to be careful because they can they

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.270 
want to be careful because they can they
can<00:02:20.120> kind<00:02:20.270> of<00:02:20.360> overwhelm<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:20.900> India<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:22.040> fire

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
can kind of overwhelm you India the fire

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.920 
can kind of overwhelm you India the fire
mops<00:02:22.610> have<00:02:22.760> like<00:02:22.940> two<00:02:23.150> million<00:02:23.420> health<00:02:23.720> or

mops have like two million health or
something<00:02:24.170> like<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.380> on<00:02:24.710> twenty<00:02:25.280> five<00:02:25.460> men

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
something like that on twenty five men

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.520 
something like that on twenty five men
and<00:02:25.970> so<00:02:26.420> they<00:02:26.570> make<00:02:26.750> take<00:02:26.990> you<00:02:27.200> no<00:02:27.320> more<00:02:27.350> than

just a couple of hits to kill on ten man

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.540 
just a couple of hits to kill on ten man
it<00:02:29.900> doesn't<00:02:30.080> really<00:02:30.320> matter<00:02:30.590> depending<00:02:31.190> on

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
it doesn't really matter depending on

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.890 
it doesn't really matter depending on
your<00:02:31.670> gear<00:02:31.910> of<00:02:32.000> course<00:02:32.030> whenever<00:02:32.420> I<00:02:32.540> first<00:02:32.720> did

this<00:02:32.960> on<00:02:33.230> 10<00:02:33.410> min<00:02:33.590> my<00:02:34.100> face<00:02:34.340> rolled<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.060> I

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
this on 10 min my face rolled it and I

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.750 
this on 10 min my face rolled it and I
was<00:02:35.540> like<00:02:35.690> 540<00:02:36.410> item-level<00:02:36.710> he<00:02:37.430> was<00:02:37.520> on<00:02:37.610> like

589 right now and so I just kind of

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.510 
589 right now and so I just kind of
wanted<00:02:41.120> to<00:02:41.150> make<00:02:41.300> sure<00:02:41.330> that<00:02:41.480> I<00:02:42.100> was<00:02:43.100> like<00:02:43.220> able

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
something that was mildly challenging so

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.970 
something that was mildly challenging so
I<00:02:47.420> can<00:02:48.050> show<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:48.230> guys<00:02:48.410> how<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:48.620> rotate<00:02:48.950> my

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
I can show you guys how I rotate my

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.910 
I can show you guys how I rotate my
cooldowns<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.640> what<00:02:49.820> problems<00:02:50.210> I<00:02:50.360> ran<00:02:50.570> into

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
cooldowns and what problems I ran into

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.980 
cooldowns and what problems I ran into
okay<00:02:51.920> so<00:02:51.980> I'm<00:02:52.490> focusing<00:02:53.060> down<00:02:53.210> Koro<00:02:53.540> on<00:02:53.750> right

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
okay so I'm focusing down Koro on right

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.290 
okay so I'm focusing down Koro on right
now<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.740> reason<00:02:55.040> for<00:02:55.070> that<00:02:55.220> is<00:02:55.520> it<00:02:56.150> I'm

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
now and the reason for that is it I'm

timer<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.570> it's<00:04:20.660> not<00:04:20.870> even<00:04:20.989> really<00:04:21.140> a<00:04:21.350> big

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
timer and it's not even really a big

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.740 
timer and it's not even really a big
deal<00:04:21.770> and<00:04:22.100> I<00:04:22.669> want<00:04:22.850> to<00:04:22.910> emphasize<00:04:23.270> again<00:04:23.300> this

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
deal and I want to emphasize again this

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.900 
deal and I want to emphasize again this
is<00:04:23.900> on<00:04:24.050> 25<00:04:24.530> min<00:04:24.770> and<00:04:24.919> so<00:04:25.010> it's<00:04:25.400> significantly

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
is on 25 min and so it's significantly

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.280 
is on 25 min and so it's significantly
more<00:04:26.000> difficult<00:04:26.540> and

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
more difficult and

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.960 
more difficult and
whenever<00:04:27.470> you<00:04:27.560> do<00:04:27.680> this<00:04:27.830> on<00:04:27.980> 10<00:04:28.190> man<00:04:28.340> it's<00:04:28.670> not

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
whenever you do this on 10 man it's not

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.610 
whenever you do this on 10 man it's not
even<00:04:29.240> big<00:04:29.360> deal<00:04:29.570> at<00:04:29.720> all<00:04:30.020> I've<00:04:30.230> done<00:04:30.500> this

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
even big deal at all I've done this

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.200 
even big deal at all I've done this
multiple<00:04:30.830> times<00:04:31.040> on<00:04:31.430> 10<00:04:31.580> men<00:04:31.760> for<00:04:31.790> just

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
multiple times on 10 men for just

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.060 
multiple times on 10 men for just
different<00:04:32.390> friends<00:04:32.690> of<00:04:32.780> mine<00:04:32.900> for<00:04:33.890> whatever

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
different friends of mine for whatever

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.340 
different friends of mine for whatever
reason<00:04:34.550> and<00:04:34.790> so<00:04:35.090> you<00:04:35.660> can<00:04:35.750> also<00:04:35.870> get<00:04:36.020> some<00:04:36.080> good

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
reason and so you can also get some good

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.630 
reason and so you can also get some good
loot<00:04:36.500> and<00:04:36.770> as<00:04:36.830> I<00:04:36.950> said<00:04:37.010> before<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:37.430> can<00:04:37.460> get

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
loot and as I said before you can get

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.430 
loot and as I said before you can get
the<00:04:37.730> grand<00:04:37.940> black<00:04:38.180> war<00:04:38.390> mammoth<00:04:38.780> and<00:04:38.990> so

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
the grand black war mammoth and so

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.300 
the grand black war mammoth and so
that's<00:04:39.650> cool<00:04:39.830> also

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
that's cool also

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.530 
that's cool also
and<00:04:40.610> so<00:04:40.730> if<00:04:40.820> you<00:04:40.880> don't<00:04:41.030> have<00:04:41.120> that<00:04:41.270> you<00:04:41.510> can

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
and so if you don't have that you can

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.420 
and so if you don't have that you can
kind<00:04:41.810> of<00:04:41.840> do<00:04:41.930> that<00:04:42.080> and<00:04:42.290> I<00:04:42.470> think<00:04:42.560> on<00:04:43.160> your<00:04:43.310> goal

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
kind of do that and I think on your goal

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.140 
kind of do that and I think on your goal
doing<00:04:43.700> this<00:04:43.790> also<00:04:44.000> let's<00:04:44.750> say<00:04:45.760> so<00:04:46.760> you<00:04:47.090> know

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
doing this also let's say so you know

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.570 
doing this also let's say so you know
not<00:04:47.450> too<00:04:47.660> bad<00:04:47.870> anyway<00:04:48.500> that's<00:04:48.710> all<00:04:49.190> it<00:04:49.280> takes

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
not too bad anyway that's all it takes

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.090 
not too bad anyway that's all it takes
so<00:04:49.760> again<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.960> strategy<00:04:51.380> is<00:04:51.470> you<00:04:51.500> take<00:04:51.770> em<00:04:51.920> one

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
so again the strategy is you take em one

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.680 
so again the strategy is you take em one
Corps<00:04:52.490> one<00:04:52.640> and<00:04:52.910> take<00:04:53.120> two<00:04:53.360> of<00:04:53.390> them<00:04:53.600> the

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
Corps one and take two of them the

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.870 
Corps one and take two of them the
archive<00:04:53.960> on<00:04:54.080> a<00:04:54.290> wium<00:04:54.710> down<00:04:54.920> and<00:04:55.220> that's<00:04:55.640> all<00:04:55.760> it

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
archive on a wium down and that's all it

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.230 
archive on a wium down and that's all it
takes

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
takes

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.880 
takes
pop<00:04:56.480> some<00:04:56.660> cooldowns<00:04:57.020> and<00:04:57.380> you<00:04:57.590> got<00:04:57.740> the

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
pop some cooldowns and you got the

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.890 
pop some cooldowns and you got the
