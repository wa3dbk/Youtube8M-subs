00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello to all of me vii century we are of 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.960
 new in clash of clan guys today 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.929
 I bring a role of the Lord of the rings and 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.519
 the hobbit mixed as you are 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.889
 listening and what are we going to do today 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.960
 an attack on the good in the purest style 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.150
 of the Lord of the Rings' let's see what 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.250
 first good rather the young already already 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.740
 you will see why in the first place as not 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.490
 could fail my mother is more what 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.849
 we have here I have wanted dragon then 38 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.260
 goblins that are the goblins of good in 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.420
 the place where they find a goal and 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.880
 others then that same good too 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.370
 would be column and then put the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.410
 three magicians would be gandalf saruman and 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.770
 radagast I think it's called the one that has 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.960
 the bird droppings the head 12 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.360
 then they are the dwarves I do not know if they were 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.700
 exactly 12 I think they were 9 more good 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.190
 as I do not remember it stuck 12 and this is 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.350
 the closest thing to the dwarfs then this 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.570
 pica that is in the first place had 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.210
 thought several things I had thought 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.829
 it was a uruguay but I think that in the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.539
 hobby does not appear so that's why I got 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.470
 a little bit the Lord of the Rings' well 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.810
 that can be said to be a uruguay 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.390
 we have here the five walls that break 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.980
 that simply breaks walls of the 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.540
 balonos those who have to come with the 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.570
 such bomb touches the wall and bursts 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:20.230
 it is exactly the same for another 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.400
 side we have red riders are not 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:26.830
 because this is not mounted on horseback 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:30.730
 these are as if soldiers of and I do not know no 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.650
 I know well good soldiers to design by 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.450
 example my mother I know anyone 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.930
 of mines tirith for example any 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.760
 city ​​and then we have to 15 the phytaz is 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.610
 say well there we could also put 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.790
 to legolas my mother we have here to 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.890
 aragorn that I do now and it's perfect to 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.330
 see us going to say something Mr. ARAGON 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.520
 he will not say anything to us 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.610
 I have come rides us if a Valkyrie 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.720
 perfect the Valkyrie could also be 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.200
 black perfectly but not the 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.119
 Valkyrie is just the elf of which she 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.759
 a dwarf falls in the movie of 'the 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.250
 hobbit ' agree and finally we have 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.860
 here two pigs ride that what they're going 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.510
 to make good are the guardians of the two 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.470
 towers and the lord of the rings the two 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.560
 towers 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.780
 we have two perfect rooms so 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.790
 We are going to give you a lot of boys 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.710
 thanks for being on the other side of the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.270
 screen one more day and we will look for a 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.790
 village by the way spells because I've 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.410
 caught one of each one so as not to be 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.150
 simply because 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.460
 By the way, remember to see if we can 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.960
 get to the figures of 200 I like for 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.880
 this video because I think it's 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.100
 quite original not in terms of 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.470
 thematic against is everything everything is very 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.270
 original so let's see let's 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.550
 look for a good village a good one and 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.980
 beautiful village that we are already in gold 3 and 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.810
 sincerely, it's not like I like it 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.170
 much to be in gold 3 by the way this 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.480
 village 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.170
 I think you came up something very similar to 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.209
 like this village to do as in your 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.800
 life of drinks and such is worth perfect me 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.570
 love this village we are going to attack her 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.950
 see let's think about a way because 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.560
 Well this attack is a bit 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.870
 rare is not a very common attack and what 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.150
 so we do not take a fart but 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.910
 well nothing happens to see there we have 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.040
 this is perfect because we are going to throw is that 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.170
 I believe that this village is too yes 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.250
 I think it 's totally or too much 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.290
 but 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.330
 too much or it would be a real abuse 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.460
 we'll see 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.800
 my mother this can be an abuse but 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.240
 this is an abuse that I like we are going to 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.800
 see where to enter I would like to get 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.480
 to this dark elixir I would like to get 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.390
 to this tower of magicians that I do not want to 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.000
 may arrive but meanwhile there 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.950
 let's use it first let's take 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.260
 down to see no no first thing will throw us 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.850
 to aragorn that will die super fast 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.310
 we are also going to cast the castle for 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.260
