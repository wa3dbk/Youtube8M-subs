the<00:00:00.210> thin<00:00:00.390> client<00:00:00.570> here<00:00:01.079> again<00:00:01.380> and<00:00:01.589> I'm<00:00:02.399> going

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
the thin client here again and I'm going

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.950 
the thin client here again and I'm going
to<00:00:03.680> embed<00:00:04.680> this<00:00:05.009> AC<00:00:05.370> gig<00:00:05.759> ID<00:00:06.089> hard<00:00:06.660> drive

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
to embed this AC gig ID hard drive

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.080 
to embed this AC gig ID hard drive
inside<00:00:07.649> it<00:00:07.890> so<00:00:08.880> that<00:00:09.179> we<00:00:09.389> can<00:00:10.849> load<00:00:11.849> other

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
inside it so that we can load other

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.520 
inside it so that we can load other
offerings<00:00:12.480> distance<00:00:12.840> on<00:00:12.960> it<00:00:12.990> which<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.290> think

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
offerings distance on it which I think

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.799 
offerings distance on it which I think
will<00:00:13.679> be<00:00:13.710> windows<00:00:14.190> 8.1<00:00:14.599> because<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.660> have<00:00:15.780> a

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
will be windows 8.1 because I have a

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.320 
will be windows 8.1 because I have a
license<00:00:16.170> key<00:00:16.320> for<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.940> and<00:00:17.940> it'll<00:00:18.090> just<00:00:18.210> be

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
license key for that and it'll just be

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.970 
license key for that and it'll just be
interesting<00:00:18.690> how<00:00:18.840> Windows<00:00:19.140> 8<00:00:19.350> operates<00:00:19.770> on

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
interesting how Windows 8 operates on

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.890 
interesting how Windows 8 operates on
such<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> device<00:00:20.510> so<00:00:21.510> I'm<00:00:21.570> just<00:00:21.660> going<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.869> open

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
such a device so I'm just going to open

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.080 
such a device so I'm just going to open
it<00:00:22.109> up<00:00:22.260> show<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.710> around<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.580> stick<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.910> hard

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
it up show you around and stick the hard

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.480 
it up show you around and stick the hard
drive<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:25.529> know<00:00:25.619> try<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:25.920> do<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.250> as

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
drive in and you know try and do that as

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.370 
drive in and you know try and do that as
best<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.000> can<00:00:27.240> because<00:00:27.720> clearly<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.170> isn't

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
best I can because clearly this isn't

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.099 
best I can because clearly this isn't
intended<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.789> have<00:00:30.000> an<00:00:30.210> 80<00:00:30.330> gig<00:00:30.570> hard<00:00:30.810> drive<00:00:30.869> in

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
intended to have an 80 gig hard drive in

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.590 
intended to have an 80 gig hard drive in
it<00:00:31.369> but<00:00:32.369> trust<00:00:32.820> me<00:00:33.000> there<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.210> quite<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> bit

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
it but trust me there is quite a bit

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.830 
it but trust me there is quite a bit
space<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:34.020> there<00:00:35.239> so<00:00:36.239> right<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> first<00:00:36.719> thing

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
space in there so right the first thing

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.580 
space in there so right the first thing
you<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.200> do<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.829> take<00:00:38.370> off<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:40.110> top<00:00:40.290> screw

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
you have to do is take off the top screw

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.130 
you have to do is take off the top screw
here<00:00:40.860> which<00:00:40.920> then<00:00:41.430> will<00:00:41.700> let<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.510> access<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
here which then will let you access the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.130 
here which then will let you access the
internal<00:00:43.500> USB<00:00:43.739> ports<00:00:44.399> as<00:00:44.550> well<00:00:44.930> see<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:45.960> this

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
internal USB ports as well see that this

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.100 
internal USB ports as well see that this
slides<00:00:46.559> forward<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.789> then<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.239> get<00:00:48.420> them<00:00:48.930> you

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
slides forward and then we get them you

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.060 
slides forward and then we get them you
can<00:00:49.289> see<00:00:49.500> inside<00:00:49.890> there<00:00:50.219> now<00:00:51.059> from<00:00:51.690> there<00:00:52.079> you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
can see inside there now from there you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.029 
can see inside there now from there you
can<00:00:53.280> take<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.640> bit<00:00:53.820> off<00:00:53.850> there<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:55.050> then<00:00:55.110> you

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
can take that bit off there and then you

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.720 
can take that bit off there and then you
can<00:00:56.660> see<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:57.989> inside<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.770> now<00:00:58.800> there's

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
can see this with inside it now there's

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.000 
can see this with inside it now there's
a<00:00:59.820> Windows<00:01:00.149> 7<00:01:00.570> license<00:01:00.989> key<00:01:01.260> behind<00:01:01.649> my<00:01:01.829> hand

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
a Windows 7 license key behind my hand

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.630 
a Windows 7 license key behind my hand
but<00:01:02.780> you<00:01:03.780> can<00:01:03.930> then<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:04.260> basically<00:01:04.680> slip<00:01:05.159> you

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
but you can then just basically slip you

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.240 
but you can then just basically slip you
can<00:01:05.820> then<00:01:05.909> basically<00:01:06.710> take<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> screws<00:01:08.100> off

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
can then basically take the screws off

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.600 
can then basically take the screws off
this<00:01:08.630> section<00:01:09.630> here<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.080> then<00:01:10.979> take<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.369> off

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
this section here and then take this off

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.010 
this section here and then take this off
and<00:01:13.159> this<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.310> what<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.729> inside<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.780> thin

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
and this is what the inside of the thin

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.320 
and this is what the inside of the thin
client<00:01:16.170> looks<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:17.759> just<00:01:17.909> twist<00:01:18.180> it

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
client looks like so we just twist it

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.160 
client looks like so we just twist it
round<00:01:18.799> I'm<00:01:19.799> going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.070> look<00:01:20.430> from<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.930> top

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
round I'm going to look from the top

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.890 
round I'm going to look from the top
here<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.820> first<00:01:23.820> thing<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.630> there

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
here the first thing you can see there

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.789 
here the first thing you can see there
is<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.799> RAM<00:01:26.600> this<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.840> take<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.259> four<00:01:28.590> gig

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
is the RAM this can take up to four gig

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.090 
is the RAM this can take up to four gig
of<00:01:28.920> ram<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:30.060> multiples<00:01:30.750> or<00:01:30.990> sub<00:01:31.320> fractions

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
of ram and in multiples or sub fractions

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.609 
of ram and in multiples or sub fractions
of<00:01:32.250> 1066<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.420> five<00:01:33.630> three<00:01:33.900> three<00:01:34.049> mega

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
of 1066 so this is five three three mega

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.130 
of 1066 so this is five three three mega
RAM<00:01:35.100> at<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.310> moment<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:36.750> then<00:01:36.930> you've<00:01:37.049> got

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
RAM at the moment and then you've got

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.990 
RAM at the moment and then you've got
the<00:01:37.229> big<00:01:37.380> heat<00:01:37.619> sink<00:01:37.650> which<00:01:38.400> covers<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.540> CPU

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
the big heat sink which covers the CPU

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.999 
the big heat sink which covers the CPU
and<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.570> Northbridge<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.560> can't<00:01:43.799> really

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
and the Northbridge but you can't really

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.569 
and the Northbridge but you can't really
see<00:01:44.729> them<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.450> camera<00:01:45.750> there<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.579> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
see them on the camera there and the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.700 
see them on the camera there and the
other<00:01:47.700> thing<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.939> see<00:01:48.180> there<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.140> flash

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
other thing you see there is the flash

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.420 
other thing you see there is the flash
module<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:51.390> that's<00:01:52.790> that<00:01:53.790> thing<00:01:54.149> there<00:01:54.630> and

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
module so that's that thing there and

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.120 
module so that's that thing there and
underneath<00:01:56.430> there<00:01:57.110> it's<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.680> about

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
underneath there it's just about

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.920 
underneath there it's just about
possible<00:01:59.790> to<00:02:00.090> see<00:02:01.670> like<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> little<00:02:02.880> PCIe<00:02:03.509> slot

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
possible to see like a little PCIe slot

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.660 
possible to see like a little PCIe slot
which<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.290> used<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.920> wireless<00:02:05.159> card

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
which is used for the wireless card

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.169 
which is used for the wireless card
should<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.630> use<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.140> now<00:02:08.000> well<00:02:09.000> I'm

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
should you use it now well I'm

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.190 
should you use it now well I'm
interested<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.370> the<00:02:11.370> IDE<00:02:11.730> pull<00:02:12.120> up<00:02:12.360> here

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
interested in is the IDE pull up here

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.620 
interested in is the IDE pull up here
because<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.800> is<00:02:13.920> just<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.190> box<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.790> 44<00:02:15.420> pin

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
because it is just a box and a 44 pin

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.040 
because it is just a box and a 44 pin
IDE<00:02:16.080> connector<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:17.790> which<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.330> can<00:02:18.450> just<00:02:18.810> plug

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
IDE connector to which I can just plug

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.800 
IDE connector to which I can just plug
in<00:02:19.260> my<00:02:20.160> hard<00:02:20.400> drive<00:02:20.640> here<00:02:20.940> now<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.500> fun<00:02:22.860> bit<00:02:23.160> is

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
in my hard drive here now the fun bit is

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.410 
in my hard drive here now the fun bit is
working<00:02:24.810> out<00:02:25.670> right<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.700> think<00:02:26.849> that'll<00:02:27.180> go<00:02:27.300> in

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
working out right I think that'll go in

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.930 
working out right I think that'll go in
there<00:02:27.599> like<00:02:27.780> that

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
there like that

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.110 
there like that
just<00:02:29.940> plug<00:02:30.209> that<00:02:30.239> in<00:02:30.600> I<00:02:32.239> just<00:02:33.239> check<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.989> the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
just plug that in I just check that the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.949 
just plug that in I just check that the
pointer<00:02:36.120> things<00:02:36.360> pointing<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.930> same

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
pointer things pointing the same

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.920 
pointer things pointing the same
direction<00:02:37.140> on<00:02:37.620> both<00:02:37.830> hard<00:02:38.130> drives<00:02:38.810> see<00:02:39.810> that's

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
direction on both hard drives see that's

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.120 
direction on both hard drives see that's
pointing<00:02:40.319> away<00:02:40.410> good

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
pointing away good

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.670 
pointing away good
so<00:02:41.910> both<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.300> hard<00:02:42.480> drives<00:02:42.690> now<00:02:42.900> plugged<00:02:43.319> into

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
so both the hard drives now plugged into

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.630 
so both the hard drives now plugged into
the<00:02:44.040> thin<00:02:44.250> client<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.849> same<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.950> now<00:02:46.980> we<00:02:47.160> can

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
the thin client the same so now we can

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.059 
the thin client the same so now we can
start<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.720> go<00:02:48.840> find<00:02:49.080> someone<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.380> put<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.830> for<00:02:50.040> a

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
start to go find someone to put it for a

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.559 
start to go find someone to put it for a
start<00:02:50.750> but<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:51.780> think<00:02:52.140> rather<00:02:52.350> helpfully<00:02:53.569> all

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
start but I think rather helpfully all

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.500 
start but I think rather helpfully all
pull<00:02:55.019> that<00:02:55.110> fear<00:02:55.380> in<00:02:55.470> there<00:02:56.060> maybe<00:02:57.060> maybe<00:02:57.360> not

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
pull that fear in there maybe maybe not

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.300 
pull that fear in there maybe maybe not
maybe<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.840> speakers<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.380> way<00:02:58.500> otherwise

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
maybe the speakers in the way otherwise

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.479 
maybe the speakers in the way otherwise
I<00:02:59.610> could<00:02:59.970> probably<00:03:03.560> that's<00:03:04.560> not<00:03:05.010> really

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
I could probably that's not really

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.030 
I could probably that's not really
fitting<00:03:06.090> under<00:03:06.450> yeah<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:07.140> can<00:03:07.440> just<00:03:07.470> embed<00:03:07.769> it

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
fitting under yeah I can just embed it

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.330 
fitting under yeah I can just embed it
in<00:03:08.160> there<00:03:09.019> now<00:03:10.019> obviously<00:03:10.590> no<00:03:10.739> you<00:03:10.799> couldn't

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
in there now obviously no you couldn't

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.030 
in there now obviously no you couldn't
you<00:03:11.519> wouldn't<00:03:11.760> normally<00:03:11.880> be<00:03:12.120> able<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.540> do<00:03:12.720> this

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
you wouldn't normally be able to do this

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.509 
you wouldn't normally be able to do this
but<00:03:14.040> this<00:03:14.250> hard<00:03:14.549> drive<00:03:14.819> has<00:03:15.150> got<00:03:16.519> insulation

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
but this hard drive has got insulation

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.990 
but this hard drive has got insulation
insulation<00:03:17.940> material<00:03:18.780> on<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.019> back<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.650> to

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
insulation material on the back of it to

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.490 
insulation material on the back of it to
prevent<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.269> making<00:03:21.660> contact<00:03:22.230> with<00:03:22.350> the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
prevent it making contact with the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:30.289 
prevent it making contact with the
components<00:03:23.220> underneath<00:03:25.070> so<00:03:26.070> that's<00:03:26.220> okay<00:03:29.299> and

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
components underneath so that's okay and

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.430 
components underneath so that's okay and
it's<00:03:30.420> now<00:03:30.600> just<00:03:30.780> going<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:30.989> boot<00:03:31.170> off<00:03:31.260> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
it's now just going to boot off the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.030 
it's now just going to boot off the
memory<00:03:31.739> stick<00:03:32.600> so<00:03:33.600> we<00:03:33.750> can<00:03:33.780> then<00:03:34.140> proceed<00:03:34.799> from

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
memory stick so we can then proceed from

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.120 
memory stick so we can then proceed from
there<00:03:37.430> there<00:03:38.430> you<00:03:38.489> go<00:03:39.290> it's<00:03:40.290> now<00:03:40.500> booting

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
there there you go it's now booting

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.690 
there there you go it's now booting
Windows<00:03:41.880> 8<00:03:42.060> style<00:03:42.799> so<00:03:43.799> I<00:03:43.859> saw<00:03:44.130> once<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.430> IDE

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
Windows 8 style so I saw once the IDE

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.069 
Windows 8 style so I saw once the IDE
hard<00:03:44.820> drive<00:03:45.269> it's<00:03:45.570> going<00:03:45.630> to<00:03:45.750> be<00:03:45.840> just<00:03:45.930> the

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
hard drive it's going to be just the

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.150 
hard drive it's going to be just the
usual<00:03:46.320> way<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:47.420> I'll<00:03:48.420> um<00:03:48.870> start<00:03:49.829> recording

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
usual way and I'll um start recording

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.830 
usual way and I'll um start recording
again<00:03:50.250> after<00:03:50.609> up<00:03:50.700> on<00:03:50.820> that<00:03:51.030> so<00:03:51.390> you<00:03:51.450> can<00:03:51.720> sort

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
again after up on that so you can sort

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.080 
again after up on that so you can sort
of<00:03:51.959> see<00:03:52.170> how<00:03:52.410> many<00:03:53.310> goes<00:03:53.459> eight<00:03:53.640> is<00:03:53.790> on<00:03:53.940> this

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
of see how many goes eight is on this

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.420 
of see how many goes eight is on this
thing<00:03:57.200> right<00:03:58.200> now<00:03:58.230> but<00:03:58.560> Windows<00:03:58.859> 8<00:03:59.100> fully

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430

installed on the thin client I'm just
going<00:04:02.579> to<00:04:02.640> pair<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:02.970> up<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:04.370> you<00:04:05.370> can<00:04:05.609> see<00:04:06.209> what

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
going to pair it up and you can see what

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:15.050 
going to pair it up and you can see what
goes<00:04:08.280> on<00:04:11.480> so<00:04:13.100> first<00:04:14.100> off<00:04:14.430> yellow<00:04:14.790> you<00:04:14.850> guys

mechanical<00:07:00.510> hard<00:07:00.720> drive<00:07:02.150> so<00:07:03.150> that's<00:07:04.050> all

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.290 
mechanical hard drive so that's all

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.950 
mechanical hard drive so that's all
absolutely<00:07:05.010> fine<00:07:05.280> I<00:07:05.580> mean<00:07:05.640> we<00:07:05.970> can<00:07:06.180> just<00:07:06.390> for

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
absolutely fine I mean we can just for

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.630 
absolutely fine I mean we can just for
the<00:07:07.050> no<00:07:07.970> go<00:07:08.970> to<00:07:09.030> the<00:07:09.180> charms<00:07:09.630> bar<00:07:09.720> I<00:07:09.930> guess

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:10.640 
the no go to the charms bar I guess

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.020 
the no go to the charms bar I guess
bring<00:07:11.640> that<00:07:11.760> up<00:07:11.970> to<00:07:12.390> see<00:07:12.660> it's<00:07:12.780> all<00:07:12.900> just

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.030 
bring that up to see it's all just

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.570 
bring that up to see it's all just
absolutely<00:07:15.030> normal

video performance wise I can do 720p
h.264<00:07:29.850> YouTube<00:07:30.270> video<00:07:31.520> but<00:07:33.560> you<00:07:34.560> can<00:07:34.620> do<00:07:35.010> 1080p

mpeg-2<00:07:36.510> which<00:07:36.810> is<00:07:36.990> slightly<00:07:37.260> easier<00:07:37.710> on<00:07:37.920> the

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:38.100 
mpeg-2 which is slightly easier on the

computer to decode see how all in all as

you<00:07:43.140> as<00:07:43.710> you<00:07:43.800> can<00:07:43.860> see<00:07:44.100> it<00:07:44.280> can<00:07:44.490> support<00:07:44.730> arrow

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 
you as you can see it can support arrow

you as you can see it can support arrow
and<00:07:45.420> all<00:07:45.480> the<00:07:45.570> features<00:07:45.780> that<00:07:45.990> come<00:07:46.200> with<00:07:46.380> that

and all the features that come with that

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.000 
and all the features that come with that
so<00:07:47.610> clearly<00:07:48.510> it<00:07:48.780> has<00:07:48.990> some<00:07:49.290> graphical<00:07:49.740> grant

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.010 
so clearly it has some graphical grant

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.570 
so clearly it has some graphical grant
in<00:07:50.160> it<00:07:50.340> or<00:07:51.150> by<00:07:51.420> not<00:07:52.290> enough<00:07:52.500> to<00:07:52.650> decode<00:07:53.010> full<00:07:53.220> HD
