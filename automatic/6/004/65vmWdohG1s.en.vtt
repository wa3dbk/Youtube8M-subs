00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
fiction I think people really I'm a

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.960 
fiction I think people really I'm a
scientist<00:00:18.730> not<00:00:19.770> get<00:00:20.770> into<00:00:20.980> my<00:00:21.279> shows<00:00:21.580> and

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
scientist not get into my shows and

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.960 
scientist not get into my shows and
stories<00:00:22.779> too<00:00:22.960> and<00:00:23.140> so<00:00:23.260> I<00:00:23.289> feel<00:00:23.619> like<00:00:23.970> it's

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
stories too and so I feel like it's

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.510 
stories too and so I feel like it's
exciting<00:00:25.359> to<00:00:25.420> be<00:00:25.480> on<00:00:25.570> this<00:00:25.720> side<00:00:25.900> of<00:00:25.960> that

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.290 

of<00:00:32.420> the<00:00:32.599> individual<00:00:33.020> characters<00:00:33.670> I<00:00:34.670> think

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
of the individual characters I think

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.090 
of the individual characters I think
will<00:00:35.420> understand<00:00:35.930> more<00:00:36.110> certainly<00:00:36.710> about<00:00:36.890> who

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
will understand more certainly about who

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.400 
will understand more certainly about who
they<00:00:37.250> are<00:00:37.400> how<00:00:37.700> they<00:00:37.730> got<00:00:38.060> to<00:00:38.720> be<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:39.080> way<00:00:39.230> they

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
they are how they got to be the way they

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.170 
they are how they got to be the way they
are<00:00:39.440> we're<00:00:40.220> going<00:00:40.310> to<00:00:40.400> understand<00:00:40.910> a<00:00:41.000> lot<00:00:41.120> more

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
are we're going to understand a lot more

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.120 
are we're going to understand a lot more
about<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:41.750> world<00:00:41.960> and<00:00:42.230> how<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:42.500> world<00:00:42.739> got<00:00:42.980> to

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
about the world and how the world got to

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.240 
about the world and how the world got to
be<00:00:43.220> the<00:00:43.340> way<00:00:43.430> that<00:00:43.460> it<00:00:43.700> is<00:00:44.380> which<00:00:45.380> is<00:00:45.410> kind<00:00:46.100> of<00:00:46.190> a

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
be the way that it is which is kind of a

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.860 
be the way that it is which is kind of a
backstory<00:00:46.670> right<00:00:47.210> it's<00:00:47.390> an<00:00:47.480> origin<00:00:47.840> story

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
backstory right it's an origin story

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:58.470 
backstory right it's an origin story
really<00:00:48.350> so

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.450 

my<00:00:59.480> name<00:00:59.629> is<00:00:59.719> Ali<00:00:59.930> she<00:01:00.320> is<00:01:00.739> a<00:01:00.800> hologram<00:01:01.340> but

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
my name is Ali she is a hologram but

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.369 
my name is Ali she is a hologram but
she's<00:01:01.610> technically<00:01:02.090> an<00:01:02.270> a<00:01:02.390> on<00:01:02.420> that<00:01:02.840> has<00:01:03.199> an

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
she's technically an a on that has an

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.370 
she's technically an a on that has an
avatar<00:01:03.649> sort<00:01:04.220> of<00:01:04.309> physical<00:01:04.930> presence<00:01:05.930> in<00:01:06.260> the

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
avatar sort of physical presence in the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.910 
avatar sort of physical presence in the
house

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.910 

yes

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
yes

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.780 
yes
are<00:01:13.009> we<00:01:13.159> supposed<00:01:13.580> to<00:01:13.670> assume<00:01:13.970> that

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.730 

safe<00:01:18.790> ish<00:01:19.060> assumption<00:01:19.690> i<00:01:19.810> think<00:01:20.050> but<00:01:20.229> it<00:01:20.470> won't

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
safe ish assumption i think but it won't

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.860 
safe ish assumption i think but it won't
be<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.370> story<00:01:21.760> that<00:01:22.060> you're<00:01:22.300> probably

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
be the story that you're probably

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.900 
be the story that you're probably
anticipating<00:01:23.620> and<00:01:23.800> the<00:01:24.130> nuke<00:01:24.370> is<00:01:24.550> probably

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
anticipating and the nuke is probably

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.360 
anticipating and the nuke is probably
not<00:01:25.150> why<00:01:25.390> you<00:01:25.450> think<00:01:25.960> it's<00:01:26.080> there<00:01:26.290> so<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:27.280> know

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
not why you think it's there so you know

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.520 
not why you think it's there so you know
one<00:01:28.030> of<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.180> things<00:01:28.210> we<00:01:28.450> like<00:01:28.600> to<00:01:28.630> do<00:01:28.810> is<00:01:28.990> sort

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
one of the things we like to do is sort

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.050 
one of the things we like to do is sort
of<00:01:29.590> set<00:01:29.800> up<00:01:29.830> expectations<00:01:30.250> at<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.729> end<00:01:30.880> of<00:01:31.000> the

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
of set up expectations at the end of the

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.570 
of set up expectations at the end of the
season<00:01:31.180> and<00:01:31.479> then<00:01:31.600> turn<00:01:32.260> it<00:01:32.290> on<00:01:32.500> its<00:01:32.650> ear<00:01:32.950> we're

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
season and then turn it on its ear we're

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.010 
season and then turn it on its ear we're
going<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:33.760> do<00:01:33.850> that<00:01:33.970> again<00:01:34.119> you<00:01:34.600> know<00:01:34.690> with<00:01:34.840> my

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
going to do that again you know with my

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.020 
going to do that again you know with my
weather<00:01:35.290> Clark<00:01:36.100> landing<00:01:36.490> in<00:01:36.580> that<00:01:36.640> white<00:01:36.820> room

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
weather Clark landing in that white room

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.270 
weather Clark landing in that white room
oh<00:01:37.300> my<00:01:37.960> god<00:01:38.110> she's<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.410> prisoner<00:01:38.650> again<00:01:39.100> and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
oh my god she's a prisoner again and

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.859 
oh my god she's a prisoner again and
then<00:01:39.369> for<00:01:39.850> a<00:01:39.880> little<00:01:39.940> while<00:01:40.240> we<00:01:40.420> thought<00:01:40.570> wait

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
then for a little while we thought wait

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.359 
then for a little while we thought wait
a<00:01:40.930> second<00:01:41.259> maybe<00:01:41.380> it's<00:01:41.619> not<00:01:41.680> so<00:01:41.860> bad<00:01:42.009> here<00:01:42.070> and

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
a second maybe it's not so bad here and

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.680 
a second maybe it's not so bad here and
then<00:01:42.460> of<00:01:42.580> course<00:01:42.610> it's<00:01:42.940> like<00:01:43.119> worse<00:01:43.360> than<00:01:43.390> you

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
then of course it's like worse than you

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.530 
then of course it's like worse than you
ever<00:01:43.840> thought<00:01:44.170> it<00:01:44.830> was<00:01:44.950> going<00:01:45.070> to<00:01:45.130> be<00:01:45.250> so<00:01:45.540> maybe

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
ever thought it was going to be so maybe

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.469 
ever thought it was going to be so maybe
that's<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.960> formula<00:01:47.350> I<00:01:47.530> don't<00:01:47.710> know<00:01:47.770> are<00:01:48.280> you

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
that's a formula I don't know are you

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.260 
that's a formula I don't know are you
season<00:01:49.479> a<00:01:50.140> lot<00:01:50.530> of<00:01:50.649> folks<00:01:50.860> that<00:01:51.789> we<00:01:51.910> think<00:01:52.149> are

network and the network that we are on
is<00:04:46.250> youthful<00:04:46.819> and<00:04:47.330> so<00:04:47.840> you<00:04:48.469> know<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:48.830> show

is youthful and so you know the show
started<00:04:49.639> out<00:04:49.759> as<00:04:49.909> there<00:04:50.090> was<00:04:50.210> a<00:04:50.240> big<00:04:50.449> Lord<00:04:50.659> of

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.689 
into that but you know I also believe
that<00:04:55.639> when<00:04:56.539> you<00:04:56.900> are<00:04:57.199> a<00:04:57.229> group<00:04:57.710> like<00:04:58.069> that<00:04:58.129> and

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
that when you are a group like that and

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.740 
that when you are a group like that and
the<00:04:59.270> external<00:05:00.229> forces<00:05:00.979> are<00:05:01.219> against<00:05:01.789> you<00:05:01.940> that

you<00:05:02.810> come<00:05:03.199> together<00:05:03.530> right<00:05:03.770> so<00:05:03.949> that<00:05:04.129> Lord<00:05:04.340> of

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
you come together right so that Lord of

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.580 
you come together right so that Lord of
the<00:05:04.490> Flies<00:05:04.610> like<00:05:05.030> internal<00:05:05.569> conflict<00:05:05.990> went

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
the Flies like internal conflict went

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.610 
the Flies like internal conflict went
away<00:05:06.680> as<00:05:07.039> the<00:05:07.430> hundred<00:05:08.180> became<00:05:08.509> like<00:05:08.719> a<00:05:08.960> unit

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
away as the hundred became like a unit

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.800 
away as the hundred became like a unit
battle-tested<00:05:10.219> unit<00:05:10.849> and<00:05:11.389> then<00:05:11.509> it<00:05:11.629> became

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
battle-tested unit and then it became

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.869 
battle-tested unit and then it became
about<00:05:12.050> that<00:05:12.770> existential<00:05:13.310> threat<00:05:13.729> and

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:13.879 
about that existential threat and

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:15.700 
about that existential threat and
fighting<00:05:14.240> for<00:05:14.479> their<00:05:14.569> lives<00:05:14.750> and<00:05:15.139> you<00:05:15.590> know

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
fighting for their lives and you know

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.219 
fighting for their lives and you know
Band<00:05:16.190> of<00:05:16.280> Brothers<00:05:16.340> and<00:05:17.000> the<00:05:17.360> hundred<00:05:17.870> are<00:05:18.080> now

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
Band of Brothers and the hundred are now

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:19.899 
Band of Brothers and the hundred are now
sort<00:05:18.469> of<00:05:18.560> you<00:05:19.039> know<00:05:19.069> there's<00:05:19.310> more<00:05:19.460> in<00:05:19.580> common

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909 
sort of you know there's more in common

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:21.730 
sort of you know there's more in common
between<00:05:20.029> those<00:05:20.360> people<00:05:20.659> then<00:05:20.779> with<00:05:21.440> their

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
between those people then with their

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.540 
between those people then with their
parents<00:05:22.159> that<00:05:22.370> came<00:05:22.639> down

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
parents that came down

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.330 
parents that came down
and<00:05:24.000> I<00:05:24.390> think<00:05:24.690> by<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:24.870> end<00:05:24.960> of<00:05:25.110> season<00:05:25.290> two<00:05:25.590> we

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
and I think by the end of season two we

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.120 
and I think by the end of season two we
see<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:27.090> sky<00:05:27.810> people<00:05:28.080> in<00:05:28.320> general<00:05:28.470> now<00:05:28.890> are

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
see the sky people in general now are

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.700 
see the sky people in general now are
sort<00:05:29.310> of<00:05:29.370> that<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:30.360> so<00:05:30.690> we'll<00:05:30.870> see<00:05:31.170> what<00:05:31.350> goes

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
sort of that and so we'll see what goes

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.400 
sort of that and so we'll see what goes
on<00:05:31.920> in<00:05:32.160> a<00:05:32.280> bigger<00:05:33.120> it's<00:05:33.480> even<00:05:33.750> bigger<00:05:33.900> in

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
on in a bigger it's even bigger in

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.380 
on in a bigger it's even bigger in
season<00:05:34.740> three<00:05:34.980> and<00:05:35.010> we<00:05:35.280> go<00:05:35.490> out<00:05:35.730> even<00:05:36.180> further

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
season three and we go out even further

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.220 
season three and we go out even further
and<00:05:36.750> we<00:05:36.810> meet<00:05:37.230> even<00:05:37.590> more<00:05:37.860> of<00:05:38.190> the<00:05:38.460> world<00:05:38.850> and

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
and we meet even more of the world and

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:46.460 
and we meet even more of the world and
hopefully<00:05:40.230> understand<00:05:40.650> it<00:05:40.770> better

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:53.800 

I<00:05:46.530> am<00:05:47.310> sure<00:05:47.640> it<00:05:47.790> was<00:05:47.910> amazing

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:59.410

the<00:06:00.080> trailer

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.180 

I<00:06:06.420> don't<00:06:07.110> know<00:06:07.200> it's<00:06:07.380> affecting<00:06:07.830> her<00:06:07.950> more

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
I don't know it's affecting her more

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.470 
I don't know it's affecting her more
certainly<00:06:09.350> Lex's<00:06:10.350> betrayal<00:06:10.890> heart<00:06:11.790> deeply

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
certainly Lex's betrayal heart deeply

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.600 
certainly Lex's betrayal heart deeply
she<00:06:13.260> trusted<00:06:14.190> her<00:06:15.110> came<00:06:16.110> to<00:06:16.350> very<00:06:16.890> much<00:06:17.160> care

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
she trusted her came to very much care

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.790 
she trusted her came to very much care
about<00:06:18.030> her<00:06:18.240> was<00:06:18.480> definitely<00:06:19.050> attracted<00:06:19.590> to

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
about her was definitely attracted to

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.230 
about her was definitely attracted to
her<00:06:19.950> and<00:06:19.980> that<00:06:20.310> was<00:06:20.430> the<00:06:20.550> beginning<00:06:20.670> something

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
her and that was the beginning something

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.520 
her and that was the beginning something
I<00:06:21.450> think<00:06:21.840> they<00:06:21.960> could<00:06:22.140> have<00:06:22.170> been<00:06:22.350> really

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
I think they could have been really

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.800 
I think they could have been really
special<00:06:22.650> and<00:06:23.100> then<00:06:23.550> she<00:06:23.790> did<00:06:23.970> which<00:06:24.120> LexA<00:06:24.690> did

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
special and then she did which LexA did

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.050 
special and then she did which LexA did
what<00:06:24.930> she<00:06:24.960> did<00:06:25.110> which<00:06:25.410> is<00:06:25.670> essentially<00:06:26.670> betray

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
what she did which is essentially betray

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.910 
what she did which is essentially betray
her<00:06:27.270> for<00:06:27.600> her<00:06:27.750> own<00:06:27.900> people<00:06:28.350> right<00:06:28.560> the<00:06:28.710> shows

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:28.920 
her for her own people right the shows

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.920
