00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:08.250
 hi to all and m kerron today 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.230
 new episode of goals ranks for 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.549
 this part I'm robbing in the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.590
 hydroponic house 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.090
 and it's a map that I really 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.890
 very want to test game never 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.330
 tested until now and in addition to 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.640
 steering mode because we access 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.939
 inside the house so with the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.810
 farms in fact and it's for this 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.210
 practice i will play with the class 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.009
 executor and I really want to test 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.099
 a new shotgun so I want 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.239
 to buy 37.6 take out as I have 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.280
 a lot of money as much use it 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.420
 here is one and hold all this is very 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.340
 well it's gone so we're the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.260
 police and we owe it to you 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.250
 prevent criminals from seizing so 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.600
 I do not know the same at all by 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.770
 against that we have to agree 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.930
 I'm here at shit it was better just 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.910
 I did not shoot at the same time 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.640
 do not know the scope of the bus at all 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.530
 take out anyway I will test it 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.240
 in this video will have to get used to 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.510
 a little bit I was doing that magnum 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.439
 870 peace was very very cool but by 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.649
 against was suffering from a problem our 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.530
 web code our code was a bit nil 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.289
 how to understand that you shoot a 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.770
 big problem know a lot of time to 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:19.710
 recorded close to his display 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.090
 damage so I hope this movie does not 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.999
 does not suffer the same problem either 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.670
 I hold the enemy below 

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:32.850
 trend is closed to apprentices we saw 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.060
 that it could approach the shoot on it 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.060
 as well 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.290
 just so ok so here we have to defend 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.710
 point b canyon the enemy who goes away 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.710
 with the bag 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.570
 so yeah my opinion he'll go out here 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:02:01.110
 just where he goes even more 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:03.810
 far in April to his plans well then a 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.080
 I'm a little scared I'm not too 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.250
 where to go 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.250
 I do not know the map at all 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:15.330
 I'm lost there was a lamp 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.760
 tactically there I tell you I do not know 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.770
 at all the map 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:26.780
 I find where are the enemies of a rank 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.780
 13 that's cool on 13 or the cannula 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:37.260
 Havre in you you were not going to tone 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.800
 do not count on me to leave you 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.700
 go 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:46.710
 that's up against the wat at Corsican a 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.590
 pirate hockey yeah that's the new 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.990
 fashion 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.320
 oulala I want to put there if I see it 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:03:00.270
 who is approaching to take this bag to fixed 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:03.030
 I do not have much we was 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.230
 this army in it's not true way 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.290
 I was hungry I'm interested in 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.790
 go out he had not seen me everything but 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.550
 three or four and in addition I missed my 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.760
 heart there it was completely missed 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:18.900
 could have been a nice action but 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.830
 I was caught short so we're still going 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.680
 around naussac 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:26.270
 it just takes the taste of the enemy in one 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.270
 just kidney friend i want to go out 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:35.790
 when exactly not driving full 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.090
 enemies on the roofs that's a little 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.590
 annoying 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.590
 here are the dislodge 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.900
 while waiting for this game mode 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.400
 personally I much prefer a 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.780
 criminal if I find that much more 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.100
 interesting steal bags rather than 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.230
 policeman it's not top 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.990
 you must just can just resist 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:10.610
 what is the provision put in place 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.900
 with tak yeah they took the bag there 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.840

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.830

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.350

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.660

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.700
 the crew do not do anything to us 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.900
 to prevent to prevent defeat 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.700
 there is the enemy who is in the process of 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.340
 walk in the underground and u us 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:34.910
