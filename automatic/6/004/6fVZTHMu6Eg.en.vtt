complete tutorial I'm just going to show
you<00:00:25.019> how<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:25.980> put<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.210> my<00:00:27.359> brain<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:27.990> speak

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
you how I put it in my brain so to speak

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.530 
you how I put it in my brain so to speak
I<00:00:28.769> think<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:29.970> as<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.750> u-boat<00:00:31.470> knot<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.540> I

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
I think of this as the u-boat knot and I

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.750 
I think of this as the u-boat knot and I
think<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.899> these<00:00:34.050> two<00:00:34.350> ships<00:00:34.680> or<00:00:34.980> lining<00:00:35.340> up<00:00:35.579> to

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
think of these two ships or lining up to

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.910 
think of these two ships or lining up to
one<00:00:35.910> another<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.719> working<00:00:37.260> yarn<00:00:37.290> and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
one another this is the working yarn and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.970 
one another this is the working yarn and
this<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:39.170> yarn<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:40.500> attached<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.930> I

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
this is the yarn to be attached so I

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.709 
this is the yarn to be attached so I
think<00:00:43.980> under<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.300> why<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:45.600> called

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
think under this is why it's called

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.279 
think under this is why it's called
u-boat<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.440> for<00:00:46.680> under<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.190> then<00:00:48.170> under<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
u-boat you for under and then under the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.150 
u-boat you for under and then under the
first<00:00:49.530> thread<00:00:50.510> over<00:00:51.510> both<00:00:51.809> that's<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.010> you

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
first thread over both that's the you

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.990 
first thread over both that's the you
both<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:54.149> boat<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.750> then<00:00:56.989> through<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:59.000> then

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
both you boat and then through and then

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.189 
both you boat and then through and then
you<00:01:00.180> pull<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.660> tight<00:01:01.460> and<00:01:02.870> then<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.019> take

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you pull this tight and then you take

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.200 
you pull this tight and then you take
the<00:01:04.350> other<00:01:04.379> thread<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.000> same

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
the other thread and you do the same

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.390

both<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.490> boat<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.200> then<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.650> tighten<00:01:31.890> this

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140
