particular<00:00:43.440> Sam<00:00:44.430> he's<00:00:44.700> been<00:00:45.300> through<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
particular Sam he's been through the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.619 
particular Sam he's been through the
mill<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.780> bit<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.680> guess<00:00:46.980> he's<00:00:47.910> struggled

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
mill a bit and I guess he's struggled

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.680 
mill a bit and I guess he's struggled
with<00:00:48.870> his<00:00:49.469> boss<00:00:50.210> getting<00:00:51.210> together<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.629> her

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
with his boss getting together with her

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.250 
with his boss getting together with her
and<00:00:52.170> she<00:00:52.829> kind<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.129> trapped<00:00:53.399> my<00:00:53.670> guess<00:00:53.879> by<00:00:54.690> I

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
and she kind of trapped my guess by I

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.590 
and she kind of trapped my guess by I
think<00:00:56.129> she<00:00:56.340> decided<00:00:56.670> she<00:00:56.820> wanted<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.120> baby<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
think she decided she wanted a baby and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.650 
think she decided she wanted a baby and
then<00:00:57.750> he<00:00:58.379> was<00:00:58.500> gonna<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.800> used<00:00:59.100> then<00:00:59.910> he<00:01:00.180> did<00:01:00.390> he

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
then he was gonna be used then he did he

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.389 
then he was gonna be used then he did he
has<00:01:00.870> fallen<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.410> Chrissie<00:01:01.620> at<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> same<00:01:02.100> time
