00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
the bottom and they're gonna speed it up

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.600 
the bottom and they're gonna speed it up
if<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.409> don't<00:01:04.470> last<00:01:04.799> too<00:01:05.100> long<00:01:05.129> cuz<00:01:05.489> they're

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
if you don't last too long cuz they're

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.170 
if you don't last too long cuz they're
level<00:01:05.970> one<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.810> that's<00:01:06.990> very<00:01:07.290> unfortunate<00:01:08.180> 12%

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
level one so that's very unfortunate 12%

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.090 
level one so that's very unfortunate 12%
and<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.960> looks<00:01:10.140> like<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.500> dragons<00:01:10.830> are<00:01:10.920> doing

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
and it looks like the dragons are doing

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.950 
and it looks like the dragons are doing
some<00:01:11.490> considerable<00:01:12.150> amount<00:01:12.479> damage<00:01:12.810> or

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
some considerable amount damage or

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.050 
some considerable amount damage or
splitting<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.770> little<00:01:14.280> tiny<00:01:14.520> bit<00:01:14.670> I

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
splitting up just a little tiny bit I

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.850 
splitting up just a little tiny bit I
brought<00:01:15.600> an<00:01:15.720> extra<00:01:15.840> lightning<00:01:16.380> spell<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.770> in

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
brought an extra lightning spell just in

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.200 
brought an extra lightning spell just in
case<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.100> clan<00:01:17.250> castle<00:01:17.580> troops<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:17.970> looks

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
case of clan castle troops and it looks

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.850 
case of clan castle troops and it looks
like<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.509> clan<00:01:18.689> castles<00:01:19.080> came<00:01:19.229> out<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.740> we're

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
like the clan castles came out so we're

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.710 
like the clan castles came out so we're
gonna<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:20.189> dropping<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> lightning<00:01:21.509> spell

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
gonna be dropping the lightning spell

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.240 
gonna be dropping the lightning spell
right<00:01:21.869> there<00:01:22.170> some<00:01:22.409> dragons<00:01:22.799> are<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.070> left

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
right there some dragons are on the left

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.429 
right there some dragons are on the left
hand<00:01:23.460> side<00:01:23.700> 30%<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.689> inferno<00:01:25.020> towers<00:01:25.200> are

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
hand side 30% in the inferno towers are

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.870 
hand side 30% in the inferno towers are
going<00:01:25.860> off<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.310> really<00:01:26.580> don't<00:01:26.759> recommend

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
going off so I really don't recommend

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.149 
going off so I really don't recommend
the<00:01:27.210> strategy<00:01:27.630> against<00:01:27.780> townhall<00:01:28.170> tens<00:01:28.409> but

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the strategy against townhall tens but

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.399 
the strategy against townhall tens but
obviously<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.090> Fortymile<00:01:30.720> times<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
obviously this is Fortymile times and

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.280 
obviously this is Fortymile times and
supercell<00:01:31.920> implemented<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:32.759> purpose<00:01:33.290> to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
supercell implemented this on purpose to

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.560 
supercell implemented this on purpose to
fight<00:01:34.470> against<00:01:34.710> Town<00:01:34.890> Hall<00:01:35.040> towns<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.759> 39%

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
fight against Town Hall towns so 39%

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.730 
fight against Town Hall towns so 39%
looks<00:01:36.750> like<00:01:36.900> we're<00:01:37.020> going<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.560> the

head<00:03:12.670> over<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.150> Town<00:03:13.420> Hall<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.230> looks

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
head over to the Town Hall and it looks

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.540 
head over to the Town Hall and it looks
like<00:03:14.560> this<00:03:14.680> going<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:14.920> be<00:03:14.980> really<00:03:15.310> really

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
like this going to be really really

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.920 
like this going to be really really
close<00:03:15.760> after<00:03:16.150> they<00:03:16.239> finished<00:03:16.570> taking<00:03:16.780> out

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
close after they finished taking out

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.050 
close after they finished taking out
some<00:03:17.170> of<00:03:17.200> those<00:03:17.320> defenses<00:03:17.950> they<00:03:18.549> either<00:03:18.700> go<00:03:19.000> to

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
some of those defenses they either go to

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.090 
some of those defenses they either go to
the<00:03:19.269> right<00:03:19.420> or<00:03:19.660> left<00:03:19.690> or<00:03:20.290> they<00:03:20.769> go<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:20.920> the

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
the right or left or they go to the

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.259 
the right or left or they go to the
center<00:03:21.489> of<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:21.640> base<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:21.970> that's<00:03:22.090> what<00:03:22.180> I'm

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
center of the base and that's what I'm

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.940 
center of the base and that's what I'm
hoping<00:03:22.480> they're<00:03:22.810> going<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:22.989> go<00:03:23.079> for<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.560> the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
hoping they're going to go for and the

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.890 
hoping they're going to go for and the
Inferno<00:03:24.310> tower<00:03:24.549> can<00:03:24.820> stretch<00:03:25.150> all<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.450> way<00:03:25.840> to

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
Inferno tower can stretch all the way to

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.380 
Inferno tower can stretch all the way to
the<00:03:26.200> outside<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:27.190> base<00:03:27.370> dragons<00:03:27.970> around

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
the outside of the base dragons around

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.539 
the outside of the base dragons around
for<00:03:28.690> dragons<00:03:29.079> have<00:03:29.290> head<00:03:29.530> have<00:03:30.040> headed<00:03:30.370> into

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
for dragons have head have headed into

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.400 
for dragons have head have headed into
this<00:03:30.790> center<00:03:31.450> of<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.660> base<00:03:31.840> and<00:03:32.110> I'm<00:03:32.230> going<00:03:32.350> to

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
this center of the base and I'm going to

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.199 
this center of the base and I'm going to
drop<00:03:32.530> another<00:03:32.680> haste<00:03:33.250> spell<00:03:33.430> right<00:03:33.790> there<00:03:34.030> and

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
drop another haste spell right there and

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.370 
drop another haste spell right there and
it<00:03:34.570> looks<00:03:34.750> like<00:03:34.870> they're<00:03:35.019> going<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:35.200> target

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
it looks like they're going to target

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.960 
it looks like they're going to target
some<00:03:35.620> ex-post<00:03:36.130> it's<00:03:36.250> going<00:03:36.370> to<00:03:36.430> take<00:03:36.579> a<00:03:36.610> long

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
some ex-post it's going to take a long

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.210 
some ex-post it's going to take a long
time<00:03:37.239> just<00:03:37.299> because<00:03:37.660> they<00:03:37.840> have<00:03:37.930> so<00:03:38.290> many<00:03:38.799> hit

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
time just because they have so many hit

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.030 
time just because they have so many hit
points<00:03:39.250> along<00:03:40.090> with<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.390> inferno<00:03:40.750> towers<00:03:41.049> so

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
points along with the inferno towers so

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.340 
points along with the inferno towers so
the<00:03:42.130> dragons<00:03:42.519> were<00:03:42.640> not<00:03:42.970> able<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.690> target<00:03:44.200> that

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
the dragons were not able to target that

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.740 
the dragons were not able to target that

Hall carve away for my arch Queen so the

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.340 
Hall carve away for my arch Queen so the

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
arch between could shoot the Town Hall

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.080 
arch between could shoot the Town Hall
but<00:04:17.530> obviously<00:04:18.160> it<00:04:18.459> doesn't<00:04:18.640> look<00:04:18.820> like<00:04:18.850> it's

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
but obviously it doesn't look like it's

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.610 
but obviously it doesn't look like it's
in<00:04:19.180> a<00:04:19.239> workout<00:04:19.570> and<00:04:19.840> I'm<00:04:19.930> having<00:04:20.140> second

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
in a workout and I'm having second

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.659 
in a workout and I'm having second
thoughts<00:04:20.650> right<00:04:21.070> about<00:04:21.250> now

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
thoughts right about now

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.219 
thoughts right about now
and<00:04:21.849> I<00:04:21.880> realized<00:04:22.210> there's<00:04:22.390> still<00:04:22.660> two<00:04:22.930> Inferno

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
and I realized there's still two Inferno

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.990 
and I realized there's still two Inferno
towers<00:04:23.560> up<00:04:23.770> so<00:04:24.190> there<00:04:24.550> was<00:04:24.700> an

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
towers up so there was an

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.730 
towers up so there was an
no<00:04:25.090> way<00:04:25.360> I<00:04:25.390> was<00:04:25.750> going<00:04:25.840> to<00:04:25.930> be<00:04:26.020> able<00:04:26.140> to<00:04:26.590> get

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
no way I was going to be able to get

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.620 
no way I was going to be able to get
that<00:04:26.830> Archer<00:04:27.160> our<00:04:27.520> excuse<00:04:27.790> me<00:04:28.000> get<00:04:28.330> that<00:04:28.480> Town

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
that Archer our excuse me get that Town

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.440 
that Archer our excuse me get that Town
Hall<00:04:28.780> with<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.080> archer<00:04:29.410> Queen<00:04:29.440> so<00:04:30.280> right<00:04:31.270> now

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
Hall with the archer Queen so right now

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.480 
Hall with the archer Queen so right now
I'm<00:04:31.630> thinking<00:04:32.020> that<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.320> rain<00:04:32.530> is<00:04:32.560> completely

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
I'm thinking that the rain is completely

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.490 
I'm thinking that the rain is completely
over<00:04:33.730> unless<00:04:33.940> my<00:04:34.120> Archer<00:04:34.420> Queen<00:04:34.600> can<00:04:35.350> be

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
over unless my Archer Queen can be

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.990 
over unless my Archer Queen can be
strategically<00:04:36.040> in<00:04:36.160> place<00:04:36.370> to<00:04:36.580> where<00:04:36.700> she<00:04:36.880> can

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
strategically in place to where she can

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.390 
strategically in place to where she can
get<00:04:37.150> eight<00:04:37.390> extra<00:04:37.930> percentage<00:04:38.350> buildings<00:04:38.920> so

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
get eight extra percentage buildings so
