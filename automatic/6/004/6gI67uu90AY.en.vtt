00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.870
 hello good morning here 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.420
 small video of the amazing things of 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:11.139
 Japan was good showing him by 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.719
 example here as in public places 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.270
 for example the hotels that we have 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:19.000
 machines to turn it off you have to go 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.460
 and only pay each contracting party 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.150
 all cash after another 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.359
 thing that I will also show you is what 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.669
 I'm des toiles means the bathrooms 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.740
 many people can be called the 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.530
 bathrooms because I do not know if in Peru there are these 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.630
 bathrooms but for example you enter the bathroom 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.050
 open the door turn on the light you 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.050
 you approach 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.690
 solid now opens the news of 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.670
 all 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.670
 is that for example you have these buttons 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:59.019
 where maybe it means little water 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.880
 he has no word 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.530
 and now what you hear look at this and 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.170
 the light district has light and apart 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.010
 it also has bird sounds I'm not going 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.010
 speak to be heard 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.580
 then like you have this music 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.580
 mind inspires are birds 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.670
 now another thing that we see in the workshop 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.189
 has what is this board this 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.939
 board is so that as you kill it you see it 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.939
 automatic 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:02:07.780
 so that also to dry and 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:10.990
 so that the thing is not going to forget 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.400
 of this because many people pass the 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.560
 embarrassment that they enter the bathroom are 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.730
 looking for the lever they can not find the 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.370
 lever of the val has to escape and 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.650
 leave gifts and do not be scared if 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.650
 they listen to the music in equal why 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.640
 these years are automatically fine in 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.310
 this board after this is the 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.350
 water when they have enough water is here 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.069
 when you want little water, when 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.160
 they urinate in this site ok 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.930
 7 so that it also closes auto more 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.680
 I'm saying goodbye in the detail of how 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.680
 with blues music 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.230
 a bath in japan
