or<00:02:10.679> whatever<00:02:11.220> they<00:02:11.340> call<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.790> exactly<00:02:12.180> was<00:02:12.300> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
or whatever they call it exactly was the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.910 
or whatever they call it exactly was the
end<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.629> 2011

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
end of 2011

end of 2011
I<00:02:13.950> think<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.340> s1is<00:02:14.790> goes<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.420> end<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.830> 2012

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
I think the s1is goes to the end of 2012

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.530 
I think the s1is goes to the end of 2012
and<00:02:16.980> some<00:02:17.100> of<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.220> other<00:02:17.370> ones<00:02:17.520> do<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:17.970> anyways

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
and some of the other ones do so anyways

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.180 
and some of the other ones do so anyways
