00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.190 
bodywork so everything's fit and right
then<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.000> can<00:01:18.150> start<00:01:18.390> assembling<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.990> door

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
then you can start assembling the door

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.429 
then you can start assembling the door
here's<00:01:19.799> how<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.979> do<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.689> now<00:01:21.689> as<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.049> can<00:01:22.229> see

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
here's how to do it now as you can see

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.770 
here's how to do it now as you can see
there<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> lot<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.880> goes<00:01:24.090> into<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.420> door

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
there is a lot it goes into a door

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.050 
there is a lot it goes into a door
there's<00:01:25.350> big<00:01:25.650> stuff<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:26.250> glass<00:01:26.580> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
there's big stuff like glass and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.120 
there's big stuff like glass and
regulators<00:01:27.960> but<00:01:28.350> there's<00:01:28.530> also<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.890> lot<00:01:29.100> of

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
regulators but there's also a lot of

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.890 
regulators but there's also a lot of
small<00:01:29.520> stuff<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.060> brackets<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.720> hardware

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
small stuff and brackets and hardware

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.649 
small stuff and brackets and hardware
this<00:01:31.650> service<00:01:32.100> specific<00:01:32.549> purpose<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.540> can

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
this service specific purpose so it can

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.450 
this service specific purpose so it can
be<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> little<00:01:34.020> overwhelming<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.250> best

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
be a little overwhelming so the best

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.240 
be a little overwhelming so the best
thing<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.790> do<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.420> break<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.810> into<00:01:36.960> three

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
thing to do is to break it into three

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.190 
thing to do is to break it into three
categories<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.430> first<00:01:38.759> being<00:01:39.659> all<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
categories the first being all the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.499 
categories the first being all the
internal<00:01:40.680> mechanical<00:01:41.189> stuff<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.970> latches

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
internal mechanical stuff the latches

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.289 
internal mechanical stuff the latches
the<00:01:42.720> hinges<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.439> regulator<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.820> second

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
the hinges the regulator the second

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.389 
the hinges the regulator the second
category<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> glass<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:47.159> weather

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
category is the glass the weather

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.819 
category is the glass the weather
stripping<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.270> window<00:01:48.600> channel<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.229> then

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
stripping the window channel and then

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
and slide the glass into the door and

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.070 
and slide the glass into the door and
connect<00:03:49.590> it<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.800> the<00:03:49.890> actuator<00:03:50.720> finally<00:03:51.720> we'll

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
connect it to the actuator finally we'll

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.050 
connect it to the actuator finally we'll
slide<00:03:52.379> in<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.680> vent<00:03:52.920> wing<00:03:53.099> assembly<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.819> bolt

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
slide in the vent wing assembly and bolt

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.940 
slide in the vent wing assembly and bolt
it<00:03:54.209> all<00:03:54.360> in<00:03:54.599> making<00:03:55.170> sure<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.799> window

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
it all in making sure that the window

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.399 
it all in making sure that the window
rubber<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:57.150> window<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.540> fitting<00:03:58.170> in<00:03:58.290> the

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
window channel properly and it's just

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:15.620 
window channel properly and it's just
tricky<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.780> do<00:04:00.930> as<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.409> is<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.739> say

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
and that is it it's hard to believe that

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.540 
and that is it it's hard to believe that
all<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.260> parts<00:05:21.650> that<00:05:21.740> were<00:05:21.920> on<00:05:22.100> this<00:05:22.280> table

seems there's a lot to this and there is
but<00:05:27.260> it's<00:05:27.560> something<00:05:27.830> that<00:05:27.980> has<00:05:28.250> to<00:05:28.430> be<00:05:28.520> done

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.850 
but it's something that has to be done
and<00:05:29.000> it's<00:05:29.420> something<00:05:29.660> you<00:05:30.260> can<00:05:30.470> do

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860
