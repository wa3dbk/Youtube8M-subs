vision<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.289> also<00:00:55.649> we<00:00:56.550> are<00:00:56.820> using<00:00:56.940> move

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
vision and also we are using move

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.319 
vision and also we are using move
control<00:00:58.350> motion<00:00:58.590> controller<00:00:59.190> as<00:00:59.460> well<00:00:59.520> so

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
control motion controller as well so

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.959 
control motion controller as well so
although<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> third<00:01:01.559> title<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.699> the

although this is a third title in the
same<00:01:03.180> platform<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.930> believe<00:01:04.650> everyone<00:01:04.979> will

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
same platform I believe everyone will

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.760 
same platform I believe everyone will
enjoy<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.549> new<00:01:05.820> feature<00:01:06.350> tell<00:01:07.350> us<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> little<00:01:07.650> bit

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
enjoy a new feature tell us a little bit

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.440 
enjoy a new feature tell us a little bit
about<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.250> move<00:01:08.610> integration<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.299> we'll

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
about the move integration that we'll

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.910 
about the move integration that we'll
see<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.780> virtual<00:01:10.200> tennis<00:01:10.350> football<00:01:10.560> players

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
see in virtual tennis football players

see in virtual tennis football players
will<00:01:11.100> be<00:01:11.189> doing<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.580> controller<00:01:11.939> itself

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
will be doing with the controller itself

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.920 
will be doing with the controller itself
so<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:13.799> enjoy<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.400> dependence<00:01:14.909> game<00:01:15.119> by

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
so you can enjoy a dependence game by

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.440 
so you can enjoy a dependence game by
using<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.439> move<00:01:16.799> controller<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:18.000> if<00:01:18.150> you're

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
using the move controller as if you're

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.510 
using the move controller as if you're
actually<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> field<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.979> your<00:01:20.250> playing

actually in the field in your playing
tennis<00:01:20.939> game<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:22.020> we<00:01:22.830> owe<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.979> lot<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:24.080> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
tennis game and we owe a lot to the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.780 
tennis game and we owe a lot to the
powerful<00:01:25.530> system<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:28.470> move<00:01:28.650> has<00:01:28.920> in

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
powerful system that the move has in

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.969 
powerful system that the move has in
conjunction<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:30.509> moved<00:01:31.110> control<00:01:31.619> itself

and<00:01:32.220> move<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.770> camera<00:01:35.100> part<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
and move I the the camera part of the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.690 
and move I the the camera part of the
system<00:01:36.470> because<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:39.950> strong<00:01:40.950> system<00:01:41.400> and

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
system because of the strong system and

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.940 
system because of the strong system and
a<00:01:41.880> strong<00:01:43.610> sense<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:46.049> coordinates<00:01:46.649> and

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
a strong sense of the coordinates and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.920 
a strong sense of the coordinates and
angle<00:01:47.490> we<00:01:48.270> are<00:01:48.329> able<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.810> achieve<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.470> quite

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
angle we are able to achieve a quite

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.120 
angle we are able to achieve a quite
strong<00:01:51.930> level<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:53.009> linear<00:01:53.600> control<00:01:54.600> between

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
strong level of linear control between

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.110 
strong level of linear control between
between<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.280> player<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.439> character

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
between the player and character

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.940 
between the player and character
now<00:01:59.810> one<00:01:59.930> of<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.110> features<00:02:00.620> is<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.800> ability

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
now one of the features is the ability

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.190 
now one of the features is the ability
to<00:02:01.430> move<00:02:01.700> up<00:02:01.850> to<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.030> net<00:02:02.300> by<00:02:02.540> moving<00:02:02.900> closer

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
to move up to the net by moving closer

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.530 
to move up to the net by moving closer
to<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.500> physical<00:02:04.130> camera<00:02:04.370> so<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:05.000> would<00:02:05.420> all

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
to the physical camera so you would all

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.360 
to the physical camera so you would all
concerned<00:02:05.930> about<00:02:06.020> people<00:02:06.380> with<00:02:06.470> small<00:02:07.040> or

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
concerned about people with small or

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.130 
concerned about people with small or
large<00:02:07.400> living<00:02:07.820> rooms<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.270> have<00:02:08.450> objects<00:02:08.990> like

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
large living rooms and have objects like

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.070 
large living rooms and have objects like
coffee<00:02:09.320> tables<00:02:09.740> in<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:09.860> way<00:02:10.480> well<00:02:11.480> you're

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
coffee tables in the way well you're

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.890 
coffee tables in the way well you're
right<00:02:12.260> in<00:02:12.410> a<00:02:12.470> way<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.800> guess<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:14.240> good<00:02:14.690> analogy

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
right in a way I guess a good analogy

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.730 
right in a way I guess a good analogy
would<00:02:15.260> be<00:02:15.370> wii<00:02:16.370> controllers<00:02:17.380> I'm<00:02:18.380> sure

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
would be wii controllers I'm sure

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.020 
would be wii controllers I'm sure
everyone's<00:02:19.130> had<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:20.090> one<00:02:20.450> or<00:02:20.570> two<00:02:20.810> I

can't say it will never happen with our
with<00:02:31.340> this<00:02:31.460> game<00:02:31.670> but<00:02:32.150> again<00:02:33.340> what<00:02:34.390> with<00:02:35.390> this

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
with this game but again what with this

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.020 
with this game but again what with this
motion<00:02:36.080> controller<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:37.040> with<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:37.520> game<00:02:37.790> I

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
motion controller and with this game I

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.570 
motion controller and with this game I
don't<00:02:38.540> need<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.990> hell<00:02:39.290> of<00:02:39.320> a<00:02:39.440> lot<00:02:39.530> of<00:02:39.590> space<00:02:40.040> you

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
don't need a hell of a lot of space you

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.060 
don't need a hell of a lot of space you
probably<00:02:41.060> need<00:02:41.420> maybe<00:02:42.170> one<00:02:42.410> meter<00:02:42.710> or<00:02:43.040> two

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
probably need maybe one meter or two

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.230 
probably need maybe one meter or two
meter<00:02:43.490> marks<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:46.640> don't<00:02:46.820> have<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.060> run

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
meter marks and you don't have to run

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.560 
meter marks and you don't have to run
around<00:02:47.380> I<00:02:48.380> like<00:02:49.070> you're<00:02:49.370> in<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.670> real<00:02:50.300> tennis

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
around I like you're in a real tennis

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.250 
around I like you're in a real tennis
court<00:02:50.900> but<00:02:51.740> you<00:02:51.890> can<00:02:52.070> you<00:02:52.490> can<00:02:52.700> enjoy<00:02:53.300> you<00:02:54.110> can

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
court but you can you can enjoy you can

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.080 
court but you can you can enjoy you can
experience<00:02:54.680> is<00:02:55.070> something<00:02:55.370> similar<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:55.940> a

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
experience is something similar to a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.190 
experience is something similar to a
real<00:02:56.360> match<00:02:56.750> in<00:02:57.050> a<00:02:57.560> fairly<00:02:58.370> minimal<00:02:58.870> space<00:02:59.870> in

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
real match in a fairly minimal space in

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.110 
real match in a fairly minimal space in
your<00:03:00.260> low<00:03:00.560> we<00:03:00.740> can<00:03:00.860> include<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.280> mix<00:03:01.460> of<00:03:01.610> first

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
your low we can include the mix of first

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.570 
your low we can include the mix of first
and<00:03:02.360> third<00:03:02.420> person<00:03:02.960> view<00:03:03.680> will<00:03:04.280> that<00:03:04.430> be

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
and third person view will that be

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.030 
and third person view will that be
tolerable<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.150> one<00:03:05.780> or<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.050> other<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.440> what

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
tolerable to one or the other and what

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.970 
tolerable to one or the other and what
is<00:03:07.130> it<00:03:07.190> important<00:03:07.580> to<00:03:07.610> include<00:03:07.910> both<00:03:08.300> versions

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
is it important to include both versions

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.449 
is it important to include both versions
well<00:03:09.980> aren't<00:03:10.250> we<00:03:11.470> get<00:03:12.470> lots<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.739> discussion

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
well aren't we get lots of discussion

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.220 
well aren't we get lots of discussion
about<00:03:13.700> this<00:03:13.880> actually<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:14.570> why<00:03:14.959> we<00:03:15.140> were

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
about this actually and why we were

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.090 
about this actually and why we were
making<00:03:15.760> this<00:03:16.760> title<00:03:17.290> but<00:03:18.290> probably<00:03:18.709> if<00:03:18.920> you

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
making this title but probably if you

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.350 
making this title but probably if you
want<00:03:19.280> if<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:19.459> just<00:03:19.580> wanted<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.000> make<00:03:20.150> a

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
want if you just wanted to make a

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.770 
want if you just wanted to make a
realistic<00:03:20.720> gameplay<00:03:21.140> and<00:03:21.680> make<00:03:22.610> you<00:03:23.360> feel

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
realistic gameplay and make you feel

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.320 
realistic gameplay and make you feel
like<00:03:24.080> you're<00:03:24.320> in<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.830> tennis<00:03:25.100> court<00:03:25.340> probably

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
like you're in a tennis court probably

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.630 
like you're in a tennis court probably
the<00:03:26.420> best<00:03:26.450> way<00:03:27.110> would<00:03:27.440> be<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.709> make<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:28.459> or

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
the best way would be to make it or

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.060 
the best way would be to make it or
first<00:03:28.940> person<00:03:29.420> view<00:03:29.570> so<00:03:30.230> you<00:03:30.500> don't<00:03:30.680> see<00:03:30.860> the

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
first person view so you don't see the

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.840 
first person view so you don't see the
back<00:03:31.250> of<00:03:31.459> your<00:03:32.440> your<00:03:33.440> character<00:03:33.980> so<00:03:34.520> you<00:03:34.580> only

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
back of your your character so you only

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.360 
back of your your character so you only
see<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.930> ball<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.530> you<00:03:36.680> will<00:03:36.830> see<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.010> core

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
see the ball and you will see the core

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.970 
see the ball and you will see the core
and<00:03:37.580> maybe<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.090> opponent<00:03:38.690> and<00:03:39.260> that<00:03:39.680> sort<00:03:39.920> of

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
and maybe the opponent and that sort of

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.900 
and maybe the opponent and that sort of
stuff<00:03:40.040> but<00:03:40.940> that<00:03:41.720> will<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:42.830> will<00:03:42.980> lose<00:03:43.340> one

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
stuff but that will that will lose one

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.790 
stuff but that will that will lose one
of<00:03:43.940> our<00:03:44.090> main<00:03:44.300> points<00:03:44.750> are<00:03:44.930> in<00:03:45.200> this<00:03:45.290> franchise

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
of our main points are in this franchise

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.280 
of our main points are in this franchise
that<00:03:45.830> you<00:03:46.130> will<00:03:46.250> get<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.489> be<00:03:46.690> Federer<00:03:47.690> you<00:03:48.170> will

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
that you will get to be Federer you will

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.400 
that you will get to be Federer you will
get<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.500> be<00:03:48.620> no<00:03:49.130> doubt<00:03:49.340> so<00:03:50.030> we<00:03:50.540> need<00:03:50.720> we<00:03:51.140> needed

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
get to be no doubt so we need we needed

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.000 
get to be no doubt so we need we needed
to<00:03:51.560> do<00:03:51.709> something<00:03:53.470> something<00:03:54.470> different<00:03:54.860> from

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
to do something something different from

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.990 
to do something something different from
that<00:03:55.100> so<00:03:55.430> that's<00:03:56.330> why<00:03:56.769> that's<00:03:57.769> why<00:03:57.830> we<00:03:58.130> ended

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
that so that's why that's why we ended

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.370 
that so that's why that's why we ended
up<00:04:00.010> or<00:04:01.010> doing<00:04:01.400> a<00:04:01.580> switch<00:04:01.910> of<00:04:02.380> first-person

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
up or doing a switch of first-person

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.170 
up or doing a switch of first-person
view<00:04:03.590> in<00:04:03.860> third<00:04:04.100> person<00:04:04.280> view<00:04:04.640> taking<00:04:05.090> the

view in third person view taking the

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.330 
view in third person view taking the
best<00:04:06.010> of<00:04:07.010> both<00:04:07.280> sides

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
best of both sides

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.820 
best of both sides
okay<00:04:08.879> now<00:04:09.629> there's<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.930> fine<00:04:10.290> line<00:04:10.319> between

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
okay now there's a fine line between

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.430 
okay now there's a fine line between
creating<00:04:11.640> an<00:04:11.790> authentic<00:04:12.239> and<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.599> simulation

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
creating an authentic and a simulation

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.009

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
sort of experience do you hope to make

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.310 
sort of experience do you hope to make
