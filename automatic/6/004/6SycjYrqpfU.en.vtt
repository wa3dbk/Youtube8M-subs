and then being cloned again each time

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.090 
and then being cloned again each time
becoming<00:01:06.689> impervious<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.350> what<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.770> was<00:01:07.950> it

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
becoming impervious to what it was it

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.130 
becoming impervious to what it was it
had<00:01:08.189> previously<00:01:08.340> killed<00:01:08.880> him<00:01:09.150> now<00:01:09.299> both<00:01:10.110> of

had previously killed him now both of

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.140 
had previously killed him now both of
these<00:01:10.380> characters<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.280> healing<00:01:11.729> factors

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
these characters have healing factors

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.539 
these characters have healing factors
and<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.659> resistance<00:01:13.229> level<00:01:13.680> high<00:01:14.250> enough<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
and a resistance level high enough to

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.550 
and a resistance level high enough to
survive<00:01:14.970> nuclear<00:01:15.330> explosions<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.409> the

survive nuclear explosions and the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.200 
survive nuclear explosions and the
destruction<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.070> planets<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.700> would<00:01:17.939> say

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
destruction of planets so I would say

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.510 
destruction of planets so I would say
that<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.259> fight<00:01:19.590> would<00:01:19.770> ultimately<00:01:20.040> end<00:01:20.340> up

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
that this fight would ultimately end up

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.760 
that this fight would ultimately end up
coming<00:01:20.850> down<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.299> brute<00:01:21.509> strength<00:01:21.840> having

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
coming down to brute strength having

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.340 
coming down to brute strength having
said<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.549> think<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.720> will<00:01:24.930> actually<00:01:25.229> end

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
said that I think this will actually end

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.740 
said that I think this will actually end
up<00:01:25.439> being<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.740> draw<00:01:26.070> with<00:01:26.729> Doomsday's<00:01:27.270> ability

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
up being a draw with Doomsday's ability

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.080 
up being a draw with Doomsday's ability
to<00:01:27.960> adapt<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.799> what<00:01:29.280> had<00:01:29.369> previously<00:01:29.820> killed

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
to adapt to what had previously killed

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.120 
to adapt to what had previously killed
him<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.540> Hulk's<00:01:31.110> strength<00:01:31.200> being<00:01:31.619> limitless

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
him and Hulk's strength being limitless

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.950 
him and Hulk's strength being limitless
I<00:01:32.310> would<00:01:32.729> say<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.180> would<00:01:33.329> turn<00:01:33.570> into<00:01:33.600> an

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
I would say it would turn into an

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.990 
I would say it would turn into an
endless<00:01:34.229> cycle<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.890> doomsday<00:01:35.220> dying<00:01:35.610> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
endless cycle of doomsday dying and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.910 
endless cycle of doomsday dying and
coming<00:01:36.150> back<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.450> life<00:01:36.630> only<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.590> be<00:01:37.710> killed

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
coming back to life only to be killed

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.499 
coming back to life only to be killed
again<00:01:38.100> by<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.549> Incredible<00:01:39.150> Hulk

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
again by the Incredible Hulk

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.539 
again by the Incredible Hulk
so<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> next<00:01:40.380> battle<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:40.829> our<00:01:40.860> list<00:01:41.189> comes

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
so the next battle on our list comes

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.660 
so the next battle on our list comes
from<00:01:41.909> Hayase<00:01:42.210> 83<00:01:42.930> with<00:01:43.170> Superman<00:01:43.710> vs.<00:01:44.189> Darwin

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
from Hayase 83 with Superman vs. Darwin

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.340 
from Hayase 83 with Superman vs. Darwin
now<00:01:44.850> since<00:01:45.479> there<00:01:45.630> wasn't<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.960> version<00:01:46.140> of

damage<00:05:13.750> than<00:05:14.169> his<00:05:14.320> non<00:05:14.560> robotic<00:05:15.070> arm<00:05:15.310> and<00:05:15.490> so

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
damage than his non robotic arm and so

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.909 
damage than his non robotic arm and so
as<00:05:15.699> a<00:05:15.820> result<00:05:16.050> Jason<00:05:17.050> Todd<00:05:17.259> would<00:05:17.470> most<00:05:17.650> likely

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
as a result Jason Todd would most likely

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.460 
as a result Jason Todd would most likely
disable<00:05:18.610> the<00:05:18.699> robotic<00:05:19.090> arm<00:05:19.300> very<00:05:19.630> early<00:05:20.050> into

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
disable the robotic arm very early into

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.770 
disable the robotic arm very early into
the<00:05:20.500> fight<00:05:20.919> this<00:05:21.550> combined<00:05:22.060> with<00:05:22.509> his

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
the fight this combined with his

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.339 
the fight this combined with his
experience<00:05:23.440> as<00:05:23.560> a<00:05:23.620> master<00:05:24.190> of<00:05:24.340> a<00:05:24.430> multitude<00:05:24.880> of

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
experience as a master of a multitude of

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.749 
experience as a master of a multitude of
disciplines<00:05:26.349> of<00:05:26.470> martial<00:05:26.800> arts<00:05:27.039> would<00:05:27.580> allow

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
disciplines of martial arts would allow

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.909 
disciplines of martial arts would allow
him<00:05:28.090> to<00:05:28.120> overcome<00:05:28.690> Bucky<00:05:29.229> Barnes<00:05:29.440> although

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
him to overcome Bucky Barnes although

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.070 
him to overcome Bucky Barnes although
again<00:05:30.250> it<00:05:30.789> would<00:05:30.909> be<00:05:31.030> a<00:05:31.060> very<00:05:31.300> difficult<00:05:31.599> feat

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
again it would be a very difficult feat

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.159 
again it would be a very difficult feat
for<00:05:32.229> him<00:05:32.380> to<00:05:32.470> achieve<00:05:32.669> now<00:05:33.669> number<00:05:34.060> one<00:05:34.300> comes

Deadpool vs. the Joker now as soon as I
saw<00:05:43.270> this<00:05:43.510> I<00:05:43.570> knew<00:05:44.560> this<00:05:44.680> had<00:05:44.830> to<00:05:44.889> be<00:05:45.010> number

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
saw this I knew this had to be number

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.879 
saw this I knew this had to be number
one<00:05:45.490> and<00:05:45.729> to<00:05:46.090> be<00:05:46.180> honest<00:05:46.539> I<00:05:46.780> don't<00:05:47.680> think

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889 
one and to be honest I don't think

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.560 
one and to be honest I don't think
there's<00:05:48.070> any<00:05:48.370> real<00:05:48.610> doubt<00:05:48.789> here<00:05:49.240> that

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
there's any real doubt here that

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.390 
there's any real doubt here that
Deadpool<00:05:49.990> would<00:05:50.229> win<00:05:50.500> due<00:05:50.710> to<00:05:50.800> his<00:05:50.949> healing

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
Deadpool would win due to his healing

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.260 
Deadpool would win due to his healing
factor<00:05:51.849> but<00:05:52.030> man<00:05:53.759> would<00:05:54.759> this<00:05:54.970> be<00:05:55.240> a

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
factor but man would this be a

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.800 
factor but man would this be a
hysterical<00:05:55.780> fight<00:05:56.229> to<00:05:56.380> see<00:05:56.560> truthfully<00:05:57.520> I

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
hysterical fight to see truthfully I

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.700 
hysterical fight to see truthfully I
wouldn't<00:05:58.810> see<00:05:58.930> this<00:05:59.050> fight<00:05:59.229> lasting<00:05:59.620> very

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
wouldn't see this fight lasting very

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.159 
wouldn't see this fight lasting very
long<00:05:59.830> Joker<00:06:00.789> would<00:06:00.970> most<00:06:01.270> likely<00:06:01.599> run<00:06:01.960> through

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
long Joker would most likely run through

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:03.839 
long Joker would most likely run through
his<00:06:02.349> normal<00:06:02.680> bag<00:06:02.830> of<00:06:02.979> goodies<00:06:03.250> which<00:06:03.520> include

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:03.849 
his normal bag of goodies which include

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:06.450 
his normal bag of goodies which include
his<00:06:04.090> I<00:06:04.120> guess<00:06:04.750> there's<00:06:04.930> acidic<00:06:05.289> lapel<00:06:05.650> his

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
his I guess there's acidic lapel his

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.249 
his I guess there's acidic lapel his
several<00:06:06.789> knives<00:06:07.000> and<00:06:07.449> so<00:06:07.570> on<00:06:07.690> and<00:06:07.840> so<00:06:07.960> forth

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:08.259 
several knives and so on and so forth

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:10.170 
several knives and so on and so forth
and<00:06:08.349> eventually<00:06:08.860> he<00:06:09.370> would<00:06:09.460> probably<00:06:09.880> settle

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
and eventually he would probably settle

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.899 
and eventually he would probably settle
on<00:06:10.360> Joker<00:06:10.840> venom<00:06:10.990> but<00:06:11.349> Deadpool<00:06:12.280> of<00:06:12.580> course

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:12.909 
on Joker venom but Deadpool of course

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:14.879 
on Joker venom but Deadpool of course
having<00:06:13.419> his<00:06:13.509> healing<00:06:13.840> factor<00:06:14.199> would<00:06:14.710> be

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:14.889 
having his healing factor would be

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:16.649 
having his healing factor would be
virtually<00:06:15.039> immune<00:06:15.699> to<00:06:15.940> Joker<00:06:16.270> venom<00:06:16.389> in

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:16.659 
virtually immune to Joker venom in

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:18.360 
virtually immune to Joker venom in
addition<00:06:17.050> to<00:06:17.139> this<00:06:17.289> Deadpool<00:06:18.070> would

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
addition to this Deadpool would

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.310 
addition to this Deadpool would
constantly<00:06:18.880> talk<00:06:19.060> about<00:06:19.120> nonsense<00:06:19.750> and<00:06:20.020> break

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
constantly talk about nonsense and break

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.080 
constantly talk about nonsense and break
the<00:06:20.500> fourth<00:06:20.770> wall<00:06:20.830> which<00:06:21.460> would<00:06:21.639> drive<00:06:21.880> the

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
the fourth wall which would drive the

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.029 
the fourth wall which would drive the
Joker<00:06:22.419> nuts<00:06:22.780> says<00:06:23.380> he<00:06:23.500> wouldn't<00:06:23.710> know<00:06:23.889> who

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 
Joker nuts says he wouldn't know who

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:26.219 
Joker nuts says he wouldn't know who
Deadpool<00:06:24.430> was<00:06:24.550> talking<00:06:25.030> to<00:06:25.240> and<00:06:25.419> so<00:06:25.599> the<00:06:26.020> fight

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229 
Deadpool was talking to and so the fight

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:28.560 
Deadpool was talking to and so the fight
itself<00:06:26.710> would<00:06:27.159> most<00:06:27.520> likely<00:06:27.820> end<00:06:28.180> with<00:06:28.449> the

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570 
itself would most likely end with the

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.360 
itself would most likely end with the
Joker<00:06:28.870> just<00:06:28.990> kind<00:06:29.199> of<00:06:29.229> giving<00:06:29.500> up<00:06:29.650> and<00:06:29.860> then

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
Joker just kind of giving up and then

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.490 
Joker just kind of giving up and then
just<00:06:30.580> going<00:06:30.729> home

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
just going home

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.960 
just going home
