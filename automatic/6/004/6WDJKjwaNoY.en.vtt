00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
anything casting it Chris was just

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.680 
anything casting it Chris was just

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
meant for beginning and intermediate

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.469 
meant for beginning and intermediate
anglers<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.280> raw<00:01:26.460> that'll<00:01:26.850> load<00:01:27.090> quickly

anglers it's a raw that'll load quickly

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.660 
anglers it's a raw that'll load quickly
and<00:01:27.750> they'll<00:01:27.869> feel<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.530> really<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:28.860> able<00:01:28.950> to

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
and they'll feel and really be able to

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.999 
and they'll feel and really be able to
understand<00:01:30.180> their<00:01:30.390> timing<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.259> casting<00:01:31.799> rod

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
understand their timing and casting rod

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.230 
understand their timing and casting rod
with<00:01:32.220> their<00:01:32.340> first<00:01:32.579> beginning<00:01:32.939> at<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
with their first beginning at the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.690 
with their first beginning at the
beginning<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:34.200> also<00:01:34.409> very<00:01:34.860> progressive<00:01:35.189> and

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
beginning it's also very progressive and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.270 
beginning it's also very progressive and
I<00:01:35.759> think<00:01:35.970> very<00:01:36.150> evenly<00:01:36.570> balanced<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.650> casting

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
I think very evenly balanced in casting

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.969 
I think very evenly balanced in casting
it<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.790> cast<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.240> very<00:01:39.509> easy<00:01:39.869> let<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> rod

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
it you can cast it very easy let the rod

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.120 
it you can cast it very easy let the rod
load<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:42.750> case<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.799> very

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
load and in this case just be very

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.039 
load and in this case just be very
smooth<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.000> does<00:01:45.180> really<00:01:45.479> everything<00:01:45.930> you

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
smooth and it does really everything you

short<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.410> will<00:03:34.560> cast<00:03:34.709> medium<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.489> it'll<00:03:35.819> cast

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
short it will cast medium and it'll cast

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.570 
short it will cast medium and it'll cast
long<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:37.620> difference<00:03:38.069> here<00:03:38.340> is<00:03:38.370> that

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
long the difference here is that

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.360 
long the difference here is that
although<00:03:39.170> 3/4<00:03:40.170> of<00:03:40.260> this<00:03:40.380> rod<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.620> made<00:03:41.130> of

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
although 3/4 of this rod is made of

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.640 
although 3/4 of this rod is made of
graphite<00:03:41.549> in<00:03:42.060> three<00:03:42.450> different<00:03:42.630> modulus<00:03:43.170> the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
graphite in three different modulus the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.710 
graphite in three different modulus the
butt<00:03:43.860> section<00:03:44.069> has<00:03:44.400> more<00:03:44.670> boron<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.390> so<00:03:45.660> it

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
butt section has more boron and so it

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.930 
butt section has more boron and so it
will<00:03:45.810> have<00:03:45.900> more<00:03:46.110> power<00:03:46.410> than<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.220> b2x<00:03:47.640> did

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
will have more power than the b2x did

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.120 
will have more power than the b2x did
but<00:03:48.420> which<00:03:48.600> are<00:03:48.720> not<00:03:48.930> giving<00:03:49.410> up<00:03:49.560> as<00:03:49.799> all<00:03:49.950> that

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
in those short casts but what's unusual

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.020 
in those short casts but what's unusual
about<00:04:06.660> this<00:04:07.260> rod<00:04:07.530> and<00:04:07.830> that's<00:04:08.430> hard<00:04:08.670> to<00:04:08.820> find

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
about this rod and that's hard to find

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.000 
about this rod and that's hard to find
in<00:04:09.269> trout<00:04:09.510> rods<00:04:09.810> is<00:04:10.320> that<00:04:10.560> when<00:04:10.680> you<00:04:10.769> start

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
in trout rods is that when you start

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.979 
in trout rods is that when you start
stretching<00:04:11.340> out<00:04:11.640> your<00:04:11.670> casts<00:04:12.060> into<00:04:12.870> the

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
stretching out your casts into the

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.680 
stretching out your casts into the
medium<00:04:13.350> section<00:04:13.980> here<00:04:14.190> that's<00:04:14.519> say<00:04:14.850> 30<00:04:15.209> or<00:04:15.299> 40

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
medium section here that's say 30 or 40

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.229 
medium section here that's say 30 or 40
feet<00:04:15.900> it's<00:04:16.440> still<00:04:16.829> really<00:04:17.130> easy<00:04:17.250> to<00:04:17.609> cast<00:04:17.789> and

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
feet it's still really easy to cast and

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.449 
feet it's still really easy to cast and
then<00:04:18.690> when<00:04:18.870> you<00:04:18.930> start<00:04:19.169> going<00:04:19.380> longer<00:04:19.979> and

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
then when you start going longer and

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.700 
then when you start going longer and
this<00:04:20.789> is<00:04:21.000> where<00:04:21.269> we<00:04:21.510> part<00:04:21.720> ways<00:04:21.959> with<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.289> b2x

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
this is where we part ways with the b2x

this is where we part ways with the b2x
a<00:04:22.860> little<00:04:23.100> bit<00:04:23.250> this<00:04:23.850> rod<00:04:24.150> will<00:04:24.450> handle<00:04:24.900> longer

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
a little bit this rod will handle longer

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.830 
a little bit this rod will handle longer
distances<00:04:26.190> in<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.580> air<00:04:26.729> meaning<00:04:27.479> that<00:04:27.690> if

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
distances in the air meaning that if

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.050 
distances in the air meaning that if
you've<00:04:27.990> laid<00:04:28.200> down<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.440> gas<00:04:28.680> is<00:04:28.950> 50<00:04:29.280> feet<00:04:29.490> you

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
you've laid down a gas is 50 feet you

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.659 
you've laid down a gas is 50 feet you
can<00:04:30.240> then<00:04:30.390> pick<00:04:30.570> that<00:04:30.780> gas<00:04:31.020> back<00:04:31.410> up<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:32.039> carry

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
can then pick that gas back up and carry

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.750 
can then pick that gas back up and carry
that<00:04:32.850> line<00:04:33.120> again<00:04:33.300> and<00:04:33.660> then<00:04:33.810> go<00:04:33.960> long<00:04:34.760> which

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
that line again and then go long which

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.860 
that line again and then go long which
you<00:04:35.880> probably<00:04:36.060> couldn't<00:04:36.419> have<00:04:36.539> done<00:04:36.660> with<00:04:36.810> the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
you probably couldn't have done with the

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.100 
you probably couldn't have done with the
b-2s<00:04:37.320> you<00:04:37.919> can<00:04:38.070> also<00:04:38.310> handle<00:04:38.910> simply<00:04:39.780> carry

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
b-2s you can also handle simply carry

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.020 
b-2s you can also handle simply carry
more<00:04:40.410> that<00:04:40.710> line<00:04:40.979> in<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.280> air<00:04:41.430> which<00:04:41.700> a<00:04:41.820> lot<00:04:42.000> of

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
more that line in the air which a lot of

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.390 
more that line in the air which a lot of
people<00:04:42.330> do<00:04:43.289> and<00:04:43.530> maybe<00:04:43.680> they<00:04:43.889> shouldn't<00:04:44.280> maybe

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
people do and maybe they shouldn't maybe

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.219 
people do and maybe they shouldn't maybe
they<00:04:44.610> should<00:04:44.760> shoot<00:04:45.000> line<00:04:45.270> but<00:04:45.870> they're<00:04:46.050> able

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
they should shoot line but they're able

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.100 
they should shoot line but they're able
to<00:04:46.440> stretch<00:04:46.919> their<00:04:47.130> cast<00:04:47.340> out<00:04:47.690> casting<00:04:48.690> longer

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
to stretch their cast out casting longer

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.170

a longer each time holding that line in
the<00:04:51.270> air<00:04:51.419> now<00:04:51.630> we've<00:04:51.810> got<00:04:52.490> probably<00:04:53.490> 60<00:04:53.850> feet

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000
