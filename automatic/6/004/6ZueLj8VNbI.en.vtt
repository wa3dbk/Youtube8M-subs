very similar to blankety which is this

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.880 
very similar to blankety which is this
one<00:02:03.299> right<00:02:03.329> here<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:04.200> one<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.560> little<00:02:04.590> bit

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890

darker<00:02:05.040> than<00:02:05.310> blankety<00:02:05.820> though<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.360> little

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
it is a cool tone so it can tend to make

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.240

my teeth look a little yellow at least
in<00:02:26.430> my<00:02:26.549> opinion<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:28.290> looks<00:02:28.709> like<00:02:28.829> this

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
in my opinion and it looks like this

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.530 
in my opinion and it looks like this
it's<00:02:30.900> very<00:02:31.260> bold<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.829> out<00:02:32.040> there<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.609> tend<00:02:33.450> to

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
it's very bold and out there I tend to

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.690 
it's very bold and out there I tend to
use<00:02:33.599> it<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.140> center<00:02:34.409> of<00:02:34.470> my<00:02:34.620> lips<00:02:34.799> to<00:02:35.370> add

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
use it in the center of my lips to add

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.179 
use it in the center of my lips to add
like<00:02:36.030> an<00:02:36.180> ombre<00:02:36.569> effect<00:02:36.930> or<00:02:37.139> I<00:02:37.530> just<00:02:37.889> warm<00:02:38.099> it

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
like an ombre effect or I just warm it

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.129 
like an ombre effect or I just warm it
up<00:02:38.280> with<00:02:38.489> some<00:02:38.670> gloss<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.420> isn't<00:02:39.689> amplified

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
up with some gloss this isn't amplified

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:41.990 
up with some gloss this isn't amplified
so<00:02:40.319> it's<00:02:40.469> really<00:02:40.590> soft<00:02:40.859> and<00:02:41.010> creamy<00:02:41.220> when<00:02:41.970> I

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
so it's really soft and creamy when I

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.759 
so it's really soft and creamy when I
use<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.359> by<00:02:42.480> itself<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:42.930> can<00:02:43.109> never<00:02:43.230> get<00:02:43.470> like

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
use it by itself I can never get like

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.710 
use it by itself I can never get like
full<00:02:44.069> opacity<00:02:44.519> I<00:02:45.120> don't<00:02:45.359> know<00:02:45.450> if<00:02:45.569> it's

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
full opacity I don't know if it's

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.460 
full opacity I don't know if it's
because<00:02:45.870> it's<00:02:46.409> a<00:02:46.530> pesto<00:02:47.010> um<00:02:47.879> but<00:02:48.569> it<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.139> a

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470
