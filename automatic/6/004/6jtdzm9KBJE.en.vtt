00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
enjoyed using him which is kind of

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.870

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
left mid when he gets in on goal he will

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.229 
left mid when he gets in on goal he will
score<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.440> lot<00:03:58.620> of<00:03:58.650> goals<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.760> mean<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.150> used

score a lot of goals and I mean it used

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.970 
score a lot of goals and I mean it used
to<00:04:00.359> be<00:04:00.450> a<00:04:00.480> striker<00:04:00.810> on<00:04:01.049> fifa<00:04:01.380> 12<00:04:01.590> that's<00:04:01.829> when<00:04:01.950> i

for<00:04:03.660> a<00:04:03.690> long<00:04:03.930> time<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.380> I<00:04:05.010> could<00:04:05.370> have

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
for a long time and I could have

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.590 
for a long time and I could have
switched<00:04:05.639> him<00:04:05.850> out<00:04:05.940> for<00:04:06.120> someone<00:04:06.389> a<00:04:06.420> lot

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
switched him out for someone a lot

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.090 
switched him out for someone a lot
higher<00:04:06.810> rated<00:04:07.230> but<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.410> never<00:04:07.590> did<00:04:07.739> because<00:04:07.920> I

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
higher rated but I never did because I

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.470 
higher rated but I never did because I
thought<00:04:08.280> he<00:04:08.370> was<00:04:08.459> absolutely<00:04:08.790> fantastic<00:04:09.060> it's

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
thought he was absolutely fantastic it's

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.240 
thought he was absolutely fantastic it's
got<00:04:09.600> four<00:04:09.810> star<00:04:10.049> skills<00:04:10.319> and<00:04:10.500> just<00:04:11.010> really

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
got four star skills and just really

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.370 
got four star skills and just really
really<00:04:11.489> good<00:04:11.670> with<00:04:11.790> that<00:04:11.850> 88<00:04:12.209> pace<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:13.200> there

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
really good with that 88 pace so there

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
is just a glitch by EA and now we can

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.750 
is just a glitch by EA and now we can
just<00:04:24.800> move<00:04:24.920> on<00:04:25.040> to<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.280> strike<00:04:25.490> because<00:04:25.610> I

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
just move on to the strike because I

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.520 
just move on to the strike because I
went<00:04:25.910> for<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.090> strong<00:04:26.390> link<00:04:26.600> or<00:04:26.870> very<00:04:27.260> strong

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
went for a strong link or very strong

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.200 
went for a strong link or very strong
link<00:04:27.740> between<00:04:27.800> two<00:04:28.220> players<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:28.700> it's<00:04:29.030> from

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
link between two players and it's from

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.870 
link between two players and it's from
the<00:04:29.300> BPL<00:04:29.690> we<00:04:29.900> have<00:04:30.110> Remi<00:04:30.470> and<00:04:30.740> we<00:04:31.430> also<00:04:31.670> have

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
the BPL we have Remi and we also have

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.300 
the BPL we have Remi and we also have
djibril<00:04:32.810> cisse<00:04:33.140> who<00:04:33.290> no<00:04:33.440> longer<00:04:33.470> plays<00:04:33.890> at<00:04:34.040> QPR

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
djibril cisse who no longer plays at QPR

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.980 
djibril cisse who no longer plays at QPR
but<00:04:34.520> he<00:04:34.580> still<00:04:34.730> has<00:04:34.850> that<00:04:34.970> keep<00:04:35.180> your<00:04:35.390> card<00:04:35.780> and

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
but he still has that keep your card and

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.770 
but he still has that keep your card and
they<00:04:36.470> are<00:04:36.650> both<00:04:36.950> overpowered<00:04:37.910> monsters<00:04:38.450> I

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
they are both overpowered monsters I

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.960 
they are both overpowered monsters I
think<00:04:39.380> that<00:04:39.680> remy<00:04:40.400> is<00:04:40.490> probably<00:04:40.790> the<00:04:40.910> most

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
think that remy is probably the most

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.820 
think that remy is probably the most
expensive<00:04:41.510> player<00:04:41.660> in<00:04:41.870> this<00:04:42.050> squad<00:04:42.350> but

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
expensive player in this squad but

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.620 
expensive player in this squad but
definitely<00:04:43.280> worth<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.550> coins<00:04:43.790> like<00:04:43.880> 92<00:04:44.270> pace

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630
