think<00:02:31.080> it's<00:02:31.200> nebula<00:02:31.650> just<00:02:31.980> because<00:02:32.280> that

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
think it's nebula just because that

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.640 
think it's nebula just because that
would<00:02:32.820> necessitate<00:02:33.050> including<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.260> lot<00:02:34.500> of

would necessitate including a lot of

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.710 
would necessitate including a lot of
extra<00:02:35.010> mythology<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.820> I<00:02:36.120> think<00:02:36.360> Marvel<00:02:36.660> is

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
extra mythology and I think Marvel is

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.940 
extra mythology and I think Marvel is
going<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.930> try<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.140> keep<00:02:37.290> this<00:02:37.470> movie<00:02:37.800> as

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
going to try and keep this movie as

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.500 
going to try and keep this movie as
simple<00:02:38.250> as<00:02:38.340> possible<00:02:38.550> just<00:02:38.850> because<00:02:39.360> there

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
simple as possible just because there

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.930 
simple as possible just because there
are<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:39.660> many<00:02:39.900> characters<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:41.310> leads<00:02:41.550> me<00:02:41.640> to

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
are so many characters that leads me to

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.600 
are so many characters that leads me to
the<00:02:42.390> more<00:02:42.600> likely<00:02:42.960> candidate<00:02:43.350> kareena<00:02:43.890> order

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
to understand who Kareena is you have to

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.620 
to understand who Kareena is you have to

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.860 
love with korvac and they become this
super<00:03:17.670> villain<00:03:17.940> team<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.450> fights<00:03:18.630> the

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
super villain team that fights the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.600 
super villain team that fights the
Avengers<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.500> other<00:03:19.620> Marvel<00:03:19.980> superheroes

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
Avengers and other Marvel superheroes

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.730 
Avengers and other Marvel superheroes
personally<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.450> think<00:03:21.600> that<00:03:21.990> whoever<00:03:22.140> they<00:03:22.590> end

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
personally I think that whoever they end

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.260 
personally I think that whoever they end
up<00:03:22.860> playing<00:03:23.070> they'll<00:03:23.400> be<00:03:23.490> retconned<00:03:23.940> either

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
up playing they'll be retconned either

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.960 
up playing they'll be retconned either
way<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:24.959> even<00:03:25.320> though<00:03:25.350> korvac<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.370> Karina<00:03:26.700> are

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
way so even though korvac and Karina are

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.240 
way so even though korvac and Karina are
fairly<00:03:27.360> cosmic<00:03:27.990> and<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.650> little<00:03:29.100> out<00:03:29.220> there

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
fairly cosmic and a little out there

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.460 
fairly cosmic and a little out there
it's<00:03:30.030> totally<00:03:30.420> possible<00:03:30.570> that<00:03:31.080> they<00:03:31.200> could<00:03:31.230> be

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
it's totally possible that they could be

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.130 
it's totally possible that they could be
in<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.650> movie<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.610> now<00:03:33.090> shipping<00:03:33.570> Lee<00:03:33.930> pace

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
in the movie so now shipping Lee pace

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.780 
in the movie so now shipping Lee pace

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.640 
and Karen Gillan for guardians of the
galaxy<00:03:35.910> think<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.780> them<00:03:36.870> like<00:03:36.900> an<00:03:37.140> evil<00:03:37.410> Amy

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650

below<00:03:41.550> honestly<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:42.630> just<00:03:42.780> really<00:03:43.230> hope<00:03:43.320> that

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
below honestly I just really hope that

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.870 
below honestly I just really hope that
it's<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.739> character<00:03:44.070> that<00:03:44.100> allows<00:03:44.400> her<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:44.640> be

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
it's the character that allows her to be

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.820 
it's the character that allows her to be
in<00:03:45.090> Avengers<00:03:45.510> 2<00:03:45.780> but<00:03:46.380> there's<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.620> lot<00:03:46.800> of

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
in Avengers 2 but there's a lot of

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.530 
in Avengers 2 but there's a lot of
theories<00:03:47.250> so<00:03:47.610> write<00:03:47.910> in<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.060> comments<00:03:48.450> and

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
theories so write in the comments and

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.330 
theories so write in the comments and
we'll<00:03:48.660> discuss<00:03:49.140> right<00:03:49.800> now<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:50.070> only

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
movie our Rocket Raccoon and Groot now

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.300 
movie our Rocket Raccoon and Groot now
the<00:03:54.810> movie<00:03:55.140> isn't<00:03:55.350> going<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.800> be<00:03:55.920> released

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
the movie isn't going to be released

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.780 
the movie isn't going to be released
till<00:03:56.580> August<00:03:57.150> of<00:03:57.530> 2014<00:03:58.530> so<00:03:59.100> they're<00:03:59.430> not<00:03:59.730> going

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
till August of 2014 so they're not going

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.400 
till August of 2014 so they're not going
to<00:04:00.000> be<00:04:00.060> cast<00:04:00.270> so<00:04:00.510> much<00:04:00.720> much<00:04:00.930> later<00:04:01.170> in<00:04:01.320> the

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
to be cast so much much later in the

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.840 
to be cast so much much later in the
process<00:04:01.650> just<00:04:02.130> because<00:04:02.430> they'll<00:04:02.640> either<00:04:02.760> be

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
process just because they'll either be

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.240 
process just because they'll either be
CG<00:04:03.330> or<00:04:03.630> motion<00:04:03.959> capture<00:04:04.350> so<00:04:04.860> we<00:04:04.950> probably

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
CG or motion capture so we probably

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.160 
CG or motion capture so we probably
won't<00:04:05.610> find<00:04:05.880> out<00:04:06.060> who<00:04:06.209> they<00:04:06.330> are<00:04:06.510> for<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.870> long

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
won't find out who they are for a long

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.810 
won't find out who they are for a long
time<00:04:07.410> but<00:04:07.950> don't<00:04:08.160> worry<00:04:08.280> i'll<00:04:08.550> be<00:04:08.640> posting
