00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.760
 ah 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.380
 ah 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.010
 hello youtube friends in this video you 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.160
 We will show how to put in time a 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.350
 pointer model 2004 with distributor 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.510
 Well, the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.950
 identify the pieces to make it more 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.230
 fast and do not make mistakes 1 gear 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.600
 of the crankshaft this has a mark 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.580
 engraved in the form of an arrow this serves 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.800
 to synchronize with the intermediate pulley 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.490
 by means of a mark in the form of a point 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.100
 As shown in picture 2 pulley 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.960
 middle of dealer this has 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.720
 two marks the first one is a notch 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.700
 recorded with the letters ot and a dot the 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.600
 which is used to synchronize with the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.060
 crankshaft gear 3 tree pulley 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.340
 of cams this pulley has a mark 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.500
 engraved with the letters or I was 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.509
 synchronized with a brand in the form of 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.470
 arrow that is recorded in the hopper that 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.810
 protects distribution band 4 pulley 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.850
 tense now is pulley is the one that 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.520
 It is in charge of giving the necessary attention to 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.320
 the distribution band 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.829
 well the first thing we will do is 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.479
 uncover a model because it deserves xd 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.429
 the first step will be to put the pulley 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.950
 intermediate of the distributor on time 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.719
 this you do it in the following way 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.579
 remove the distributor cap and observe 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.619
 that the brush points the cable that goes 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.140
 connected to cylinder number 1 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.819
 this is the one that is in the part 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.880
 from the front of the engine to the front 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.709
 back already put on time this pulley the 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.869
 second step will be to put on time 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.940
 crankshaft gear to spin it 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.950
 lift the wheel on the right side of your 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.049
 vehicle in panty the fifth speed and 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.180
 turn the wheel in this way you will spin 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.459
 the crankshaft until match it 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.870
 the point of the intermediate pulley as well as 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.150
 show the image 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.489
 You can also verify by removing the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.590
 spark plug of cylinder number 1 and enter 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.900
 a screwdriver through the hole in the 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.030
 same until you feel the piston this should 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.190
 stay at the top dead center to 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.950
 adjust it you can turn the wheel that is 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.780
 raised another way to verify is 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.610
 observe in the gearbox a 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.470
 gradual viewer that indicates the point 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.540
 exact timing of the gear 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.720
 crankshaft this has some brands can 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.819
 to be graduated with a zero 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.910
 well now uncover another model and let's go 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.530
 with the third step x of this will be to put 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.720
 on time the camshaft pulley 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.209
 it is spun until it matches 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.819
 the mark or 'the with the mark engraved on 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.129
 the hopper that protects the band now that 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.569
 all the pulleys are already on time 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.700
 we have to place the band of 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.069
 and adjust the tensor distribution pulley 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.239
 since we have finished he owes us 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.239
 stay as follows 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.150
 good friends that's all and do not forget 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.150
