to wear when I'm bouldering and

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.669 
to wear when I'm bouldering and
especially<00:00:11.910> here<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:12.269> all<00:00:12.420> bar<00:00:12.570> scene<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:12.990> the

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
especially here in all bar scene is the

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.010 
especially here in all bar scene is the
last<00:00:13.830> 40<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.219> solution<00:00:14.610> it's<00:00:15.480> really<00:00:15.809> perfect

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
last 40 the solution it's really perfect

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.630 
last 40 the solution it's really perfect
for<00:00:16.230> bouldering<00:00:16.680> because<00:00:16.949> it's<00:00:17.100> super<00:00:17.310> down

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
for bouldering because it's super down

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.910 
for bouldering because it's super down
turn<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.270> can<00:00:18.420> really<00:00:18.539> edge<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.260> those

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
turn so you can really edge in on those

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.519 
turn so you can really edge in on those
small<00:00:20.250> holds<00:00:20.670> on<00:00:20.850> steep<00:00:21.390> roofs<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:22.199> little

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
small holds on steep roofs in little

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.570 
small holds on steep roofs in little
pockets<00:00:22.740> whatever<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.939> need<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:25.130> the<00:00:26.130> 3d

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
pockets whatever you need and the 3d

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.019 
pockets whatever you need and the 3d
heel<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.949> amazing<00:00:28.949> for<00:00:29.310> heel<00:00:29.490> hooking<00:00:29.880> and

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
heel is amazing for heel hooking and

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.840 
heel is amazing for heel hooking and
there's<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.900> ton<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.289> here<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.550> 3d

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
there's a ton of that here so the 3d

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.850 
there's a ton of that here so the 3d
heel<00:00:33.270> means<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.440> all<00:00:34.620> one<00:00:34.829> piece

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
heel means that this is all one piece

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.370 
heel means that this is all one piece
it's<00:00:35.460> really<00:00:35.790> rounded<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:36.960> not<00:00:37.140> multiple

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
it's really rounded so it's not multiple

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.560 
it's really rounded so it's not multiple
pieces<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.070> create<00:00:38.309> an<00:00:38.430> edge<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.329> no<00:00:39.450> matter

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
pieces that create an edge so no matter

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.569 
pieces that create an edge so no matter
where<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.200> put<00:00:40.230> your<00:00:40.530> heel<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:41.219> going<00:00:41.520> to

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
where you put your heel it's going to

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.160 
where you put your heel it's going to
stick<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.000> rock<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.540> really<00:00:42.719> molds

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
stick to the rock and it really molds

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.880 
stick to the rock and it really molds
down

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
down

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.979 
down
so<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> lot<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.760> times<00:00:44.969> you'll<00:00:45.180> find<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.719> as

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
so a lot of times you'll find that as

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.290 
so a lot of times you'll find that as
you<00:00:46.289> wear<00:00:46.469> shoes<00:00:46.800> they<00:00:47.280> become<00:00:47.700> flattened<00:00:48.180> out

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
you wear shoes they become flattened out

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.049 
you wear shoes they become flattened out
and<00:00:48.629> lose<00:00:49.289> their<00:00:49.469> downturned<00:00:50.059> characteristic

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
and lose their downturned characteristic

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.610 
and lose their downturned characteristic
which<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.600> super<00:00:52.050> important<00:00:52.410> when<00:00:52.440> you're

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
which is super important when you're

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.220 
which is super important when you're
bouldering<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.850> p3<00:00:54.300> power<00:00:54.539> system<00:00:54.989> is

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
bouldering so the p3 power system is

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.290 
bouldering so the p3 power system is
this<00:00:55.949> yellow<00:00:56.219> band<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.820> goes<00:00:56.940> all<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.210> way

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
this yellow band that goes all the way

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.869 
this yellow band that goes all the way
around<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.719> heel<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:59.100> maintains<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
around the heel and that maintains the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.840 
around the heel and that maintains the
downturned<00:01:00.420> feature<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> shoe<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.129> that's

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
downturned feature of the shoe so that's

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.219 
downturned feature of the shoe so that's
awesome<00:01:03.090> when<00:01:03.420> you're<00:01:03.539> standing<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> tiny

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
awesome when you're standing on a tiny

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.479 
awesome when you're standing on a tiny
hold<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.860> don't<00:01:05.040> need<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.280> worry<00:01:05.430> about

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
hold and you don't need to worry about

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.179 
hold and you don't need to worry about
your<00:01:05.909> foot<00:01:06.659> going<00:01:07.170> flat<00:01:07.590> because<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:08.040> going

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
your foot going flat because it's going

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.130 
your foot going flat because it's going
to<00:01:08.280> stay<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.670> downturned<00:01:09.420> position<00:01:09.869> and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
to stay in that downturned position and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.620 
to stay in that downturned position and
really<00:01:10.560> allow<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.189> use<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.369> power<00:01:11.640> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
really allow you to use that power to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.719 
really allow you to use that power to
make<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.960> hard<00:01:13.140> move<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.100> lock<00:01:14.280> harness

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
make that hard move so the lock harness

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.340 
make that hard move so the lock harness
system<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.299> another<00:01:15.630> really<00:01:15.869> important

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
system is another really important

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.609 
system is another really important
feature<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.860> solution<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:18.110> as<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.170> spell

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
feature of the solution and as a spell

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.320 
feature of the solution and as a spell
croque<00:01:19.830> piece<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.280> often<00:01:20.610> you'll<00:01:20.729> find<00:01:20.790> that

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
croque piece so often you'll find that

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.539 
croque piece so often you'll find that
velcro<00:01:22.049> shoes<00:01:22.470> are<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> little<00:01:22.920> bit<00:01:23.100> cumbersome

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
velcro shoes are a little bit cumbersome

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.010 
velcro shoes are a little bit cumbersome
there's<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.909> lot<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.240> straps<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.780> they<00:01:24.869> often

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
there's a lot of straps and they often

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.070 
there's a lot of straps and they often
come<00:01:25.200> undone<00:01:25.680> or<00:01:25.950> don't<00:01:26.189> stay<00:01:26.520> together<00:01:27.210> but

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
come undone or don't stay together but

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.499 
come undone or don't stay together but
this<00:01:28.619> system<00:01:28.860> wraps<00:01:29.430> around<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.970> entire<00:01:30.000> shoe

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
this system wraps around the entire shoe

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.480 
this system wraps around the entire shoe
from<00:01:30.750> side<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:30.990> side<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:31.890> really<00:01:32.280> allows

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
from side to side so that really allows

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.120 
from side to side so that really allows
you<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.759> crank<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.240> down<00:01:33.299> which<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.560> important

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
you to crank it down which is important

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.800 
you to crank it down which is important
for<00:01:35.159> narrow<00:01:35.490> feet<00:01:35.759> or<00:01:36.000> if<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.479> really

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
for narrow feet or if you just really

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.020 
for narrow feet or if you just really
like<00:01:36.990> your<00:01:37.200> shoe<00:01:37.439> fit<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:37.860> super<00:01:38.159> tight<00:01:38.340> so

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
like your shoe fit it's super tight so

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.210 
like your shoe fit it's super tight so
it's<00:01:39.720> super<00:01:40.079> quick<00:01:40.259> there's<00:01:40.530> only<00:01:40.680> one<00:01:40.860> strap

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
it's super quick there's only one strap

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.910 
it's super quick there's only one strap
and<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.689> cinch<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.079> down<00:01:43.110> from<00:01:43.500> these<00:01:43.590> two

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
and you can cinch it down from these two
