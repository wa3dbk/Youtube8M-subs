00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.380
 i 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.380
 yes 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:22.789
 and there behold the ritz 12w 25th minecraft 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:29.029
 and well it's the last snapshot before 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:31.939
 of the fight of 1.3 so let's go to 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.400
 see the few changes that have made us 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:38.070
 to put 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.070
 and as you can see I am in the end 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.420
 sound of death that you just 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.420
 hear 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.690
 and you see that the color of the sky is violet 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.909
 well this is the only change that 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.969
 made in the in another of the new 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:01:01.449
 changes is the new tp command but with 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.460
 coordinates that is if I put 84 93 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.040
 20 for example I'm going to have to go into 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:11.770
 a special room 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:15.550
 here is the truth of things is that 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:19.750
 we can put levers now on the roof 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.670
 we can put the rest in the part of 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.760
 up or if we put a ladder 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.860
 inverse you see that this is a ladder 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.790
 then we can put on the top 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.530
 and we can also put the lab on Monday 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.690
 the top part if it's a sla in the 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.570
 part of below is not going to work we can 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.420
 put the rest and it works perfectly 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.680
 so this dispenser would have us 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.940
 give something super mega special interest 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:53.370
 go slam if we are going to put what 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:55.400
 fun if you join lav well as you see 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.330
 here the circuit works perfectly 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.400
 yes wii 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.990
 if I go up these stairs now, should 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:07.170
 to spend something special and hear that you are 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.950
 sounding miss music 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.099
 and as you see open to land and we have 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:19.500
 new land servers we can put 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:21.810
 example that to make a server land 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.630
 put here some characteristics and power 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.940
 put your rival creative adventure and here 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.250
 put 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.350
 in the chests 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:37.800
 ignited when being land and third 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:41.530
 and if they have put us after 17 years and 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.800
 43 days but they were they have put us the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.030
 desired colors the stairs that do not 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.010
 they have no use other than 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.260
 decorative but we had put the 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.390
 slats had put us the blocks and 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.100
 we were missing the stairs another of the 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.190
 most important changes is that if 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.880
 we kill women 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.620
 will give us between 1 and 3 items where 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.360
 Tshirts 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.620
 as you can see that being at the moment all 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.620
 here are 13 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.180
 It's m2 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.660
 and that value is now when you're 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.790
 drowning I'm going to drown you remember that 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.660
 to go up when I was a year ago 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.540
 pulled back 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.720
 now it hurts me but I can continue 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.490
 perfectly that is, it only hurts me and 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.210
 the truth is that they have removed the notebook 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.980
 that I had and now look I'm going to go up I'm going 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.740
 I'm going to go up and today it was 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.150
 perfectly this the truth is that it is 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.260
 pretty good I did not think they were going to 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.120
 remove and 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.769
 and that I 'm going to tell you if you too 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.510
 you play minecraft how many times you 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.849
 you have died for this nonsense 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.519
 one of the last changes they have made 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.250
 is that now the inhabitants besides 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.730
 good is now was that they generate 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.310
 now they are going to come out some spirals we are going to 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.930
 kill this chicken chicken dies good 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.659
 you have noticed something strange to explain the 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.450
 what is it is generated in a new 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:13.659
 internal but what happens is that if you 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.709
 we buy many things he gets tired or he is 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:19.139
 can you tire we'll see if you get tired 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.480
 tired you get tired of that I bought you 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:25.870
 axes and said you're tired 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:29.380
 we are going to give it and the one that 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:35.580
 I can buy you made of metal that 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.580
 buy do not you want me to kill you 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.750
 to finish telling you the great news and 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.380
 is that now because of the server land 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.730
 today to suck a lot more memory 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.040
 of the computer therefore there will be 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:53.270
 lag and let's check if it's true 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.270
 you can click click 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.240
 Well, well, it does not happen right now 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.850
 let's see with the levers with the tnt 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.850
 to see if there is 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:13.400
 and the one that had been an expression 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.230
 late we will be 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:20.180
 you have seen that I click and have not 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:24.290
 come out there are many you have to see all the 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:27.020
 things six take a lot and percent 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.470
 with the bows also pass we go to 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.190
 look for an arch 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.190
 through him 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:44.400
 I've seen that like the gala 2030 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:48.630
 you have seen that you have seen that it is very 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.200
 beast then they said they were the 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.639
 more carefree right now the 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.550
 problem 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.439
 this has been the whole snap shot in the 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:02.849
 next week upload the video of 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:05.520
 Thursday and Friday of summer I can already 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:08.430
 upload videos almost every day already 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:13.789
 it is indicated what plans I have and nothing I hope 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.789
