00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:34.040
 minimum for a tiny map was 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:37.250

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.970

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.860
 no block because I do not have the suit 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.190
 but now I'm going to put on the suit and 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.650
 they will see that I will be able to break everything and 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.650
 jump high there 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:19.170

 break point 4 point as wow 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.280
 then also another thing that to me not 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.980
 here is that the little cloud of the typical egg 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.530
 then another thing that this is a 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.280
 trampoline wow wow 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.790
 then another thing that he does is also 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.900
 this 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.900
 Look, when I saw this, I really did not 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.340
 that is, this spectacular as well as how 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.750
 make 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:19.300
 and then also bring me leave all this 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.890
 here we are going to see this 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.650
 let's see what this does 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.560
 it's a like the game bomb and 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.130
 they exploded the shot there I will throw as 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.130
 forever 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:41.230
 and this is like material I do not know what 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:43.739
 So this is the weird thing, there's only soil 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.739
 or 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:56.099
 he proposes again and there he gave me two 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:00.659
 him then to fill in this then if 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:04.560
 I also to put a fungus a life 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:07.230
 yes if we put a fungus there and a life 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.530
 it's also going to be the same then we're going 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.430
 Let's see 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.430
 and there throw to life and you give 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:25.319
 tiralongo I do not know where I throw it but I think 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.319
 that gives you more life there 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.980
 it surprises me then it also brings 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.780
 a series of weapons that we like and this 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.210
 which is spectacular spectacular 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.330
 spectacular of truth look at the lie 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:47.730
 of the fire and will burn the enemies by 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:52.490
 example I will put enemies here 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:56.720
 I'm going to put kripper to see 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:04:01.540
 to see the eggs for this is a pen 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.540
 I'll see if I can use the pen 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.349
 but iron I hope 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.709
 leather hat also brings this is 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:17.150
 a degree of georg and brings all the gravel 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:20.750
 of iron are like a kind of idea 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.180
 this is like a fire thing that he 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.620
 Bring the diamond breastplate is like the 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:30.680
 costume of him that has 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.020
 then we go down cookie not 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.330
 let's look for things to invoke 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.030
 the monsters here yes here is 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.639
 well the clipper would be another 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.320
 kind otherwise the young people came 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.190
 doing another thing too 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.330
 we'll see 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:53.460
 the skeleton sold doing the same thing 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.740
 chas no no no no 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.539
 that you generate it if you want to see it 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.949
 then I will generate only these 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:02.400
 three things 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:05.039
 look at the dog that is good I did not believe 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.070
 that was going to look like georgi me something 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:15.180
 the skeleton if it's like 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:20.060
 and the wolf is the skeleton of angels of 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.060
 christer and they will see that if I hurt 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:30.270
 then if it hurts if it does a lot of damage 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:35.000
