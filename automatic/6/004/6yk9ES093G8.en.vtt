00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.970
 r 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.050
 with the playful action the residents of the post ask the municipality and province 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.349
 measures against the increased traffic pressure 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.360
 That is why a number of dangerous situations were re-enacted today 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.939
 a truck driver until the club really runs every 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.769
 road user with a tip 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:21.589
 in value 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.539
 yes, he wants emmen to live in the neighborhoods, but very often I don't have any more 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:26.849
 coming upstairs 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.359
 the weather seems like something 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.289

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.550

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.160
 this year will be resumed after it becomes today 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.790
 the four film all 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.520
 yes that people come to sit because of problems and blue unsafe 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.050
 For the residents of the post, the traffic pressure in the village has been around for years 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.040
 a source of concern and annoyance 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.110
 the n360 the main traffic artery between groningen and delfzijl that is possible 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.070
 house price is the village 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.270
 there we are halfway groningen delfzijl the only village baarn the bus bridge 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.090
 about tents to search for with a trip 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.280
 and that is getting busier and lorries being diverted by the future 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.700
 and they are now not looking for anything at all through the problem 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.120
 dangerous situations are recorded from the air 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.530
 the photo will be the last in traffic so that it will be processed soon 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.370
 is handed over to municipalities and province, we want in the first instance 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.100
 strive for a 30-kilometer zone that will become safer 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.240
 that something is being done about the footpath and the long one 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.140
 Term endeavors to judge two people already that traffic is here now 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.200
 has nothing to look for on the web 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.170
 of course the action of today is to make somewhat rash according to the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.600
 local residents have to do something quickly, my children I absolutely did not want it 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.220
 come alone 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.640
 with a view to safety 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.680
 and with the increased traffic pressure, the chance of damage at home is considerable 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.680
 and then we get to work out further 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.650
 we want to cook there 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.420
 luckily my car has it 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.299
 No
