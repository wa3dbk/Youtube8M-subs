tanks are supposed to roll that's why

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.580

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.080 
that didn't move I mean lame seriously I
am<00:03:50.290> thinking<00:03:50.799> I<00:03:50.859> might<00:03:51.069> actually<00:03:51.250> take<00:03:51.880> some

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
am thinking I might actually take some

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.110 
am thinking I might actually take some
oil<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:52.690> oil<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.889> wheels<00:03:54.100> just<00:03:54.609> a<00:03:54.730> little<00:03:54.940> bit
