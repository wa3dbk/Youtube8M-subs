quickly make the delicate petals using a

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.100 
quickly make the delicate petals using a
poking<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.670> sliding<00:00:54.090> motion<00:00:54.270> there<00:00:55.020> is

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
poking and sliding motion there is

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.110 
poking and sliding motion there is
really<00:00:55.410> not<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.829> much<00:00:56.039> product<00:00:56.399> waste<00:00:56.699> but

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
really not that much product waste but

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.670 
really not that much product waste but
I'm<00:00:57.239> going<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.629> wipe<00:00:57.750> off<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.170> drops<00:00:58.440> that

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
I'm going to wipe off the drops that

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.510 
I'm going to wipe off the drops that
remain<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.129> top

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.650 

continue<00:01:06.520> with<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.760> second<00:01:07.120> round<00:01:07.300> of<00:01:07.420> petals

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
continue with the second round of petals

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.780 
continue with the second round of petals
using<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.290> same<00:01:08.560> poking<00:01:09.040> and<00:01:09.160> sliding<00:01:09.610> motion

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
using the same poking and sliding motion

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.760 
using the same poking and sliding motion
but<00:01:10.480> slide<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:10.870> needle<00:01:11.140> a<00:01:11.200> little<00:01:11.500> farther

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
but slide the needle a little farther

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.800 
but slide the needle a little farther
this<00:01:12.040> time<00:01:12.100> gradually<00:01:12.910> spreading<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.570> yellow

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
this time gradually spreading the yellow

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:23.280 
this time gradually spreading the yellow
to<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:14.170> left<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.620> right<00:01:14.920> on<00:01:15.130> each<00:01:15.310> row<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
to the left and right on each row the

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.140 
to the left and right on each row the
petals<00:01:23.680> will<00:01:23.890> then<00:01:24.040> become<00:01:24.220> larger<00:01:24.940> and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
petals will then become larger and

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.850 
petals will then become larger and
fuller<00:01:27.210> these<00:01:28.210> needles<00:01:28.750> are<00:01:28.960> cost<00:01:29.260> efficient

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
fuller these needles are cost efficient

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.530 
fuller these needles are cost efficient
because<00:01:29.979> they<00:01:30.310> can<00:01:30.460> save<00:01:30.640> you<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.790> lot<00:01:30.880> of<00:01:31.180> time

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
because they can save you a lot of time

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.600 
because they can save you a lot of time
and<00:01:31.810> believe<00:01:32.170> it<00:01:32.350> time<00:01:32.920> is<00:01:33.070> money<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:33.340> in

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
and believe it time is money and in

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.760 
and believe it time is money and in
every<00:01:33.970> business<00:01:34.180> increased<00:01:35.020> production<00:01:35.440> in

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
every business increased production in

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.499 
every business increased production in
the<00:01:35.890> shortest<00:01:36.280> time<00:01:36.430> possible<00:01:36.490> is<00:01:37.090> always

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
the shortest time possible is always

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:52.470 
the shortest time possible is always
excellent

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.360 

the<00:01:53.480> petals<00:01:53.870> will<00:01:54.080> then<00:01:54.230> become<00:01:54.440> larger<00:01:55.130> and

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
the petals will then become larger and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:06.710 
the petals will then become larger and
fuller

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.359
