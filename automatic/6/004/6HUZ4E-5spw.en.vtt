00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.950
 hello of a making a video on five 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.809
 crates we will disassemble it so 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.759
 removed the screen and the battery we were 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.769
 showed how to change the screen and the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.330
 battery and also to disconnect the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.850
 reflex of the home button so always the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:27.510
 trousers 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:34.170
 always below that turn 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:39.390
 spontaneously we say that we take the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.680
 sucker and be careful not too much 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.940
 raised because there is the tablecloth is very 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.649
 fragile so you lift the trophy 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.050
 if you go he is too strong you 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:51.559
 are you going to snatch tear off the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.559
 tablecloth so a point of concern 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:05.990
 yes gently leverage you 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.380
 I can learn my nails 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.159
 right here 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:17.060
 so here's the under glass and so there is 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.390
 so this little girl did it 1 ap the 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.390
 home button 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.920
 we would have there disconnected nicely 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:33.670
 so you take others if you have a 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.670
 clip or maybe holding back 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:54.060
 the camera so the plate 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:57.090
 so this is this plate trying to raise 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:03.600
 and you will disconnect the tablecloth 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:10.030
 this is how it is connected 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:13.060
 6-1 and connections so that's it 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.010
 always the same we have changed a little 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.580
 compared to 5 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:22.570
 it's the same even no more than the 5 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.550
 hours on the 5th so it's always alive 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.740
 which is never who is not and 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.390
 riding and others 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.530
 so all their masters it's a little 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:37.450
 the worst of me is the vagaries of 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.100
 craft did not make vices went up 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:45.160
 it's not very busy so when the 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:47.640
 little son but hey, so here you are 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.760
 can use this every year 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:03:00.580
 I use my elbow's house 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:03.040
 connected everything now like this so 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.239
 there you have climbs the screen of 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.310
 your iphone 5 is so after that's all 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.970
 same time so when you want 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.000
 change the screen 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.010
 often they are not ready so go up so you have to 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.770
 to found this black also so with levis 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.470
 very nice camera as well as the by 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.500
 during the climbs we removed and so there 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.270
 it stinks 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.100
 it's not that it's not it's not anymore 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:30.860
 complicated that on the 5 and 25 c you 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.470
 remove here here we left six and the 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.470
 sese seko and here you take off 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.680
 delicately the tablecloth that sticks in 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.980
 all capelle programs and then 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.540
 after we continue to repair 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.990
 so for the battery for the battery 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:52.000
 it is not nothing it is not and that the 5 c 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:57.760
 these same blacks disassembled the plate 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.760
 we do a little straw we come back 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.870
 finally his revenge on the inter joined the 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.290
 5 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:10.250
 here is a little good camera a little 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.560
 like this so here you disconnect the 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.510
 battery and to remove it so for 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:24.200
 remove the best is to leverage 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:26.479
 with you too and it's like these 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.040
 do not see him but do not do the pass 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.960
 who is shabby who pays beneath and 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.640
 whiskey and whiskey and the damaged 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.100
 building without all that is so you 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:42.169
 will have more volume vibrators etc 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.540
 so now you know how 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.350
 we replace the battery and cram years 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.690
 and more than to go up 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.820
 so here I leave you there and I hope 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.820
 that this video will have helped you
