00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.700
 for a long time we were looking for a recipe for cucumbers 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.950
 who would have their homeland in style for very long 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.410
 and remained not to switch the scheme 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.630
 a long time right now is april month we 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.020
 still eat them they have remained so 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.160
 how practically we will be like this 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.220
 face it practically 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.619
 as they were after a month 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.840
 after salting in a month 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.840
 crisply ready-made pretty together 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.029
 with 2 runs roughly barely found this 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.570
 honestly I tried the recipe very 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.700
 many poured a couple of years straight banks 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.550
 10 cans because as far as rewrote 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.290
 it was impossible to eat and here on one 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.829
 kind man showed that in any 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.870
 recipe 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.600
 here's the recipe that you do so 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.910
 garlic than you do there yes if u 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.510
 you already have your recipe 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.890
 you need to add three huge twigs 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.489
 amaranth schiritsa it is called by 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.649
 Ukrainian amaranth is a malicious weed 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.539
 weed in Ukraine 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.879
 which very many are trying to bring 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.720
 himself from the garden, he is mean green 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.470
 green red and red but not red 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.600
 such more in burgundy or 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.030
 Buryakova his color here are three kinds of it 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.460
 happens to tear 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.460
 we are 30-40 centimeters tall 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.080
 a twig is so good and that's what you need 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.810
 on a three-liter jar of three cucumbers 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.040
 things here we have greenbacks in our 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.229
 the case of green is so big 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.140
 I will share those persons with recipes 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.060
 do and here we throw on the three-liter 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.759
 jar means cucumbers necessarily 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.680
 note that the cucumbers were 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.000
 just for conservation for pickling 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.829
 why because we are this year 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.560
 experimented we closed tick 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.869
 that for salting in a jar mixed one 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.350
 those that were early, that is, they were not 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.360
 they are intended like that 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.149
 not afraid of that word so father what 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.649

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.869

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.990
 salt without a hill that is a glass 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.260
 side of the new salt I will be able to say 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.180
 what can a recipe do 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.880
 an individual who is used to something 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.520
 the main thing to add magic 3 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.350
 amaranth sprigs and your cucumbers in general 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.840
 will not rewrite practically that is 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.300
 they are barely a can of course from a bank 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.210
 too different can not understand why 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.700
 sometimes a jar we open it straight my 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.710
