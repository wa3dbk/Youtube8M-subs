to get rid of one so to do that and I
keep<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.290> dropping<00:01:16.560> though

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.179 

and<00:01:25.009> as<00:01:25.700> you<00:01:25.850> can<00:01:26.000> see<00:01:27.189> each<00:01:28.189> one<00:01:29.799> has<00:01:30.799> gotten

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
and as you can see each one has gotten

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.639 
and as you can see each one has gotten
smaller<00:01:31.570> there's<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.780> first<00:01:32.990> one<00:01:34.360> second<00:01:35.360> one

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
smaller there's the first one second one

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.780 
smaller there's the first one second one
that's<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.860> actually<00:01:37.310> I<00:01:37.369> think<00:01:37.430> that's<00:01:37.640> the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
that's the actually I think that's the

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.880 
that's the actually I think that's the
second<00:01:38.030> one<00:01:38.180> third<00:01:38.869> one<00:01:38.930> fourth<00:01:39.140> one<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:39.740> then

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
second one third one fourth one and then

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.840 
second one third one fourth one and then
finally<00:01:40.810> this<00:01:41.810> itsy-bitsy<00:01:42.680> as<00:01:43.549> you<00:01:43.700> see

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
finally this itsy-bitsy as you see

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.660 
finally this itsy-bitsy as you see
comparison<00:01:44.590> from<00:01:45.590> actually<00:01:46.190> I<00:01:46.220> think<00:01:46.340> this<00:01:46.549> is

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
comparison from actually I think this is

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.499 
comparison from actually I think this is
the<00:01:46.789> first<00:01:47.030> one<00:01:47.350> there's<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.530> first<00:01:48.710> one

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
the first one there's the first one

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.450 
the first one there's the first one
second<00:01:50.509> one<00:01:50.659> it's<00:01:51.229> so<00:01:51.619> tiny<00:01:52.990> look<00:01:53.990> at<00:01:54.170> it<00:01:54.460> it's

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
second one it's so tiny look at it it's

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.399 
second one it's so tiny look at it it's
like<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.610> little<00:01:55.909> baby<00:01:56.240> troll<00:01:56.810> I<00:01:56.840> just<00:01:57.140> picked

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
like a little baby troll I just picked

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.130 
like a little baby troll I just picked
it<00:01:57.530> up<00:01:57.649> by<00:01:57.860> accident<00:01:58.009> but<00:01:59.770> it's<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:01.190> tiny<00:02:02.110> so<00:02:03.110> I

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
it up by accident but it's so tiny so I

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.570 
it up by accident but it's so tiny so I
don't<00:02:03.380> know<00:02:03.500> if<00:02:03.619> this<00:02:03.799> is<00:02:03.830> a<00:02:06.069> like<00:02:07.069> a<00:02:07.100> common

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
don't know if this is a like a common

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.699 
don't know if this is a like a common
