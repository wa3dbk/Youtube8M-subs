this and I will really realistic in pure
lighting<00:00:23.840> can<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:24.960> get<00:00:25.109> down<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.410> path<00:00:25.560> so

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
lighting can we get down the path so

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.650 
lighting can we get down the path so
that<00:00:25.740> mission<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.250> probably<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.060> most

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
that mission is probably one of the most

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.009 
that mission is probably one of the most
complex<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.470> could<00:00:29.099> turn<00:00:29.250> yet<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.849> lot<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.720> big

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
buildings and again we would like to try

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.790 
buildings and again we would like to try
it<00:00:43.170> as<00:00:43.559> less<00:00:44.070> detected<00:00:44.730> as<00:00:44.850> we<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.620> so<00:00:46.620> we're

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
it as less detected as we can so we're

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.380 
it as less detected as we can so we're
using<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.160> flying<00:00:47.520> drone<00:00:47.789> again<00:00:48.030> today

going to break your tell situation or
recount<00:02:44.990> situation<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:47.450> one<00:02:47.630> of<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.810> issues

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
recount situation so one of the issues

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.990 
recount situation so one of the issues
with<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.620> find<00:02:48.950> role<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.310> seen<00:02:49.580> is<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:49.730> it

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
with the find role you seen is that it

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.410 
with the find role you seen is that it
cannot<00:02:50.450> sit<00:02:50.750> indoors<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:52.370> will<00:02:52.550> you<00:02:52.820> use<00:02:53.060> for

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
cannot sit indoors so will you use for

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.510 
cannot sit indoors so will you use for
that<00:02:53.540> some<00:02:53.750> kind<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:53.959> you<00:02:54.260> man<00:02:54.470> manual<00:02:54.950> recon

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
that some kind of you man manual recon

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.699 
that some kind of you man manual recon
moment<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.630> x-ray<00:02:57.050> view<00:02:57.260> is<00:02:57.350> the<00:02:57.470> great<00:02:57.680> thing

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
moment the x-ray view is the great thing

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.410 
moment the x-ray view is the great thing
to<00:02:57.920> do<00:02:58.160> so<00:02:58.340> because<00:02:58.490> it<00:02:58.700> shows<00:02:58.940> you<00:02:59.120> everything

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
to do so because it shows you everything

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.340 
to do so because it shows you everything
BN<00:02:59.900> walls<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.470> lets<00:03:01.250> you<00:03:01.520> normally<00:03:02.120> get<00:03:02.870> Intel

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
BN walls and lets you normally get Intel

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.410 
BN walls and lets you normally get Intel
unloads<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.100> guard<00:03:04.520> situations<00:03:05.030> but<00:03:05.270> also

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
unloads the guard situations but also

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.880 
unloads the guard situations but also
shared<00:03:05.780> with<00:03:06.020> any<00:03:06.260> of<00:03:06.440> your<00:03:06.590> teammates

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
shared with any of your teammates

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.910 
shared with any of your teammates
whether<00:03:07.310> their<00:03:07.640> tomato<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:09.709> eyes<00:03:09.890> or

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
whether their tomato the eyes or

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.870 
whether their tomato the eyes or
teammates<00:03:10.640> in<00:03:10.790> real<00:03:10.910> life

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.290 

so<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.720> drone<00:03:15.960> is<00:03:16.020> that<00:03:16.410> Co<00:03:17.310> functionality<00:03:18.000> to

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
so the drone is that Co functionality to

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.380 
so the drone is that Co functionality to
crawl<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:19.200> it's<00:03:19.830> way<00:03:20.250> less<00:03:20.460> detectable<00:03:20.790> that

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
crawl so it's way less detectable that

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.750 
crawl so it's way less detectable that
way<00:03:21.630> it's<00:03:21.960> all<00:03:22.200> slower<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.310> move<00:03:23.520> and

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
way it's all slower to move and

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.820 
way it's all slower to move and
obviously<00:03:24.330> can<00:03:24.570> not<00:03:24.960> overcome<00:03:25.170> specific

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
obviously can not overcome specific

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.460 
obviously can not overcome specific
obstacles<00:03:26.420> but<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.480> good<00:03:27.720> things<00:03:27.960> that<00:03:28.110> least

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
obstacles but the good things that least

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.130 
obstacles but the good things that least
comes<00:03:28.710> with<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.950> sonic<00:03:29.310> pulse<00:03:29.520> so<00:03:29.790> kind<00:03:29.970> of

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
comes with a sonic pulse so kind of

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.830 
comes with a sonic pulse so kind of
ultra<00:03:31.140> sound<00:03:31.430> audio<00:03:32.430> wave<00:03:32.640> that<00:03:33.090> was<00:03:33.240> done<00:03:33.570> any

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
ultra sound audio wave that was done any

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.410 
ultra sound audio wave that was done any
girls<00:03:34.290> in<00:03:34.440> this<00:03:34.500> earning<00:03:35.150> but<00:03:36.150> if<00:03:36.270> you<00:03:36.390> use

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
girls in this earning but if you use

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.180 
girls in this earning but if you use
that<00:03:36.570> you<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.900> bit<00:03:37.140> dejected<00:03:37.260> so<00:03:37.770> we<00:03:37.890> probably

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
that you a bit dejected so we probably

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:45.680 
that you a bit dejected so we probably
skip<00:03:38.550> one<00:03:38.760> away<00:03:43.670> it's<00:03:44.670> not<00:03:44.910> meant<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.180> be<00:03:45.300> using

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
skip one away it's not meant to be using

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
skip one away it's not meant to be using
stairs<00:03:45.960> so<00:03:46.260> might<00:03:46.680> want<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:46.950> fly<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:52.470> drone

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
stairs so might want to fly the drone

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.650 
stairs so might want to fly the drone
can<00:03:52.920> be<00:03:53.040> detected<00:03:53.310> as<00:03:53.610> you<00:03:53.670> can<00:03:53.850> see<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.480> best

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
can be detected as you can see the best

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.570 
can be detected as you can see the best
thing<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:55.020> do<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.500> avoid<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.250> go

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
thing to do to avoid that is to go

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.100 
thing to do to avoid that is to go
crawling<00:03:56.910> again<00:03:57.270> and<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.660> see<00:03:57.810> just

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
crawling again and you see just

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.390 
crawling again and you see just
disappear<00:03:58.500> from<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.830> point<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.070> view<00:03:59.130> of<00:03:59.250> an

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
disappear from the point of view of an

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:09.810 
disappear from the point of view of an
alga

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.400 

okay<00:04:10.820> so<00:04:10.880> now<00:04:11.270> we<00:04:11.330> know<00:04:11.630> how<00:04:11.780> many<00:04:11.840> guards<00:04:12.140> I

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
okay so now we know how many guards I

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.610 
okay so now we know how many guards I
can<00:04:12.680> be<00:04:14.260> you<00:04:15.260> try<00:04:15.500> to<00:04:15.560> begin<00:04:15.920> and<00:04:16.160> then<00:04:17.620> yeah

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
can be you try to begin and then yeah

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.680
