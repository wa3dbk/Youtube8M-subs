00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:06.819
 the star of easy the real ones all have answers to create a 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:08.279
 alliance 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:10.589
 mohamed are interested 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.669
 while they sound more like making a pincho a montadito with black pudding and apples 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.210
 we will also use bread crumbs although olive oil first we remove the 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.930
 skin to blood sausage because if you can not do it when we lament the 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.359
 skillet 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.050
 we'll cut it into slices rather like a choir 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.050
 then we will see also how 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.770
 how are we going to overflow 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.120
 brief as we have done and overflow the bungled 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.260
 and then love the apple 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.240
 and what has not been cut into very thin slices what will be the ones that we will assault 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.530
 in oil 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.530
 and we have them to start ambassadors 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.840
 here the apple is a golden apple challenges that the apple has combined and 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.940
 refresh the fat that the black pudding has 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.040
 good as it has a lot of oil logically what we do is take them out 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.470
 to a plate we can also use 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.570
 a blotting paper 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.869
 for what luck all that access tell you that you can have 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.780
 and then fry the black pudding 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.430
 the pandas found in a pan in the field of the arts 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.560
 well we have already put the name of the bread the bread blocks of barreto on we put the 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.940
 Apple 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.280
 and then we will finish with the blood sausage 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.380
 that this basket points digits so that it does not stay Canada and enjoy a 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.460
 spike easy to make 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.780
 and is that you have how rich we are 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.340
 let's go over mozilla skewer with apples black pudding apple hold'em bread 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.080
 grated and toasted bread 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.440
 we will remove blood from the black pudding and cut slices in panama or without 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.010
 brakes the blood sausage 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.510
 then we peel if we cut the apple into slices and then fry them 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.149
 of a slice of bread 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.149
 the apple and the music 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:17.249
