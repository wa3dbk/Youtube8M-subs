00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
it's just pretty much stopped record and

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.300 
it's just pretty much stopped record and
so<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.040> those<00:01:47.790> very<00:01:48.000> easy<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.299> use<00:01:49.070> some<00:01:50.070> cons

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
so on those very easy to use some cons

that<00:02:22.670> might<00:02:23.670> be<00:02:23.880> trouble<00:02:24.180> for<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.780> lot<00:02:24.900> of

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
that might be trouble for a lot of

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.560 
that might be trouble for a lot of
people<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.100> chord<00:02:26.490> is<00:02:27.240> only<00:02:27.450> about

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
people is that this chord is only about

people is that this chord is only about
four<00:02:27.870> feet<00:02:28.020> long<00:02:28.320> so<00:02:29.040> your<00:02:29.430> computer<00:02:29.910> is

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
four feet long so your computer is

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.930 
four feet long so your computer is
Matthew<00:02:30.360> relatively<00:02:30.990> close<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.130> device

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
Matthew relatively close to the device

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.710 
Matthew relatively close to the device

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
that you're recording from unless you

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.890 
that you're recording from unless you
have<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.870> USB<00:02:37.080> extender<00:02:37.590> or<00:02:38.460> if<00:02:38.910> your<00:02:39.060> TV<00:02:39.570> has<00:02:39.690> an

output<00:02:40.200> like<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.440> said<00:02:40.590> earlier<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:41.520> can<00:02:41.700> just

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
output like I said earlier you can just

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.080 
output like I said earlier you can just
plug<00:02:42.150> this<00:02:42.360> in<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:42.630> then<00:02:43.550> hook<00:02:44.550> this<00:02:44.700> up<00:02:44.910> and

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
plug this in and then hook this up and

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.080 
plug this in and then hook this up and
then<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.300> can<00:02:45.420> actually<00:02:45.690> play<00:02:45.900> on<00:02:46.200> your<00:02:47.090> TV

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.480 
then you can actually play on your TV
and<00:02:48.420> have<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.500> recorded<00:02:49.980> in<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.100> computer<00:02:50.400> at

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
and have it recorded in a computer at

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.530 
and have it recorded in a computer at
the<00:02:50.520> same<00:02:50.700> time<00:02:51.800> I<00:02:52.800> think<00:02:53.760> that's<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.090> for<00:02:54.300> both

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
the same time I think that's it for both

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.950 
the same time I think that's it for both
pros<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.020> cons<00:02:56.120> as<00:02:57.120> for<00:02:57.510> me<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.630> would

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
pros and cons as for me I would

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.060 
pros and cons as for me I would
definitely<00:02:58.140> recommend<00:02:58.410> this<00:02:58.680> device

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
definitely recommend this device

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.700 
definitely recommend this device

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
way to do that so I would definitely

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.610 
way to do that so I would definitely
recommend<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:26.780> there<00:03:27.780> is<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:28.140> mean<00:03:28.350> there<00:03:28.500> is

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
recommend it there is I mean there is

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.570 
recommend it there is I mean there is
better<00:03:28.830> capture<00:03:29.820> cards<00:03:30.000> out<00:03:30.090> there<00:03:31.160> but<00:03:32.160> there

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
better capture cards out there but there

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.930 
better capture cards out there but there
are<00:03:32.670> going<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:32.910> be<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.030> lot<00:03:33.120> more<00:03:33.180> expensive<00:03:34.940> so

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
are going to be a lot more expensive so

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.740
