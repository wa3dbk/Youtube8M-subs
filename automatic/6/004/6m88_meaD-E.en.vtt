can see I've got adhesive here and then
along<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.470> perpendicular<00:01:47.280> edge<00:01:47.430> I've<00:01:47.640> also

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
along the perpendicular edge I've also

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.910 
along the perpendicular edge I've also
got<00:01:48.030> adhesive<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> bottom<00:01:48.840> I'm<00:01:49.740> just

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
got adhesive on the bottom I'm just

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.499 
got adhesive on the bottom I'm just
gonna<00:01:50.009> hold<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.579> bottom<00:01:50.909> corner<00:01:51.240> where<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
gonna hold the bottom corner where the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.649 
gonna hold the bottom corner where the
two<00:01:51.720> adhesive<00:01:52.130> meet<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.700> I'm<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:54.509> gonna

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
two adhesive meet and I'm just gonna

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.109 
two adhesive meet and I'm just gonna
make<00:01:55.439> sure<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.979> I'm<00:01:56.159> folding<00:01:56.490> kind<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.030> a

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
make sure that I'm folding kind of a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.679 
make sure that I'm folding kind of a
cone<00:01:57.360> shape<00:01:57.689> across<00:01:58.520> so<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.759> top<00:02:00.030> here<00:02:00.659> that

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
cone shape across so the top here that

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.690 
cone shape across so the top here that
that<00:02:01.170> pointy<00:02:01.590> part<00:02:01.829> shows<00:02:02.070> off<00:02:02.250> really<00:02:02.520> nicely

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
that pointy part shows off really nicely

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.580 
that pointy part shows off really nicely
and<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.540> basically<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:04.079> just<00:02:04.290> tuck<00:02:04.439> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and you basically you just tuck the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.859 
and you basically you just tuck the
bottom<00:02:04.920> edge<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.310> really<00:02:05.700> tightly<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.299> leave

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
bottom edge in really tightly and leave

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.550 
bottom edge in really tightly and leave
the<00:02:07.079> top<00:02:07.320> part<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.890> little<00:02:08.310> bit<00:02:08.429> looser<00:02:08.729> now

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
the top part a little bit looser now

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.750 
the top part a little bit looser now
because<00:02:10.560> we've<00:02:10.709> got<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.039> adhesive<00:02:11.340> on<00:02:11.640> there

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
because we've got that adhesive on there

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.010 
because we've got that adhesive on there
you<00:02:11.879> can<00:02:12.060> kind<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.360> do<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.540> little<00:02:12.750> bit<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.959> a

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
you can kind of do a little bit of a

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.760 
you can kind of do a little bit of a
check<00:02:13.230> here

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
check here

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.320 
check here
and<00:02:13.920> see<00:02:14.250> what<00:02:14.400> you're<00:02:14.520> going<00:02:14.700> cones<00:02:15.060> gonna

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
and see what you're going cones gonna

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.300 
and see what you're going cones gonna
look<00:02:15.480> like<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.900> don't<00:02:16.290> quite<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:16.740> where<00:02:17.160> the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
look like I don't quite like where the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.040 
look like I don't quite like where the
papers<00:02:17.670> overlapping<00:02:18.180> here<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.750> I'm<00:02:18.840> just

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
papers overlapping here so I'm just

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.660 
papers overlapping here so I'm just
gonna<00:02:19.140> carefully<00:02:19.530> remove<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.250> little<00:02:20.460> bit

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
gonna carefully remove this a little bit

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.330 
gonna carefully remove this a little bit
and<00:02:20.970> just<00:02:21.200> readjust<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.410> this<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.010> one<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.190> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
and just readjust and this is one of the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.890 
and just readjust and this is one of the
great<00:02:23.550> things<00:02:23.790> about<00:02:23.880> putting<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.450> adhesive

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
great things about putting the adhesive

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.870 
great things about putting the adhesive
in<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.140> two<00:02:25.290> places<00:02:25.770> because<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.580> gives<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.850> a

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
in the two places because it gives you a

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.430 
in the two places because it gives you a
little<00:02:27.060> bit<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.390> an<00:02:27.510> opportunity<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.200> move

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
little bit of an opportunity to move

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.810 
little bit of an opportunity to move
things<00:02:28.710> around<00:02:28.860> if<00:02:29.130> you're<00:02:29.220> not<00:02:29.370> liking<00:02:29.700> how

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
things around if you're not liking how

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.640 
things around if you're not liking how
they're<00:02:30.000> looking<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.990> I<00:02:31.020> think<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.290> like<00:02:31.380> that

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
they're looking so I think I like that

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.020 
they're looking so I think I like that
placement<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.130> little<00:02:32.340> bit<00:02:32.460> better<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:32.970> I'm

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
placement a little bit better so I'm

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.150 
placement a little bit better so I'm
just<00:02:33.180> gonna<00:02:33.300> continue<00:02:33.510> rolling<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.530> then<00:02:35.040> I'm

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
just gonna continue rolling and then I'm

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.740 
just gonna continue rolling and then I'm
just<00:02:35.310> gonna<00:02:35.460> press<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.790> down<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.630> can

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
just gonna press that down so you can

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.750 
just gonna press that down so you can
see<00:02:36.930> I've<00:02:37.020> got<00:02:37.170> these<00:02:37.290> really<00:02:37.500> too<00:02:37.800> cute<00:02:38.520> paper

see I've got these really too cute paper

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.980 
see I've got these really too cute paper
cones<00:02:39.060> ready<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.480> go<00:02:39.570> now

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
cones ready to go now

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.720 
cones ready to go now
so<00:02:40.260> I'm<00:02:40.320> gonna<00:02:40.440> continue<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.010> process<00:02:41.580> with

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
so I'm gonna continue that process with

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.200 
so I'm gonna continue that process with
the<00:02:41.760> rest<00:02:42.030> now<00:02:43.670> okay<00:02:44.670> now<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.090> you've

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.240 
the rest now okay now that you've
actually<00:02:45.540> folded<00:02:46.440> your<00:02:46.620> four<00:02:46.860> by<00:02:47.010> four

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
actually folded your four by four

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.520 
actually folded your four by four
squares<00:02:47.610> into<00:02:47.910> your<00:02:48.180> cones<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:49.020> get<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.320> place

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
squares into your cones you get to place

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.620 
squares into your cones you get to place
them<00:02:49.740> around<00:02:49.890> your<00:02:50.310> wire<00:02:50.490> wreath<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.060> check

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
them around your wire wreath and check

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.990 
them around your wire wreath and check
your<00:02:51.780> spacing<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.830> easiest<00:02:53.400> way<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.550> do<00:02:53.820> this

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
your spacing the easiest way to do this

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.420 
your spacing the easiest way to do this
on<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.720> wire<00:02:54.960> form<00:02:55.410> is<00:02:55.590> just<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.040> take<00:02:56.220> one<00:02:56.400> of

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
on the wire form is just to take one of

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.280 
on the wire form is just to take one of
your<00:02:56.580> paper<00:02:56.790> cones<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.360> just<00:02:57.690> place<00:02:58.020> it<00:02:58.050> on

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
your paper cones and just place it on

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.630 
your paper cones and just place it on
the<00:02:58.440> wreath<00:02:58.650> form<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.340> slightly

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
the wreath form so that it slightly

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.880 
the wreath form so that it slightly
overhangs<00:03:00.270> in<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.570> middle<00:03:00.810> then<00:03:01.470> just<00:03:01.710> take

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
overhangs in the middle then just take

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.680 
overhangs in the middle then just take
your<00:03:02.040> finger<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.370> just<00:03:02.580> pinch<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.120> bottom

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
your finger and just pinch that bottom

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.870 
your finger and just pinch that bottom
so<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.440> tucks<00:03:04.770> underneath<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.700> wreath

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
so that it tucks underneath the wreath

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.820 
so that it tucks underneath the wreath
form<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.690> create<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.050> little<00:03:07.230> bit<00:03:07.380> of<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.590> hook

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
form you create a little bit of a hook

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.860 
form you create a little bit of a hook
which<00:03:08.100> allows<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.880> cone<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.210> kind<00:03:09.420> of<00:03:09.540> stay<00:03:09.720> in

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
which allows the cone to kind of stay in

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.900 
which allows the cone to kind of stay in
place<00:03:10.140> so<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.830> can<00:03:11.040> check<00:03:11.220> your<00:03:11.280> spacing<00:03:11.820> and

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
place so you can check your spacing and

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.770 
place so you can check your spacing and
see<00:03:12.090> how<00:03:12.240> things<00:03:12.480> are<00:03:12.660> worked<00:03:12.870> out<00:03:14.570> now<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:15.750> I

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
see how things are worked out now that I

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.450 
see how things are worked out now that I
have<00:03:15.960> my<00:03:16.110> pattern<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:16.650> my<00:03:16.770> placement<00:03:17.040> all

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
have my pattern in my placement all

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.340 
have my pattern in my placement all
figured<00:03:17.880> out<00:03:18.000> it's<00:03:18.630> just<00:03:18.720> time<00:03:19.020> to<00:03:19.050> actually

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
figured out it's just time to actually

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.470 
figured out it's just time to actually
adhere<00:03:19.890> this<00:03:20.070> layer<00:03:20.370> onto<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.090> wreath<00:03:21.270> base

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
adhere this layer onto the wreath base

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.210 
adhere this layer onto the wreath base
so<00:03:22.110> all<00:03:22.230> you're<00:03:22.380> gonna<00:03:22.440> do<00:03:22.650> is<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:22.800> remove

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
so all you're gonna do is just remove

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.490 
so all you're gonna do is just remove
one<00:03:23.280> of<00:03:23.430> your<00:03:23.520> cones<00:03:23.880> just<00:03:24.540> flip<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:24.900> over<00:03:25.110> and

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
one of your cones just flip it over and

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.260 
one of your cones just flip it over and
write<00:03:25.770> in<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.160> hook<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:26.730> created<00:03:27.150> just

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
write in that hook that you created just

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.600 
write in that hook that you created just
place<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.540> small<00:03:27.900> bead<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.170> glue<00:03:28.490> just<00:03:29.490> like

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
place a small bead of glue just like

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.520 
place a small bead of glue just like
that<00:03:29.760> just<00:03:30.360> place<00:03:30.570> it<00:03:30.600> back<00:03:30.900> onto<00:03:31.110> your<00:03:31.260> wire

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
that just place it back onto your wire

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.010 
that just place it back onto your wire
frame<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.160> just<00:03:32.190> press<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:32.730> down<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.750> that<00:03:33.780> the

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
frame and just press it down so that the

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.660 
frame and just press it down so that the
glue<00:03:34.200> adheres<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.740> both<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:35.040> paper<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.520> the

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
of this top edge of the cone in place as

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.350 
of this top edge of the cone in place as
well<00:03:49.050> just<00:03:49.860> like<00:03:50.010> that<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:50.940> I'm<00:03:51.030> gonna<00:03:51.180> go

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
well just like that so I'm gonna go

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.730 
well just like that so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.780> I'm<00:03:51.870> just<00:03:52.020> gonna<00:03:52.140> continue<00:03:52.350> this

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
ahead and I'm just gonna continue this

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.380 
ahead and I'm just gonna continue this
process<00:03:53.190> with<00:03:53.340> all<00:03:53.550> of<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.820> cones<00:03:54.030> on<00:03:54.240> my

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
process with all of the cones on my

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.800 
process with all of the cones on my
wreath

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.589 

I<00:03:57.310> have<00:03:58.310> my<00:03:58.430> first<00:03:58.700> layer<00:03:58.880> of<00:03:58.970> cones<00:03:59.300> glued

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
I have my first layer of cones glued

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.240 
I have my first layer of cones glued
into<00:03:59.780> place<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:00.410> you<00:04:00.530> can<00:04:00.680> see<00:04:00.709> it's<00:04:00.950> actually

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
into place and you can see it's actually

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.830 
into place and you can see it's actually
quite<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.520> sturdy<00:04:01.819> structure<00:04:02.150> I<00:04:02.390> can<00:04:02.450> even

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
quite a sturdy structure I can even

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.540 
quite a sturdy structure I can even
actually<00:04:03.080> pick<00:04:03.500> it<00:04:03.620> up<00:04:03.709> by<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:03.920> cones<00:04:04.280> and

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
actually pick it up by the cones and

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.089 
actually pick it up by the cones and
things<00:04:04.790> stay<00:04:05.030> in<00:04:05.180> place<00:04:05.420> so<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.470> next<00:04:06.770> step

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
things stay in place so the next step

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:08.710 
things stay in place so the next step
are<00:04:07.310> actually<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.910> last<00:04:08.090> step<00:04:08.360> in<00:04:08.540> creating

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
are actually the last step in creating

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.540 
are actually the last step in creating
the<00:04:08.900> structure<00:04:09.230> is<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.680> take<00:04:09.860> your<00:04:09.980> 3<00:04:10.220> by<00:04:10.370> 3

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
the structure is to take your 3 by 3

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.180 
the structure is to take your 3 by 3
pieces<00:04:10.910> and<00:04:11.330> to<00:04:12.020> fold<00:04:12.260> those<00:04:12.410> into<00:04:12.739> cones<00:04:12.920> as

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
pieces and to fold those into cones as

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.280 
pieces and to fold those into cones as
well<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:13.640> then<00:04:14.060> all<00:04:14.300> you're<00:04:14.510> gonna<00:04:14.630> do<00:04:14.900> it<00:04:15.050> so

well and then all you're gonna do it so

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.960 
well and then all you're gonna do it so
easy<00:04:15.590> is<00:04:15.890> just<00:04:15.920> repeat<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:16.639> exact<00:04:16.940> same

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
easy is just repeat the exact same
