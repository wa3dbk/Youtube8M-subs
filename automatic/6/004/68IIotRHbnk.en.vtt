00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.489
 sharing experiences and helping a friend 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.940
 friend that allows us to progress 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:40.390
 faster for those who have not seen let's 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.860
 let's see the current absolute record 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:47.019
 planets performed by alexander puhovichi

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.920
 my questions 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.820
 and 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:58.569
 what exercises and principle classic 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.819
 dangerous nobody will hurt Alekhine 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:06.340
 gym t1000 range of repetitions there 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.649
 mega personal here already closer to 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.110
 competitive lane can work 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.480
 and on the strength of the force never prevented 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.580
 Respectively in the same work in Ponte 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.329
 if we have strong arms 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.000
 what will be there a series of back writing 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:24.329
 Here is a seizure of the product when 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.110
 no one get confused just a period 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.720
 steadfast and we can wore 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.380
 equip already competitive period 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.120
 month and a half since left before 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.120
 speed speed power what qualities 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.620
 yawn this year we are there to reach powerful 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.060
 elastic to exercise more 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.110
 will suit us the same marcin 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.110
 and dinner cultures 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.209
 principle neglected and impossible on 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:56.799
 initial there now they can constantly 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:03:01.209
 this should move 20 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.739
 repetitions in meat repeat for approaches 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.239
 and secrets are already a period of competition 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:09.819
 and this period qualify or 88 1080 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:14.379
 in principle there is much silumin 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:24.930
 process there to avoid injuries and in 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:32.190
 avoiding the big 50 already perfectly common 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:35.430
 survivability need to always contribute 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.750
 have an job while working stand 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.209
 soviet fighter mma in general especially

 great for yourself gives life in general 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:46.560
 stably working 12-20 reps 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.099
 because it is necessary to scatter greatness 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:54.609
 when heavy weights all science is not so 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:57.690
 came strong but when you make 11 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.690
 make three or four 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.680
 the speed of the forces and there it is important but not 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.680
 absolute strength 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.500
 this is brodsky 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.860
 which were people a big problem 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.640

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.880
 talked with the guys has you port 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.060
 better this kind of spam to find after 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.090
 some base a good base if that's it

 9090 is also a lot of time to pay. 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.910
 development of force therefore bureau those guys 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.880
 that interfere with just doing 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:53.100
 crossfit i read achieve results 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.780
 a lot of injuries the seas start on 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.880
 everything else is professionally built 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.620
 this is a lot of rising injuries 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.620
 body formed history 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.909
 not everyone can push treatment 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:06:11.379
 a set of exercises that and doing 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.460
 something yes you start gradually 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:14.740
