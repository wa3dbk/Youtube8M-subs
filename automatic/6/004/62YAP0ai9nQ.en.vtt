they realized that instead of making the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.809 
they realized that instead of making the
single<00:02:09.629> episode<00:02:10.700> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
the way that we demarcate this the story

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.149 
the way that we demarcate this the story
they<00:02:17.249> realized<00:02:17.730> it's<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.510> season<00:02:19.139> that<00:02:19.889> makes

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
they realized it's the season that makes

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.129 
they realized it's the season that makes
the<00:02:20.310> difference<00:02:20.489> we're<00:02:21.359> gonna<00:02:21.480> try<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.810> tell<00:02:22.109> a

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:22.139 
the difference we're gonna try to tell a

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
story over an entire season and so we

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.319 
story over an entire season and so we
had<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.980> introduction<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.609> these<00:02:26.730> serial

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
had the introduction of these serial

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.990 
had the introduction of these serial
shows<00:02:27.629> as<00:02:27.900> opposed<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.379> standalone<00:02:28.980> shows<00:02:29.310> it

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
shows as opposed to standalone shows it

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.890 
shows as opposed to standalone shows it
meant<00:02:30.329> that<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.659> scope<00:02:31.109> of<00:02:31.609> television

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
meant that the scope of television
