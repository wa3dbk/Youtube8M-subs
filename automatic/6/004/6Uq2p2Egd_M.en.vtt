lens flare but as I zoomed in I thought
it<00:02:06.479> was<00:02:06.659> too<00:02:06.840> bright<00:02:07.080> for<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.380> flare<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.800> its

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
it was too bright for a flare and its

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.150 
it was too bright for a flare and its
border<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.670> not<00:02:08.700> fuzzy<00:02:09.179> or<00:02:09.479> glared<00:02:09.869> out<00:02:10.160> also

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
photo to inverse as a negative the solid

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.500 
photo to inverse as a negative the solid
objects<00:02:23.130> would<00:02:23.370> appear<00:02:23.700> dark<00:02:24.030> while<00:02:24.269> and
