00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.470 
DJ mixer into inter speakers these ones
quite<00:02:32.220> close<00:02:32.460> but<00:02:32.670> sometimes<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.150> course<00:02:33.180> our

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
quite close but sometimes of course our

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.570 
quite close but sometimes of course our
speakers<00:02:33.900> are<00:02:33.930> much<00:02:34.350> further<00:02:34.560> away<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.190> I

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
speakers are much further away so I

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.370 
speakers are much further away so I
wanted<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.910> few<00:02:36.120> meters<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.630> cable<00:02:36.840> lengths<00:02:37.260> on

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
wanted a few meters of cable lengths on

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.070 
wanted a few meters of cable lengths on
these<00:02:37.670> but<00:02:38.670> also<00:02:38.790> for<00:02:39.180> plug-in<00:02:39.360> controllers

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
these but also for plug-in controllers

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.100 
these but also for plug-in controllers
into<00:02:40.350> our<00:02:40.830> into<00:02:41.760> our<00:02:41.880> system<00:02:42.240> here<00:02:42.390> as<00:02:42.600> well<00:02:42.810> to

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
into our into our system here as well to

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.050 
into our into our system here as well to
both<00:02:43.350> individuals<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.250> one<00:02:44.460> can<00:02:44.640> go<00:02:44.760> off<00:02:44.910> to

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
both individuals so one can go off to

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.360 
both individuals so one can go off to
each<00:02:45.210> speaker<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.020> these<00:02:46.830> are<00:02:47.130> slightly

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
each speaker and these are slightly

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.980 
each speaker and these are slightly
different<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:47.850> design<00:02:48.180> let<00:02:48.480> me<00:02:48.570> show<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.780> what

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
different in design let me show you what

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.780 
different in design let me show you what
he's<00:02:49.140> done<00:02:49.320> for<00:02:49.380> me<00:02:49.590> here<00:02:49.920> he's<00:02:50.490> given<00:02:50.760> me

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
he's done for me here he's given me

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.270 
he's done for me here he's given me
these<00:02:51.090> really<00:02:51.750> big<00:02:53.000> chunky<00:02:54.710> RCA<00:02:55.710> connectors

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
these really big chunky RCA connectors

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.110 
these really big chunky RCA connectors
gold-plated<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.600> these<00:02:57.840> ones<00:02:58.080> quite<00:02:58.350> nicely

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120

gold-plated and these ones quite nicely
tighten<00:03:00.120> up<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.680> loosen<00:03:01.940> onto<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.060> pole<00:03:03.270> that

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
tighten up and loosen onto the pole that

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.480 
tighten up and loosen onto the pole that
you<00:03:03.510> push<00:03:03.750> them<00:03:03.930> onto<00:03:04.080> so<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.010> can<00:03:05.130> get<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.280> nice

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
you push them onto so you can get a nice

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.680 
you push them onto so you can get a nice
tight<00:03:05.790> fit<00:03:05.820> so<00:03:06.090> where<00:03:06.300> should<00:03:06.360> we<00:03:06.480> going<00:03:06.630> to

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
tight fit so where should we going to

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
tight fit so where should we going to
put<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.840> back<00:03:06.960> of<00:03:07.080> your<00:03:07.170> mixer<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.620> got

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
put the back of your mixer and you got

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.840 
put the back of your mixer and you got
to<00:03:07.800> leave<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.010> there<00:03:08.100> for<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.280> couple<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.580> months

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
to leave it there for a couple of months

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.370

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
in and in and out around the back you

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.010 
in and in and out around the back you
want<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:11.910> make<00:03:12.030> sure<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.330> these<00:03:12.480> get<00:03:12.660> really

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
want to make sure that these get really

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.920

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
took them apart to check because I'm

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.310 
took them apart to check because I'm
probably<00:03:17.460> as<00:03:17.700> geeky<00:03:17.880> as<00:03:18.090> he<00:03:18.300> is<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:19.080> he's<00:03:19.170> done
