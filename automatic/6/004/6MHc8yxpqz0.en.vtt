00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.309
 hello girls steals is how are you today 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.949
 gm 2 sweat quillo and we are here in the 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.400
 low cost gaming pc budget of 400 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:23.349
 euros the budget is 400 euros 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.310
 400 gold coins from the world of warcraft 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.660
 400 pesos 400 what you take away and good 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.609
 you know that water starts components 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.529
 because the page that I use I'm not 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.940
 forcing you to buy this page for 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.860
 many people who come saying yes 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.629
 you buy where you want below 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.670
 description you ask for the links to see the 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.010
 products and good let's start in 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.129
 this case the lunar base plate lesson 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.750
 980 that format at &amp; t x is worth a 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.769
 good plate good for the price for the 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.530
 budget that we are having in this 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.869
 case and good as you can see then good 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.280
 your pc and all the slots good the truth 

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:57.869
 which is great for the price it has 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.549
 of processor chosen one of fx series 

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:02.769
 6.300 to 3.5 gigahertz 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:06.100
 talking about 6 French 6-core 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.680
 Sorry physicists worth working at 3.5 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.400
 each hard drive I choose the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.650
 zeitgeist bakur at 7200 point 12 and a half 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.000
 terabytes more than enough with the 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.320
 spaces you know we can expand 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.290
 in the future with 12 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.240
 a ssd that is highly recommended of the 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.810
 computers since it is very demanding now 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.340
 same and good let's move on to the next one 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.900
 would be the graphics card in this case is 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.300
 an asus radeon hd 7.750 of a giga 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.890
 gddr5 is a graph for good more than 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.050
 nothing support to play the games 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.280
 so to speak from low to medium is not 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.869
 a graphic that goes a long way 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.910
 performance we are talking about under 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.040
 medium and low order of nexcen 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.720
 course those of the current generation the 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.250
 poor in good middle that we will already have 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.660
 have to look at why according to the optimization 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.580
 of each game has the best one 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.440
 know by heart they have chosen a skin already 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.030
 you know that I love that brand is what 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.950
 better is a little fanboy on my part 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.600
 but it's what's in that after 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.930
 try many brands is the one that most 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.119
 convinced 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.520
 are ddr3 to 1600 4gb in two slots in two 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.260
 forgiveness modules of 2 gigas each and 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.960
 good is enough for a 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.550
 low cost gaming budget voucher 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.080
 electrons someone the most dirty the most 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.250
 cheap the one that everyone discards that 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.830
 we have to the garbage to which nobody 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.069
 he wants what is there is he is the one 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.439
 mosley 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.469
 the stake box of a night cycle that 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.819
 It is worth having a great flow but 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:32.909
 remember that this is a budget that 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.549
 I cut it from the budget 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.109
 we have to throw at the cheapest as 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:39.389
 accessible is not worth it is a house 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:41.040
 I bought precisely but good 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:43.200
 the function we need is not done 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.850
 because it's not a bad house inside what 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.680
 it fits 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.930
 and good for this price outside the 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.150
 true that there is nothing better in the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.980
 cooling of the microprocessor in 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.420
 this case in this proposal that crazy me 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.450
 If you want to say or put it, it's worth 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.240
 colors master hyper tx3 wow for 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.090
 refrigerate to cool forgiveness to cool 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.860
 cool our processor and that the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.130
 temperatures are not so high as to 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.840
 to say is a bit bad 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.030
 and finally the power supply 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.920
 that is a cooler master t 1500 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.950
 enough for what we are riding 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.480
 the computer and good little more than talking 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.710
 of this power supply so 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:26.500
 well now I will give the price 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:29.210
 which is that it goes to 409 with 80 cents 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.160
 guys so well I hope you have 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.330
 liked to make like favorites and up 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.870
 chao chao dishes 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.870
 trini 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.709
