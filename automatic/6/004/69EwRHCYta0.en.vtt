00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
enough yes and I think that's just the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.580 
enough yes and I think that's just the
nature<00:02:20.350> of<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.530> show<00:02:20.710> I<00:02:20.740> mean<00:02:21.010> if<00:02:21.160> there<00:02:21.280> was

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
nature of the show I mean if there was

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.990 
nature of the show I mean if there was
you<00:02:23.590> know<00:02:23.620> it's<00:02:23.920> it's<00:02:24.220> it's<00:02:24.640> one<00:02:24.850> of<00:02:24.940> these

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
you know it's it's it's one of these

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.120 
you know it's it's it's one of these
things<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.540> because<00:02:26.230> we're<00:02:26.500> not<00:02:26.680> really

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
things that because we're not really

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.600 
things that because we're not really
bound<00:02:27.550> by<00:02:27.940> reality<00:02:28.480> we<00:02:28.720> can<00:02:28.900> kind<00:02:29.110> of<00:02:29.430> we<00:02:30.430> can

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:10.529 
that they're taking in a direction that

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:13.159 
that they're taking in a direction that
is<00:05:10.889> right<00:05:11.699> for<00:05:11.729> a<00:05:12.060> whole<00:05:12.210> new<00:05:12.419> field<00:05:12.810> of
