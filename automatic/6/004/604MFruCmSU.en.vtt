Paul<00:01:57.509> evany<00:01:58.509> I<00:01:58.539> think<00:01:58.929> it's<00:01:59.170> a<00:01:59.320> swirl<00:01:59.649> remover

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
Paul evany I think it's a swirl remover

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.719 
Paul evany I think it's a swirl remover
anyway<00:02:01.030> it's<00:02:01.179> just<00:02:01.210> a<00:02:01.359> real<00:02:01.539> fine<00:02:01.869> polish<00:02:02.729> so

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
anyway it's just a real fine polish so

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.609 
anyway it's just a real fine polish so
I'll<00:02:03.969> do<00:02:04.119> it<00:02:04.240> by<00:02:04.329> him<00:02:04.569> you<00:02:04.960> don't<00:02:05.170> want<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.469> do

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
I'll do it by him you don't want to do

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.330 
I'll do it by him you don't want to do
this<00:02:05.770> with<00:02:06.640> a<00:02:06.960> machine<00:02:08.069> unless<00:02:09.069> you<00:02:09.250> know

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
this with a machine unless you know

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.800 
this with a machine unless you know
exactly<00:02:09.610> what<00:02:09.879> you're<00:02:09.970> doing<00:02:10.209> because<00:02:10.300> the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
exactly what you're doing because the

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.869 
exactly what you're doing because the
machine<00:02:11.140> heats<00:02:11.349> the<00:02:11.590> paint<00:02:11.800> up<00:02:11.950> if<00:02:12.519> you<00:02:12.640> heat

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
machine heats the paint up if you heat

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.759 
machine heats the paint up if you heat
it<00:02:12.910> up<00:02:13.090> you'll<00:02:13.299> burn<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.690> if<00:02:14.379> you<00:02:14.530> hit<00:02:14.650> these

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
it up you'll burn it if you hit these

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.500 
it up you'll burn it if you hit these
edges<00:02:15.129> you'll<00:02:15.280> go<00:02:15.370> right<00:02:15.549> on<00:02:15.670> through<00:02:15.700> these

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
edges you'll go right on through these

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.390 
edges you'll go right on through these
edges<00:02:16.870> are<00:02:16.900> very<00:02:17.260> very<00:02:17.530> thin<00:02:17.799> coated<00:02:18.250> with

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
edges are very very thin coated with

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.130 
edges are very very thin coated with
paint<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.910> really<00:02:19.390> don't<00:02:19.569> even<00:02:19.629> need<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:19.989> hit

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
paint you really don't even need to hit

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.920 
paint you really don't even need to hit
them<00:02:20.230> but<00:02:20.440> once<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.769> do<00:02:20.920> hit<00:02:21.069> them<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.750> you

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
them but once you do hit them and you

ten<00:02:44.829> minutes<00:02:45.129> between<00:02:45.280> each<00:02:45.459> coat<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.030> then

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
ten minutes between each coat and then

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.420 
ten minutes between each coat and then
let<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.049> sit<00:02:47.200> overnight<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.739> I'll<00:02:47.980> sand<00:02:48.250> it

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.559 
let it sit overnight and I'll sand it
with<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.840> 1500<00:02:49.840> again<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:52.090> when<00:02:52.209> I'm<00:02:52.329> sure

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
with the 1500 again and when I'm sure

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.789 
with the 1500 again and when I'm sure
that<00:02:52.599> that's<00:02:53.140> what<00:02:53.500> I<00:02:53.530> want<00:02:53.799> it<00:02:55.680> then<00:02:56.680> I'll

that that's what I want it then I'll
give<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.040> another<00:02:57.360> two<00:02:58.360> coats<00:02:58.660> or<00:02:59.230> three<00:02:59.590> coats

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
give it another two coats or three coats

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.330

for its final finished coat and I'll

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.770 
for its final finished coat and I'll
sand<00:03:06.639> it<00:03:06.790> perfectly<00:03:07.180> smooth<00:03:07.829> with<00:03:08.829> mm<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:10.720> the

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
sand it perfectly smooth with mm and the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.509 
sand it perfectly smooth with mm and the
reason<00:03:11.019> we<00:03:11.109> use<00:03:11.139> mm<00:03:11.859> it's<00:03:11.950> just<00:03:12.010> easier<00:03:12.489> to

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
reason we use mm it's just easier to

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.059 
reason we use mm it's just easier to
polish<00:03:12.970> if<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:13.630> do<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.810> by<00:03:13.930> hand<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.799> finer

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
polish if you do it by hand the finer

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.009 
polish if you do it by hand the finer
the<00:03:15.310> sandpaper<00:03:15.900> easier<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:17.019> is<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:17.109> polish

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
the sandpaper easier it is to polish

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.339 
the sandpaper easier it is to polish
okay<00:03:20.019> I<00:03:20.049> got<00:03:20.319> a<00:03:20.349> Karl<00:03:20.650> guy<00:03:20.829> named<00:03:21.040> Tom<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:22.060> think
