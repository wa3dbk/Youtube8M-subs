00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
and what this does that really

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.200 
and what this does that really
encourages<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.120> horse<00:00:12.389> if<00:00:12.660> he<00:00:13.259> thinks<00:00:13.650> he<00:00:13.799> can

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.210 
encourages the horse if he thinks he can
