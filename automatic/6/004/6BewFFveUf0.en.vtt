there's<00:01:05.400> been<00:01:05.519> nothing<00:01:05.640> confirmed<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.540> far

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
there's been nothing confirmed so far

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.240 
there's been nothing confirmed so far
however<00:01:07.439> I've<00:01:07.590> had<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> look<00:01:07.950> at<00:01:08.100> some

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
however I've had a look at some

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.429 
however I've had a look at some
screenshots<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.360> shown<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.750> RPG<00:01:10.350> of

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
screenshots and it's shown at the RPG of

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.320 
screenshots and it's shown at the RPG of
the<00:01:10.560> rocket<00:01:10.860> launcher<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.369> required<00:01:11.970> at<00:01:12.119> level

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the rocket launcher is required at level

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.940 
the rocket launcher is required at level
80<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:12.960> appears<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.500> highest<00:01:13.770> rank

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
80 so it appears that the highest rank

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.859 
80 so it appears that the highest rank
has<00:01:14.070> been<00:01:14.220> increased<00:01:14.580> from<00:01:14.820> 70<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.720> one

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
warfare two up until 80 which is crazy I

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.149 
warfare two up until 80 which is crazy I
guess<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.020> want<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.259> try<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.560> prolong<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.009> life

prestiges<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.899> personally<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.590> think<00:01:46.619> 15<00:01:46.920> is

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
prestiges and personally I think 15 is

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.859 
prestiges and personally I think 15 is
quite<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> nice<00:01:47.610> number<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.240> only<00:01:48.420> ever<00:01:48.570> hit

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
quite a nice number I only ever hit

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.609 
quite a nice number I only ever hit
around<00:01:49.170> 45<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.159> black<00:01:50.340> ops<00:01:50.579> 1<00:01:50.990> warfare<00:01:51.990> two<00:01:52.259> and

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
around 45 on black ops 1 warfare two and

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.620 
around 45 on black ops 1 warfare two and
those<00:01:53.130> ability<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.610> hack<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> prestige

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
those ability to hack to a prestige

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.539 
those ability to hack to a prestige
that's<00:01:54.960> kind<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.259> irrelevant<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.100> think<00:01:56.340> 15

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
that's kind of irrelevant but I think 15

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.730 
that's kind of irrelevant but I think 15
