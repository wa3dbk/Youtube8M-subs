teams<00:01:35.790> from<00:01:36.000> players<00:01:36.570> from<00:01:36.720> all<00:01:36.930> different

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
teams from players from all different

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.350 
teams from players from all different
companies<00:01:37.920> all<00:01:38.130> different<00:01:38.520> universities<00:01:39.180> all

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
companies all different universities all

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.700 
companies all different universities all
different<00:01:39.720> thoughts<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.170> how<00:01:40.320> they<00:01:40.470> want<00:01:40.650> to

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
different thoughts of how they want to

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.920 
different thoughts of how they want to
play<00:01:40.920> all<00:01:41.100> different<00:01:41.250> fitness<00:01:41.820> levels<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
play all different fitness levels so the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.969 
play all different fitness levels so the
thing<00:01:43.110> we've<00:01:43.229> been<00:01:43.380> working<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.890> just

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
thing we've been working on is just

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.069 
thing we've been working on is just
trying<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.460> discover<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.149> way<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.840> know<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
trying to discover one way you know the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.780 
trying to discover one way you know the
way<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.409> we<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.710> win<00:01:46.860> at<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.100> top<00:01:47.310> level<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
way that we can win at the top level and

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.789 
way that we can win at the top level and
so<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.930> itself<00:01:48.960> spring<00:01:49.560> quite

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
so that in itself spring quite

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.069 
so that in itself spring quite
challenging<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.520> what<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.390> Japanese<00:01:51.840> way

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
challenging so what is the Japanese way

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.620 
challenging so what is the Japanese way
well<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.549> know<00:01:53.640> if<00:01:53.729> we<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.060> involved<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.540> an

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
well you know if we get involved in an

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.480 
well you know if we get involved in an
amorous<00:01:54.780> or<00:01:55.140> gonna<00:01:55.320> lose<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.860> we've<00:01:56.009> got<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.189> use

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
amorous or gonna lose so we've got a use

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.819 
amorous or gonna lose so we've got a use
skill<00:01:57.000> we've<00:01:57.630> got<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.960> be<00:01:58.170> fitter<00:01:58.500> than<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
skill we've got to be fitter than the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.080 
skill we've got to be fitter than the
other<00:01:58.979> side's

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
other side's

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.450 
other side's
we're<00:02:00.540> gonna<00:02:00.689> be<00:02:00.840> tactically<00:02:01.469> smart<00:02:01.979> and

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
we're gonna be tactically smart and

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.859 
we're gonna be tactically smart and
we've<00:02:02.640> got<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:02.909> able<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.090> play<00:02:03.329> with<00:02:03.570> speed

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
we've got to be able to play with speed

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.450 
we've got to be able to play with speed
so<00:02:04.140> they're<00:02:04.320> all<00:02:04.530> things<00:02:04.829> we're<00:02:05.040> looking<00:02:05.159> at

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
so they're all things we're looking at

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.190 
so they're all things we're looking at
and<00:02:05.640> we're<00:02:06.119> gonna<00:02:06.210> find<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.540> competitive<00:02:06.840> edge

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and we're gonna find a competitive edge

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.199 
and we're gonna find a competitive edge
you<00:02:07.469> know<00:02:08.069> that's<00:02:08.310> that's<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.849> main<00:02:08.970> thing

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
you know that's that's the main thing

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.339 
you know that's that's the main thing
we've<00:02:09.330> got<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.450> find<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.780> way<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:10.140> we're

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
we've got to find a way that we're

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.360 
we've got to find a way that we're
better<00:02:10.590> than<00:02:10.679> any<00:02:10.950> other

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
better than any other

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.430 
better than any other
in<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.700> world<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:12.000> playing<00:02:12.269> rugby<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:13.319> know<00:02:13.409> I

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
in the world of playing rugby you know I

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.199 
in the world of playing rugby you know I
think<00:02:13.650> it's<00:02:13.920> true<00:02:14.280> attacking<00:02:14.819> him<00:02:14.940> through

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
think it's true attacking him through

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.210 
think it's true attacking him through
ball<00:02:15.420> movement<00:02:15.690> yeah<00:02:16.319> for<00:02:16.590> us<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.890> think<00:02:16.920> we've

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
ball movement yeah for us I think we've

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.770 
ball movement yeah for us I think we've
got<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.340> skort<00:02:17.640> right<00:02:17.879> we're<00:02:18.150> gonna<00:02:18.269> try<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.540> be

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
got a skort right we're gonna try to be

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.420 
got a skort right we're gonna try to be
at<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.080> best<00:02:19.260> attacking<00:02:19.620> team<00:02:19.950> in<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.220> world

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
at the best attacking team in the world

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.369 
at the best attacking team in the world
you<00:02:20.670> know<00:02:20.760> every<00:02:21.120> team<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:22.110> wins

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
you know every team that that wins

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.050 
you know every team that that wins
consistently<00:02:23.099> in<00:02:23.159> the<00:02:23.250> world<00:02:23.430> has<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.670> very

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
consistently in the world has a very

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.479 
consistently in the world has a very
strong<00:02:24.510> style<00:02:25.019> they<00:02:25.260> play<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.769> that's<00:02:26.310> the

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
strong style they play and that's the

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.610 
strong style they play and that's the
style<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.879> think<00:02:26.909> suits<00:02:27.420> Japan<00:02:27.870> then<00:02:28.319> we've<00:02:28.470> got

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
style I think suits Japan then we've got

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.839 
style I think suits Japan then we've got
to<00:02:28.709> have<00:02:28.860> everything<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.640> country

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
to have everything in the country

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.199 
to have everything in the country
cohesive<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.930> achieve<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:31.860> kids<00:02:32.760> between

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
cohesive to achieve that so kids between

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.720 
cohesive to achieve that so kids between
the<00:02:33.299> third<00:02:33.540> age<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.200> 30<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.680> they<00:02:34.829> then<00:02:35.129> must

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
the third age of 30 and they then must

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.330 
the third age of 30 and they then must
have<00:02:36.000> fantastic<00:02:36.450> ball<00:02:36.930> skills<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.530> then<00:02:38.159> they

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
have fantastic ball skills and then they

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.280 
have fantastic ball skills and then they
must<00:02:38.640> have<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.940> high<00:02:39.150> level<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.569> fitness<00:02:39.750> and

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
must have a high level of fitness and

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.050 
must have a high level of fitness and
then<00:02:40.560> we've<00:02:40.680> got<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.920> maximize<00:02:41.370> themselves<00:02:41.940> in

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
then we've got to maximize themselves in

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.849 
then we've got to maximize themselves in
terms<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.720> their<00:02:42.780> physical<00:02:42.989> capacity<00:02:43.680> just

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
terms of their physical capacity just

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.369 
terms of their physical capacity just
like<00:02:44.040> Spain<00:02:44.819> doesn't<00:02:45.120> soccer<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:46.140> know<00:02:46.230> all

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
like Spain doesn't soccer you know all

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.839 
like Spain doesn't soccer you know all
the<00:02:46.620> great<00:02:46.739> countries<00:02:47.250> in<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.489> world<00:02:47.640> that

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
the great countries in the world that

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.699 
the great countries in the world that
aren't<00:02:48.030> physically<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.810> best<00:02:49.019> they<00:02:49.500> have<00:02:49.680> a

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
aren't physically the best they have a

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.050 
aren't physically the best they have a
way<00:02:49.950> of<00:02:49.980> playing<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.489> game<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.849> that's<00:02:50.940> what

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
way of playing the game and that's what

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.729 
way of playing the game and that's what
we've<00:02:51.299> got<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.450> have<00:02:51.629> in<00:02:51.750> Japan<00:02:51.870> Eddy<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.530> guess

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
we've got to have in Japan Eddy I guess

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.500 
we've got to have in Japan Eddy I guess
there's<00:02:52.920> some<00:02:53.099> similarities<00:02:53.730> with<00:02:53.760> Australia
