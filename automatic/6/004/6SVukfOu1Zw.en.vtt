00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.220
 There are certain laws in the world we live in. 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.640
 When the sun goes down, 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.640
 Yen sky Stars sparkling yimina 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.740
 Earth and the planets to continue in the revolution and rotation at regular intervals 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:41.640
 Water flows from the top down and trust 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.640
 Go to the sea â€‹â€‹as the water is caught. 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:52.920
 After the cold winter, be sure to have flowers in Spring 2nd class 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:03.950
 The mystery of nature is wonderful. 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.070
 There is a spiritual rule between God and man who made the world come 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.070
 There is 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.150
 God loves you and has a wonderful plan for you 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.020
 U 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.470
 But why many people do not know God's love and plan ? 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:41.100
 We fall from God because we fall into the sins of men. 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.100
 That's why I can not know God's love and plan . 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.920
 Originally, people were connected with God 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:57.470
 But because a man intended to live his own way 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.470
 Finally , fellowship with God was cut off. 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:07.170
 Rebellion and interest in God 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:14.390
 This is evidence of sin in the Bible . 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.390
 Sin has created a huge gap between us and God . 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:26.240
 People are constantly at the forefront of religious 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:32.770
 I try to reach God with my own power, such as philosophical beliefs. 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.770
 But the only way to bridge this gap is through Jesus Christ 2 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.350
 O Jesus Christ is the only God who can solve man's sin 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.350
 Is the way 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:51.650
 God on our behalf by sending his Son, Jesus Christ, into the world 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:56.170
 To die on the cross 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.170
 Instead chirwo was the price of our sins 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.810
 And Jesus rose again as the Bible promised 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.770
 This is how much we love God. 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.790
 But knowing these three messages is not enough 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:28.730
 We personally right deulyeoya Jesus as my Savior and my God 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.700
 I will 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:39.320
 Then you can experience God's love and plan 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:44.360
 We can receive Jesus at their own invitation 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:46.640
 Jesus is knocking on the door, our hearts are all . 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.210
 When I hear the voice and open the door 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.210
 We can begin fellowship with Jesus 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.210
 U 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.460

 Jesus has changed my life . 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:17.120
 I often fall into frustration and confusion because God determines everything I have to bear 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.209
 Jesus Christ is my master. 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:26.090
 Christ is sitting at the center of my life 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:30.740
 I came down from the center of my life and left everything to Christ 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.720
 By Christ's decision to do all things, the unity of God's plan

 God knows our hearts.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:40.340
 I will.
