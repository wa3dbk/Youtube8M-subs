 We continue to review and on minifigurkam and 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.599
 Today we have another batch of military 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.400
 minifigures from the company on the deck of the game 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:20.000
 modern warfare or modern war 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.980
 4 mini figures of soldiers it looks like it is Russian 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.199
 army army of russia 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.829
 let's collect and see what 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.829

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.000
 Here also gathered on 4 minifigurki 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.980
 probably hurried said that this army 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.480
 Russia because there is no 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.500
 unmarked not 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.770
 but nevertheless there are Russian weapons 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.680
 production you Kalashnikov I see 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.009
 and rifles look like through but I don't know 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.680
 how exactly is it called but generally 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.340
 if you have any doubts or 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.700
 write your opinion with comments 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.649
 each figure to show such a bulletproof vest I 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.020
 Ukraine began to wear to consider 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.259
 better certain hero figures 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.649
 furco is like some kind of attack aircraft 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:41.750
 him so powerful paint with glasses glasses 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:43.220
 recline the streets of glass glass on 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.680
 leans up that is possible 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.610
 consider his huge face mask 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.100
 neither does it move in his hands either 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.560
 sniper steel machine gun but more similar 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.600
 on the sniper and thought something Russian 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.930
 production write comments that 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.570
 think on the body of vani and prints everywhere 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:08.679
 back leg on the hands including 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.429
 and on the sides everywhere but the quality of prints is up 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.040
 so far wearable 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.810
 but as if not very good photo hands 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.480
 everything is fine and here is fuck 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.790
 strange and unusual not like always 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.739
 do and also show with him 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:29.920
 words like a rifle silencer machine and 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.920
 your knife legs usually 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:38.220
 so the next figure is also an attack aircraft with 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.560
 Kalashnikov automatic again 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.670
 akarin knife him 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.000
 body print also individually with 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.730
 their business designs to look 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.120
 some of its casco elements such 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.299
 unusual interesting omission candle y 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.970
 This pointer also did not miss here without 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:04.560
 heat print on his face one behind 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.310
 some stuff is not clear also 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.870
 him 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:16.139
 hand machine too, but as a stun 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:18.810
 light gun and body armor 100 years 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:21.409
 pretty detailed on the tablet 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.409
 usual 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.040
 next it is men sniper 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.670
 masked episheva not resolved too 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.280
 I meet for the first time such companies 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.920
 of interest may be some 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.260
 homemade bypass and hood and hands 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.380
 his rifle is very detailed then 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.900
 There are various items to watch. 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.170
 very cool made such a weapon me too 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.170
 I have never met on strong at the printer 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.760
 He as well as top made of 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.130
 his visual sketches drawing from him 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.680
 your a particular 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:06.500
 masking such a sniper after that shuria 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:11.060
 body armor black goes and legs legs and 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:14.800
 the gun is also worth detailing 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.340
 excellent next and last figure 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.519
 similar 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.410
 wife with such a communication device with 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.350
 headphones on the background 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.870
 what kind of back device can the engineers 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.550
 trace 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:34.100
 hand me the gun Kalashnikov machine 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.639
 matter is also here where there is even armor 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:43.190
 not a real bulletproof vest yet another light 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:47.000
 automatic but he resembles a rubber such 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.940
 simple and new that the figures from big y 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.360
 I was pleased was not that they have 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.490
 its weapon which is quite unique 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.210
 rarely such one can be met this will allow 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.250
 these rifles and Kalashnikovs 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.340
 also interesting prints and from the hood 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:07.040
 This mini figure is very cool but 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.650
 there is a minus in their body prints 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.200
 they are somehow not very good 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.940
 the quality of that or any pact made it 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.090
 technology friend on his 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.460
 Well, in general, like this, well, so Du ul make themselves 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.460
 more or less such nice figures and 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.220
 so 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.949
 I recommend that you take it was the channel 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.490
 my toys, see these figures on 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:31.560
 brie channel which is from 1600 degrees 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.460
 Like put all necessary support 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.460
 bye and see you
