00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
it's a dremel multi-max

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.640 
it's a dremel multi-max
now<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:25.000> vise<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:27.189> can<00:00:27.750> mount<00:00:28.750> it<00:00:28.960> I'm<00:00:29.470> going

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
now this vise you can mount it I'm going

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.400 
now this vise you can mount it I'm going
to<00:00:29.710> be<00:00:29.770> mounting<00:00:30.070> it<00:00:30.099> to<00:00:30.220> this<00:00:30.340> table<00:00:31.110> the<00:00:32.110> jaws

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
to be mounting it to this table the jaws

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.200 
to be mounting it to this table the jaws
two<00:00:32.920> and<00:00:33.130> a<00:00:33.160> half<00:00:33.399> inches<00:00:33.700> I<00:00:33.850> think<00:00:33.880> some

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
two and a half inches I think some

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:41.190 
two and a half inches I think some
maximum<00:00:36.510> it's<00:00:37.510> can<00:00:38.260> rotate<00:00:38.500> 360<00:00:39.370> degrees<00:00:40.200> it

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
maximum it's can rotate 360 degrees it

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.439 
maximum it's can rotate 360 degrees it
can<00:00:41.260> tilt<00:00:41.710> to<00:00:42.070> about<00:00:42.399> fifty<00:00:42.760> degrees<00:00:42.850> I<00:00:43.269> think

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
can tilt to about fifty degrees I think

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:44.810 
can tilt to about fifty degrees I think
so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
so

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.799
