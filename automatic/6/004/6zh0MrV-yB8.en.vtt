00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.470
 did not vote by parliament it is missing 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.240
 Something 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.429
 agree in one thing it's easter in 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.179
 reaction the president came in I you 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.860
 we say you are not able 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.360
 to say it when we have these elections 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.780
 can you say that if the elections 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.930
 do not take place by the 12th what will 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.460
 us on January 12, 2015 what will we 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.949
 bring about a malfunction of the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.660
 the chamber of parliament 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.090
 Article 36 of the Constitution provides 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.340
 that the president has guarantors of the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.230
 good expression it's exciting it's 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.540
 party as uses when everything works 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.550
 today the institutions in place 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.620
 it's up to the institutions to do their 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.450
 job is not the ex team that you 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.890
 dragging in fact you're waiting 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.309
 to get to this point where you can 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.730
 in fact encircling by decree if the junta 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.949
 unlock the institution knows it the vine 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.610
 is setup 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:58.079
 the executive has nothing to see but two 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.210
 20 years is promised when the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.890
 to this electoral concern which is the law 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.359
 elections and that do not exist 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.129
 besides the proof that I will go 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.830
 in elections is that once there 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.030
 sees a malfunction my first 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.439
 decision on convening the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.820
 elections so you 're already waiting 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.070
 to get to the malfunctions you 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.350
 already know that your guests 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.479
 I may be at my fourth 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.590
 dialogue with all sectors of the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.240
 national life dialogue true dialogue 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.229
 true dialogue besides the proof one 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.130
 asked me for an opening government 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.759
 I sent the ministries I opened to 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.159
 opposition 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.500
 I am each time new tomorrow 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.700
 advice I've been doing since I love it 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.299
 TV you said if elections 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.310
 do not take place 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.220
 I can not help it as president 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.850
 and when the time if I would organize 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.829
 we are in crisis 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.810
 I do not have anything right now by the 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.549
 law a power not come back it's from 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.229
 force the parliament voted 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.030
 besides, what I can not 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.649
 understand that they did not vote 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.290
 no to the electoral law they do not hold 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.820
 no session so that tells you everything 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.530
 just that it's a blocking idea 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.560
 from them it's not an idea to 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.969
 not that it was and a coincidence that we are going 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.979
 not do constitutional law but 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.190
 there are street demonstrations telling you 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.050
 deep down it's not my fault we 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.380
 there are demonstrations that challenges 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.340
 this situation you say I have the ball 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.230
 is not in my camp what to play 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.560
 protesters even come out the cardboard 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.240
 red 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.240
 I will simply say that 1
