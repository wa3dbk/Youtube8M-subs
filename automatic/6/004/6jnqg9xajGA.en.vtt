my algebra techs and they're based on
two<00:00:29.220> observations<00:00:29.730> I've<00:00:30.420> made<00:00:30.840> during<00:00:31.140> my

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
two observations I've made during my

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.270 
two observations I've made during my
career<00:00:31.880> one<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.690> every<00:00:34.140> student<00:00:34.200> has<00:00:34.920> a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
career one is that every student has a

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.660 
career one is that every student has a
teachable<00:00:36.059> moment<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:37.020> moment<00:00:37.530> when<00:00:38.010> he<00:00:38.340> or

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
teachable moment that moment when he or

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.450 
teachable moment that moment when he or
she<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.270> ready<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.780> learn<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:41.160> want<00:00:41.370> to

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
she is ready to learn and we want to

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.970 
she is ready to learn and we want to
have<00:00:41.640> material<00:00:42.210> available<00:00:43.050> when<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.680> moment

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
have material available when that moment

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.600 
have material available when that moment
arrives<00:00:44.930> another<00:00:45.930> observation<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.219> when

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
arrives another observation is that when

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.700 
arrives another observation is that when
I've<00:00:47.730> asked<00:00:48.180> my<00:00:48.329> students<00:00:48.899> if<00:00:49.170> they<00:00:49.379> want<00:00:49.559> more

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
I've asked my students if they want more

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.459 
I've asked my students if they want more
homework<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.640> answer<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.210> no<00:00:51.510> but<00:00:52.170> when<00:00:52.350> I've

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
homework the answer is no but when I've

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.900 
homework the answer is no but when I've
asked<00:00:52.739> my<00:00:52.860> students<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.370> they<00:00:53.579> want<00:00:53.820> a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
asked my students that they want a

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.849 
asked my students that they want a
practice<00:00:54.600> test<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.620> answer<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.250> always<00:00:56.910> yes

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
practice test the answer is always yes

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.459 
practice test the answer is always yes
so<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:59.100> let's<00:00:59.430> take<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.640> closer<00:01:00.120> look<00:01:00.359> at<00:01:00.870> how

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
so now let's take a closer look at how

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.880 
so now let's take a closer look at how
these<00:01:01.710> apps<00:01:02.070> work<00:01:02.780> with<00:01:03.780> each<00:01:03.930> algebra<00:01:04.589> prep

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
these apps work with each algebra prep

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.090 
these apps work with each algebra prep
app<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.909> choose<00:01:06.299> from<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.810> practice<00:01:07.380> test<00:01:07.710> or<00:01:08.040> a

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
look at how that works the many tests

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.040 
look at how that works the many tests
are<00:02:39.100> designed<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.700> take<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.150> 10<00:02:40.450> minutes<00:02:40.660> or

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
are designed to take you 10 minutes or

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.350 
are designed to take you 10 minutes or
less<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.410> complete<00:02:42.100> they<00:02:42.820> will<00:02:43.030> give<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.330> a

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
reviewed on the practice tests so you

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.090 
reviewed on the practice tests so you
can<00:02:49.390> build<00:02:49.630> your<00:02:49.870> skills<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.770> confidence
