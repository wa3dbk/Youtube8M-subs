00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
the series and I really didn't know that

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.689 
the series and I really didn't know that
at<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.370> time<00:03:36.549> and<00:03:36.900> maybe<00:03:38.160> she<00:03:39.160> takes<00:03:39.430> for

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
at the time and maybe she takes for

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.089 
at the time and maybe she takes for
granted<00:03:40.030> that<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.810> have<00:03:40.989> read<00:03:41.349> the<00:03:41.949> other

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099

parts<00:03:42.370> of<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.549> series<00:03:42.819> and<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.569> which<00:03:43.750> is

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
parts of the series and and which is

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.479 
parts of the series and and which is
