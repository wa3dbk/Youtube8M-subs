00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
make sure that all these valves are

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.030 
make sure that all these valves are
correct<00:00:34.960> then<00:00:35.960> we're<00:00:36.080> gonna<00:00:36.170> run<00:00:36.320> some<00:00:36.379> AMSOIL

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
correct then we're gonna run some AMSOIL

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.400 
correct then we're gonna run some AMSOIL
engines<00:00:37.489> flush<00:00:38.470> get<00:00:39.470> rid<00:00:39.590> all<00:00:39.710> that<00:00:39.860> crud<00:00:41.410> put

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
engines flush get rid all that crud put

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.100 
engines flush get rid all that crud put
in<00:00:42.559> some<00:00:42.940> fresh<00:00:43.940> oil<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:46.480> move<00:00:47.480> forward<00:00:47.960> with

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
in some fresh oil and move forward with

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.260 
in some fresh oil and move forward with
that<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:50.410> something<00:00:51.410> we<00:00:51.469> found<00:00:51.770> today<00:00:52.090> as<00:00:53.090> we

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
that and something we found today as we

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.750 
that and something we found today as we
started<00:00:53.600> digging<00:00:53.750> into<00:00:54.110> this<00:00:54.320> project<00:00:54.920> was

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
started digging into this project was

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.450 
started digging into this project was
that<00:00:55.790> a<00:00:56.649> little<00:00:57.649> bit<00:00:57.770> of<00:00:57.860> a<00:00:57.950> leak<00:00:58.160> right<00:00:58.399> here

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
that a little bit of a leak right here

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.749 
that a little bit of a leak right here
and<00:01:00.850> looks<00:01:01.850> like<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.180> seals<00:01:02.510> bad<00:01:03.489> so<00:01:04.489> we

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
and looks like the seals bad so we

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.520 
and looks like the seals bad so we
wanted<00:01:05.030> to<00:01:05.089> do<00:01:05.239> a<00:01:05.270> brake<00:01:05.690> upgrade<00:01:06.110> anyway

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
wanted to do a brake upgrade anyway

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.139 
wanted to do a brake upgrade anyway
because<00:01:06.800> those<00:01:07.009> 19-inch<00:01:07.369> brakes<00:01:07.729> are<00:01:07.970> just

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
because those 19-inch brakes are just

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.290 
because those 19-inch brakes are just
not<00:01:08.330> going<00:01:08.509> to<00:01:08.570> cut<00:01:08.780> it<00:01:08.960> and<00:01:09.970> we<00:01:10.970> want<00:01:11.119> to<00:01:11.179> put

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
not going to cut it and we want to put

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.669 
not going to cut it and we want to put
11<00:01:11.509> inch<00:01:11.720> drums<00:01:12.050> up<00:01:12.259> front<00:01:13.450> so<00:01:14.500> it's<00:01:15.500> a<00:01:15.530> good

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
11 inch drums up front so it's a good

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:17.410 
11 inch drums up front so it's a good
time<00:01:15.740> to<00:01:15.950> do<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.490> whole<00:01:16.670> thing<00:01:16.700> at<00:01:17.000> one<00:01:17.149> time

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
time to do the whole thing at one time

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.999 
time to do the whole thing at one time
and<00:01:18.910> why<00:01:19.910> we're<00:01:20.090> out<00:01:20.209> it<00:01:20.450> gonna<00:01:21.380> change<00:01:21.709> out

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
and why we're out it gonna change out

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.260 
and why we're out it gonna change out
the<00:01:22.810> tie<00:01:23.810> rod<00:01:24.080> ends<00:01:24.580> because<00:01:25.580> as<00:01:25.729> you<00:01:25.880> can<00:01:26.030> see

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
the tie rod ends because as you can see

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.100 
the tie rod ends because as you can see
those<00:01:26.509> power<00:01:26.810> ends<00:01:27.200> are<00:01:27.440> shot<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.929> just<00:01:29.929> make

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
those power ends are shot and just make

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.150 
those power ends are shot and just make
sense<00:01:30.349> to<00:01:30.560> get<00:01:30.679> it<00:01:30.800> all<00:01:30.920> done<00:01:31.130> now<00:01:31.429> and<00:01:32.149> then<00:01:33.160> we

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
sense to get it all done now and then we

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.940 
sense to get it all done now and then we
don't<00:01:34.310> have<00:01:34.399> to<00:01:34.520> worry<00:01:34.700> about<00:01:34.849> it<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:35.950> knock

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
don't have to worry about it and knock

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.870 
don't have to worry about it and knock
it<00:01:37.130> all<00:01:37.220> out<00:01:37.369> at<00:01:37.490> once<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:39.009> also<00:01:40.009> why<00:01:40.490> we're<00:01:40.670> at

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
it all out at once and also why we're at

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.460 
it all out at once and also why we're at
it<00:01:41.060> we<00:01:41.209> decided<00:01:41.509> to<00:01:41.720> do<00:01:41.869> a<00:01:41.899> little<00:01:42.110> cleaning

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
it we decided to do a little cleaning

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.100 
it we decided to do a little cleaning
and<00:01:43.250> get<00:01:44.240> rid<00:01:44.390> of<00:01:44.450> some<00:01:44.509> of<00:01:44.660> the<00:01:44.780> grease<00:01:45.080> that

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
and get rid of some of the grease that

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.370 
and get rid of some of the grease that
build-up<00:01:45.770> underneath<00:01:45.950> here<00:01:46.869> quite<00:01:47.869> a<00:01:47.899> bit<00:01:48.110> of

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
build-up underneath here quite a bit of

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.520 
build-up underneath here quite a bit of
grease<00:01:48.770> it<00:01:49.009> was<00:01:49.270> all<00:01:50.270> over<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:50.750> transfer<00:01:51.259> case

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
grease it was all over the transfer case

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.570 
grease it was all over the transfer case
and<00:01:51.560> like

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
and like

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.140 
and like
transmission<00:01:53.300> oil<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:54.490> both<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.760> front<00:01:56.090> and

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
transmission oil and both the front and

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.680 
transmission oil and both the front and
rear<00:01:56.240> differential<00:01:57.140> are<00:01:57.290> just<00:01:57.530> greasy<00:01:58.310> so<00:01:58.690> we

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
rear differential are just greasy so we

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.070 
rear differential are just greasy so we
got<00:01:59.870> our<00:02:00.020> purple<00:02:00.380> power<00:02:00.560> out<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.960> we're<00:02:02.960> gonna

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
got our purple power out and we're gonna

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.020 
got our purple power out and we're gonna
hit<00:02:03.320> that<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.860> then<00:02:04.070> who<00:02:04.430> knows<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:04.940> know

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
hit that and then who knows you know

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.790 
hit that and then who knows you know
we'll<00:02:05.180> go<00:02:05.300> from<00:02:05.420> there<00:02:05.660> but<00:02:05.840> we're<00:02:06.680> probably

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
we'll go from there but we're probably

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.220 
we'll go from there but we're probably
gonna<00:02:07.100> replace<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:09.280> Rancho<00:02:10.420> rs.5000<00:02:11.420> with

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
gonna replace the Rancho rs.5000 with

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.770 
gonna replace the Rancho rs.5000 with
something<00:02:12.620> else<00:02:12.770> it<00:02:13.190> looks<00:02:13.430> like<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.850> end

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
something else it looks like the end

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.600 
something else it looks like the end
bushings<00:02:15.260> are<00:02:15.440> pretty<00:02:15.620> much<00:02:15.770> shot<00:02:16.070> on<00:02:16.250> that<00:02:16.400> as

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
bushings are pretty much shot on that as

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.050 
bushings are pretty much shot on that as
well

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
well

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.810 
well
that's<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:18.110> steering<00:02:18.860> dampener<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:21.820> we'll

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
that's the steering dampener and we'll

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.810 
that's the steering dampener and we'll
see<00:02:22.970> what<00:02:23.090> happens<00:02:23.180> from<00:02:23.480> there
