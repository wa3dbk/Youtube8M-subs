I'll<00:03:37.129> demonstrate<00:03:40.120> let's<00:03:41.120> come<00:03:41.329> all<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.690> way

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
I'll demonstrate let's come all the way

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.119 
I'll demonstrate let's come all the way
up<00:03:42.190> down<00:03:43.190> nice<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:43.519> slow<00:03:44.409> now<00:03:45.409> my<00:03:45.530> elbow<00:03:45.949> is

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
up down nice and slow now my elbow is

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.649 
up down nice and slow now my elbow is
great<00:03:46.370> this<00:03:46.549> pocket<00:03:46.940> right<00:03:47.150> here

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.729 

it's<00:03:50.659> very<00:03:50.930> important<00:03:51.409> that<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:51.590> have

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
it's very important that you have

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.520 
it's very important that you have
support<00:03:55.389> all<00:03:56.389> the<00:03:56.629> pressures<00:03:56.900> going<00:03:57.049> rain<00:03:57.319> to

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
support all the pressures going rain to

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.610 
support all the pressures going rain to
the<00:03:57.620> bicep<00:03:58.239> so<00:03:59.239> go<00:03:59.540> at<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.049> relatively<00:04:00.470> slow

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
the bicep so go at a relatively slow

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.479 
the bicep so go at a relatively slow
pace<00:04:01.129> like<00:04:01.370> this<00:04:01.840> find<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:03.019> ten<00:04:03.260> reps<00:04:03.530> squeeze

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
pace like this find the ten reps squeeze

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.430 
pace like this find the ten reps squeeze
as<00:04:04.639> hard<00:04:04.669> as<00:04:05.030> you<00:04:05.180> can<00:04:05.389> all<00:04:05.629> the<00:04:05.659> way<00:04:05.750> up<00:04:05.989> and<00:04:06.199> on

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
as hard as you can all the way up and on

as hard as you can all the way up and on
the<00:04:06.470> way<00:04:06.560> down<00:04:06.889> as<00:04:07.459> soon<00:04:07.669> as<00:04:07.760> you<00:04:07.849> finish<00:04:08.000> one

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
the way down as soon as you finish one

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.339 
the way down as soon as you finish one
side<00:04:08.709> go<00:04:09.709> to<00:04:09.769> the<00:04:10.040> other<00:04:10.159> side<00:04:11.169> utilize<00:04:12.169> the

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
side go to the other side utilize the

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.110 
side go to the other side utilize the
same<00:04:12.500> form<00:04:12.949> and<00:04:13.159> technique<00:04:15.669> just<00:04:16.669> like<00:04:16.909> this

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
same form and technique just like this

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.750 
same form and technique just like this
breathe<00:04:17.510> out<00:04:17.659> on<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:17.780> way<00:04:17.840> up<00:04:18.400> if<00:04:19.400> I<00:04:19.519> had<00:04:19.639> the

breathe out on the way up if I had the

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.560 
breathe out on the way up if I had the
ten<00:04:19.940> reps<00:04:20.650> that<00:04:21.650> completes<00:04:22.010> one<00:04:22.220> set<00:04:22.550> two<00:04:23.300> more
