00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.030
 talking about mendoza the director and 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.730
 founder of the dotcom global marketing 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.950
 problem for too many owners of 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.950
 small and medium businesses and for 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.410
 of course entrepreneurs is that they fall 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.989
 any of the following traps that I'm going 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.470
 to try in this video the trap number 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:27.630
 one is to be a victim of advertising 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.210
 the fact is that it is very easy to become 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.460
 in a victim of advertising see 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.710
 Some representative or agency of 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.239
 advertising will meet with you and you 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.469
 will say that you need to advertise 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.269
 advertising 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.879
 simply because he needs to do 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:45.929
 advertising and they will want to sell you 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.879
 rather than institutional advertising 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.010
 direct response advertising that is 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.769
 the one that we teach the marketing 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.530
 global dotcom the difference between 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:01:01.130
 both styles of advertising is pretty 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.560
 obvious in fact the same name indicates 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.640
 institutional advertising in the 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.800
 advertising that makes cocacola or the 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.920
 women's blimp and with this kind of 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.960
 advertising you can not can not measure 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.700
 the results tell you that when 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.270
 someone is ready for your product in 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.640
 particular 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.310
 when they will think of you and they will 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.149
 call and they will make an appointment if 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.490
 you fall victim to this simply 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:32.250
 break the only companies that can 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.869
 pay this type of advertising are the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.420
 cocacola the deals the google of the world 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.569
 what you want to do and only do 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.420
 in response emotional advertising 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:48.319
 direct is the type of advertising where 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.880
 every dollar you spend monthly 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:55.530
 is measurable and can be susceptible to 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.380
 responsibility if you want to use the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.079
 information about advertising 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.689
 emotional direct response click 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.849
 about the link that you will find below 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.799
 this video or go to unlimited flow of 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:10.410
 dotcom clients 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:14.040
 I repeat unlimited flow of clients 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.530
 puntocom the second trap is to think that 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.350
 you are the customer 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.630
 I can not list the number of times 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.810
 that owners of small medium and 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.910
 medium businesses and entrepreneurs have 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.400
 said that his clients are too many 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.720
 sophisticated for this type of marketing 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:37.980
 or this kind of advertising this way of 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.860
 think without doing the test can be 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.380
 something quite dangerous just because 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.530
 you could not answer something not 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.860
 means that its customers would not 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.100
 you need to be open to try 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.390
 new ideas if you're interested that you 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.769
 teach dozens of tactical principles and 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.980
 sea techniques that live 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:06.120
 focused exclusively on generating more 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.280
 money more prospects and more clients them 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.040
