high grade universal century line so

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.639 
high grade universal century line so
it's<00:01:45.810> nothing<00:01:46.500> special<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:47.009> my<00:01:47.189> opinion<00:01:48.649> so

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
it's nothing special in my opinion so

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.039 
it's nothing special in my opinion so
here's<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.130> set<00:01:50.930> comes<00:01:51.930> with<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:54.049> seafoam

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
here's the set comes with a seafoam

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:03.090 
here's the set comes with a seafoam
green<00:01:56.149> lightsaber<00:01:57.149> fits<00:01:57.899> firmly<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.560> head

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.250 

so<00:02:04.100> does<00:02:04.370> the<00:02:04.670> beam<00:02:05.000> rifle<00:02:05.270> not<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.080> beam

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
so does the beam rifle not the beam

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.470 
so does the beam rifle not the beam
rifle<00:02:06.620> does<00:02:08.260> when<00:02:09.260> was<00:02:09.380> it<00:02:09.500> beam<00:02:09.710> pistol<00:02:10.480> spray

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.980 
rifle does when was it beam pistol spray
beam<00:02:12.080> spray<00:02:12.560> pistol<00:02:13.450> basically<00:02:14.450> it's<00:02:14.600> not<00:02:14.780> as

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
beam spray pistol basically it's not as

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.330 
beam spray pistol basically it's not as
powerful<00:02:15.200> as<00:02:15.530> that<00:02:15.650> beam<00:02:15.950> rifle<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:19.130> then

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
powerful as that beam rifle and then

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.930 
powerful as that beam rifle and then
someone's<00:02:20.120> being<00:02:20.330> noise<00:02:20.720> in<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:21.050> background

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
someone's being noise in the background

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
someone's being noise in the background
his<00:02:22.940> shield<00:02:23.360> it's<00:02:23.870> been<00:02:24.080> 360<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.630> not<00:02:26.630> only

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
his shield it's been 360 and not only

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.240 
his shield it's been 360 and not only
kind<00:02:27.110> of<00:02:27.260> fit<00:02:27.500> in<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.680> back<00:02:29.830> that's<00:02:30.830> not

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
kind of fit in the back that's not

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.470 
kind of fit in the back that's not
supposed<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.730> happen

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.140 

so<00:02:39.020> it<00:02:39.110> goes<00:02:39.260> in<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.560> back<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:40.370> there's<00:02:40.790> a

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
so it goes in the back and there's a

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.839 
so it goes in the back and there's a
slot<00:02:41.660> on<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:41.930> right<00:02:42.349> arm<00:02:42.739> as<00:02:43.430> well<00:02:43.670> as<00:02:43.760> the

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
slot on the right arm as well as the

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:52.449 
slot on the right arm as well as the
left<00:02:44.030> on<00:02:47.380> also<00:02:48.380> 360<00:02:49.780> so<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.930> head<00:02:51.110> can<00:02:51.140> go<00:02:52.099> left

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
left on also 360 so the head can go left

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.610 
left on also 360 so the head can go left
and<00:02:52.760> right<00:02:54.610> but<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.970> neck<00:02:56.300> armor<00:02:56.720> prevents<00:02:57.530> it

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
and right but the neck armor prevents it

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.820 
and right but the neck armor prevents it
from<00:02:57.739> going<00:02:57.950> 360<00:02:58.690> again<00:02:59.690> going<00:03:00.230> up<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:00.650> down<00:03:00.770> a

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
from going 360 again going up and down a

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:13.960 
from going 360 again going up and down a
little<00:03:01.130> bit<00:03:05.470> there<00:03:06.470> goes<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.800> hand<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:13.700> what

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
little bit there goes the hand and what

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.270 
little bit there goes the hand and what
is<00:03:14.120> out

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.330 

that's<00:03:20.880> a<00:03:21.000> problem<00:03:21.270> with<00:03:22.340> high-grade

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
that's a problem with high-grade

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.000 
that's a problem with high-grade
universal<00:03:24.090> century<00:03:24.330> hands<00:03:24.690> they<00:03:25.290> tend<00:03:25.710> to<00:03:25.770> pop

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
universal century hands they tend to pop

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.520 
universal century hands they tend to pop
off<00:03:27.740> okay<00:03:28.740> so<00:03:28.800> for<00:03:29.190> that<00:03:29.280> elbow<00:03:30.200> goes<00:03:31.200> around

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
off okay so for that elbow goes around

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.880 
off okay so for that elbow goes around
90<00:03:32.490> degrees

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
90 degrees

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.630 
90 degrees
not<00:03:34.890> bad<00:03:35.160> but<00:03:35.520> not<00:03:35.580> that<00:03:35.970> great<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:37.830> arm<00:03:38.010> and

go this way up and down the shoulder

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.940 
go this way up and down the shoulder
guard<00:03:44.700> blocks<00:03:45.200> prevents<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.290> from<00:03:46.380> going<00:03:46.650> any

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.370 
guard blocks prevents it from going any
further<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:49.050> can<00:03:49.320> go<00:03:50.250> take<00:03:50.580> this<00:03:51.060> on<00:03:51.380> the

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
further and you can go take this on the

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.890 
further and you can go take this on the
arm<00:03:52.620> at<00:03:52.709> this<00:03:52.890> joint<00:03:53.130> 360<00:03:54.060> degrees<00:03:54.360> you<00:03:54.750> can

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
arm at this joint 360 degrees you can

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:02.240 
arm at this joint 360 degrees you can
rotate<00:03:55.080> it<00:03:55.290> just<00:03:56.390> join<00:03:57.390> that<00:03:57.570> 360<00:03:57.930> degrees<00:04:01.250> and

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
rotate it just join that 360 degrees and

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:09.980 
rotate it just join that 360 degrees and
a<00:04:02.490> hand<00:04:02.880> fell<00:04:03.270> apart<00:04:03.570> again<00:04:08.300> this<00:04:09.300> usually

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
a hand fell apart again this usually

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.960 
a hand fell apart again this usually
isn't<00:04:10.140> a<00:04:10.380> pump<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.920> don't<00:04:11.160> play<00:04:11.340> around<00:04:11.459> with<00:04:11.820> it

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
isn't a pump I don't play around with it

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:23.300 
isn't a pump I don't play around with it
that<00:04:12.120> much<00:04:12.330> so<00:04:12.540> I<00:04:12.570> guess<00:04:12.810> that's<00:04:13.590> why<00:04:22.310> and

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
that much so I guess that's why and

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.840 
that much so I guess that's why and
let's<00:04:23.790> see<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.300> front<00:04:24.960> skirt<00:04:25.530> armor<00:04:25.860> barely

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
let's see the front skirt armor barely

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.650 
let's see the front skirt armor barely
moves<00:04:27.090> at<00:04:27.330> all<00:04:27.590> same<00:04:28.590> with<00:04:28.770> a<00:04:28.800> side<00:04:29.280> skirt<00:04:29.660> the

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
moves at all same with a side skirt the

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.440 
moves at all same with a side skirt the
leg<00:04:31.200> really<00:04:31.590> can't<00:04:31.860> move<00:04:32.070> that<00:04:32.520> much<00:04:32.970> far

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
leg really can't move that much far

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.980 
leg really can't move that much far
because<00:04:34.320> this<00:04:34.680> red<00:04:35.130> armor<00:04:35.510> and<00:04:36.510> then<00:04:36.630> it<00:04:36.750> can't

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
because this red armor and then it can't

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.170 
because this red armor and then it can't
move<00:04:37.169> back<00:04:37.500> down<00:04:37.710> much<00:04:37.919> I'd<00:04:38.100> do<00:04:38.460> veer<00:04:38.700> screwed

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
move back down much I'd do veer screwed

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.140 
move back down much I'd do veer screwed
armor<00:04:39.419> does<00:04:39.570> not<00:04:39.750> move<00:04:39.990> at<00:04:40.110> all<00:04:40.880> that's<00:04:41.880> for

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
armor does not move at all that's for

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.530 
armor does not move at all that's for
the<00:04:42.240> knee<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:43.410> it's<00:04:43.620> around<00:04:43.890> a<00:04:44.310> little<00:04:45.240> less

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
the knee and it's around a little less

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.480 
the knee and it's around a little less
than<00:04:45.810> 90<00:04:46.140> degrees<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.729> foot<00:04:47.970> can<00:04:48.390> move

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490

the<00:06:57.039> visor<00:06:57.249> is<00:06:57.639> not<00:06:57.669> a<00:06:57.879> sticker<00:06:58.240> it's<00:06:58.629> a

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:00.449 
the visor is not a sticker it's a

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:06.920 
the visor is not a sticker it's a
transparent<00:07:01.449> piece<00:07:02.610> dark<00:07:03.719> greenish

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.830 

and<00:07:07.930> for<00:07:08.380> that<00:07:08.500> backpack<00:07:09.450> there<00:07:10.450> was<00:07:10.540> a<00:07:10.570> little

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 
and for that backpack there was a little

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:19.920 
and for that backpack there was a little
boosters<00:07:11.260> move<00:07:11.560> as<00:07:11.830> well<00:07:18.000> so<00:07:19.000> it's<00:07:19.300> an<00:07:19.540> average

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:19.930 
boosters move as well so it's an average

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.030 
boosters move as well so it's an average
set<00:07:21.420> you<00:07:22.420> didn't<00:07:22.720> have<00:07:22.930> too<00:07:23.290> many<00:07:23.440> extra<00:07:23.830> hands

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:24.040 
set you didn't have too many extra hands

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.520 
set you didn't have too many extra hands
and<00:07:24.460> has<00:07:25.090> two<00:07:25.360> weapons<00:07:25.750> and<00:07:26.020> one<00:07:26.170> shield

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:26.530 
and has two weapons and one shield

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.210 
and has two weapons and one shield
although<00:07:27.490> the<00:07:27.700> shield<00:07:28.000> is<00:07:28.900> pretty<00:07:29.380> the<00:07:29.950> back

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:30.220 
although the shield is pretty the back

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:38.340 
although the shield is pretty the back
side<00:07:30.520> of<00:07:30.550> it<00:07:30.850> has<00:07:31.360> a<00:07:31.390> lot<00:07:31.750> of<00:07:31.780> detail<00:07:32.350> so<00:07:37.320> so<00:07:38.320> I

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:38.350 
side of it has a lot of detail so so I

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.080 
side of it has a lot of detail so so I
definitely<00:07:38.770> recommend<00:07:39.010> this<00:07:39.430> suit<00:07:39.730> if<00:07:39.850> you're

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.090 
definitely recommend this suit if you're

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.560 
definitely recommend this suit if you're
a<00:07:40.150> big<00:07:40.600> fan<00:07:40.630> of<00:07:40.900> grunts<00:07:41.350> and<00:07:42.000> it's<00:07:43.000> not<00:07:43.360> that

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:43.570 
a big fan of grunts and it's not that

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.270 
a big fan of grunts and it's not that
expensive<00:07:43.980> because<00:07:44.980> it's<00:07:45.370> somewhat<00:07:45.940> old<00:07:47.280> and

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 
expensive because it's somewhat old and

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.610 
expensive because it's somewhat old and
they<00:07:48.790> haven't<00:07:49.240> really<00:07:49.540> released<00:07:50.170> any<00:07:50.380> newer

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:50.620 
they haven't really released any newer

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.550 
they haven't really released any newer
versions<00:07:51.160> I<00:07:51.280> mean<00:07:51.670> there's<00:07:51.910> others<00:07:52.450> ones<00:07:52.750> like

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560 
versions I mean there's others ones like

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.110 
versions I mean there's others ones like

the power TM and Geum quo I wish they

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.210 
the power TM and Geum quo I wish they
made<00:07:58.150> like<00:07:58.570> the<00:08:00.060> like<00:08:01.060> DM<00:08:01.630> cannon<00:08:02.230> or<00:08:02.440> the
