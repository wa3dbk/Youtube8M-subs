of communicate I felt that way I felt

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.260 
of communicate I felt that way I felt
like<00:02:52.740> a<00:02:52.770> misfit<00:02:53.280> in<00:02:53.490> high<00:02:53.670> school<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.150> was

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
like a misfit in high school and I was

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.490 
like a misfit in high school and I was
bullied<00:02:54.540> in<00:02:54.630> high<00:02:54.750> school<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.230> I've<00:02:55.350> always

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
bullied in high school and I've always

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.750

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
sort of been different and interesting

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.150 
sort of been different and interesting
and<00:02:57.240> I<00:02:57.330> think<00:02:57.390> people<00:02:58.200> have<00:02:58.380> such<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.680> tendency

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.250 
and I think people have such a tendency
to<00:02:59.400> judge<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.000> compare<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.600> kind<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.840> glom<00:03:01.050> on
