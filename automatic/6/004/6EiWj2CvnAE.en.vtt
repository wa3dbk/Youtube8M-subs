00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:33.200
 and the dogs were very sad because 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.610
 because the architects did not peel them 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.129
 because the architects had never 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.219
 put to design a house for a dog 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.100
 ten dispatches of the new generation of 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.289
 Mexican architects to reinvent the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.420
 houses for a dog part of a concept 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.400
 very simple that has always 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.130
 called the attention that is the dog 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.800
 but it follows its own tail and in this case 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.160
 Well, it's the archetypal form of 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.490
 house that perceives itself and generates 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.980
 a look and it's a house that pretends 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.670
 take a tour and have a space in 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.560
 the central part as to rest 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.660
 Well I'm from Eduardo Gorospe and I 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.410
 I direct 001 architecture workshop 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:20.350
 we did is that formally we created a 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.970
 nest a tissue that was generated 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.810
 from totally materials 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:29.200
 synthetic and good after all the 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.930
 radical way lies in how a dog 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.060
 scratches its own burrow and in the part 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.160
 back always has a part of 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.470
 protection behind the house of the 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.660
 displacements because he said that instead 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.840
 of wanting to make a house as a 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.610
 formal intention what he intended was 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.740
 make a house with the first memory of 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.320
 a dog in his life that in this case was 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.480
 the dog of the other guy 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.110
 we are the collective those 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.060
 Our dog house is the wok house or 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.260
 the igloo house product of the 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.660
 experimentation 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.300
 we wanted to achieve a regular geometry 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.700
 that could have three functions like 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.580
 carpet in the beginning and by means of 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.380
 tension you could have this two 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.380
 ways to meet the needs of a 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.600
 dog if you're inside this can 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.200
 work like the wok over there your cushion 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.420
 cited noodles and igloo not for the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.000
 interperience then basically that's it 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.490
 not a house that can function 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.690
 three forms for all the 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.360
 needs or environments where you can 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.090
 be inspired by the concept of the envelope 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.860
 cicla g 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.680
 the creative transformation of a 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.110
 residual material in this case all the 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.440
 the components and elements of this 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.599
 house they were had another function before 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.209
 for example the base are boxes of 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:51.629
 archivist the wooden box is 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:54.269
 plantings for construction roofs 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.519
 they are stools for carpenter and so on 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.269
 It has a water catchment system 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.930
 rain and a production system 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:07.500
 aromatic plants we have the egg of 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.319
 safe goods of the qatar architect of 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.380
 neighborhoods the house of the producers that 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.739
 is this very elegant golden pyramid very 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.510
 elegant that is born from the game of going 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.879
 putting a pencil in different 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.950
 positions the house of michel roussin that 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.349
 It is a house that can be placed in 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.459
 several positions and has different 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:32.489
 tickets the house that imitates your dog is 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.250
 the sustainable home study house that 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.370
 it works at the same time as 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.190
 a bench and a house for a dog and a 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.650
 gigantic pot good because thanks to 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.290
 lucky this project could be made 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.740
 hello I'm felipe fadón founder of n'hug 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.770
 and together with esteban suárez I 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.870
 participated in the decision making for 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.240
 start the toki texture project 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.620
 arming brito that has done then this that 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.230
 is that you can see here in fiber 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.140
 cloud glass and that's good 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.730
 a house that is very ergonomic like the 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.400
 rest of the houses that here in some of 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.709
 the cases are decorative objects but 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.930
 all of them functional and good so we 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.489
 We feel very satisfied with the work that 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.489
 we have carried out 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.570
