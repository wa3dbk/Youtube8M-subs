has that you're not going to find in
other<00:00:38.820> cameras<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:40.200> first<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.649> all<00:00:40.739> especially

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
other cameras is first of all especially

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.340 
other cameras is first of all especially
not<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.850> point-and-shoots<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.870> actually

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
not in point-and-shoots this is actually

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.740 
not in point-and-shoots this is actually
compatible<00:00:43.710> with<00:00:44.010> i5<00:00:44.789> cards<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.450> it's

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
compatible with i5 cards so it's

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.540 
compatible with i5 cards so it's
automatically<00:00:46.350> compatible<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:47.039> all<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
IFI cards on the market so you're going

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.510 
IFI cards on the market so you're going
to<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.530> able<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.710> use<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.160> wirelessly

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
to be able to use this to wirelessly

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.729 
to be able to use this to wirelessly
upload<00:00:50.910> all<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.120> your<00:00:51.300> pictures<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.649> your

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
upload all of your pictures to your

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.689 
upload all of your pictures to your
computer<00:00:53.480> 720p<00:00:54.480> high<00:00:55.230> definition<00:00:55.469> video<00:00:56.399> it

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
computer 720p high definition video it

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.840 
computer 720p high definition video it
does<00:00:57.030> 3d<00:00:57.449> stills<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> single<00:00:59.280> lens<00:00:59.550> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
does 3d stills with a single lens and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.790 
does 3d stills with a single lens and
essentially<00:01:00.329> how<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.600> does<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.230> takes

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
essentially how it does that is it takes

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.039 
essentially how it does that is it takes
two<00:01:02.100> pictures<00:01:02.579> offsets<00:01:03.270> each<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.690> them<00:01:03.870> and

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
two pictures offsets each of them and

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.670 
two pictures offsets each of them and
then<00:01:04.589> renders<00:01:05.369> them<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:06.330> your<00:01:06.450> 3d<00:01:06.990> devices

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
then renders them for your 3d devices

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.230 
then renders them for your 3d devices
you're<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.220> able<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:08.670> images<00:01:08.880> in

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
you're going to be able to see images in

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.080 
you're going to be able to see images in
3d<00:01:10.020> from<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.680> single<00:01:11.250> lens<00:01:11.430> it'll<00:01:11.670> even<00:01:11.880> do

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
3d from just a single lens it'll even do

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.660 
3d from just a single lens it'll even do
panoramas<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.409> use<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.799> snap<00:01:14.189> three

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
panoramas you can use this to snap three

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.249 
panoramas you can use this to snap three
pictures<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.570> will<00:01:15.720> stitch<00:01:16.020> them

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
pictures and it will stitch them

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.590 
pictures and it will stitch them
together<00:01:16.520> automatically<00:01:17.520> right<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.390> within

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
point-and-shoot cameras you're going to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.100 
point-and-shoot cameras you're going to
find<00:01:26.909> them<00:01:27.060> starting<00:01:27.360> at<00:01:27.390> about<00:01:27.570> 35

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
find them starting at about 35

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.080 
find them starting at about 35
millimetres<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.520> going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.820> allow<00:01:30.030> you

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
millimetres this is going to allow you

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.289
