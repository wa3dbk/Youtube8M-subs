that a few of you have asked over over
time<00:00:09.219> but<00:00:09.549> I<00:00:09.580> didn't<00:00:09.879> make<00:00:09.969> a<00:00:10.030> video<00:00:10.179> on<00:00:10.539> it<00:00:10.719> and

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
time but I didn't make a video on it and

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.949 
time but I didn't make a video on it and
this<00:00:11.110> is<00:00:11.349> why<00:00:12.039> do<00:00:12.099> some<00:00:12.669> orchids<00:00:13.209> look<00:00:13.570> worse

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:13.959 
this is why do some orchids look worse

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.220 
this is why do some orchids look worse
after<00:00:14.679> reporting<00:00:15.280> than<00:00:15.750> others<00:00:16.750> they<00:00:17.050> should

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
after reporting than others they should

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.429 
after reporting than others they should

I've had this happen a lot a lot of the
times<00:00:23.259> with<00:00:23.920> fouls<00:00:24.339> that<00:00:24.820> are<00:00:25.119> kind<00:00:25.480> of

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
times with fouls that are kind of

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.630 
times with fouls that are kind of
suffering<00:00:25.990> when<00:00:26.230> I<00:00:26.259> repot<00:00:26.769> them<00:00:26.800> even<00:00:27.400> if<00:00:27.490> they

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
suffering when I repot them even if they

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.570 
suffering when I repot them even if they
have<00:00:27.970> a<00:00:28.000> few<00:00:28.419> roots<00:00:28.660> they<00:00:29.529> sometimes<00:00:29.980> go

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
have a few roots they sometimes go

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.970

Phalaenopsis<00:00:37.390> blackjack<00:00:38.199> which<00:00:38.469> was<00:00:38.680> very

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
Phalaenopsis blackjack which was very

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.090 
Phalaenopsis blackjack which was very
very<00:00:39.100> limping<00:00:39.760> but<00:00:40.300> it<00:00:40.660> plumped<00:00:41.140> back<00:00:41.379> up<00:00:41.649> and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100

still has two Limpy leaves
I<00:00:47.079> think<00:00:47.500> they<00:00:47.680> old<00:00:47.890> yellow<00:00:48.340> soon<00:00:48.670> oh<00:00:48.879> this<00:00:49.300> one

I think they old yellow soon oh this one

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.299 
I think they old yellow soon oh this one
has<00:00:49.510> plumped<00:00:49.960> up<00:00:50.050> but<00:00:50.649> the<00:00:50.770> other<00:00:50.859> ones<00:00:51.129> are

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
has plumped up but the other ones are

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.430 
has plumped up but the other ones are
looking<00:00:51.699> good<00:00:51.879> so<00:00:52.570> I've<00:00:52.840> had<00:00:53.079> this<00:00:53.260> happen

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
looking good so I've had this happen

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.860 
looking good so I've had this happen
with<00:00:53.949> quite<00:00:54.340> a<00:00:54.370> few<00:00:54.519> orchids<00:00:55.180> and<00:00:55.420> I've

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
with quite a few orchids and I've

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.740 
with quite a few orchids and I've
noticed<00:00:56.320> that<00:00:56.850> if<00:00:57.850> they<00:00:58.059> don't<00:00:58.300> have<00:00:58.449> a<00:00:58.480> proper

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
noticed that if they don't have a proper

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.750 
noticed that if they don't have a proper
root<00:00:58.989> system<00:00:59.559> or<00:00:59.710> if<00:00:59.890> they<00:01:00.039> have<00:01:00.219> a<00:01:00.250> root

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
root system or if they have a root

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.360 
root system or if they have a root
system<00:01:01.120> that<00:01:01.149> is<00:01:01.359> slightly<00:01:02.010> suffering<00:01:03.010> they

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
system that is slightly suffering they

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.450 
system that is slightly suffering they
will<00:01:03.640> go<00:01:03.940> very<00:01:04.600> Limpy<00:01:05.140> after<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.590> repot<00:01:06.130> and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
will go very Limpy after a repot and

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.429 
will go very Limpy after a repot and
this<00:01:06.610> is<00:01:06.820> because<00:01:07.180> you<00:01:07.750> are<00:01:07.869> changing<00:01:07.900> your

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
this is because you are changing your

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.230 
this is because you are changing your
their<00:01:08.920> environment<00:01:09.610> they're<00:01:09.820> trying<00:01:10.150> to

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
their environment they're trying to

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.060 
their environment they're trying to
adjust<00:01:10.659> in<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:10.869> new<00:01:11.049> environment<00:01:11.229> even<00:01:11.770> if

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
adjust in the new environment even if

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.160 
adjust in the new environment even if
it's<00:01:12.250> a<00:01:12.369> better<00:01:12.610> one<00:01:12.909> if<00:01:13.240> it's<00:01:13.630> fresh<00:01:13.869> medium

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
it's a better one if it's fresh medium

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.950 
it's a better one if it's fresh medium
that<00:01:14.560> suits<00:01:14.950> their<00:01:15.189> needs<00:01:15.220> better<00:01:15.880> they<00:01:16.689> just

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
that suits their needs better they just

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.020 
that suits their needs better they just
go<00:01:17.140> through<00:01:17.470> this<00:01:17.829> limb<00:01:18.220> penis<00:01:18.579> because<00:01:18.880> they

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
go through this limb penis because they

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.090 
go through this limb penis because they
are<00:01:19.119> adjusting<00:01:19.750> to<00:01:20.049> the<00:01:20.170> environment<00:01:20.710> to<00:01:20.979> the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
are adjusting to the environment to the

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.880 
are adjusting to the environment to the
new<00:01:21.280> medium<00:01:22.180> and<00:01:22.420> so<00:01:22.720> on<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.380> if<00:01:23.500> it's<00:01:23.680> a

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
new medium and so on and if it's a

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.039 
new medium and so on and if it's a
healthy<00:01:24.490> if<00:01:24.640> it's<00:01:24.850> not<00:01:25.000> a<00:01:25.030> healthy<00:01:25.390> orchid<00:01:25.720> it

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
healthy if it's not a healthy orchid it

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.870 
healthy if it's not a healthy orchid it
can<00:01:26.290> go<00:01:26.439> pre<00:01:26.770> Limpy<00:01:27.220> because<00:01:27.460> it's<00:01:27.670> that

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
can go pre Limpy because it's that

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.480 
can go pre Limpy because it's that
diverting<00:01:28.630> energy<00:01:29.079> to<00:01:29.320> adjusting<00:01:30.220> to<00:01:30.369> that

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
diverting energy to adjusting to that

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.850 
diverting energy to adjusting to that
environment<00:01:31.119> sometimes<00:01:31.540> some<00:01:32.409> healthy

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
environment sometimes some healthy

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.700 
environment sometimes some healthy
orchids<00:01:33.310> do<00:01:33.729> this<00:01:34.000> as<00:01:34.210> well<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:34.869> this<00:01:35.229> was<00:01:35.470> one

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
orchids do this as well and this was one

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.730 
orchids do this as well and this was one
of<00:01:35.740> them<00:01:36.040> which<00:01:36.700> now<00:01:36.970> looks<00:01:37.500> spectacular<00:01:38.500> now

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
of them which now looks spectacular now

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.190 
of them which now looks spectacular now
this<00:01:39.009> had<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.310> lot<00:01:39.579> of<00:01:39.610> roots<00:01:39.970> but<00:01:40.750> for<00:01:40.990> some

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
this had a lot of roots but for some

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.109 
this had a lot of roots but for some
reason<00:01:41.740> when<00:01:41.890> I<00:01:41.920> reported<00:01:42.520> it<00:01:42.700> for<00:01:42.880> about<00:01:42.969> a

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
reason when I reported it for about a

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.359 
reason when I reported it for about a
month<00:01:43.390> it<00:01:43.719> was<00:01:43.810> kind<00:01:44.170> of<00:01:44.290> Limpy<00:01:44.680> until<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.219> new

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
month it was kind of Limpy until the new

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.130 
month it was kind of Limpy until the new
roots<00:01:45.610> grabbed<00:01:45.969> hold<00:01:46.240> of<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.509> medium<00:01:46.930> and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
roots grabbed hold of the medium and

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.370 
roots grabbed hold of the medium and
adjusted<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.670> new<00:01:48.850> pots<00:01:49.600> that<00:01:49.899> I've<00:01:50.049> used

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
adjusted to the new pots that I've used

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.889 
adjusted to the new pots that I've used
but<00:01:50.979> after<00:01:51.280> that<00:01:51.490> they<00:01:51.729> just<00:01:51.969> bloomed<00:01:52.329> back<00:01:52.630> up

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
but after that they just bloomed back up

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.429 
but after that they just bloomed back up
and<00:01:53.320> they're<00:01:53.920> looking<00:01:54.250> very<00:01:54.280> very<00:01:54.939> fine<00:01:55.439> today

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
and they're looking very very fine today

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.830 
and they're looking very very fine today
it<00:01:56.649> didn't<00:01:56.950> take<00:01:57.070> long<00:01:57.100> about<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.090> month<00:01:58.420> or<00:01:58.570> so

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
it didn't take long about a month or so

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.499 
it didn't take long about a month or so
so<00:01:59.439> some<00:01:59.710> orchids<00:02:00.280> do<00:02:00.610> this<00:02:00.880> when<00:02:01.090> you<00:02:01.180> a<00:02:01.210> pot

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
so some orchids do this when you a pot

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:02.999 
so some orchids do this when you a pot
them<00:02:01.750> but<00:02:01.899> I've<00:02:01.990> noticed<00:02:02.439> the<00:02:02.590> ones<00:02:02.770> that

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
them but I've noticed the ones that

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.069 
them but I've noticed the ones that
don't<00:02:03.159> have<00:02:03.310> too<00:02:03.670> many<00:02:03.820> roots<00:02:04.119> or<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.899> roots

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
don't have too many roots or the roots

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.020 
don't have too many roots or the roots
are<00:02:05.229> not<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.590> healthiest<00:02:06.130> they<00:02:06.310> tend<00:02:06.579> to<00:02:06.670> be

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
are not the healthiest they tend to be

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.840 
are not the healthiest they tend to be
more<00:02:07.270> Limpy<00:02:07.689> than<00:02:08.260> others<00:02:08.860> so<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.430> would<00:02:09.610> think

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
more Limpy than others so I would think

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.160 
more Limpy than others so I would think
this<00:02:10.150> is<00:02:10.210> norm

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
this is norm

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.490 
this is norm
until<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:11.920> see<00:02:12.130> root<00:02:12.700> tip<00:02:12.970> root<00:02:13.690> tips<00:02:13.930> growing

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
until you see root tip root tips growing

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.590 
until you see root tip root tips growing
I<00:02:14.680> think<00:02:14.710> your<00:02:15.100> kid<00:02:15.430> will<00:02:15.640> be<00:02:15.760> slightly<00:02:16.030> Limpy

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
I think your kid will be slightly Limpy

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.809 
I think your kid will be slightly Limpy
now<00:02:17.230> this<00:02:17.470> doesn't<00:02:17.680> happen<00:02:17.950> with<00:02:18.130> everybody

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
now this doesn't happen with everybody

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.030 
now this doesn't happen with everybody
it<00:02:19.120> doesn't<00:02:19.150> really<00:02:19.750> happen<00:02:19.959> with<00:02:20.410> all<00:02:20.620> sick

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
it doesn't really happen with all sick

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.940 
it doesn't really happen with all sick
or<00:02:21.280> kids<00:02:21.640> it's<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:23.140> really<00:02:23.380> depends<00:02:23.740> on<00:02:23.800> the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
or kids it's it really depends on the

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.040 
or kids it's it really depends on the
orchid<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.550> how<00:02:24.880> much<00:02:25.060> energy<00:02:25.330> actually<00:02:25.990> it

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
orchid and how much energy actually it

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.890 
orchid and how much energy actually it
has<00:02:26.260> stored<00:02:26.740> so<00:02:27.310> if<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.910> has<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.090> lot<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.390> energy

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
has stored so if it has a lot of energy

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.410 
has stored so if it has a lot of energy
stored<00:02:28.959> in<00:02:29.470> her<00:02:29.830> leaves<00:02:30.100> then<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.030> might<00:02:31.240> not

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
stored in her leaves then it might not

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.440 
stored in her leaves then it might not
go<00:02:31.600> Limpy<00:02:31.990> but<00:02:32.230> if<00:02:32.500> it's<00:02:32.980> pretty<00:02:33.610> depleted<00:02:34.209> it

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
go Limpy but if it's pretty depleted it

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.150 
go Limpy but if it's pretty depleted it
will<00:02:34.600> go<00:02:34.780> but<00:02:35.020> don't<00:02:35.230> worry<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.770> will<00:02:35.860> plump

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
will go but don't worry it will plump

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.640 
will go but don't worry it will plump
back<00:02:36.430> up<00:02:36.700> if<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.510> doesn't<00:02:37.810> happen<00:02:37.989> in<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.470> few

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
back up if it doesn't happen in a few

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.650 
back up if it doesn't happen in a few
months<00:02:39.070> then<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:40.000> should<00:02:40.150> check<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.480> roots

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
months then you should check the roots

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.809 
months then you should check the roots
once<00:02:41.020> again<00:02:41.440> see<00:02:41.709> if<00:02:41.739> everybody<00:02:42.130> is<00:02:42.459> okay

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
once again see if everybody is okay

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.940 
once again see if everybody is okay
because<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.600> might<00:02:43.780> mean<00:02:44.050> that<00:02:44.080> you<00:02:44.440> have<00:02:44.920> a

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
because it might mean that you have a

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.040 
because it might mean that you have a
different<00:02:45.280> problem<00:02:45.610> with<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.360> root<00:02:46.540> system

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
different problem with the root system

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.470 
different problem with the root system
now<00:02:48.040> in<00:02:48.160> Syrians<00:02:48.550> tend<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:49.000> be<00:02:49.120> even<00:02:49.330> more

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
now in Syrians tend to be even more

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.970 
now in Syrians tend to be even more
dramatic<00:02:50.050> if<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.260> have<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.440> problematic

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
dramatic if you have a problematic

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.160 
dramatic if you have a problematic
oncidium<00:02:51.940> that<00:02:52.269> doesn't<00:02:52.540> really<00:02:52.660> have<00:02:52.900> good

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
oncidium that doesn't really have good

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.110 
oncidium that doesn't really have good
roots<00:02:53.320> or<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.860> medium<00:02:54.160> was<00:02:54.430> really<00:02:54.790> not<00:02:54.970> to

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
roots or the medium was really not to

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.990 
roots or the medium was really not to
its<00:02:55.209> liking<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.870> it's<00:02:56.080> pretty<00:02:56.530> dehydrated

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
its liking and it's pretty dehydrated

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.970 
its liking and it's pretty dehydrated
most<00:02:58.000> likely<00:02:58.390> when<00:02:58.630> you<00:02:58.870> report<00:02:59.410> it<00:02:59.590> you're

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
most likely when you report it you're

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.580 
most likely when you report it you're
gonna<00:03:00.160> have<00:03:00.400> some<00:03:00.640> pretty<00:03:00.910> shriveled

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
gonna have some pretty shriveled

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.660 
gonna have some pretty shriveled
pseudobulbs<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:02.769> many<00:03:02.920> of<00:03:03.070> you<00:03:03.220> have<00:03:03.400> asked

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
pseudobulbs and many of you have asked

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.850 
pseudobulbs and many of you have asked
me<00:03:03.790> if<00:03:03.970> they<00:03:04.209> do<00:03:04.269> plump<00:03:04.840> up<00:03:04.989> because<00:03:05.650> some

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
me if they do plump up because some

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.250 
me if they do plump up because some
sources<00:03:06.280> say<00:03:06.519> they<00:03:06.730> will<00:03:06.880> never<00:03:07.090> plump<00:03:07.870> up<00:03:08.050> and

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
sources say they will never plump up and

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.949 
sources say they will never plump up and
some<00:03:09.040> say<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.670> there<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.360> will<00:03:10.510> return<00:03:10.900> to

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
some say that there you will return to

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:11.430 
some say that there you will return to
normal

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
normal

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.650 
normal
well<00:03:11.709> I<00:03:12.010> can<00:03:12.580> tell<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:12.940> that<00:03:13.120> they<00:03:13.450> will<00:03:13.600> not

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
well I can tell you that they will not

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.120 
well I can tell you that they will not
fully<00:03:14.410> return<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.310> normal<00:03:16.140> but<00:03:17.140> if<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:17.950> can

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
fully return to normal but if you can

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.670 
fully return to normal but if you can
believe<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.459> these<00:03:19.180> all<00:03:19.540> these<00:03:19.870> pseudo<00:03:20.260> bulbs

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
believe it these all these pseudo bulbs

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.240 
believe it these all these pseudo bulbs
were<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.370> size<00:03:21.640> of<00:03:21.820> a<00:03:21.910> leaf<00:03:22.120> or<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:23.799> width<00:03:24.070> of

were the size of a leaf or the width of

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.640 
were the size of a leaf or the width of
a<00:03:24.459> leaf<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:25.030> look<00:03:25.450> at<00:03:25.600> this<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:25.959> reported<00:03:26.530> this

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
a leaf and look at this I reported this

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.920 
a leaf and look at this I reported this
guy<00:03:26.890> into<00:03:27.220> a<00:03:27.250> more<00:03:27.549> water<00:03:27.910> retentive<00:03:28.329> medium

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
guy into a more water retentive medium

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.979 
guy into a more water retentive medium
and<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.950> old<00:03:30.100> pseudobulbs<00:03:30.850> got<00:03:31.480> really

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
and the old pseudobulbs got really

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.690 
and the old pseudobulbs got really
really<00:03:32.290> plump<00:03:32.560> of<00:03:32.799> course<00:03:33.160> they<00:03:33.310> do<00:03:33.370> have<00:03:33.519> a

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
really plump of course they do have a

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.789 
really plump of course they do have a
few<00:03:34.060> wrinkles<00:03:34.269> here<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:34.810> there<00:03:34.989> but<00:03:35.500> their

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
few wrinkles here and there but their

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.190 
few wrinkles here and there but their
width<00:03:36.160> is<00:03:36.430> really<00:03:37.030> back<00:03:37.299> to<00:03:37.329> normal<00:03:37.930> I<00:03:38.140> would

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
width is really back to normal I would

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.580 
width is really back to normal I would
say<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:39.459> this<00:03:39.730> guy<00:03:40.000> stayed<00:03:40.510> really<00:03:41.140> really

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
say and this guy stayed really really

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.250 
say and this guy stayed really really
wrinkly<00:03:41.950> for<00:03:42.340> six<00:03:42.730> months<00:03:43.269> or<00:03:43.450> so<00:03:43.660> until<00:03:44.230> I

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
wrinkly for six months or so until I

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.140 
wrinkly for six months or so until I
figured<00:03:44.799> out<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.280> potting<00:03:45.640> medium<00:03:45.970> was

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
figured out the potting medium was

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.600 
figured out the potting medium was
really<00:03:46.390> not<00:03:46.570> to<00:03:46.720> its<00:03:46.840> liking<00:03:47.290> so<00:03:47.950> yeah<00:03:48.489> I'm

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
really not to its liking so yeah I'm

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.550 
really not to its liking so yeah I'm
using<00:03:48.790> coconut<00:03:49.030> husk<00:03:49.480> of<00:03:49.660> this<00:03:49.870> guy<00:03:50.079> now<00:03:50.290> in

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
using coconut husk of this guy now in

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.289 
using coconut husk of this guy now in
the<00:03:50.650> new<00:03:50.769> suitable<00:03:51.160> student<00:03:51.519> wrinkle<00:03:51.910> at<00:03:52.120> all

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
the new suitable student wrinkle at all

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.710 
the new suitable student wrinkle at all
and<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.900> older<00:03:53.350> ones<00:03:53.730> just<00:03:54.730> plumped<00:03:55.180> back<00:03:55.450> up

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
and the older ones just plumped back up

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.560 
and the older ones just plumped back up
now<00:03:56.530> I've<00:03:56.829> seen<00:03:57.160> that<00:03:57.340> someone's<00:03:57.730> idioms<00:03:58.090> can

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
now I've seen that someone's idioms can

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.440 
now I've seen that someone's idioms can
have<00:03:58.870> an<00:03:59.079> even<00:03:59.350> better<00:03:59.620> recovery<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:01.329> old

have an even better recovery the old

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.090 
have an even better recovery the old
city<00:04:01.720> walls<00:04:01.900> can<00:04:02.200> look<00:04:02.380> even<00:04:02.680> better<00:04:02.950> than

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
city walls can look even better than

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.900 
city walls can look even better than
this<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:03.940> just<00:04:04.299> depends<00:04:04.780> on<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:05.230> acidity

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
this it just depends on the acidity

this it just depends on the acidity
diems<00:04:06.910> might<00:04:07.180> not<00:04:07.450> have<00:04:07.750> quite<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:08.410> good

is<00:04:22.730> pretty<00:04:23.300> normal<00:04:23.570> and<00:04:24.050> I've<00:04:24.140> noticed<00:04:24.530> when
