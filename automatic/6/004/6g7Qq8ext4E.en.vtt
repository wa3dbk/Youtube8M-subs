00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
of material between the two that told me

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.740 
of material between the two that told me
and<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> Pokemon<00:01:02.850> Center<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.420> it's

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and the Pokemon Center and it's

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.070 
and the Pokemon Center and it's
basically<00:01:04.170> consistent<00:01:04.830> with<00:01:04.979> all<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
basically consistent with all the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.649 
basically consistent with all the
differences<00:01:07.080> between<00:01:07.260> those<00:01:07.619> two<00:01:07.830> brands<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
differences between those two brands and

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.880 
differences between those two brands and
the<00:01:09.659> chocolate<00:01:09.990> old<00:01:10.229> one<00:01:10.409> actually<00:01:10.740> has<00:01:10.860> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the chocolate old one actually has a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.330 
the chocolate old one actually has a
beam<00:01:11.330> beanie<00:01:12.330> bag<00:01:13.430> on<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> bottom<00:01:15.770> I<00:01:16.770> think

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
beam beanie bag on the bottom I think

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.490 
beam beanie bag on the bottom I think
the<00:01:17.400> front<00:01:17.640> tip<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.119> more<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.509> shiny<00:01:18.840> shiny

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
the front tip is more of a shiny shiny

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.330 
the front tip is more of a shiny shiny
feel<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.159> rather<00:01:20.369> than<00:01:21.020> tries<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.340> sorry

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
feel to it rather than tries to sorry

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.560 
feel to it rather than tries to sorry
for<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> sound<00:01:23.700> oh<00:01:23.939> there<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.150> goes<00:01:24.330> yeah

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
for the sound oh there it goes yeah

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.480 
for the sound oh there it goes yeah
that's<00:01:24.750> pretty<00:01:24.900> focused<00:01:25.140> yes<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.310> tell

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
that's pretty focused yes you can tell

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.560 
that's pretty focused yes you can tell
us<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.610> little<00:01:26.729> longer<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> little

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
us a little longer and it's a little

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.340 
us a little longer and it's a little
shinier<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:29.159> terms<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.640> colors<00:01:30.350> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
shinier and in terms of colors the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.260 
shinier and in terms of colors the
Pokemon<00:01:32.009> Center<00:01:32.130> one<00:01:32.340> slightly<00:01:32.700> more<00:01:33.000> like

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
Pokemon Center one slightly more like

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.999 
Pokemon Center one slightly more like
sky-blue<00:01:33.950> whereas<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.600> told<00:01:36.600> me<00:01:36.750> one<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.740> more

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
sky-blue whereas the told me one is more

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.090 
sky-blue whereas the told me one is more
like<00:01:38.220> baby<00:01:38.850> blue<00:01:39.210> pastel<00:01:40.079> blue<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.530> there's

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
like baby blue pastel blue it's there's

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.280 
like baby blue pastel blue it's there's
a<00:01:41.189> slight<00:01:41.520> difference<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.090> color<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.570> think

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
a slight difference in color I think

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.810 
a slight difference in color I think
that<00:01:43.380> makes<00:01:43.530> sense<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:44.009> think<00:01:44.610> what<00:01:44.700> we're

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
that makes sense I think what we're

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.080 
that makes sense I think what we're
unboxing<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.600> think<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.840> felt<00:01:46.049> really<00:01:46.200> heavy

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
unboxing it I think it felt really heavy

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.460 
unboxing it I think it felt really heavy
yeah<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.420> had<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> bean<00:01:48.780> bag<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.259> when<00:01:49.350> we

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
yeah is it had a bean bag so when we

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.819 
yeah is it had a bean bag so when we
actually<00:01:49.759> held<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.880> case<00:01:51.320> yeah<00:01:52.320> it's<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.590> lot

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
actually held the case yeah it's a lot

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.539 
actually held the case yeah it's a lot
heavier<00:01:53.659> well<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.689> guess<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.549> better

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
heavier well I guess it's better

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.380 
heavier well I guess it's better
