problem<00:00:38.820> i<00:00:38.969> can't<00:00:39.239> find<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> broken<00:00:39.930> piece<00:00:40.110> so

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
problem i can't find the broken piece so

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.560 
problem i can't find the broken piece so
hopefully<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.590> don't<00:00:40.770> step<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.399> but<00:00:41.610> ok<00:00:42.510> so

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.020 
hopefully I don't step on it but ok so
that's<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.960> con<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.530> these<00:00:44.129> are<00:00:44.460> breakable

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030
