definitely<00:03:44.380> gonna<00:03:44.590> be<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:45.190> more<00:03:45.700> stable

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
definitely gonna be the more stable

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.770 
definitely gonna be the more stable
agile<00:03:47.050> overall<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.700> little<00:03:49.269> bit<00:03:49.360> quicker<00:03:49.570> of<00:03:49.720> a

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
agile overall a little bit quicker of a

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.949 
agile overall a little bit quicker of a
helicopter<00:03:50.350> actually<00:03:50.890> a<00:03:51.040> lot<00:03:51.250> quicker<00:03:51.570> um<00:03:52.600> so

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
helicopter actually a lot quicker um so
