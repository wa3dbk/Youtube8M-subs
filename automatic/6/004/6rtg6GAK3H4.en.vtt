00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 in this video i'm going to explain what's going on 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.000
 happens when you enter the statement letters 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.919
 instead of numbers and sometimes becomes 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.050
 one at gladly with probability and 30 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.580
 used instead of the number 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.590
 in which case basis are not 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.509
 You think through calculations with the letter 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.730
 and I'm going to be using two 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.630
 show examples 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.680
 first the example where the just 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.710
 numbers of the two 6000 tests 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.050
 students is 248 students 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.390
 cycle at least three in their student days 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.790
 stolen what is 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.380
 based on this data the chance that 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.790
 there in a friends group of nine 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.559
 students 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.809
 you have a student whose bike 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.320
 steamed at least three times 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.960
 so there are 248 unhappy student 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.670
 their bicycle is often stolen 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.960
 And what's the chance that you're in a friends 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.230
 group of 9 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.520
 she 's so unhappy about someone 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.829
 so now no or 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.140
 because yes it is exactly a student of 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.640
 the nine it can in nine ways because 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.989
 it is once more no curdled if you 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.949
 must see for you that you have one out of you 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.659
 with on well that you are us or not 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.560
 your bike people streaker gets stolen 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.260
 so now not eight times and once 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.250
 well so its not in this diet and one 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.900
 times 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.759
 and so that can rank travel choices 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.299
 in nine ways 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.770
 the chance is now those who whose 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.340
 cyclists started at least three times 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.180
 is becoming 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.240
 so that is one of those 248 and yes part 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.400
 gravel or whole is two ounces 48 hours 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.299
 62100 is the chance that you will hear tell there 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.560
 but 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.880
 And then yes the chance that you are not there 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.439
 then you belong to the other one 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.030
 group a different angle so two sons to 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.439
 100 min collects 48 so that they are 5962 of those 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.000
 62100 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.040
 who do it on size 8 there are 8 people 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.750
 in the group that is not with that 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.540
 small group that was from the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.979
 features are often asked and that must be 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.000
 still turns to ways and then to 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.700
 you come to 0.2 6 3 it's the odds pike 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.770
 with 263 that of a group of nine 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.829
 students a stencil from at least since 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.429
 snares 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.009
 ok now you have to introduce yourself 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.410
 that you had received this question in style 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.330
 existed in the question this of the 260 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.950
 for students in Utrecht because there is a fall 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.630
 to students to bike in their 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.030
 student time people I stole from you 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.280
 what is going out or most data the chance 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.660
 the one finger group of nine students 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.060
 exactly a student show off the bike 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.160
 monster truck recovered so that they are the same 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.480
 question is just the only change 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.870
 that we now find us forty-eight 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.220
 is the letter is on 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.720
 nevertheless we decide on the chops 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.240
 go exactly the same from living our net 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.850
 so again no or more nine ways 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.830
 but just had 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.470
 those who do it digitus least three 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.230
 once it was stolen it was 248 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.780
 100 his sister 100 part 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.240
 where the happening of the freon is now 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.680
 that part is no trams 840 is true 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.120
 just this is really not what it is 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.360
 number is where are your skin us from 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.190
 just to compromised his sister 100 and 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.020
 than the other group of which the 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.590
 don't cycle people three times 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.560
 being that is is 62 100 min that portion 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.290
 at home it is a thorough lover in the 6200 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.510
 to video city the chance that you bike 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.660
 light people have tricks tom well there 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.950
 we are 8 people from that to power 8 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.140
 and then still returns nine ways 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.130
 that's it then you have it 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.200
 answer 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.330
 and then you would have those 9 here that are still you 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.630
 put above children to simplify 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.709
 but yes now beautiful than this you do not go 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.630
 to get 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.030
 this is this is the answer to that question 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.010
 you are just in a in the answer 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.540
 we were not out because the endless 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.880
 so naturally you get one 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.860
 letter your answer so true simple 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.600
 Questions answered correctly You see that he 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.010
 no more difficult than the question with the 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.720
 numbers but yes it looks 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.030
 It must be more complicated with it 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.530
 so that some talma actually 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.270
 exactly the same 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.130
 so that's what i want to say about it 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.470
 letters instead of numbers with a 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.989
 question do you have questions about it please ask 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.440
 just below and then you live thank you 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.440
 for watching
