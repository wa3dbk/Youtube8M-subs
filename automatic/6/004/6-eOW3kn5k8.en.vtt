generously floured board to actually
shape<00:03:23.270> it<00:03:23.420> into<00:03:23.600> a<00:03:23.750> ball

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.650 

I<00:03:35.910> always<00:03:36.720> lean<00:03:37.710> on<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:37.890> little<00:03:38.280> extra<00:03:38.520> flour<00:03:39.240> to

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
I always lean on a little extra flour to

00:03:39.660 --> 00:04:02.970 
I always lean on a little extra flour to
the<00:03:39.750> side<00:03:39.960> for<00:03:40.380> when<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.620> do<00:03:40.680> this

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.350 

alright<00:04:03.980> once<00:04:04.159> you've<00:04:04.310> gotten<00:04:04.579> in<00:04:04.790> shape<00:04:05.030> into

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
alright once you've gotten in shape into

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.479 
alright once you've gotten in shape into
a<00:04:05.390> ball<00:04:05.480> and<00:04:05.900> it's<00:04:06.200> no<00:04:06.409> longer<00:04:06.469> sticky<00:04:06.859> you're

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
a ball and it's no longer sticky you're

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:08.949 
a ball and it's no longer sticky you're
actually<00:04:07.790> going<00:04:07.909> to<00:04:08.000> want<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:08.209> cut<00:04:08.420> it<00:04:08.540> in<00:04:08.689> half

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
actually going to want to cut it in half

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.670 
actually going to want to cut it in half
with<00:04:09.379> a<00:04:09.439> sharp<00:04:09.799> knife<00:04:11.109> so<00:04:12.109> you<00:04:12.170> can<00:04:12.349> form<00:04:12.620> two

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
with a sharp knife so you can form two

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:25.180 
with a sharp knife so you can form two
separate<00:04:13.989> rows<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:24.740> then<00:04:24.919> you're<00:04:25.039> going<00:04:25.130> to

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
separate rows and then you're going to

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.879 
separate rows and then you're going to
form<00:04:25.430> those<00:04:25.580> two<00:04:25.610> separate<00:04:26.090> books<00:04:26.240> into<00:04:26.960> their

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
form those two separate books into their

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:42.350 
form those two separate books into their
own<00:04:28.270> little<00:04:29.270> ball

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:55.159 

this<00:04:43.360> here's<00:04:43.569> from<00:04:43.719> my<00:04:43.840> experiment<00:04:44.469> later

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.300 

once<00:04:56.169> you<00:04:56.319> have<00:04:56.349> informed<00:04:56.919> it<00:04:57.009> into<00:04:57.129> two

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
once you have informed it into two

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.679 
once you have informed it into two
separate<00:04:57.669> balls<00:04:57.939> you're<00:04:58.210> going<00:04:58.389> to<00:04:58.449> want<00:04:58.599> to

00:04:58.679 --> 00:04:58.689 
separate balls you're going to want to

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:01.550 
separate balls you're going to want to
slice<00:04:59.199> an<00:04:59.469> X<00:04:59.770> into<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:00.639> middle<00:05:00.879> of<00:05:01.029> them

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
slice an X into the middle of them

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.070 
slice an X into the middle of them
because<00:05:02.560> when<00:05:02.919> they<00:05:03.819> start<00:05:04.509> to<00:05:04.629> bake<00:05:04.810> they'll

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
because when they start to bake they'll

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.619 
because when they start to bake they'll
actually<00:05:05.590> split<00:05:06.069> and<00:05:06.370> it<00:05:06.819> helps<00:05:07.090> it<00:05:07.210> bake<00:05:07.449> a

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:07.629 
actually split and it helps it bake a

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:26.359 
actually split and it helps it bake a
little<00:05:07.870> bit<00:05:07.990> more<00:05:08.139> evenly

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:26.369 

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:30.119 

then<00:05:27.369> you<00:05:27.520> gonna<00:05:28.270> place<00:05:28.569> them<00:05:28.779> on<00:05:29.050> your<00:05:29.129> sheet

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:30.129 
then you gonna place them on your sheet

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.359 
then you gonna place them on your sheet
a<00:05:30.809> greased<00:05:31.809> baking<00:05:32.050> sheet<00:05:32.319> or<00:05:32.710> if<00:05:33.129> you'd<00:05:33.339> like

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
using parchment paper like I'm doing

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.980 
using parchment paper like I'm doing
don't<00:05:35.979> use<00:05:36.339> wax<00:05:36.610> paper<00:05:36.759> if<00:05:37.419> you're<00:05:37.719> going<00:05:37.869> to

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.900 

and<00:05:57.740> they're<00:05:58.039> going<00:05:58.160> to<00:05:58.220> bake<00:05:58.460> it<00:05:58.610> for<00:05:58.639> about

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
and they're going to bake it for about

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:05.709 
and they're going to bake it for about
35<00:05:59.570> or<00:05:59.840> 40<00:06:00.169> minutes<00:06:00.380> a<00:06:00.650> few<00:06:00.680> hundred

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:05.719 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:08.719 

all<00:06:06.719> right<00:06:06.869> so<00:06:07.050> we<00:06:07.169> let<00:06:07.379> our<00:06:07.589> brand<00:06:07.949> bake<00:06:08.249> for
