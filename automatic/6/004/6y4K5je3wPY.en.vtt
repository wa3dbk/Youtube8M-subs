as a basic jet trainer and the pilots

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.850 
as a basic jet trainer and the pilots
were<00:00:33.210> initially<00:00:34.210> started<00:00:34.539> off<00:00:34.600> in<00:00:34.780> Y<00:00:34.809> X<00:00:34.989> 5<00:00:35.620> to

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
were initially started off in Y X 5 to

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.200 
were initially started off in Y X 5 to
sort<00:00:36.070> of<00:00:36.129> seven<00:00:36.370> hours<00:00:36.489> just<00:00:36.789> to<00:00:36.940> get<00:00:37.030> them

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
sort of seven hours just to get them

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.759 
sort of seven hours just to get them
used<00:00:37.449> to<00:00:37.570> flying<00:00:37.780> an<00:00:37.929> aeroplane<00:00:38.050> and<00:00:38.469> then

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
used to flying an aeroplane and then

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:39.930 
used to flying an aeroplane and then
they<00:00:38.859> put<00:00:39.039> them<00:00:39.159> in<00:00:39.249> these<00:00:39.399> things<00:00:39.640> before

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
they put them in these things before

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.090 
they put them in these things before
strapping<00:00:40.329> in<00:00:40.449> them<00:00:40.839> into<00:00:41.170> a<00:00:41.199> mix<00:00:41.469> so<00:00:41.739> it's<00:00:41.920> a

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
strapping in them into a mix so it's a

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.090 
strapping in them into a mix so it's a
bit<00:00:42.699> of<00:00:42.789> a<00:00:42.879> bit<00:00:43.149> of<00:00:43.239> an<00:00:43.329> upgrade<00:00:43.980> going<00:00:44.980> through

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
bit of a bit of an upgrade going through

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.189 
bit of a bit of an upgrade going through
things<00:00:45.219> quite<00:00:45.519> quickly<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:46.629> Europe<00:00:47.019> plane

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
things quite quickly the Europe plane

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:48.689 
things quite quickly the Europe plane
it's<00:00:47.440> been<00:00:47.589> in<00:00:47.710> this<00:00:47.769> country<00:00:48.159> now<00:00:48.309> since<00:00:48.609> I

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
it's been in this country now since I

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.479 
it's been in this country now since I
think<00:00:48.850> about<00:00:49.059> 2001<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:51.190> was<00:00:51.249> initially

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
think about 2001 it was initially

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:52.799 
think about 2001 it was initially
brought<00:00:51.699> in<00:00:51.909> just<00:00:52.059> as<00:00:52.149> basically<00:00:52.479> a<00:00:52.569> private

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
brought in just as basically a private

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.319 
brought in just as basically a private
run<00:00:53.109> around<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.489> we<00:00:54.579> bought<00:00:54.729> the<00:00:54.879> airplane<00:00:55.149> in

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
run around and we bought the airplane in

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.719 
run around and we bought the airplane in
2008<00:00:56.139> lovely<00:00:57.039> airplane<00:00:57.370> fly<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:59.469> not

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
2008 lovely airplane fly it's not

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.459 
2008 lovely airplane fly it's not
particularly<00:01:00.729> fast<00:01:01.030> as<00:01:01.359> as<00:01:01.870> jets<00:01:02.229> go<00:01:02.440> by

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
particularly fast as as jets go by

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.110 
particularly fast as as jets go by
normal<00:01:03.190> jet<00:01:03.309> standard<00:01:03.699> it's<00:01:03.850> not<00:01:03.969> one<00:01:04.089> of

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
normal jet standard it's not one of

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.750 
normal jet standard it's not one of
those<00:01:04.269> airplanes<00:01:04.930> that<00:01:05.400> throws<00:01:06.400> you<00:01:06.580> into<00:01:06.670> the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
those airplanes that throws you into the

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.040 
those airplanes that throws you into the
back<00:01:06.880> of<00:01:07.030> your<00:01:07.120> seat<00:01:07.330> and<00:01:07.479> you<00:01:07.630> climb<00:01:07.930> away

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
back of your seat and you climb away

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.510 
back of your seat and you climb away
vertically<00:01:08.620> it's<00:01:08.830> a<00:01:09.130> very<00:01:09.610> very<00:01:10.080> docile

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
vertically it's a very very docile

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.940 
vertically it's a very very docile
aircraft<00:01:12.810> performs<00:01:13.810> quite<00:01:14.260> poorly<00:01:14.530> if<00:01:14.860> you

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
aircraft performs quite poorly if you

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.560 
aircraft performs quite poorly if you
think<00:01:15.160> about<00:01:15.310> it<00:01:15.430> compared<00:01:15.760> to<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:15.880> most<00:01:16.030> most

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
think about it compared to the most most

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.690 
think about it compared to the most most
jet<00:01:16.810> airplanes<00:01:17.230> once<00:01:18.100> it<00:01:18.220> gets<00:01:18.340> going<00:01:18.400> though

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
jet airplanes once it gets going though

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.630 
jet airplanes once it gets going though
it<00:01:18.790> goes<00:01:18.940> quite<00:01:19.180> well<00:01:19.240> does<00:01:19.900> 800<00:01:20.830> kazar<00:01:21.190> now<00:01:21.310> so

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
it goes quite well does 800 kazar now so

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.260 
it goes quite well does 800 kazar now so
relatively<00:01:22.390> fast<00:01:23.280> quite<00:01:24.280> maneuverable<00:01:24.490> we<00:01:25.120> do

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
relatively fast quite maneuverable we do

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.730 
relatively fast quite maneuverable we do
a<00:01:25.510> lot<00:01:25.630> of<00:01:25.750> different<00:01:26.020> sort<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.200> aerobatics

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
a lot of different sort of aerobatics

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.850 
a lot of different sort of aerobatics
ranging<00:01:27.280> from<00:01:27.750> barrel<00:01:28.750> rolls<00:01:28.960> aileron<00:01:29.620> rolls

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
ranging from barrel rolls aileron rolls

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.830 
ranging from barrel rolls aileron rolls
to<00:01:30.100> loops<00:01:30.310> with<00:01:30.910> a<00:01:30.940> range<00:01:31.180> of<00:01:31.300> g-forces

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
to loops with a range of g-forces

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.920 
to loops with a range of g-forces
experience<00:01:32.560> between<00:01:32.710> 2<00:01:33.370> and<00:01:33.730> up<00:01:34.150> to<00:01:34.300> 6<00:01:34.510> GS

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
experience between 2 and up to 6 GS

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.110 
experience between 2 and up to 6 GS
so<00:01:35.380> quite<00:01:35.860> a<00:01:35.890> lot<00:01:36.040> quite<00:01:36.730> a<00:01:36.760> lot<00:01:36.880> lovely

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
so quite a lot quite a lot lovely

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.390 
so quite a lot quite a lot lovely
airplane<00:01:37.480> to<00:01:37.630> fly<00:01:37.660> very<00:01:38.530> very<00:01:38.770> simple<00:01:39.190> the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
airplane to fly very very simple the

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.710 
airplane to fly very very simple the
systems<00:01:39.820> very<00:01:40.540> very<00:01:40.750> simple<00:01:41.370> lots<00:01:42.370> of<00:01:42.460> very

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
systems very very simple lots of very

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.170 
systems very very simple lots of very
clever<00:01:43.720> unique<00:01:44.290> functions<00:01:44.770> in<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:45.850> airplane

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
clever unique functions in the airplane

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.380 
clever unique functions in the airplane
make<00:01:46.870> it<00:01:47.020> easy<00:01:47.170> for<00:01:47.320> just<00:01:48.040> general<00:01:48.430> pilot<00:01:49.330> to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
make it easy for just general pilot to

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.310 
make it easy for just general pilot to
fly<00:01:50.190> now<00:01:51.190> just<00:01:51.700> enough<00:01:51.940> I<00:01:52.330> myself<00:01:53.020> didn't

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
fly now just enough I myself didn't

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.600 
fly now just enough I myself didn't
realize<00:01:53.530> that<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:53.740> aircraft<00:01:54.040> had<00:01:54.160> been<00:01:54.190> here

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
realize that the aircraft had been here

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.980 
realize that the aircraft had been here
in<00:01:54.820> New<00:01:54.910> Zealand<00:01:54.940> for<00:01:55.240> so<00:01:55.390> long<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:55.960> know

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
in New Zealand for so long you know

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.290

while at one point there was a SoCo

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.330 
while at one point there was a SoCo
Galib<00:02:01.900> here<00:02:02.140> which<00:02:02.320> was<00:02:02.500> also<00:02:02.800> a<00:02:02.830> chick<00:02:03.070> build

had quite a quite a aircraft favourite
you<00:02:07.330> know<00:02:07.390> design<00:02:07.690> they<00:02:08.349> do<00:02:08.409> they<00:02:08.860> still<00:02:09.099> do

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
you know design they do they still do

you know design they do they still do
they<00:02:09.670> still<00:02:09.940> make

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
they still make

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.420 
they still make
arrividerci<00:02:11.050> that<00:02:11.530> built<00:02:11.769> this<00:02:11.920> aircraft

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
arrividerci that built this aircraft

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.000 
arrividerci that built this aircraft
still<00:02:12.670> exists<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.810> builds<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.470> variant<00:02:14.920> of

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
still exists and builds the variant of

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.350 
still exists and builds the variant of
the<00:02:15.160> l-39<00:02:15.520> which<00:02:16.000> is

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
the l-39 which is

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.420 
the l-39 which is
successor<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:17.020> this<00:02:17.200> but<00:02:18.130> they've<00:02:18.250> been

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
successor to this but they've been

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.400 
successor to this but they've been
building<00:02:19.060> airplanes<00:02:19.330> for<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.780> very<00:02:20.200> long<00:02:20.380> time

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
building airplanes for a very long time

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.770 
building airplanes for a very long time
now<00:02:20.860> they've<00:02:21.040> built<00:02:21.250> about<00:02:21.760> 5000<00:02:22.570> of<00:02:22.690> these

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
now they've built about 5000 of these

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.400 
now they've built about 5000 of these
things

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
things

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.140 
things
two<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:23.950> our<00:02:24.070> two<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.460> half<00:02:24.550> thousand<00:02:25.000> which

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
two of our two and a half thousand which

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.990 
two of our two and a half thousand which
went<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.480> just<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.020> Soviet<00:02:26.380> Air<00:02:26.500> Force<00:02:26.710> alone

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
went to just the Soviet Air Force alone

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.220 
went to just the Soviet Air Force alone
so<00:02:28.000> they've<00:02:28.120> had<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.300> very<00:02:29.340> long<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.550> prolific

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
so they've had a very long and prolific

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.140 
so they've had a very long and prolific
history<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.380> producing<00:02:32.950> airplanes<00:02:33.370> engine<00:02:34.060> as

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
history of producing airplanes engine as

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.060 
history of producing airplanes engine as
well<00:02:34.300> also<00:02:34.780> built<00:02:35.020> by<00:02:35.080> Czechoslovakian

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
well also built by Czechoslovakian

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.670 
well also built by Czechoslovakian
company<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:36.850> it's<00:02:37.450> all<00:02:37.660> designed<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.470> built

second<00:03:26.320> I<00:03:26.350> spend<00:03:26.410> in<00:03:26.680> this<00:03:26.709> airplane<00:03:27.040> so<00:03:27.580> I

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
second I spend in this airplane so I

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.160 
second I spend in this airplane so I
guess<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.330> fact<00:03:28.480> that<00:03:28.660> it<00:03:28.750> is<00:03:28.900> actually

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
guess the fact that it is actually

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.930 
guess the fact that it is actually
designed<00:03:29.350> as<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.709> trainer<00:03:30.040> aircraft<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:30.880> the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
designed as a trainer aircraft and the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.490 
designed as a trainer aircraft and the
star<00:03:31.150> does<00:03:31.390> make<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:31.780> a<00:03:31.840> bit<00:03:31.959> easier<00:03:31.989> for<00:03:32.320> a

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
star does make it a bit easier for a

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.259 
star does make it a bit easier for a
civil<00:03:32.769> partner<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.160> transition<00:03:33.610> for<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.000> civil

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
civil partner to transition for a civil
