00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.859
 how about I'm galvanic chapters too 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.110
 known as the 1000 and in this little 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.410
 video of a science granite we are going to 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.539
 see the basic difference at least source 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:19.060
 in an understandable way of what a 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:19.060
 core i3 i5 or i7 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.860
 well it is rebounding is a little bit to the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.320
 history we are going to realize that it makes 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.239
 enough years was enough to see the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.820
 megahertz amount that had a 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.879
 team for us to be able to tell you if 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.160
 this team is better and therefore 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.160
 they have more megahertz and obviously 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.300
 however now this with the 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.149
 emergence of new features 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.070
 as the cache memory and even the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.070
 number of memories that the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.079
 processors the processing of 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.150
 video that have each one of them integrated 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.129
 the processors well then we come across 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.379
 with different characteristics that make 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.080
 vary greatly the price of 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.390
 processors for example these days 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.399
 you can go and find us in a 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.619
 laptop or a desktop computer that you 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.750
 you want to bring a processor and three to 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.470
 three trips and all find one that 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.840
 brings 15 to 2.5 and yet the i5 goes to 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.670
 be more expensive and you'll wonder why if 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.310
 they have less megahertz the i5 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.470
 well that's where the explanation comes in 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.170
 of all these characteristics that now 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.090
 They give greater value to a processor where 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.750
 no longer necessarily the amount of 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.720
 megahertz is the most characteristic 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.180
 important 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.310
 in our days making a review 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.110
 obviously from the intel processors 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.890
 Well, internal offers what is the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.280
 i3 i5 and the i7 and the differences are 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.750
 basic but quite important 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.090
 within the first options 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.619
 we found what is the i3 that 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.229
 obviously it's the most processor 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.600
 economic that intel offers us the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.430
 processor and 3 and they also include two 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.440
 nuclei and you can tell me they have 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.149
 found in a and three and the seen the 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.030
 number of cores and four appear 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.280
 yes but only two of them are 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.440
 physical and the others are virtualized 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.870
 this means that using technology 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.850
 ht and does not mean it's bad without 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.350
 However, if you put a processor 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.690
 four real cores against one 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.340
 processor and three that you simulated good 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.650
 because the quad-core processor goes 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.200
 to be real but then what utility 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.180
 have to have four of them two 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.459
 simulated good the fact that simulate 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.739
 two makes it a good processor for 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.390
 do multitasking which is what we 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.450
 offers current operating systems 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.190
 like the windows operating system or the 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.230
 operating systems based on inah 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.880
 well what tasks can you perform with a 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.890
 and three when I recommend it 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.630
 only for office tasks to 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.730
 Internet tasks obviously all the 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.010
 your social networks small games 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.380
 even a little more complex games without 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.110
 doubt they will run although not with the greatest 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.150
 amount of details but good we talk 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.620
 that the 13 is the processor of the minor 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.690
 cost 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.500
 the second option offered by intel 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.230
 core i5 the core i5 includes two to four 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.480
 real nuclei these are no longer simulated 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.930
 which allows much processing 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.819
 heavier also include more memory 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.250
 cache is an internal memory that 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.010
 use for data exchange so 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.650
 fast 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.079
 it also includes turbo technology 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.060
 technology had you help us to 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.360
 increase the speed of these cores 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.939
 automatically which is that we 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.560
 will allow that if in some program 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:42.329
 require more 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.659
 good processing then at that time 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.790
 he's going to get it and I for you 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.950
 I recommend that you use a and 5 - yes to you 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.140
 you like to play with more amount of 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.079
 detail because it is certainly a good 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.359
 option in addition to all the options that 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.730
 do and three things from offices networks 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.190
 social and even a little bit of the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.170
 slightly heavier processing this is 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.360
 video or experimentation 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.480
 and finally the last option that we 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.760
 t offer the core i7 is one of the 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.489
 more expensive processors that goes up to the 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.440
 800 or a little more dollars for each 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.870
 one of these processors that without 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.000
 But I can tell you it's worth it 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.070
 because I use one are processors 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.889
 that go from the two nuclei to the 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.380
 eight real cores have a lot more 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.389
 psuv cache has the ability to 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.430
 control much more ram memory than 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.500
 any of the other two have a 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.080
 variable electrical consumption that wants 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.940
 say that depending on the amount of 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.950
 tasks that you are not demanding because it is 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.780
 which will consume and that what 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.430
 causes it to be completely 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.130
 silent if you are running the 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.810
 system nothing else the operating system 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.330
 practically does not make noise except that 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.610
 you put the very heavy processing 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.600
 besides these processors already have 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.740
 in an integrated way 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.900
 a very good graphic processing if you 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.450
 you want games you can practically 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.970
 climb to the top to the details depending 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.880
 of the game obviously but you can upload 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.190
 to the top the details and will process it 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.140
 without any problem 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.360
 and obviously what you can do 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:21.710
 Well, you can do everything we've already said 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.000
 of the processors and 5 and 3 and besides me 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.730
 I would add that you can make a 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.620
 much more extensive processing a lot 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.979
 heavier 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.919
 of vilar data in processing 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.970
 data in question to videos processing 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.190
 in terms of experimentation 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:40.630
 scientific that in particular is something that 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:43.660
 I do and the processor is going to give you the 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.610
 better performance you can expect 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.980
 so I hope that with this little and 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.800
 brief explanation if you have to take 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.260
 the decision to buy a 3 1 and 5 1 and 7 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.910
 depending on your budget watching 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.640
 exactly what do you want to do 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:00.120
 Well you read an idea with this video and 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.460
 now you can make the decision 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.320
 and as always if you liked the video you 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.930
 I recommend that you subscribe to the channel that 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.180
 it's your channel we 're making it grow and 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:12.030
 we are going to have this type of capsules a 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:15.060
 or twice a week explaining some 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.220
 theme that is fashionable or that I believe that 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.530
 some explanation is required in a way 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.650
 very simple so that we can all 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:25.160
 understand so I see them in the next 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.160
 video
