00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
experiences from the World Cup it's hard

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.850

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
I don't always want to dwell on the past

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.400 
I don't always want to dwell on the past
experiences<00:01:57.610> or<00:01:57.850> bring<00:01:58.330> up<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:59.080> victory

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
experiences or bring up the victory

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.559 
experiences or bring up the victory
because<00:01:59.649> I<00:01:59.830> don't<00:02:00.160> it's<00:02:00.399> it's<00:02:00.850> a<00:02:00.910> new<00:02:01.060> team<00:02:01.300> and

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
because I don't it's it's a new team and

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.270 
because I don't it's it's a new team and
I<00:02:01.720> have<00:02:01.869> I<00:02:02.110> had<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.530> recognize<00:02:02.890> that<00:02:03.009> it<00:02:03.190> took

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
I have I had to recognize that it took

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.730 
I have I had to recognize that it took
me<00:02:03.459> a<00:02:03.490> while<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:04.110> understand<00:02:05.110> that<00:02:05.259> this<00:02:05.500> is<00:02:05.709> a

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
me a while to understand that this is a

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.490 
me a while to understand that this is a
completely<00:02:06.280> new<00:02:06.759> journey<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.810> think

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
completely new journey and I think

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.449 
completely new journey and I think
that's<00:02:08.619> what's<00:02:08.740> gonna<00:02:08.800> make<00:02:09.039> it<00:02:09.160> so<00:02:09.280> special

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
that's what's gonna make it so special

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.490 
that's what's gonna make it so special
is<00:02:09.640> I'm<00:02:09.759> not<00:02:09.850> trying<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:10.149> recreate<00:02:10.660> what<00:02:11.380> it

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
is I'm not trying to recreate what it

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.170 
is I'm not trying to recreate what it
what<00:02:11.980> that<00:02:12.010> journey<00:02:12.430> was<00:02:12.700> it's<00:02:12.880> gonna<00:02:12.970> be

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
what that journey was it's gonna be

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.339 
what that journey was it's gonna be
completely<00:02:13.330> different<00:02:13.660> hopefully<00:02:13.959> with<00:02:14.260> the

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
completely different hopefully with the

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.660 
completely different hopefully with the
same<00:02:14.500> result<00:02:14.830> but<00:02:14.950> just<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.220> different<00:02:15.340> way<00:02:15.640> of

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
same result but just a different way of

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.410 
same result but just a different way of
getting<00:02:15.910> there<00:02:16.290> she<00:02:17.290> brings<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.770> ton<00:02:18.040> of

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
getting there she brings a ton of

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.490 
getting there she brings a ton of
experience<00:02:19.420> based<00:02:19.870> on<00:02:19.990> her<00:02:20.170> World<00:02:20.349> Cup

experience she brings a great leadership

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.070

quality incredible communication simply

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.870 
quality incredible communication simply
because<00:02:26.380> she's<00:02:27.190> been<00:02:27.370> there<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:27.610> she's<00:02:27.760> done

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
cycle this year is gonna pay huge

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.970 
cycle this year is gonna pay huge
dividends<00:02:36.630> specifically<00:02:37.630> for<00:02:37.780> our<00:02:37.810> backline

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
dividends specifically for our backline

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.240 
dividends specifically for our backline
on<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.819> field<00:02:41.030> there<00:02:41.180> are<00:02:41.209> things<00:02:41.510> that<00:02:41.690> we<00:02:42.290> go

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
on the field there are things that we go

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.010 
on the field there are things that we go
through<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.880> I<00:02:43.970> recognize<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.630> right<00:02:44.750> in<00:02:44.959> the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
through and I recognize it right in the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.960 
through and I recognize it right in the
moment<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.500> this<00:02:45.920> could<00:02:46.130> lead<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.610> certain

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
moment that this could lead to a certain

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.190 
moment that this could lead to a certain
situation<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.510> I've<00:02:47.599> experienced<00:02:48.080> in<00:02:48.110> the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
situation that I've experienced in the

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.790 
situation that I've experienced in the
World<00:02:48.380> Cup<00:02:48.580> in<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.700> past<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:50.780> am<00:02:51.530> able<00:02:51.650> to

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
World Cup in the past so I am able to

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.380 
World Cup in the past so I am able to
either<00:02:51.980> prevent<00:02:52.340> that<00:02:52.520> situation<00:02:52.640> or<00:02:53.120> direct

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
either prevent that situation or direct

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.940 
either prevent that situation or direct
a<00:02:53.480> player<00:02:53.660> on<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.900> field<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:54.290> say<00:02:54.380> hey<00:02:54.590> step

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
a player on the field and say hey step

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.740 
a player on the field and say hey step
there<00:02:55.220> do<00:02:55.580> this<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:56.060> hopefully<00:02:56.270> we<00:02:56.480> could<00:02:56.600> fix

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
there do this and hopefully we could fix

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.180 
there do this and hopefully we could fix
the<00:02:56.870> situation<00:02:57.319> before<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:57.650> gets<00:02:57.860> worse

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
the situation before it gets worse

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.860 
the situation before it gets worse
and<00:02:58.459> I<00:02:58.819> think<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.180> only<00:02:59.300> reason<00:02:59.450> I'm<00:02:59.600> able<00:02:59.840> to

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
and I think the only reason I'm able to

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.050 
and I think the only reason I'm able to
do<00:03:00.020> that<00:03:00.110> is<00:03:00.260> because<00:03:00.380> I<00:03:01.060> playing

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
do that is because I playing

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.640 
do that is because I playing
side-by-side<00:03:02.569> with<00:03:02.690> Julie<00:03:02.900> Johnson<00:03:03.260> last

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
side-by-side with Julie Johnson last

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.870 
side-by-side with Julie Johnson last
World<00:03:03.950> Cup<00:03:04.010> she<00:03:04.340> was<00:03:04.430> one<00:03:04.550> of<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.700> greatest

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
World Cup she was one of the greatest

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.850 
World Cup she was one of the greatest

game and fight and I think remembering

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.390

that<00:03:39.440> always<00:03:39.709> keeping<00:03:39.950> that<00:03:40.010> in<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.130> back<00:03:40.190> of

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
that always keeping that in the back of

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.360 
that always keeping that in the back of
our<00:03:40.459> minds<00:03:40.700> that<00:03:40.970> we<00:03:41.480> won't<00:03:41.720> just<00:03:41.900> qualify<00:03:42.500> we

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
our minds that we won't just qualify we

our minds that we won't just qualify we
have<00:03:43.519> to<00:03:43.610> win<00:03:43.730> games<00:03:43.970> to<00:03:44.269> qualify<00:03:44.600> for<00:03:44.660> the

World<00:03:44.900> Cup<00:03:44.989> I<00:03:45.170> think<00:03:45.320> that's<00:03:45.470> important<00:03:45.920> that

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040
