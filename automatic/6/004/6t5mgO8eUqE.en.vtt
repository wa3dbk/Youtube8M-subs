my<00:00:00.659> memory<00:00:01.350> was<00:00:01.920> starting<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.340> fail<00:00:02.669> me<00:00:02.970> I

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
my memory was starting to fail me I

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.050 
my memory was starting to fail me I
would<00:00:04.049> forget<00:00:04.350> all<00:00:04.560> kinds<00:00:05.190> of<00:00:05.310> things<00:00:05.580> and

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
would forget all kinds of things and

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.000 
would forget all kinds of things and
something<00:00:07.020> that<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.200> had<00:00:07.350> just<00:00:07.500> said<00:00:07.710> earlier

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
something that I had just said earlier

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.580 
something that I had just said earlier
in<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.309> day<00:00:08.490> would<00:00:09.389> just<00:00:09.690> have<00:00:10.080> completely

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
in the day would just have completely

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.379 
in the day would just have completely
slipped<00:00:10.830> my<00:00:10.920> mind

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
slipped my mind

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.990 
slipped my mind
and<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.750> was<00:00:12.960> worried<00:00:13.500> about<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.790> when<00:00:14.969> I

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
and I was worried about it so when I

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.939 
and I was worried about it so when I
read<00:00:15.240> about<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.780> lipids<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.320> how<00:00:16.560> much<00:00:16.770> it

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
read about the lipids and how much it

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.250 
read about the lipids and how much it
would<00:00:17.070> help<00:00:17.310> with<00:00:17.640> memory<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.330> wanted<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.020> try

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
would help with memory I wanted to try

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.070 
would help with memory I wanted to try
it<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.949> almost<00:00:20.490> forgot<00:00:21.090> my<00:00:21.480> granddaughter's

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
it I almost forgot my granddaughter's

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.529 
it I almost forgot my granddaughter's
birthday<00:00:23.090> and<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.269> would<00:00:24.420> have<00:00:24.510> been

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
birthday and that would have been

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.279 
birthday and that would have been
horrible

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
horrible

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.609 
horrible
it<00:00:25.980> was<00:00:26.160> horrible<00:00:26.640> even<00:00:26.970> then<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.619> had

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
it was horrible even then I had

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.220 
it was horrible even then I had
forgotten<00:00:28.980> lots<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.400> other<00:00:29.580> little<00:00:29.789> things

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
forgotten lots of other little things

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.930 
forgotten lots of other little things
along<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.470> way<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.130> last<00:00:32.340> several<00:00:32.790> months

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
along the way in the last several months

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.690 
along the way in the last several months
I've<00:00:33.450> noticed<00:00:33.480> about<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.860> last<00:00:35.100> six<00:00:35.340> months

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
I've noticed about the last six months

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.760 
I've noticed about the last six months
or<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:35.850> my<00:00:36.450> memory<00:00:36.690> seemed<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.320> be<00:00:37.469> getting

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
or so my memory seemed to be getting

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.830 
or so my memory seemed to be getting
pretty<00:00:38.690> unreliable<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.730> thought<00:00:42.300> I'd

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
pretty unreliable and so I thought I'd

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.900 
pretty unreliable and so I thought I'd
better<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.260> something<00:00:43.649> about<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:44.070> now<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.789> was

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
better do something about it now it was

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.880 
better do something about it now it was
very<00:00:45.149> gradual<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.899> wasn't<00:00:46.260> like<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> sudden

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
very gradual it wasn't like a sudden

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.680 
very gradual it wasn't like a sudden
thing<00:00:47.129> where<00:00:47.520> all<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.969> sudden<00:00:48.300> oh<00:00:48.450> I'm
