00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
to that no it's the biggest team in the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.360 
to that no it's the biggest team in the
country<00:00:39.090> against<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.440> team<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:40.829> very<00:00:41.010> small

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
country against the team it's very small

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.030 
country against the team it's very small
but<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.840> Pride<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> smallest<00:00:43.829> team

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
but in Pride this is the smallest team

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.220 
but in Pride this is the smallest team
in<00:00:44.160> league<00:00:44.570> but<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.600> don't<00:00:45.840> think<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.079> could

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
in league but I don't think we could

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.750 
in league but I don't think we could
beat<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.649> didn't<00:00:46.950> think<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.129> represent<00:00:47.550> very

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
beat I didn't think we represent very

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.700 
beat I didn't think we represent very
well<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:49.579> know<00:00:50.579> they<00:00:50.700> had<00:00:51.170> we<00:00:52.170> had<00:00:52.289> 15

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
well and you know they had we had 15

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.459 
well and you know they had we had 15
defensive<00:00:53.190> rebounds<00:00:53.489> he<00:00:53.550> had<00:00:53.640> 12<00:00:53.850> offensive

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
defensive rebounds he had 12 offensive

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.510 
defensive rebounds he had 12 offensive
so<00:00:55.469> pretty<00:00:55.710> much<00:00:55.829> they<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.219> do<00:00:56.370> they

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520

so pretty much they just do they
obviously<00:00:56.670> had<00:00:57.059> their<00:00:57.239> way<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.840> would<00:00:58.440> have

rate your chances um you know I think

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.610 
rate your chances um you know I think
because<00:03:28.180> of<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.389> character<00:03:29.019> in<00:03:29.139> chemistry<00:03:30.060> I

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
because of the character in chemistry I

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.780 
because of the character in chemistry I
think<00:03:32.620> they<00:03:32.769> certainly<00:03:33.159> they<00:03:33.549> certainly<00:03:33.909> can

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790

offensive team we played them and one of

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.250 
offensive team we played them and one of
the<00:03:42.159> things<00:03:42.220> that<00:03:42.489> I<00:03:42.639> would<00:03:42.849> be<00:03:43.030> just<00:03:43.359> a<00:03:44.230> little

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
the things that I would be just a little

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.149 
the things that I would be just a little
concerned<00:03:44.950> about<00:03:45.069> if<00:03:45.459> if<00:03:46.090> they<00:03:46.359> let<00:03:46.629> them<00:03:46.780> play

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
concerned about if if they let them play

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.449 
concerned about if if they let them play
which<00:03:48.159> I<00:03:48.310> hope<00:03:48.579> they<00:03:48.790> wouldn't<00:03:49.150> be<00:03:49.180> game<00:03:49.599> okay

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
which I hope they wouldn't be game okay

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.589 
which I hope they wouldn't be game okay
there<00:03:51.459> will<00:03:51.609> be<00:03:51.639> new<00:03:51.909> they<00:03:52.090> should<00:03:52.299> be<00:03:52.420> they

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
should have a real good chance i just

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.270 
should have a real good chance i just
would<00:03:54.939> hate<00:03:55.180> that<00:03:55.510> if<00:03:55.989> they<00:03:56.170> all<00:03:56.620> of<00:03:56.859> a<00:03:56.920> sudden

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
would hate that if they all of a sudden

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.439 
would hate that if they all of a sudden
start<00:03:57.519> calling<00:03:57.879> and<00:03:58.000> different<00:03:58.269> in<00:03:58.359> the

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
because if they're very physical they

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.619 
because if they're very physical they

files tonight if that stays the way it
will<00:04:10.840> be<00:04:11.109> i<00:04:11.379> think<00:04:11.530> they<00:04:12.480> only<00:04:13.480> certainly<00:04:13.989> can

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.640 

reason<00:04:17.530> that<00:04:17.680> said<00:04:17.919> have<00:04:18.489> four

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.860 

well<00:04:23.650> I<00:04:23.919> think<00:04:24.039> that<00:04:24.430> look<00:04:25.240> he's<00:04:25.479> got<00:04:25.659> great

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
well I think that look he's got great

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.860 
well I think that look he's got great
size<00:04:26.169> and<00:04:26.499> he<00:04:26.740> can<00:04:27.009> go<00:04:27.189> by<00:04:27.400> you<00:04:27.460> and<00:04:28.240> he's<00:04:28.270> and

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
size and he can go by you and he's and

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.820 
size and he can go by you and he's and
he<00:04:28.930> looks<00:04:29.229> over<00:04:29.439> the<00:04:29.560> top<00:04:29.830> of<00:04:29.860> you<00:04:30.219> and<00:04:31.830> you

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
he looks over the top of you and you

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.350 
he looks over the top of you and you
know<00:04:32.949> so<00:04:33.099> I<00:04:33.189> think<00:04:33.249> you<00:04:33.849> know<00:04:33.879> I<00:04:33.969> could<00:04:34.180> get

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
know so I think you know I could get
