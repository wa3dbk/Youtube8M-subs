going<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.239> do<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.989> know<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.199> has<00:00:58.350> been<00:00:58.469> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
going to do and you know this has been a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.530 
going to do and you know this has been a
lot<00:00:58.769> tougher<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.339> do<00:00:59.430> under<00:00:59.729> use<00:00:59.909> weapons<00:01:00.180> in

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
lot tougher to do under use weapons in

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.210 
lot tougher to do under use weapons in
battlefield<00:01:01.049> 4<00:01:01.110> than<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.589> wasn't<00:01:01.860> battlefield

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
battlefield 4 than it wasn't battlefield

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.619 
battlefield 4 than it wasn't battlefield
3<00:01:02.430> because<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.729> feel<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:02.909> a<00:01:03.119> lot<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
3 because I feel like a lot of the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.749 
3 because I feel like a lot of the
weapons<00:01:04.019> are<00:01:04.140> more<00:01:04.290> balanced<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.519> think

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
weapons are more balanced but I think

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.880 
weapons are more balanced but I think
everyone<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.330> agree<00:01:06.439> that<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.619> most

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
everyone can agree that the most

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.310 
everyone can agree that the most
underpowered<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.820> underused<00:01:09.479> carbine<00:01:10.049> in

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
underpowered and underused carbine in

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.819 
underpowered and underused carbine in
the<00:01:11.100> game<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.150> g36c<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.290> seems<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.799> it

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829 
the game is the g36c it seems like it

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:15.499 
the game is the g36c it seems like it
it's<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> one<00:01:14.490> weapon<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.000> everyone<00:01:15.390> can

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
it's the one weapon that everyone can

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.749 
it's the one weapon that everyone can
agree<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.869> need<00:01:16.380> some<00:01:16.680> sort<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.009> buff<00:01:17.340> because

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
agree on need some sort of buff because

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.030 
agree on need some sort of buff because
it<00:01:18.240> went<00:01:18.450> from<00:01:18.630> being<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.990> really<00:01:19.380> solid<00:01:19.650> choice

are<00:01:31.590> pushed<00:01:32.250> out<00:01:32.430> by<00:01:32.640> dice<00:01:32.909> because<00:01:33.330> it's<00:01:33.540> nice

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
are pushed out by dice because it's nice

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.930 
are pushed out by dice because it's nice
to<00:01:33.900> see<00:01:34.110> where<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.440> weapon<00:01:34.800> was<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:35.490> then

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
to see where the weapon was and then

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.760 
to see where the weapon was and then
where<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.330> was<00:01:36.510> after<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> patch<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.590> think

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
where it was after the patch I think

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.170 
where it was after the patch I think
that's<00:01:37.920> what<00:01:38.040> underused<00:01:38.430> weapons<00:01:38.790> has<00:01:38.909> always

done<00:01:39.330> well<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:40.170> always<00:01:40.320> been<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.530> series<00:01:40.920> that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
done well it's always been a series that

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.219 
done well it's always been a series that
looks<00:01:41.100> at<00:01:41.490> some<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.909> lesser<00:01:42.390> used<00:01:42.659> weapons

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
made me scratch my head whenever I was

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.969 
made me scratch my head whenever I was
looking<00:02:09.989> at<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.229> for<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.409> first<00:02:10.590> time<00:02:10.769> after

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
looking at it for the first time after

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.500 
looking at it for the first time after
unlocking<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.670> was<00:02:11.790> like<00:02:11.909> well<00:02:12.090> why<00:02:12.269> on<00:02:12.420> earth

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
unlocking it was like well why on earth

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.390 
unlocking it was like well why on earth
did<00:02:12.840> dice<00:02:13.049> feel<00:02:13.379> like<00:02:13.650> they<00:02:13.830> needed<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.099> nerf

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
did dice feel like they needed to nerf

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.640 
did dice feel like they needed to nerf
it<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.819> common<00:02:15.390> logic<00:02:15.540> would<00:02:15.840> say<00:02:16.080> typically

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
it and common logic would say typically

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.229 
it and common logic would say typically
when<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.980> fire<00:02:17.250> rate<00:02:17.459> goes<00:02:17.670> down<00:02:17.700> the

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
when the fire rate goes down the

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.880 
when the fire rate goes down the
controllability<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.140> weapon<00:02:19.470> goes<00:02:19.620> up

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
controllability of the weapon goes up

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.250 
controllability of the weapon goes up
dice<00:02:20.519> tends<00:02:20.879> to<00:02:21.120> balance<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.599> out<00:02:21.659> it's<00:02:22.049> the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
dice tends to balance that out it's the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.839 
dice tends to balance that out it's the
way<00:02:22.439> it<00:02:22.590> always<00:02:22.620> has<00:02:22.860> been<00:02:23.069> so<00:02:23.430> if<00:02:23.519> you<00:02:23.610> have<00:02:23.819> a

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
way it always has been so if you have a

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.270 
way it always has been so if you have a
weapon<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.569> has<00:02:25.019> a<00:02:25.049> good<00:02:25.439> you<00:02:25.739> know<00:02:25.830> medium

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
weapon that has a good you know medium

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.429 
weapon that has a good you know medium
fire<00:02:26.519> rate<00:02:26.819> typically<00:02:27.569> it's<00:02:27.810> really<00:02:28.140> easy<00:02:28.319> to

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
fire rate typically it's really easy to

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.289 
fire rate typically it's really easy to
control<00:02:28.799> at<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.189> medium<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.670> long<00:02:29.849> ranges

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
control at the medium the long ranges

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.570 
control at the medium the long ranges
making<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.080> excel<00:02:31.590> in<00:02:31.769> those<00:02:31.890> ranges<00:02:32.280> over

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
making it excel in those ranges over

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.610 
making it excel in those ranges over
something<00:02:32.939> like<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.180> a91<00:02:33.659> which<00:02:34.379> shoots

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
something like the a91 which shoots

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.769 
something like the a91 which shoots
really<00:02:35.069> quick<00:02:35.310> or<00:02:35.700> even<00:02:36.000> like<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.239> mtar<00:02:36.599> which

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:36.779 
really quick or even like the mtar which

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:38.959 
really quick or even like the mtar which
is<00:02:36.930> another<00:02:37.139> fast<00:02:37.439> fire<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.680> weapon<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.340> for

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:38.969 
is another fast fire a weapon and for

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.209 
is another fast fire a weapon and for
some<00:02:39.150> reason<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.540> g36c<00:02:40.169> just<00:02:40.529> doesn't<00:02:40.980> seem

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219 
some reason the g36c just doesn't seem

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:42.140 
some reason the g36c just doesn't seem
to<00:02:41.400> get<00:02:41.519> those<00:02:41.760> bone

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
to get those bone

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.250 
to get those bone
says<00:02:42.299> I<00:02:42.420> mean<00:02:42.569> if<00:02:42.659> you're<00:02:42.780> going<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:42.959> compare

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
says I mean if you're going to compare

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.059 
says I mean if you're going to compare
it<00:02:43.379> to<00:02:43.470> like<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.709> aku<00:02:44.099> 12<00:02:44.579> or<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.329> tight<00:02:45.510> 95<00:02:46.069> it

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
it to like the aku 12 or the tight 95 it

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.770 
it to like the aku 12 or the tight 95 it
really<00:02:47.370> doesn't<00:02:47.819> do<00:02:48.120> anything<00:02:48.450> better<00:02:48.720> than

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
really doesn't do anything better than

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.479 
really doesn't do anything better than
them<00:02:49.079> I<00:02:49.230> mean<00:02:49.379> in<00:02:49.530> most<00:02:49.799> scenarios<00:02:50.040> you're

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
them I mean in most scenarios you're

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.880 
them I mean in most scenarios you're
better<00:02:50.700> off<00:02:50.819> using<00:02:51.209> both<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:52.170> those<00:02:52.260> weapons<00:02:52.560> I

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
better off using both of those weapons I

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.080 
better off using both of those weapons I
mean<00:02:53.040> they<00:02:53.220> do<00:02:53.280> have<00:02:53.640> some<00:02:53.849> slight

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
mean they do have some slight

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.759 
mean they do have some slight
differences<00:02:54.299> here<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.870> there<00:02:55.019> but<00:02:55.230> for<00:02:55.709> the

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
differences here and there but for the

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.350 
differences here and there but for the
most<00:02:55.860> part<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.549> an<00:02:56.670> easier<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.180> control

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
most part it is an easier to control

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.660 
most part it is an easier to control
weapon<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.079> same<00:02:58.290> with<00:02:58.439> the<00:02:58.530> tight<00:02:59.129> 95<00:02:59.340> you

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
weapon the same with the tight 95 you

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.910 
weapon the same with the tight 95 you
know<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.849> cube<00:03:00.090> z-95<00:03:00.750> same<00:03:01.260> same<00:03:01.620> weapon<00:03:01.890> that

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
know the cube z-95 same same weapon that

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.360 
know the cube z-95 same same weapon that
was<00:03:02.069> in<00:03:02.250> battlefield<00:03:02.909> 3<00:03:02.939> so<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:04.079> find<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.069> hard

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
was in battlefield 3 so I find a hard

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.479 
was in battlefield 3 so I find a hard
time<00:03:05.640> really<00:03:06.540> breaking<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.290> g36<00:03:07.980> down<00:03:08.189> as<00:03:08.459> a

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
time really breaking the g36 down as a

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.520 
time really breaking the g36 down as a
usable<00:03:09.150> weapon<00:03:09.540> now<00:03:09.689> I'm<00:03:09.810> sure<00:03:10.019> there's<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.290> lot

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
usable weapon now I'm sure there's a lot

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.259

the g36c like it kind of surprised me

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.500 
the g36c like it kind of surprised me
when<00:03:20.489> I<00:03:20.549> was<00:03:20.670> doing<00:03:20.760> this<00:03:20.940> video<00:03:21.180> was<00:03:21.299> going

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
when I was doing this video was going

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.819 
when I was doing this video was going
scrolling<00:03:22.109> through<00:03:22.260> in<00:03:22.349> a<00:03:22.379> sick<00:03:22.530> man<00:03:22.680> I've

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
scrolling through in a sick man I've

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.680 
scrolling through in a sick man I've
actually<00:03:23.250> racked<00:03:23.760> up<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:24.060> lot<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.359> kills<00:03:24.569> with

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
find a reason to use that to use a

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.099 
find a reason to use that to use a
particular<00:04:05.040> weapon<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:05.819> I<00:04:05.879> mean<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.510> g36c

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
first to tell you that I'm not saying

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.099

only shoot 650 rounds per minute I'm
just<00:04:15.060> saying<00:04:15.269> that<00:04:15.389> when<00:04:15.569> compared<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:16.019> like

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
just saying that when compared to like

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.539 
just saying that when compared to like
the<00:04:16.260> aku<00:04:16.709> or<00:04:17.269> even<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.449> type<00:04:18.750> 95<00:04:19.340> those<00:04:20.340> are

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
the aku or even the type 95 those are

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.060 
the aku or even the type 95 those are
slightly<00:04:20.940> easier<00:04:21.239> to<00:04:21.479> control<00:04:21.690> it<00:04:22.530> just<00:04:22.830> makes

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
slightly easier to control it just makes

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.870 
slightly easier to control it just makes
more<00:04:23.340> sense<00:04:23.729> to<00:04:24.180> use<00:04:24.419> those<00:04:24.659> weapons<00:04:24.960> now<00:04:25.880> can

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
more sense to use those weapons now can

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.960
