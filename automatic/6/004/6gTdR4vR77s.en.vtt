00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
ninety-nine point nine percent of the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.700 
ninety-nine point nine percent of the
time<00:00:50.070> any<00:00:50.750> mountain<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.989> blocked<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.500> is

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
time any mountain that you blocked in is

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.619 
time any mountain that you blocked in is
fixable<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.340> if<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.440> don't<00:00:55.440> want<00:00:55.949> to

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
fixable but if you just don't want to

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.490 
fixable but if you just don't want to
work<00:00:57.629> with<00:00:57.660> something<00:00:58.079> you've<00:00:58.230> already

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
work with something you've already

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.590 
work with something you've already
painted<00:00:58.710> then<00:00:59.340> with<00:00:59.879> an<00:00:59.969> acrylic<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.449> could

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
painted then with an acrylic you could

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.990 
painted then with an acrylic you could
just<00:01:00.750> apply<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:01.289> few<00:01:01.890> coats<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.340> acrylic<00:01:02.430> gesso

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
just apply a few coats of acrylic gesso

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.190 
just apply a few coats of acrylic gesso
and<00:01:03.329> then<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.019> can<00:01:04.199> start<00:01:04.439> all<00:01:04.769> over<00:01:04.830> again

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
and then you can start all over again

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.560 
and then you can start all over again
okay<00:01:07.520> so<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.479> here<00:01:11.210> i'm<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.510> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
okay so with this here i'm just going to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.840 
okay so with this here i'm just going to
straighten<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.680> out<00:01:13.860> just<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.610> little<00:01:14.670> bit

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
straighten this out just a little bit

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.690 
straighten this out just a little bit
more<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.770> not<00:01:16.950> quite<00:01:17.220> sure<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.460> like

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
more like that and not quite sure I like

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.520 
more like that and not quite sure I like
that<00:01:17.880> peak<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.450> way<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.290> think

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
that peak the way that is so I think

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.050 
that peak the way that is so I think
what<00:01:20.040> I'll<00:01:20.159> do<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.640> I'll<00:01:20.790> bring<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.330> out<00:01:21.570> just

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.870 

like<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.330> oh<00:01:27.509> now<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.960> looks<00:01:28.049> really<00:01:28.320> bumpy

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.510 

and<00:01:32.880> then<00:01:33.659> I'll<00:01:33.780> bring<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.110> one<00:01:34.320> out

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.760 

so<00:01:38.450> we<00:01:38.600> can<00:01:38.719> just<00:01:38.780> create<00:01:39.170> a<00:01:39.289> shape<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.740> little

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
so we can just create a shape a little

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:48.550 
so we can just create a shape a little
bit<00:01:40.159> okay<00:01:41.890> we<00:01:42.890> can<00:01:43.039> work<00:01:43.219> down<00:01:43.429> here<00:01:47.469> so<00:01:48.469> we

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
bit okay we can work down here so we

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.319 
bit okay we can work down here so we
don't<00:01:48.740> see<00:01:49.070> any<00:01:49.310> repetitive<00:01:49.700> pattern

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
don't see any repetitive pattern

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.240 
don't see any repetitive pattern
starting<00:01:50.780> okay<00:01:51.409> that's<00:01:51.619> one<00:01:51.829> thing<00:01:51.979> you<00:01:52.100> have

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
starting okay that's one thing you have

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.770 
starting okay that's one thing you have
to<00:01:52.280> make<00:01:52.490> sure<00:01:52.520> now<00:01:53.359> in<00:01:53.689> here<00:01:55.509> there's<00:01:56.509> quite

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
to make sure now in here there's quite

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.270

that I like to do just right off on

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.380 
that I like to do just right off on
rinse<00:05:17.050> it<00:05:17.200> right<00:05:17.410> on<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.890> offset<00:05:18.430> is<00:05:18.640> I<00:05:19.180> like

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
rinse it right on the offset is I like

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.890 
rinse it right on the offset is I like
to<00:05:19.419> blend<00:05:19.840> the<00:05:20.200> bottom<00:05:21.010> of<00:05:21.160> my<00:05:21.940> Mountain<00:05:22.630> now

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
to blend the bottom of my Mountain now

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.090 
to blend the bottom of my Mountain now
remember<00:05:23.140> if<00:05:23.320> we're<00:05:23.470> doing<00:05:23.710> an<00:05:23.800> actual

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
remember if we're doing an actual

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.460 
remember if we're doing an actual
painting<00:05:24.820> you<00:05:25.540> have<00:05:25.750> your<00:05:25.930> they're<00:05:26.260> going<00:05:26.410> to

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
painting you have your they're going to

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.200 
painting you have your they're going to
have<00:05:26.620> other<00:05:26.830> elements<00:05:27.370> that<00:05:27.460> say<00:05:27.640> with<00:05:27.820> trees

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
have other elements that say with trees

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.260 
have other elements that say with trees
or<00:05:28.750> you'll<00:05:29.680> have<00:05:29.890> other<00:05:30.160> things<00:05:30.550> happening

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
or you'll have other things happening

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.360 
or you'll have other things happening
but<00:05:32.200> for<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.380> purpose<00:05:32.650> of<00:05:32.740> this<00:05:32.800> study<00:05:33.100> it's

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
but for the purpose of this study it's

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.499 
but for the purpose of this study it's
usually<00:05:33.700> good<00:05:33.910> practice<00:05:34.510> just<00:05:34.720> to

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:36.509 
usually good practice just to

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:38.790 
usually good practice just to
blend<00:05:37.509> the<00:05:37.690> bottom<00:05:38.050> just<00:05:38.169> so<00:05:38.319> you<00:05:38.410> don't<00:05:38.650> have

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
blend the bottom just so you don't have

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.370 
blend the bottom just so you don't have
anything<00:05:39.069> harsh<00:05:39.639> happening<00:05:40.449> here<00:05:40.690> okay<00:05:41.169> and

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
anything harsh happening here okay and

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.129 
anything harsh happening here okay and
normally<00:05:41.740> you<00:05:41.830> would<00:05:41.949> do<00:05:42.100> this<00:05:42.280> on<00:05:42.699> a<00:05:43.050> wet<00:05:44.050> on

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
normally you would do this on a wet on

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.020 
normally you would do this on a wet on
wet<00:05:44.169> technique<00:05:44.620> where<00:05:45.069> that<00:05:45.310> will<00:05:45.550> blend<00:05:45.729> in

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
wet technique where that will blend in

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:52.260 
wet technique where that will blend in
with<00:05:46.569> the<00:05:46.720> base<00:05:47.039> okay<00:05:50.550> and<00:05:51.550> I'm<00:05:51.699> just<00:05:51.940> kind<00:05:52.120> of

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
with the base okay and I'm just kind of

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.029 
with the base okay and I'm just kind of
pushing<00:05:52.870> the<00:05:52.990> brush<00:05:53.199> up<00:05:53.440> because<00:05:53.740> what<00:05:53.889> this

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
pushing the brush up because what this

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.499 
pushing the brush up because what this
is<00:05:54.190> doing<00:05:54.370> is<00:05:54.580> creating<00:05:54.940> a<00:05:55.180> little<00:05:55.330> bit<00:05:55.419> of

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:55.509 
is doing is creating a little bit of

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:59.670 
is doing is creating a little bit of
mist<00:05:56.639> okay<00:05:57.639> this<00:05:58.270> all<00:05:58.539> this<00:05:58.780> in<00:05:58.990> here<00:05:59.289> would<00:05:59.650> be

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
mist okay this all this in here would be

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.050 
mist okay this all this in here would be
your<00:06:00.840> your<00:06:02.490> whatever<00:06:03.490> back<00:06:03.759> whatever

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
your your whatever back whatever

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.730 
your your whatever back whatever
foreground<00:06:04.780> material<00:06:05.199> going<00:06:05.289> to<00:06:05.380> put<00:06:05.620> you're

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
foreground material going to put you're

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.249 
foreground material going to put you're
going<00:06:05.860> to<00:06:05.919> put<00:06:06.099> in<00:06:06.190> here<00:06:06.690> so<00:06:07.690> this<00:06:07.840> creates<00:06:08.199> a

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:08.259 
going to put in here so this creates a

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:12.260 
going to put in here so this creates a
little<00:06:08.380> bit<00:06:08.500> of<00:06:08.590> mist<00:06:10.410> doing<00:06:11.410> it<00:06:11.530> this<00:06:11.680> way

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
little bit of mist doing it this way

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.189 
little bit of mist doing it this way
okay<00:06:14.520> and<00:06:15.520> the<00:06:16.090> other<00:06:16.210> thing<00:06:16.300> that<00:06:16.539> we<00:06:16.810> can<00:06:16.990> do

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 
okay and the other thing that we can do

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:19.290 
okay and the other thing that we can do
which<00:06:17.830> is<00:06:18.099> beyond<00:06:18.699> the<00:06:18.789> scope<00:06:18.849> of<00:06:19.240> this

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
which is beyond the scope of this

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.120 
which is beyond the scope of this
workshop<00:06:19.840> is<00:06:20.050> that<00:06:20.530> you<00:06:20.710> can<00:06:20.830> create<00:06:20.979> a

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
workshop is that you can create a

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.950 
workshop is that you can create a
reflection<00:06:21.610> of<00:06:21.669> the<00:06:21.789> mountain<00:06:22.210> in<00:06:22.419> the<00:06:22.720> water

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
reflection of the mountain in the water

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.990 
reflection of the mountain in the water
as<00:06:23.229> well<00:06:23.470> you<00:06:23.919> can<00:06:24.070> actually<00:06:24.220> just<00:06:24.460> pull<00:06:24.789> that

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
as well you can actually just pull that

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.120 
as well you can actually just pull that
down<00:06:28.349> like<00:06:29.349> this<00:06:29.470> it<00:06:29.650> just<00:06:29.680> creates<00:06:30.099> a

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
down like this it just creates a

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:35.339 
down like this it just creates a
reflection<00:06:30.669> that's<00:06:31.509> beyond<00:06:33.870> this<00:06:34.870> workshop

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:35.349 
reflection that's beyond this workshop

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:39.890 
reflection that's beyond this workshop
though<00:06:36.120> we<00:06:37.120> get<00:06:37.300> into<00:06:37.539> reflections<00:06:38.169> in

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
though we get into reflections in

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.120 
though we get into reflections in
upcoming<00:06:40.900> studies<00:06:41.409> i'm<00:06:41.560> just<00:06:41.710> going<00:06:41.860> to<00:06:41.919> clean

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
upcoming studies i'm just going to clean

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.210 
upcoming studies i'm just going to clean
this<00:06:42.190> up<00:06:42.490> there<00:06:43.090> we<00:06:43.240> go<00:06:43.680> okay<00:06:44.680> so<00:06:44.740> when<00:06:45.039> you<00:06:45.130> do

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
this up there we go okay so when you do

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.100 
this up there we go okay so when you do
a<00:06:45.250> mountain<00:06:45.699> you<00:06:46.150> would<00:06:46.270> normally<00:06:46.449> just<00:06:46.720> clean

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
a mountain you would normally just clean

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.110 
a mountain you would normally just clean
up<00:06:47.139> the<00:06:47.830> bottom<00:06:48.190> okay<00:06:48.759> so<00:06:49.690> in<00:06:49.840> this<00:06:49.990> one<00:06:50.229> here

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
up the bottom okay so in this one here

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.209 
up the bottom okay so in this one here
did<00:06:52.120> the<00:06:52.210> same<00:06:52.360> thing<00:06:52.389> just<00:06:52.830> use<00:06:53.830> basically

00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:54.219 
did the same thing just use basically

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:57.350 
did the same thing just use basically
just<00:06:54.430> kind<00:06:54.669> of<00:06:55.020> soften<00:06:56.020> the<00:06:56.139> bottom<00:06:56.500> area<00:06:56.740> here

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
just kind of soften the bottom area here

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.730 
just kind of soften the bottom area here
when<00:06:58.360> you're<00:06:58.539> working<00:06:58.750> with<00:06:59.080> something<00:06:59.349> that

00:06:59.730 --> 00:06:59.740 
when you're working with something that

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.950 
when you're working with something that
has<00:07:00.070> a<00:07:00.310> foreground<00:07:01.000> in<00:07:01.270> it<00:07:01.419> like<00:07:01.570> something<00:07:01.870> in

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
has a foreground in it like something in

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.659 
has a foreground in it like something in
front<00:07:02.110> of<00:07:02.259> the<00:07:02.320> mountains<00:07:04.020> so<00:07:05.219> you<00:07:06.219> bring<00:07:06.460> down

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:06.669 
front of the mountains so you bring down

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:08.430 
front of the mountains so you bring down
the<00:07:06.759> reflection<00:07:07.360> and<00:07:07.570> this<00:07:07.780> is<00:07:07.900> all<00:07:07.990> the<00:07:08.139> trees

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440 
the reflection and this is all the trees

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.610 
the reflection and this is all the trees
here<00:07:08.830> the<00:07:09.699> mountains<00:07:10.120> are<00:07:10.240> so<00:07:10.389> far<00:07:10.690> back<00:07:10.960> you

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:11.620 
here the mountains are so far back you

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.930 
here the mountains are so far back you
wouldn't<00:07:11.889> have<00:07:12.070> depending<00:07:12.580> on<00:07:12.669> the<00:07:12.789> angle

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:12.940 
wouldn't have depending on the angle

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.670 
wouldn't have depending on the angle
that<00:07:13.240> you're<00:07:13.389> looking<00:07:13.509> at<00:07:13.780> you<00:07:14.169> may<00:07:14.289> not<00:07:14.440> see

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 
that you're looking at you may not see

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.170 
that you're looking at you may not see
the<00:07:14.770> reflection<00:07:15.280> of<00:07:15.400> the<00:07:15.550> mountains<00:07:15.940> and<00:07:16.120> the

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.180 
the reflection of the mountains and the

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.629 
the reflection of the mountains and the
misting<00:07:17.139> you<00:07:17.409> probably<00:07:17.620> can't<00:07:17.949> see<00:07:18.039> the<00:07:18.310> light

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 
misting you probably can't see the light

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.879 
misting you probably can't see the light
misting<00:07:19.240> right<00:07:19.630> back<00:07:19.810> here<00:07:20.110> where<00:07:20.169> I<00:07:20.469> miss

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:20.889 
misting right back here where I miss
