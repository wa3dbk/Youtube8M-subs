 we have a card inserted and this is 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.449
 also an advantage to avoid 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.449
 shoot maybe without having the card 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.440

 however, ahead of the movie is 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:15.870
 interesting subjects and for how much 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:19.849
 they can be automatic anyway 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.849
