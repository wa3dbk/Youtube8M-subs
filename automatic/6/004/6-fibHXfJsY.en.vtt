like I have to be the one to protect

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.490 
like I have to be the one to protect
them<00:03:45.800> if<00:03:45.970> anything<00:03:46.970> were<00:03:47.210> to<00:03:47.240> happen<00:03:47.500> stopping

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:50.320 
I can accept that but the cost for ammo
is<00:04:44.890> crazy<00:04:46.570> so<00:04:47.570> expensive<00:04:48.440> but<00:04:49.370> anyway<00:04:49.790> that

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
is crazy so expensive but anyway that

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.240 
is crazy so expensive but anyway that
has<00:04:50.540> nothing<00:04:50.900> to<00:04:51.170> do<00:04:51.350> with<00:04:51.470> kingdom<00:04:51.890> hearts<00:04:52.130> at

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
has nothing to do with kingdom hearts at

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.300 
has nothing to do with kingdom hearts at
all<00:04:53.380> so<00:04:54.380> yeah<00:04:54.710> it's<00:04:54.860> just<00:04:55.070> one<00:04:55.190> of<00:04:55.220> those

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
all so yeah it's just one of those

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.440 
all so yeah it's just one of those
tangents<00:04:56.150> I<00:04:56.330> went<00:04:56.990> off<00:04:57.140> on<00:04:58.000> all<00:04:59.000> right<00:04:59.210> let's

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
tangents I went off on all right let's

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.660 
tangents I went off on all right let's
see<00:04:59.600> what<00:04:59.630> one<00:04:59.990> should<00:05:00.020> we<00:05:00.320> save<00:05:00.680> it<00:05:00.830> over<00:05:01.130> this

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
see what one should we save it over this

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.270 
see what one should we save it over this
warm<00:05:02.060> how<00:05:02.330> about<00:05:03.670> yes<00:05:05.170> alrighty<00:05:06.250> but<00:05:07.250> I

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
warm how about yes alrighty but I

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.700 
warm how about yes alrighty but I
definitely<00:05:07.550> think<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.270> guns<00:05:08.570> should<00:05:09.230> never

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
definitely think the guns should never

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.270 
definitely think the guns should never
be<00:05:10.540> illegal<00:05:11.540> because<00:05:11.780> that<00:05:12.350> is<00:05:12.710> kind<00:05:13.100> of

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
be illegal because that is kind of

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.980 
be illegal because that is kind of
control<00:05:14.120> and<00:05:14.720> leading<00:05:15.470> to<00:05:15.800> ah<00:05:16.690> yeah<00:05:17.690> more

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
control and leading to ah yeah more

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
control and leading to ah yeah more
control<00:05:18.380> and<00:05:19.300> I<00:05:20.300> really<00:05:20.810> hate<00:05:21.020> control<00:05:21.560> within

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
control and I really hate control within

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.680 
control and I really hate control within
the<00:05:22.250> government<00:05:22.340> which<00:05:22.790> is<00:05:22.970> what<00:05:23.210> it's<00:05:23.360> pretty
