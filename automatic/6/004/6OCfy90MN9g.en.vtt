of you guys may have seen this gun

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.680 
of you guys may have seen this gun
before<00:00:47.550> some<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.940> may<00:00:48.059> not<00:00:48.269> have<00:00:48.329> I

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
before some of you may not have I

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.599 
before some of you may not have I
basically<00:00:49.500> just<00:00:49.649> take<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> little<00:00:50.190> bit<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.429> heat

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
basically just take a little bit of heat

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:51.919 
basically just take a little bit of heat
here<00:00:50.850> I'm<00:00:51.089> using<00:00:51.269> this<00:00:51.449> little<00:00:51.690> portable

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929 
here I'm using this little portable

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:57.739 
here I'm using this little portable
torch<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:55.170> we're<00:00:55.499> going<00:00:55.679> to<00:00:56.600> torch<00:00:57.600> is

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
torch and we're going to torch is

00:00:57.749 --> 00:00:59.329 
torch and we're going to torch is
getting<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.019> little<00:00:58.109> low<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.350> fuel<00:00:58.739> here<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.249> it

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
getting a little low on fuel here so it

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.040 
getting a little low on fuel here so it
might<00:00:59.460> cut<00:00:59.699> out<00:00:59.850> on<00:00:59.999> me<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.269> you<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:00.809> see<00:01:00.960> what

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
might cut out on me but you can see what

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.389 
might cut out on me but you can see what
I'm<00:01:01.140> doing<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.499> lightly<00:01:01.829> heating<00:01:02.280> these

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
I'm doing is just lightly heating these

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.899 
I'm doing is just lightly heating these
up<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:06.350> this<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.470> called<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.800> kneeling<00:01:08.040> and

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
up and this is called a kneeling and

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.100 
up and this is called a kneeling and
that's<00:01:09.030> really<00:01:09.210> all<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.540> need<00:01:09.690> to<00:01:09.810> do<00:01:09.930> there

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that's really all we need to do there

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.389 
that's really all we need to do there
guys<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.470> don't<00:01:10.619> need<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.799> heat<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:10.979> up<00:01:11.040> anymore

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
guys I don't need to heat it up anymore

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.280 
guys I don't need to heat it up anymore
that<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.759> see<00:01:11.909> how<00:01:12.030> they<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.869> she<00:01:13.020> kind

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
that you can see how they but she kind

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.990 
that you can see how they but she kind
of<00:01:13.380> contorted<00:01:14.340> there<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.759> little<00:01:14.790> bit

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
of contorted there just a little bit

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.370 
of contorted there just a little bit
don't<00:01:15.270> worry<00:01:15.390> we<00:01:15.659> didn't<00:01:15.869> hurt<00:01:15.990> any<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.259> those

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
don't worry we didn't hurt any of those

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.219 
don't worry we didn't hurt any of those
parts<00:01:17.180> what<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.329> does<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.840> makes<00:01:18.899> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
parts what that does is that makes the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.929 
parts what that does is that makes the
brass<00:01:19.470> parts<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.950> lot<00:01:20.040> more<00:01:20.250> pliable<00:01:20.579> and

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
brass parts a lot more pliable and

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.370 
brass parts a lot more pliable and
flexible<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.689> standard<00:01:22.079> thing<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.320> you

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
flexible it's a standard thing that you

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.920 
flexible it's a standard thing that you
do<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:22.649> most<00:01:22.799> go<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.100> which<00:01:23.219> parts<00:01:23.579> and

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
do with most go to which parts and

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.030 
do with most go to which parts and
that'll<00:01:24.930> allow<00:01:24.960> us<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.380> bend<00:01:25.590> them<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.860> fit

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
that'll allow us to bend them and fit

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.289 
that'll allow us to bend them and fit
them<00:01:26.159> into<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.369> different<00:01:26.759> shapes<00:01:26.969> that<00:01:27.149> we

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
them into the different shapes that we

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.429 
them into the different shapes that we
need<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.540> they'll<00:01:27.630> stay<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:27.899> way<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.290> get

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
need and they'll stay that way and get

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.749 
need and they'll stay that way and get
rid<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.590> some<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.920> spring<00:01:29.250> action<00:01:29.460> if

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
rid of some of that spring action if

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.929 
rid of some of that spring action if
that<00:01:29.939> brass<00:01:30.659> parts<00:01:31.020> normally<00:01:31.350> have<00:01:31.820> so<00:01:32.820> what

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
that brass parts normally have so what

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.160 
that brass parts normally have so what
I'm<00:01:33.000> gonna<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.390> let<00:01:33.509> those<00:01:33.630> cool<00:01:33.930> off<00:01:34.140> just

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
I'm gonna do is let those cool off just

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.420 
I'm gonna do is let those cool off just
a<00:01:34.469> little<00:01:34.500> bit<00:01:34.680> then<00:01:34.920> I'm<00:01:34.979> gonna<00:01:35.100> come<00:01:35.310> back

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
a little bit then I'm gonna come back

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.889 
a little bit then I'm gonna come back
and<00:01:35.610> steel<00:01:35.909> wool<00:01:36.149> these<00:01:36.299> while<00:01:36.570> they're<00:01:36.719> still

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
and steel wool these while they're still

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:38.929 
and steel wool these while they're still
on<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.200> sheet<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.649> that<00:01:38.460> will<00:01:38.610> make<00:01:38.789> our

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
on the sheet and that will make our

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.580 
on the sheet and that will make our
paint<00:01:39.329> adhere<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.840> those<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> lot<00:01:40.229> better<00:01:40.469> when

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
paint adhere to those a lot better when

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.660 
paint adhere to those a lot better when
we<00:01:40.710> get<00:01:40.829> ready<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.039> paint<00:01:41.280> those<00:01:41.460> little

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
we get ready to paint those little
