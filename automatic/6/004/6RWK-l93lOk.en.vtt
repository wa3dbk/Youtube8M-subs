know<00:02:50.510> while<00:02:51.510> they<00:02:51.750> were<00:02:51.810> hanging<00:02:52.350> onto<00:02:52.470> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
know while they were hanging onto the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.580 
know while they were hanging onto the
crystal<00:02:53.130> they<00:02:53.310> probably<00:02:53.610> tore<00:02:54.570> something<00:02:55.050> I

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
crystal they probably tore something I

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.570

guess<00:02:56.390> tore<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.420> hole<00:02:57.960> in<00:02:58.020> space<00:02:58.980> or<00:02:59.370> something

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
guess tore a hole in space or something

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.500 
guess tore a hole in space or something
that<00:03:00.090> always<00:03:00.270> happens<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:01.940> they<00:03:02.940> have<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.360> go

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
that always happens and they have to go

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.380 
that always happens and they have to go
fix<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.410> they<00:03:04.620> have<00:03:04.740> to<00:03:04.860> save<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.730> other

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.440 
fix it and they have to save the other
realms<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.290> one<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:08.310> them<00:03:08.490> has<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:09.000> be<00:03:09.030> Chima
