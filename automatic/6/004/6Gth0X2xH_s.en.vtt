00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.220

 it's called false smiles let's start 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.260
 I remember very well what happened the only thing 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.990
 what I remember are these words that 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.030
 they resonate in my mind and say so because 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.190
 you had to go I do not know if it's my fault 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.320
 you left or I'm an idiot I let you go 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.090
 but now I feel guilty that I do not 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.980
 I was with you in the moments more 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.410
 happy and sad of my miserable life 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.320
 we were so happy together and I do not know what 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.289
 happened was in the blink of an eye already 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.539
 You were not with me but now I miss you 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.420
 I do not know where you are the nights are some 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.870

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.300
 that we would always be together and that 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.580
 you loved a moment I begin to remember what 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.550
 what happened already 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.590
 now I understand everything was because of 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.410
 those damn humans that you parted 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.110
 from me you were a beautiful garde boy and I 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.090
 a strong warrior called quiet you and 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.310
 I met since we were about 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.590
 baby rals we made the best 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.810
 friends and finally when we evolved 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.850

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.730

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.530
 we would always be together but you being 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.540

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.090
 give boy and I to be a boy in a galla 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.190
 I always told you that I would do what 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.350
 possible so that she was never alone and 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.630
 that would protect you with my life you alone 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.350
 I smiled if you said with sweet words 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.910
 How cute you are, I will love you forever 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.369
 all the pokÃ©mon that lived to our 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.490
 around were our friends and 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.170
 We lived peacefully in harmony and peace 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.119
 until one day those damn humans 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.400
 who call themselves pokemon hunters 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.040
 they came to capture several 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.260
 of our friends but you and me 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.840
 protected and we block their networks for 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.479
 catch pokemon but they to see that no 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.480
 They could with us sent their 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.849
 pokemon they told their pokemon 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.650
 do what you want with them just 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.440
 eliminate those of our sight and of being 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.290
 possible kill them I remember them very well 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.480
 those wild pokemon was an agro neither a 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.220
 I looked at the store and I was a fighting guy. 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.650
 the advantage over a drone and I defeated him 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.470
 no problems but I saw that it is my store 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.569
 that was attacking fiercely in that 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.340
 moment a ruthless fury invaded me 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.099
 and I ran towards it is my store and at a stroke 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.140
 it defeats the impact of the blow was so 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.569
 strong that he has me spit blood 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.700
 slightly but the hunters will 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.010
 they withdrew and said someday they will pay it 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.099
 we will go back and kill them both 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.989
 I went to see how you were doing and you were very 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.000
 wounded luckily I had some fences 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.069
 orange that I had collected and I gave them to you 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.200
 you recover you and gave me a strong 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.540
 hug and you with your beautiful voice you told me 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.670
 I love you and I will always be with you to me 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.459
 I had a tear and I told you never 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.079
 I will leave you alone from that day we train 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.720
 day and night to wait for the arrival 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.609
 eager for those pokemon hunters and 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.980
 we were pretty strong and we 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.140
 we protected the weakest until 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.870
 one day one of our friends warned us 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.120
 the pokemon hunters will arrive tomorrow 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.890
 I answered them we will wait here with 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.989
 craving but I did not know that I was going to 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.239
 repent of those stupid words 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.220
 I said the next morning 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.650
 I got up very early before arrival 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.260
 of pokemon hunters then you 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.750
 you woke up and you told me what's wrong with you 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.610
 you look very worried I just told you 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.579
 I want you to stay here I have a bad 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.620
 feeling that something bad will happen you 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.500
 just with an expression of sadness 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.390
 You said be careful I was training 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.370
 until they arrived but it was something very 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.560
 weird this time he was just a hunter and 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.840
 He looked different and dressed with 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.359
 a black robe I could not distinguish his 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.400
 face we were one against one and in the 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.280
 only the sound of the wind resounded 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.099
 he sacked his man but this time 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.260
 agron looked very powerful and started a 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.849
 epic battle I thought I had the 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.829
 advantage but when I thought there was 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.109
 defeated that aaron got up very 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.150
 enraged but to my bad luck I 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.919
 I was already very hurt and very tired and so 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.530
 I only had the strength to throw two 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.180
 attacks more I was creating an attack 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.280
 and when I cast it I gave it right in the 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.320
 white to that hoop I was very damaged 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.230
 he got up without any problem 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.210
 and fatigue was a fierce attack of 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.220
 metal claw against me 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.570
 I thought it was my end and I closed my eyes 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.970
 waiting for the moment of my death 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.920
 while I thought that I had not met 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.720
 my word that I would always leave you 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.580
 alone but at the same time I had fulfilled my 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.400
 promise that I would protect you with my life 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.530
 and I said I'm already dead when I opened my 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.390
 eyes that agronist had hit you with that 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.030
 metal claw had not killed you but 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.490
 If it left you very hurt, how could I? 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.560
 I picked up but that damn hunter told him 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.470
 your agron uses your ip ray with all your 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.390
 I can push you to protect you 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.700
 devastating and bitch me but at least 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.500
 I expected it, you took me out of the way before 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.230
 that the hyper beam hit me and you 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.150
 gave you right in the center I cried 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.060
 as a child and I screamed when I saw you fall 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.090
 slowly and see your eyes empty my 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.190
 heart broke into a thousand pieces I with 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.770
 my last forces I hit him in the 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.720
 head to that aaron I did not kill him but what 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.180
 I left unconscious and released my last 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.130
 attack until that hunter tries to escape 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.260
 but I did not let him escape and I threw him my 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.840
 last attack fulminating him but something 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.350
 very strange happened when I eliminated him he 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.120
 did 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.300
 and his body completely disappeared 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.460
 without a trace I fell very hurt and 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.890
 tired I thought he was already dead and that 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.470
 I was with my beloved but I managed to open the 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.510
 eyes and I saw a human seeing me I 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.390
 I got up and saw that I had no wounds and 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.370
 I was completely rehabilitated he 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.620
 He said how good you woke up with 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.050
 an expression of happiness on his face 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.060
 and also good that I found you 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.580
 time you were very hurt luckily 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.320
 I had medicine in my backpack myself 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.050
 remember what happened to my beloved 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.540
 I started crying and he told me what's wrong 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.390
 I was able to communicate with him thanks to the 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.040
 telepathy he told me quiet friends of 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.590
 what it feels like to go through that to me 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.390
 the same thing happened to me and his eye 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.090
 a tear came out 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:21.240
 I told him we already have something in common he 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.250
 he told me I'm alone in this world I just 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.070
 I put an expression of sadness on my 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:29.880
 face and I said nothing can fill the 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:32.100
 empty of my interior that of his backpack 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.650
 he took out a touch ball and told me he wants to be 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.330
 my partner on my pokemon trip I 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.770
 I remembered what that human did to him 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.930
 look I should go but could not 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.690
 resist to be the friend of that human 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.759
 because I knew that he was different I 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:48.360
 I said that if he gave me a big hug and 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:50.819
 he said thank you while some tears 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.710
 of happiness came from his face 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:55.949
 now that human has become my best 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:57.810
 friend it's been several years but still 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:00.479
 so I can not fill the emptiness of my 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.300
 Inside I remember how my dear died 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:05.069
 carl I must go as if it had been yesterday 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.180
 every time my coach chooses me to 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:08.699
 some battle 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.039
 it does not matter if we win or lose him 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:13.319
 he always hugged me and told me someday 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:15.569
 we will be the best every time he 

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:17.789
 He says that I put a smile on his face 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:20.849
 but he does not know that inside me 

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:23.759
 I'm torn and that those smiles are 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:26.940
 false smiles where behind them 

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:28.740
 hidden so many tears shed good 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.569
