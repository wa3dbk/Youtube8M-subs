blade I anticipate this to be a really
really<00:01:26.700> good<00:01:26.820> slicer<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:28.049> haven't<00:01:28.890> looked

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
really good slicer so I haven't looked

really good slicer so I haven't looked
for<00:01:29.159> some<00:01:29.400> tomatoes<00:01:29.820> or<00:01:30.000> something<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.270> slice

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
for some tomatoes or something to slice

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.999 
for some tomatoes or something to slice
up<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.140> know<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.350> demonstrate<00:01:31.799> that

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
up of it you know to demonstrate that

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.850 
up of it you know to demonstrate that
didn't<00:01:32.970> have<00:01:33.090> any<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.720> kitchen<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.409> all<00:01:34.710> we

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
didn't have any in the kitchen so all we

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.090 
didn't have any in the kitchen so all we
can<00:01:35.009> slice<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.430> paper<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.820> guess<00:01:36.350> but<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.560> six

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
can slice is paper I guess but the six

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.940 
can slice is paper I guess but the six

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
six 20s so they were you know I'm pretty

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.560 
six 20s so they were you know I'm pretty
much<00:02:05.250> just<00:02:05.310> had<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.700> manufacture<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.299> blades

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
the steel on this one is going to be

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.589 
the steel on this one is going to be

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
go to blade steel there was an M 390

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.569 
go to blade steel there was an M 390
version<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.540> 620<00:02:30.930> carbon<00:02:31.230> fiber<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.829> 390<00:02:32.489> is

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
version the 620 carbon fiber and 390 is

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:33.649 
version the 620 carbon fiber and 390 is
very<00:02:32.790> very<00:02:33.000> difficult<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.360> get<00:02:33.510> right<00:02:33.599> now

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
very very difficult to get right now

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.059 
very very difficult to get right now
because<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.019> bowler<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.409> pretty<00:02:34.680> backed<00:02:34.860> up

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
because the bowler is pretty backed up

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.270 
because the bowler is pretty backed up
so<00:02:35.909> you'll<00:02:36.180> see<00:02:36.420> in<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.569> lot<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:37.129> changes<00:02:38.129> like

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
so you'll see in a lot of changes like

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.149 
so you'll see in a lot of changes like
they<00:02:38.519> changed<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.180> gt390<00:02:40.079> to<00:02:40.260> from<00:02:40.500> m390<00:02:41.010> to

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
they changed the gt390 to from m390 to

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.839 
they changed the gt390 to from m390 to
cts<00:02:41.700> 204<00:02:42.269> so<00:02:43.109> it's<00:02:43.950> just<00:02:44.159> the<00:02:44.489> heart<00:02:44.700> it's<00:02:44.819> hard

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
cts 204 so it's just the heart it's hard

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.280 
cts 204 so it's just the heart it's hard
to<00:02:45.030> get<00:02:45.180> right<00:02:45.329> now<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.659> that's<00:02:45.810> why<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:45.989> might

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
to get right now so that's why you might

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.410 
to get right now so that's why you might
see<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.560> hardness<00:02:47.549> if<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.790> can<00:02:47.940> pick<00:02:48.120> up<00:02:48.209> one<00:02:48.329> of

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
see a hardness if you can pick up one of

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.860 
see a hardness if you can pick up one of
these<00:02:48.709> 620<00:02:49.709> carbon<00:02:49.980> fibers<00:02:50.310> right<00:02:50.579> now<00:02:50.870> m390

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
these 620 carbon fibers right now m390

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.440 
these 620 carbon fibers right now m390
blade<00:02:52.079> that's<00:02:52.319> a<00:02:52.440> really<00:02:52.650> good<00:02:53.389> really<00:02:54.389> good

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
could use the same scale as a lot of

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:38.990 
could use the same scale as a lot of
guys<00:03:37.799> are<00:03:38.010> starting<00:03:38.099> scales<00:03:38.579> for<00:03:38.819> the<00:03:38.879> East

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000

custom scale and then you've got then in

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.379 
custom scale and then you've got then in
my<00:03:44.010> opinion<00:03:44.040> much<00:03:44.549> more<00:03:44.730> attractive<00:03:45.150> blade

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
my opinion much more attractive blade

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.210 
my opinion much more attractive blade
shape<00:03:45.569> I<00:03:45.750> like<00:03:45.959> tanto<00:03:46.379> so<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.680> like<00:03:46.919> the<00:03:47.069> other

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
shape I like tanto so I like the other

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.089 
shape I like tanto so I like the other
one<00:03:47.430> but<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.329> one<00:03:48.540> is<00:03:48.660> just<00:03:49.109> really<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.889> really

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
so Emerson wise like I said the CQC 8 it

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.149 
so Emerson wise like I said the CQC 8 it
would<00:03:54.120> be<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.299> closest<00:03:54.750> thing<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:55.049> this<00:03:55.169> but

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159

frame lock anyone number some design you

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.270 
frame lock anyone number some design you
cannot<00:04:46.080> be<00:04:46.229> the<00:04:46.319> value<00:04:46.530> of<00:04:46.590> this<00:04:46.710> knife<00:04:46.889> so

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
cannot be the value of this knife so

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.969 
cannot be the value of this knife so
it's<00:04:47.729> it's<00:04:48.000> an<00:04:48.120> exceptional<00:04:48.720> value<00:04:49.229> for<00:04:49.259> $200

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
it's it's an exceptional value for $200

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.700 
it's it's an exceptional value for $200
so<00:04:50.819> specs<00:04:51.599> on<00:04:51.750> this<00:04:51.870> it's<00:04:52.080> got<00:04:52.199> a<00:04:52.229> three<00:04:52.470> point

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
so specs on this it's got a three point

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.870 
so specs on this it's got a three point
six<00:04:52.949> inch<00:04:53.250> blade<00:04:54.139> it's<00:04:55.139> a<00:04:55.319> is<00:04:56.099> four<00:04:56.430> point<00:04:56.699> nine

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
six inch blade it's a is four point nine

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.189 
six inch blade it's a is four point nine
inches<00:04:57.210> closed<00:04:57.509> so<00:04:57.659> it's<00:04:57.780> a<00:04:57.840> pretty<00:04:58.020> good

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
inches closed so it's a pretty good

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.270 
inches closed so it's a pretty good
sized<00:04:58.409> knife<00:04:59.720> 0.51<00:05:00.720> inches<00:05:01.110> thick<00:05:01.560> so<00:05:02.159> it's

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
sized knife 0.51 inches thick so it's

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.800 
sized knife 0.51 inches thick so it's
about<00:05:02.430> a<00:05:02.490> half<00:05:02.759> inch<00:05:02.940> thick<00:05:03.270> in<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.479> handle

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
about a half inch thick in the handle

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.529 
about a half inch thick in the handle
which<00:05:03.930> is<00:05:04.500> honestly<00:05:04.800> not<00:05:05.220> too<00:05:05.550> bad<00:05:05.759> I<00:05:06.180> have

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
which is honestly not too bad I have

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:07.730 
which is honestly not too bad I have
definitely<00:05:06.780> have<00:05:07.050> other<00:05:07.139> titanium<00:05:07.470> frame

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
definitely have other titanium frame

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.279 
definitely have other titanium frame
lock<00:05:07.800> that<00:05:08.069> are<00:05:08.190> much<00:05:08.430> thicker<00:05:08.970> so<00:05:09.389> and<00:05:09.659> then

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
lock that are much thicker so and then

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.200 
lock that are much thicker so and then
weighs<00:05:10.530> in<00:05:10.680> at<00:05:10.770> six<00:05:11.039> point<00:05:11.219> three<00:05:11.340> ounces<00:05:11.580> so
