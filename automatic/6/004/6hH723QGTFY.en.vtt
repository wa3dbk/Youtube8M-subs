00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.140
 show how to make a line for 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.120
 keep it ideal for easy fishing we 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.690
 will need another two lines 9 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.240
 hundredths of a 1 g cap of a 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.820
 main plomer composed of three planes 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:25.140
 0.24 g of a center plan of 0.12 g 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.529
 a man full of touch of 0.06 g of a 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.780
 bottom of line 1,600th dunham his number 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.850
 22 or 24 and a flat- nose pliers 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.430
 here we are going to start with the body 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.489
 of line for the line body I 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.649
 start by unwinding a little thread then 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.610
 I'm going to make a nice loop for that 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:52.730
 I take the son I bring him back to the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:58.140
 reel I pass it around my finger 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:04.530
 like that then I come the past to 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.780
 center of the loop and I hold that's the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.420
 little knot effect the loop that me 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.360
 will serve as an attachment to the can and done 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.200
 now I just have to unroll at 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.280
 put 50 to 1 m 82 line body and then has 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.350
 donned the cap here I just 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.140
 pass the cap on the line body 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.380
 to do this I first insert the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.250
 wire in this little ring I removed 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.759
 this ring 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.689
 then I slipped the end of the wire into 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.079
 this one and I came inserted on the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.909
 stem 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:47.130
 this is my butcher climb now I 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.409
 can put the main plumbing the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.049
 main plumbing is composed of three 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.890
 0.24 g weights 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.500
 these must be between 35 and 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.450
 50 centimeters of the hand are for the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.790
 needs of the video I have them closer 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.600
 of the cap here is how to put a plan 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.670
 on a line a lead 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.929
 as you can see at a small 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.910
 party in the center 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.350
 this feint 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.790
 must be placed on the wire the way 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:24.360
 next then we go tight with the 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:28.590
 just have to go down 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:32.510
 and to fix it you can take a 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:37.070
 pinch flat and serves it and stronger 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.990
 this is your plan is tight now 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:43.110
 repeat the operation on the board but 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.190
 main and then on the center plane and 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.190
 finally on the sideline 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.070
 here are the plans in place here plomÃ©e 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.210
 main where the three plans are well 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.730
 then grouped together the center plan that 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.430
 must be located at about fifteen 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.580
 centimeters of the first principal is 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.650
 in fact full of touch that will have to 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.710
 stay moving because it can be 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.760
 shifted as needed more he will be ready to 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.770
 the hook plus the line will be sensitive 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.840
 now we must proceed as the 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.440
 first step that is to say that it is necessary 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.880
 loop at the bottom of the line so 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.100
 to be able to hang the bottom of the line 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.740
 this is the loop of the leader who 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.530
 have just been done you can 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.070
 now test if you like 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:43.260
 the general plomber of the line in a 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:45.030
 little bottle filled with water I'm here 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.190
 have just immersed malignant in a 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.650
 bottle of water to make sure she 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.230
 this one was well sealed we can see 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.470
 that the antenna goes well beyond the 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.900
 cap is not too immersed so my 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.810
 well sealed line I do not have any left 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.500
 than to put the bottom line and the 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.260
 monsoon for my part I used a 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.510
 editing already everything made up in 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.050
 the soul his number 20 and a bottom of line 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.660
 in six hundredths a loop has already been 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.000
 realized then it will be enough for me to 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.980
 pass in mine 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.740
 then pass the monsoon 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.500
 in this same loop what will create a 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.900
 node 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.100
 here is my leader with the hook and 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.310
 the bottom line loop 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.710
 here again from line and the loop of 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.570
 line corps to make their agreement there 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:43.360
 must pass the loop of the bottom line 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.360
 in that of the line body like this 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:52.330
 here 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:57.740
 then you have to come and take the mosson 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:05:05.150
 where pss avoiding to put it in 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:11.330
 fingers and pass this dana hook 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:15.580
 loop of the leader and then just 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:18.470
 shoot what will make a sliding e 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:22.160
 here is the bottom of the line and now 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:25.300
 connected to the line body and the line 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.600
 on guard we are ready 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.600
 thank you all
