I think of addy because your changes

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.970 
I think of addy because your changes
should<00:04:29.790> always<00:04:30.030> be<00:04:30.420> straight<00:04:30.810> not<00:04:31.650> in<00:04:31.890> a

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
should always be straight not in a

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.680 
should always be straight not in a
direction<00:04:32.610> so<00:04:33.570> 9<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.470> turn<00:04:35.000> now<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.030> want<00:04:36.630> to

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
direction so 9 to turn now I want to

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.170 
direction so 9 to turn now I want to
make<00:04:36.870> her<00:04:37.080> a<00:04:37.350> right<00:04:38.010> lead<00:04:38.370> change<00:04:38.730> but<00:04:39.030> I'm
