I'll<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.330> turn<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> key<00:00:30.900> here<00:00:35.750> so<00:00:36.750> right<00:00:36.899> now

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
I'll just turn the key here so right now

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.720 
I'll just turn the key here so right now
it's<00:00:37.200> just<00:00:37.260> warming<00:00:37.739> up<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.070> has<00:00:38.250> more<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.640> a

with sort of a blue tint to it you can

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.590 
with sort of a blue tint to it you can
see<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.590> side<00:00:52.829> markers<00:00:53.280> or<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.270> sorry<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
see the side markers or the sorry the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.479 
see the side markers or the sorry the
parking<00:00:54.960> lights<00:00:55.140> pretty<00:00:55.829> much<00:00:56.039> match<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:58.489> I'm

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
parking lights pretty much match it I'm

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.549 
parking lights pretty much match it I'm
sort<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.879> standing<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> level<00:01:01.140> that

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
sort of standing it on a level that

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.090 
sort of standing it on a level that
someone<00:01:02.370> would<00:01:02.489> see<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.350> just<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.470> show<00:01:04.769> that

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
someone would see it just to show that

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.390 
someone would see it just to show that
there's<00:01:05.960> no<00:01:06.960> scattered<00:01:07.470> light<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.159> would

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
there's no scattered light that would

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.350 
there's no scattered light that would
cause<00:01:08.970> any<00:01:09.000> glare<00:01:09.600> if<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.170> go<00:01:10.290> down<00:01:10.439> any<00:01:10.650> lower

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
cause any glare if I go down any lower

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.219 
cause any glare if I go down any lower
then<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.600> see<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.900> starts<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:14.479> glare<00:01:15.479> also

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
then you can see it starts to glare also

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.460 
then you can see it starts to glare also
show<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:17.030> scattered<00:01:18.030> or<00:01:18.630> sorry<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.140> light

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
show the scattered or sorry the light

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.230 
show the scattered or sorry the light
pattern<00:01:19.740> here<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:20.850> see<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.150> that

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
pattern here as you can see it's that

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.120 
pattern here as you can see it's that
more<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.720> an<00:01:21.810> angle<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.320> that's<00:01:22.650> obvious

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
more of an angle and that's obvious

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.340 
more of an angle and that's obvious
because<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.030> bikes<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.630> its<00:01:24.780> kickstand<00:01:27.350> just

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
because the bikes on its kickstand just

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.469 
because the bikes on its kickstand just
to<00:01:28.439> compare<00:01:28.860> how<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.460> looks<00:01:29.790> compared<00:01:30.420> to

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
to compare how this looks compared to

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.789 
to compare how this looks compared to
the<00:01:30.720> halogen<00:01:31.290> bulb<00:01:31.470> my<00:01:32.369> high<00:01:32.880> beams<00:01:33.119> are

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
the halogen bulb my high beams are

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.780 
the halogen bulb my high beams are
indeed<00:01:34.799> halogen<00:01:35.369> at<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.970> moment<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:38.610> that's

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
indeed halogen at the moment and that's

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.990 
indeed halogen at the moment and that's
the<00:01:38.970> high<00:01:39.119> beam<00:01:39.329> there<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> projector<00:01:40.470> and

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
the high beam there it's a projector and

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.420 
the high beam there it's a projector and
that's<00:01:42.000> my<00:01:42.210> low<00:01:42.420> beam<00:01:42.890> bright<00:01:43.890> white<00:01:45.110> 6000k

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.000 

if<00:01:49.300> you<00:01:49.480> probably<00:01:49.960> take<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.230> look<00:01:50.500> from<00:01:50.830> this

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
if you probably take a look from this

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.540 
if you probably take a look from this
side<00:01:51.220> here<00:01:51.490> you<00:01:51.670> can<00:01:51.700> see<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.590> LED<00:01:53.800> bulb<00:01:54.340> in

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
side here you can see the LED bulb in

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.140 
side here you can see the LED bulb in
the<00:01:54.940> place<00:01:55.810> where<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.110> halogens<00:01:56.530> were<00:01:56.770> or<00:01:57.150> the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
the place where the halogens were or the

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.140 
the place where the halogens were or the
parking<00:01:58.450> lights<00:01:59.700> show<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:00.760> on<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.060> other

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
parking lights show you on the other

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.730 
parking lights show you on the other
side<00:02:01.240> too<00:02:01.660> these<00:02:01.810> are<00:02:01.870> not<00:02:02.170> too<00:02:02.440> hard<00:02:02.680> to

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
side too these are not too hard to

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.010 
side too these are not too hard to
change<00:02:03.040> there's<00:02:03.400> a<00:02:03.490> rubber<00:02:03.820> grommet<00:02:04.060> right

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
change there's a rubber grommet right

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.760 
change there's a rubber grommet right
behind<00:02:05.320> here<00:02:05.710> and<00:02:06.510> you<00:02:07.510> kind<00:02:07.720> of<00:02:07.810> have<00:02:08.649> to

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
behind here and you kind of have to

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.230 
behind here and you kind of have to
shave<00:02:08.979> me<00:02:09.100> around<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.399> bit<00:02:09.429> and<00:02:09.670> find<00:02:09.880> it

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
shave me around a bit and find it

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.300 
shave me around a bit and find it

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
I think maybe a couple bucks not much

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.300 
I think maybe a couple bucks not much
and<00:02:22.020> they<00:02:23.020> light<00:02:23.230> up<00:02:23.260> pretty<00:02:23.590> good<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.860> got<00:02:24.160> the
