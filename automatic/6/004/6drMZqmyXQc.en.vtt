00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
so I went to the hardware store and got

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.880 
so I went to the hardware store and got
all<00:00:16.450> this<00:00:16.599> pipe<00:00:16.869> out<00:00:17.079> on<00:00:17.230> the<00:00:17.349> floor<00:00:17.590> and<00:00:17.740> kind

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
all this pipe out on the floor and kind

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.760 
all this pipe out on the floor and kind
of<00:00:18.009> put<00:00:18.160> the<00:00:18.279> thing<00:00:18.490> together<00:00:18.579> and<00:00:19.000> guys<00:00:19.210> it

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
of put the thing together and guys it

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.460 
of put the thing together and guys it
you're<00:00:20.770> going<00:00:20.860> to<00:00:20.949> have<00:00:21.070> water<00:00:21.250> everywhere

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.560 

and<00:00:26.470> then<00:00:26.619> I<00:00:27.130> told<00:00:27.970> them<00:00:28.089> what<00:00:28.179> I<00:00:28.269> was<00:00:28.359> going<00:00:28.509> to

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
and then I told them what I was going to

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.890 
and then I told them what I was going to
use<00:00:28.689> the<00:00:28.839> party<00:00:29.230> didn't<00:00:30.130> believe<00:00:30.339> me<00:00:30.490> so<00:00:33.900> you

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
use the party didn't believe me so you

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.340 
use the party didn't believe me so you
get<00:00:35.079> the<00:00:38.699> stand<00:00:39.699> put<00:00:40.539> together<00:00:40.690> like<00:00:41.050> this<00:00:41.289> and

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
get the stand put together like this and

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.760 
get the stand put together like this and
then<00:00:41.680> you're<00:00:41.829> ready<00:00:42.010> for<00:00:42.070> these<00:00:42.370> rails<00:00:43.770> this

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
then you're ready for these rails this

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.700 
then you're ready for these rails this
is<00:00:44.920> going<00:00:45.039> to<00:00:45.100> be<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:46.289> x<00:00:48.660> axis<00:00:49.660> the<00:00:50.109> the<00:00:50.469> back

and forth part stage rails try to put

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.770 
and forth part stage rails try to put
together<00:01:00.850> as<00:01:01.179> fast<00:01:01.390> as<00:01:01.480> I<00:01:01.539> can<00:01:01.750> here<00:01:03.780> stepper

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.980 
screw that on this is the ex stage the
back<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.799> forth<00:01:29.009> thing<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.149> got<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:30.539> piece

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
back and forth thing it's got one piece

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:39.020 
back and forth thing it's got one piece
of<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:32.659> channel<00:01:34.130> aluminum<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.490> channel<00:01:38.030> and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
of the channel aluminum you channel and

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.779 
of the channel aluminum you channel and
then<00:01:39.149> this<00:01:39.329> little<00:01:39.979> bearing<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.429> is<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
then this little bearing this is the

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.919 
then this little bearing this is the
roller<00:01:42.000> bearings<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.929> to<00:01:42.990> hold<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.819> the

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
roller bearings going to hold the the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.550 
roller bearings going to hold the the
table<00:01:45.929> the<00:01:46.259> ex<00:01:46.500> stage<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> rail<00:01:48.409> keep<00:01:49.409> it

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
table the ex stage to the rail keep it

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.880 
table the ex stage to the rail keep it
from<00:01:49.860> keep<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.429> straight<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.439> see<00:01:52.439> when<00:01:52.799> you

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
from keep it straight you see when you

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.219 
from keep it straight you see when you
tighten<00:01:53.069> a<00:01:53.250> screw<00:01:53.280> driver<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:54.149> tightens<00:01:55.110> it

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
tighten a screw driver just tightens it

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.819 
tighten a screw driver just tightens it
right<00:01:55.409> up<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.709> that<00:01:55.860> rail<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:57.409> then<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.619> is

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
right up to that rail and then this is

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:05.179 
right up to that rail and then this is
the<00:01:59.039> coupling<00:01:59.579> nut<00:02:00.209> pen<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:03.619> tie<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.039> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
the coupling nut pen and tie that to the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.460 
the coupling nut pen and tie that to the
ex<00:02:05.399> stage<00:02:05.689> then<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.869> see<00:02:07.049> when<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.289> motor

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
ex stage then you see when the motor

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.729 
ex stage then you see when the motor
turns<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.690> makes<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.840> stage<00:02:10.110> slide<00:02:10.500> back

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
turns that makes the stage slide back

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.979 
turns that makes the stage slide back
and<00:02:10.920> forth

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:25.670 

okay<00:02:15.989> now<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.260> Y<00:02:17.840> rails

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.410 

so<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.890> why<00:02:27.040> stand<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:27.640> kind<00:02:27.970> of<00:02:28.060> needs<00:02:28.210> to<00:02:28.300> be

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
so the why stand it kind of needs to be

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.780 
so the why stand it kind of needs to be
square<00:02:28.900> with<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:30.190> X<00:02:30.610> rails<00:02:32.520> another<00:02:33.520> motor

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
square with the X rails another motor

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:44.670 
square with the X rails another motor
with<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:37.500> threaded<00:02:38.500> rod<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:41.520> so<00:02:42.520> that<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:43.680> Y

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
with the threaded rod and so that the Y

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.730 
with the threaded rod and so that the Y
stages<00:02:45.520> just<00:02:45.820> like<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.870> get<00:02:47.050> X<00:02:47.410> stage<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:49.740> then

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
stages just like to get X stage and then

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.180 
stages just like to get X stage and then
we<00:02:50.980> got<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.880> little<00:02:52.830> roller<00:02:55.740> that<00:02:56.740> holds<00:02:57.070> that

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
we got a little roller that holds that

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.430 
we got a little roller that holds that
together<00:02:57.550> and<00:02:57.790> lets<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.270> slide<00:02:58.570> forward<00:02:59.320> and

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
together and lets it slide forward and

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.949 
together and lets it slide forward and
back<00:02:59.590> and<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:01.750> motor<00:03:01.959> makes<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.350> go<00:03:03.420> x<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.720> y

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.400 

this<00:03:07.959> is<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.290> z-axis<00:03:09.900> again<00:03:10.900> we<00:03:11.050> have<00:03:11.230> the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
this is the z-axis again we have the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.430 
this is the z-axis again we have the
rails<00:03:11.650> we<00:03:12.040> have<00:03:12.220> that<00:03:12.459> stage<00:03:13.170> it's<00:03:14.170> going<00:03:14.350> to

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
rails we have that stage it's going to

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.760 
rails we have that stage it's going to
slide<00:03:14.709> up<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.070> down<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.670> little<00:03:16.240> roller

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
slide up and down and little roller

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:23.390 
slide up and down and little roller
bearing<00:03:17.770> and<00:03:18.660> then<00:03:19.660> then<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:21.300> coupling<00:03:22.300> nut<00:03:22.600> is

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
bearing and then then a coupling nut is

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.620 
bearing and then then a coupling nut is
down<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.430> little<00:03:24.700> differently<00:03:25.209> here<00:03:25.270> it<00:03:25.540> just

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
down a little differently here it just

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.979 
down a little differently here it just
has<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:26.100> stop<00:03:29.340> okay<00:03:30.340> these<00:03:30.550> four<00:03:30.850> posts<00:03:31.390> are<00:03:31.600> for

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
has a stop okay these four posts are for

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:38.460 
has a stop okay these four posts are for
the<00:03:32.850> motor<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:34.239> mount<00:03:35.230> in<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:37.840> see<00:03:38.080> the<00:03:38.200> stage

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
the motor to mount in you see the stage

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.080 
the motor to mount in you see the stage
is<00:03:38.500> going<00:03:38.800> to<00:03:38.860> kind<00:03:39.100> of<00:03:39.160> flop<00:03:39.400> around<00:03:39.580> there<00:03:39.910> so

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
is going to kind of flop around there so

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.630 
is going to kind of flop around there so
we<00:03:40.209> add<00:03:40.360> these<00:03:40.540> extra<00:03:43.170> roller<00:03:44.190> bearings<00:03:45.190> to

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
we add these extra roller bearings to
