00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
track and it's not easy every day

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.110

in<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.370> middle<00:01:55.640> because<00:01:56.120> I<00:01:56.210> like<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.390> bit<00:01:56.600> of<00:01:56.690> a

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
in the middle because I like a bit of a

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.480 
in the middle because I like a bit of a
challenge<00:01:57.080> and<00:01:57.230> just<00:01:57.530> that<00:01:57.950> last<00:01:58.220> gate<00:01:58.460> I

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
challenge and just that last gate I

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.250 
challenge and just that last gate I

and<00:03:01.770> you<00:03:02.340> know<00:03:02.430> sometimes<00:03:02.730> some<00:03:03.180> tests<00:03:03.510> are

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
and you know sometimes some tests are

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.880 
and you know sometimes some tests are
bigger<00:03:03.750> than<00:03:03.900> others<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.380> it's<00:03:04.500> up<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.830> you

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
bigger than others and it's up to you

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:23.509 
bigger than others and it's up to you
whether<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.220> pass<00:03:05.430> or<00:03:05.610> not
