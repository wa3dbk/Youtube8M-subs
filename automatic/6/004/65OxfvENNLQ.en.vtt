00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.359 

so<00:02:05.840> as<00:02:05.960> you<00:02:06.109> can<00:02:06.229> see<00:02:06.409> I<00:02:06.439> have<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.770> bag<00:02:06.920> open<00:02:07.130> it

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
so as you can see I have the bag open it

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:08.979 
so as you can see I have the bag open it
is<00:02:07.490> actually<00:02:07.759> nothing<00:02:08.119> more<00:02:08.509> than<00:02:08.629> a<00:02:08.690> giant

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
is actually nothing more than a giant

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.460 
is actually nothing more than a giant
ziploc<00:02:09.410> bag<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.459> it<00:02:11.299> has<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.629> top<00:02:11.870> right<00:02:12.290> here

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
ziploc bag and it has the top right here

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.280 
ziploc bag and it has the top right here
that<00:02:12.739> will<00:02:12.890> actually<00:02:13.010> use<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.849> remove<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:15.110> air

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
that will actually use to remove the air

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.890 
that will actually use to remove the air
from<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.430> actual<00:02:16.790> bag<00:02:17.180> itself<00:02:17.569> and<00:02:17.840> that's

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
from the actual bag itself and that's

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.440 
from the actual bag itself and that's
what<00:02:18.230> will<00:02:18.739> actually<00:02:19.190> cause<00:02:19.760> it<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.120> shrink

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
what will actually cause it to shrink

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.509 
what will actually cause it to shrink
and<00:02:20.780> then<00:02:21.230> when<00:02:21.410> I'm<00:02:21.530> ready<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.980> actually<00:02:22.129> hang

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
and then when I'm ready to actually hang

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.240 
and then when I'm ready to actually hang
it<00:02:22.700> up<00:02:22.849> the<00:02:23.420> actual<00:02:23.750> hook<00:02:24.230> hair<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.980> actually

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
it up the actual hook hair is actually

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.940 
it up the actual hook hair is actually
the<00:02:25.700> top<00:02:25.970> so<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:26.390> will<00:02:26.660> screw<00:02:26.989> in<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.440> hold

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
the top so that will screw in and hold

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.009 
the top so that will screw in and hold
the<00:02:28.130> air<00:02:28.310> down<00:02:28.610> or<00:02:29.000> hold<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.299> air<00:02:29.450> out<00:02:29.660> and

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
the air down or hold the air out and

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.319 
the air down or hold the air out and
allow<00:02:30.470> us<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.829> hang<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.790> first<00:02:32.000> step<00:02:32.150> to

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
allow us to hang it so the first step to

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:33.940 
allow us to hang it so the first step to
do<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.599> to<00:02:32.690> actually<00:02:32.810> insert<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:33.500> clothes<00:02:33.769> and

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
do is to actually insert the clothes and

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.650 
do is to actually insert the clothes and
if<00:02:34.069> you<00:02:34.160> can<00:02:34.310> see<00:02:34.519> there<00:02:34.760> there's<00:02:35.180> actually<00:02:35.630> a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
if you can see there there's actually a

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.930 
if you can see there there's actually a
little<00:02:35.840> hanging<00:02:36.380> hook<00:02:36.650> inside<00:02:37.160> there<00:02:37.459> so<00:02:37.849> you

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
little hanging hook inside there so you

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.160 
little hanging hook inside there so you
have<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.120> put<00:02:38.239> all<00:02:38.360> my<00:02:38.390> clothes<00:02:38.690> in<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.049> bag

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
have to put all my clothes in the bag

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.410 
have to put all my clothes in the bag
and<00:02:39.440> then<00:02:39.560> attach<00:02:39.829> them<00:02:40.069> to<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.579> hook<00:02:41.180> that's

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
and then attach them to the hook that's

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.479 
and then attach them to the hook that's
there<00:02:41.720> so<00:02:41.930> they<00:02:42.019> don't<00:02:42.170> fall<00:02:42.379> in<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.799> back<00:02:42.980> so

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
there so they don't fall in the back so

00:02:43.489 --> 00:03:05.690 
there so they don't fall in the back so
let's<00:02:43.640> do<00:02:43.879> that<00:02:43.910> now

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.460 

so<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.850> next<00:03:07.000> step<00:03:07.180> is<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.480> seal<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.080> bag<00:03:08.230> and

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
so the next step is to seal the bag and

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.960 
so the next step is to seal the bag and
actually<00:03:08.770> give<00:03:08.890> you<00:03:08.950> this<00:03:09.040> little<00:03:09.250> tool<00:03:09.580> that

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
actually give you this little tool that

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.840 
actually give you this little tool that
allows<00:03:10.270> you<00:03:10.480> just<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.750> run<00:03:11.680> it<00:03:11.800> along<00:03:11.920> imagine

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
allows you just to run it along imagine

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.360 
allows you just to run it along imagine
if<00:03:12.910> you<00:03:13.030> were<00:03:13.180> stealing<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:14.170> ziploc<00:03:14.560> bag<00:03:14.830> just

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
if you were stealing a ziploc bag just

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.540 
if you were stealing a ziploc bag just
kind<00:03:15.580> of<00:03:15.700> run<00:03:16.270> this<00:03:16.420> little<00:03:16.720> pool<00:03:16.960> along<00:03:17.550> the

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
kind of run this little pool along the

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.100 
kind of run this little pool along the
bag<00:03:18.760> and<00:03:19.060> it<00:03:19.150> kind<00:03:19.390> of<00:03:19.420> does<00:03:19.630> all<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.930> work<00:03:19.960> for

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
bag and it kind of does all the work for

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.190 
bag and it kind of does all the work for
you<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.590> seals<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:21.100> up<00:03:21.250> now<00:03:21.970> I<00:03:22.030> did<00:03:22.450> put<00:03:22.810> 10

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.149 

once<00:04:11.000> all<00:04:11.269> the<00:04:11.420> air<00:04:11.540> is<00:04:11.689> out<00:04:11.840> take<00:04:12.349> the<00:04:12.560> hanger

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
once all the air is out take the hanger
