00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
fight like it's better than shit fights

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.790 
fight like it's better than shit fights
like<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.239> su<00:02:12.660> soto<00:02:13.050> karass<00:02:13.260> or

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
like a su soto karass or

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.790 
like a su soto karass or
berta<00:02:14.040> soler<00:02:14.160> or<00:02:14.670> some<00:02:14.850> shit<00:02:15.090> like<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.240> but

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
berta soler or some shit like that but

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.510 
berta soler or some shit like that but
you<00:02:16.800> know<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.690> thought<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:19.110> mean<00:02:19.770> Broner<00:02:20.160> would

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
you know I thought I mean Broner would

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.760 
you know I thought I mean Broner would
have<00:02:20.610> been<00:02:20.730> better<00:02:21.410> from<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.530> business

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
have been better from a business

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.330 
have been better from a business
standpoint<00:02:24.290> but<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.350> guess<00:02:25.620> Brona<00:02:25.920> didn't<00:02:26.190> take

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
standpoint but I guess Brona didn't take

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.040 
standpoint but I guess Brona didn't take
the<00:02:26.520> fight<00:02:26.730> because<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.270> know<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.420> can't<00:02:27.810> see<00:02:28.020> a

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
the fight because you know I can't see a

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.510 
the fight because you know I can't see a
broader<00:02:28.260> taking<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.710> fight<00:02:28.890> with<00:02:29.040> Aamir<00:02:29.310> Khan

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520
