watches I'd have to put a couple of our

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.670 
watches I'd have to put a couple of our
constellations<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.690> there<00:00:57.899> cuz<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.350> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
solid gold 1960s constellation they are

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.420 
solid gold 1960s constellation they are
absolute<00:01:05.280> works<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.880> art<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:07.280> you<00:01:08.280> know<00:01:08.400> I

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
absolute works of art and you know I

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.630 
absolute works of art and you know I
think<00:01:08.850> they're<00:01:09.240> less<00:01:09.390> certainly<00:01:09.810> worthy<00:01:10.080> of

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
think they're less certainly worthy of

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.539 
think they're less certainly worthy of
praise<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:12.869> constellation<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.830> recent<00:01:14.280> times

you've had the Cindy Crawford and you've
had<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.680> another<00:01:17.670> model<00:01:18.090> which<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.360> was<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
had the another model which is was the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.289 
had the another model which is was the
Manhattan<00:01:19.049> very<00:01:19.950> 80s<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.670> little<00:01:20.909> bit<00:01:21.060> dated

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
Manhattan very 80s a little bit dated

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.830 
Manhattan very 80s a little bit dated
now<00:01:21.540> but<00:01:22.080> they<00:01:22.979> were<00:01:23.369> very<00:01:23.520> cool<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.360> their<00:01:24.570> day

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.840 
status in the range I'm going to give it
an<00:01:57.119> 8<00:01:57.439> now<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.500> might<00:01:58.799> say<00:01:59.009> why<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.460> give<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
an 8 now you might say why do I give the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.090 
an 8 now you might say why do I give the
constellation<00:02:00.689> an<00:02:00.810> 8<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.500> speed<00:02:01.829> mass

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
constellation an 8 and the speed mass

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.450 
constellation an 8 and the speed mass
doing<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.579> CMOS<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.299> get<00:02:03.479> tens<00:02:03.869> well<00:02:04.460> that's

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
doing a CMOS to get tens well that's

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.240 
doing a CMOS to get tens well that's
really<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.270> ones<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.930> are<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.829> popular

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
really the ones that are so so popular

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.089 
really the ones that are so so popular
in<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:09.209> modern<00:02:09.629> age<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.950> constellation<00:02:10.950> has

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
in this modern age the constellation has

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.570 
in this modern age the constellation has
fallen<00:02:11.459> out<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.879> flavor

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
fallen out of flavor

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.550 
fallen out of flavor
but<00:02:13.120> I'm<00:02:13.240> giving<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.630> an<00:02:13.750> 8<00:02:13.930> because<00:02:14.380> I<00:02:14.410> do

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
but I'm giving it an 8 because I do

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.980 
but I'm giving it an 8 because I do
recognize<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.700> history<00:02:16.210> and<00:02:16.420> the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
recognize the history and the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.940 
recognize the history and the
contribution<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:18.070> has<00:02:18.490> made<00:02:18.880> in<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.300> past

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
contribution it has made in the past

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.460 
contribution it has made in the past
okay<00:02:20.950> for<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.640> movements<00:02:22.210> well<00:02:22.470> these

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
okay for the movements well these

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.340 
okay for the movements well these
movements<00:02:24.130> often<00:02:24.790> weren't<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.780> great<00:02:25.990> they

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
movements often weren't that great they

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.440 
movements often weren't that great they
were<00:02:26.410> just<00:02:26.770> generic<00:02:27.310> sort<00:02:27.550> of<00:02:27.700> machines<00:02:28.210> but

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
were just generic sort of machines but

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.020 
were just generic sort of machines but
the<00:02:29.350> constellation<00:02:30.190> they<00:02:30.340> often<00:02:30.730> went<00:02:30.940> to

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
the constellation they often went to

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.900 
the constellation they often went to
extra<00:02:31.780> levels<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.470> refinement<00:02:32.680> so<00:02:33.520> I'm<00:02:33.730> going

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
extra levels of refinement so I'm going

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.860 
extra levels of refinement so I'm going
to<00:02:33.940> give<00:02:34.180> Peter<00:02:35.080> 7<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:36.700> overall<00:02:37.270> quality<00:02:37.600> and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
to give Peter 7 the overall quality and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.890 
to give Peter 7 the overall quality and
finish<00:02:38.530> of<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:39.010> constellation<00:02:39.570> I'm<00:02:40.570> going<00:02:40.840> to

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
finish of a constellation I'm going to

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.580 
finish of a constellation I'm going to
give<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.260> 7<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:42.580> polluter<00:02:43.330> prestige<00:02:43.990> rating

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
give it a 7 the polluter prestige rating

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.730 
give it a 7 the polluter prestige rating
on<00:02:44.770> Omega<00:02:45.660> constellations<00:02:46.660> I'm<00:02:47.440> going<00:02:47.680> to

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
on Omega constellations I'm going to

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.730 
on Omega constellations I'm going to
give<00:02:47.890> another<00:02:48.010> 7<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:49.330> we<00:02:49.510> add<00:02:50.320> all<00:02:50.530> those

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
give another 7 so we add all those

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.540 
give another 7 so we add all those
scores<00:02:51.100> up<00:02:51.400> there<00:02:51.760> we<00:02:52.540> have<00:02:52.810> 35<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:54.100> I<00:02:54.190> think

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
scores up there we have 35 and I think

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.150 
scores up there we have 35 and I think
that's<00:02:54.760> that's<00:02:55.060> quite<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.480> reasonable<00:02:56.160> rating

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
that's that's quite a reasonable rating

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.810 
that's that's quite a reasonable rating
to<00:02:57.310> have<00:02:57.520> there<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.840> Omega<00:02:59.820> constellation

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
to have there the Omega constellation

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.410 
to have there the Omega constellation
scores<00:03:01.420> 35
