 nice mult for two pigeons and 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:17.699

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.850
 and keep gas on your arm and us 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.760

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.460

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:11.040

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:13.220
 strategy so completely in the eyes of the eyes 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:19.459
 I only briefly so only one 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:21.560

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:55.600
 you can leave so beautiful for walls 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.330
