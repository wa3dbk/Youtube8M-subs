that I incorporated a Nintendo 64 Hori
mini<00:02:03.399> path<00:02:03.670> this<00:02:04.360> was<00:02:04.600> one<00:02:04.750> of<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.929> last<00:02:05.110> mini

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
mini path this was one of the last mini

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.510 
mini path this was one of the last mini
pads<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.810> last<00:02:08.020> third-party<00:02:08.739> mini<00:02:08.950> pads<00:02:09.190> made

pads the last third-party mini pads made

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.790 
pads the last third-party mini pads made
for<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.849> Nintendo<00:02:09.940> 64<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:10.959> because<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.709> was

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
for the Nintendo 64 and because it was

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.130 
for the Nintendo 64 and because it was
one<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.130> last<00:02:12.280> they<00:02:13.090> put<00:02:13.330> in<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.540> Nintendo

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
one of the last they put in a Nintendo

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.339 
one of the last they put in a Nintendo
GameCube<00:02:14.410> joystick<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.580> d-pad<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:17.110> it's<00:02:17.260> a

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
GameCube joystick and d-pad so it's a

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.619 
GameCube joystick and d-pad so it's a
lot<00:02:17.500> better<00:02:17.680> than<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.099> original<00:02:18.610> Nintendo<00:02:18.849> 64

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
lot better than the original Nintendo 64

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.720 
lot better than the original Nintendo 64
joystick<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.319> it's<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.099> little<00:02:21.280> bit<00:02:21.400> smaller

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
joystick and it's a little bit smaller

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.910 
joystick and it's a little bit smaller
so<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.090> fit<00:02:22.239> in<00:02:22.330> my<00:02:22.420> portable<00:02:22.780> better<00:02:23.050> on<00:02:23.260> the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
so it fit in my portable better on the

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.530 
so it fit in my portable better on the
bottom<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:24.580> can<00:02:24.730> see<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:25.270> there's<00:02:25.480> a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
bottom you can see that there's a

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.170 
bottom you can see that there's a
charging<00:02:26.020> jack<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.530> headphone<00:02:26.890> jack<00:02:27.180> the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
charging jack and a headphone jack the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.170 
charging jack and a headphone jack the
charging<00:02:28.599> jack<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:28.930> because<00:02:29.290> there's<00:02:29.620> two

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
charging jack is because there's two

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.300 
charging jack is because there's two
lithium<00:02:31.180> polymer<00:02:31.330> five<00:02:32.140> thousand<00:02:33.069> milliamp

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
lithium polymer five thousand milliamp

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.580 
lithium polymer five thousand milliamp
batteries<00:02:33.879> in<00:02:34.060> there<00:02:34.270> so<00:02:34.959> it<00:02:35.110> will<00:02:35.200> power<00:02:35.319> the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
batteries in there so it will power the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.619 
batteries in there so it will power the
device<00:02:35.860> for<00:02:36.160> about<00:02:36.370> three<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.209> little<00:02:37.450> over

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
device for about three a little over

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.059 
device for about three a little over
three<00:02:37.870> hours<00:02:37.900> three<00:02:38.410> hours<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.709> 15<00:02:38.800> minutes

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
three hours three hours and 15 minutes

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.869 
three hours three hours and 15 minutes
and<00:02:39.489> as<00:02:40.360> you<00:02:40.510> can<00:02:40.599> see<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:40.959> uses<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.470> small<00:02:42.160> smart

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
and as you can see it uses a small smart

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.150 
and as you can see it uses a small smart
charger<00:02:43.300> takes<00:02:43.540> two<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.900> half<00:02:44.050> hours<00:02:44.440> you
