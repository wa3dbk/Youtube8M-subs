going to be reviewing is called tim bar
now<00:00:30.660> basically<00:00:31.650> what<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.890> allows<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.369> do

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
now basically what it allows you to do

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.450 
now basically what it allows you to do
is<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:33.420> chop<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.840> whole<00:00:34.050> tree<00:00:34.290> down<00:00:34.340> just<00:00:35.340> by

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
is to chop the whole tree down just by

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.510 
is to chop the whole tree down just by
cutting<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.030> bottom<00:00:36.329> block<00:00:36.540> now<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:38.219> sounds

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
cutting the bottom block now it sounds

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.290 
cutting the bottom block now it sounds
pretty<00:00:39.510> simple<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:41.100> simple<00:00:41.370> you

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
pretty simple and it is that simple you

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.400 
pretty simple and it is that simple you
can<00:00:42.450> see<00:00:42.890> once<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.980> cut<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.370> bottom<00:00:44.670> block<00:00:45.410> it

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
can see once you cut the bottom block it

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.779 
can see once you cut the bottom block it
kind<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.649> looks<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.039> tip<00:00:47.250> terraria

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
kind of looks like the tip terraria

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.279 
kind of looks like the tip terraria
actually<00:00:48.239> some<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.899> played<00:00:49.050> that

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
actually some of you have played that

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.910 
actually some of you have played that
game<00:00:49.640> cut<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> bottom<00:00:51.000> block<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.649> the<00:00:52.649> rest

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
game cut the bottom block and the rest

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.459 
game cut the bottom block and the rest
come<00:00:53.280> tumbling<00:00:53.730> down<00:00:53.840> now<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:55.199> imagine

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
come tumbling down now you can imagine

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.209 
come tumbling down now you can imagine
how<00:00:55.860> much<00:00:56.039> time<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.820> would<00:00:56.969> actually<00:00:57.180> save

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
how much time this would actually save

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.099 
how much time this would actually save
especially<00:00:59.219> for<00:00:59.399> really<00:00:59.850> big<00:01:00.030> trees<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:01.079> know

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
especially for really big trees you know

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.990 
especially for really big trees you know
tall<00:01:01.469> ones<00:01:01.710> where<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:01.980> can't<00:01:02.280> reach<00:01:02.340> like

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
tall ones where you can't reach like

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.090 
tall ones where you can't reach like
that<00:01:03.180> one<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:04.519> this<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.670> mainly<00:01:05.880> aimed<00:01:06.210> for

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
that one and this is mainly aimed for

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.910 
that one and this is mainly aimed for
people<00:01:08.100> who<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.310> playing<00:01:08.670> survival<00:01:09.240> but<00:01:09.990> you

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.840 
know don't want to really ruin the
experience<00:01:12.840> by<00:01:13.560> adding<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.189> mod<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.460> will

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
experience by adding in a mod that will

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.120 
experience by adding in a mod that will
just<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.810> know<00:01:15.900> make<00:01:16.170> everything<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.860> lot

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
easier and it's really simple it what

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.670 
easier and it's really simple it what
you<00:01:22.560> need<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:23.100> an<00:01:23.970> axe<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:25.320> doesn't<00:01:25.619> matter

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
you need is an axe it doesn't matter

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.039 
you need is an axe it doesn't matter
what<00:01:25.890> X<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.150> actually<00:01:27.330> cut<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.990> tree

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
what X so if I actually cut this tree

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.249 
what X so if I actually cut this tree
down<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.619> my<00:01:28.710> hand<00:01:29.600> it<00:01:30.600> won't<00:01:30.810> actually<00:01:30.930> do

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
down to my hand it won't actually do

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.950 
down to my hand it won't actually do
anything<00:01:31.680> until<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.640> cut<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:32.939> an<00:01:33.060> axe<00:01:33.210> okay

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
anything until you cut with an axe okay

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.109 
anything until you cut with an axe okay
that<00:01:34.470> doesn't<00:01:34.680> actually<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.820> be<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
that doesn't actually have to be the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.120 
that doesn't actually have to be the
bottom<00:01:36.450> block<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.409> cut<00:01:37.650> from<00:01:38.009> up

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
bottom block and you can cut from up

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.330 
bottom block and you can cut from up
here<00:01:39.049> but<00:01:40.049> if<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> whole<00:01:40.530> tree<00:01:40.829> yeah

really<00:02:00.540> good<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.860> massive<00:02:02.460> trees<00:02:02.670> like<00:02:02.820> this

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
really good so massive trees like this

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.740 
really good so massive trees like this
really<00:02:05.700> simplistic<00:02:07.819> select<00:02:08.819> them<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.119> you

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
really simplistic select them and you

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.740 
really simplistic select them and you
can<00:02:09.869> see<00:02:10.020> we<00:02:10.110> already<00:02:10.229> have<00:02:10.349> 40<00:02:10.979> logs<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.489> like

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
can see we already have 40 logs in like

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.990 
can see we already have 40 logs in like
well<00:02:12.900> if<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.830> wasn't<00:02:14.130> her<00:02:14.370> if<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.670> wasn't<00:02:14.910> for
