00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.200
I chose the education program because I wanted to teach children since as long as I can remember.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.180
I would love to become an elementary school teacher one day.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:22.700
My ultimate goal is to go into administration, but before I get there I have to become a teacher and learn the ins and outs of the classroom and the school system as a whole.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:32.300
Throughout the experience here, teacher education candidates will learn about child development from birth all the way to high school.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.540
Bridgewater College students will learn how to prepare lessons, especially for a diverse set of learners.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:49.200
The teacher education program is very hands-on. We want our students to experience what it's really like to teach in the classroom.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:59.680
We get to do hands-on experiments and then the professors will give us an issue to discuss that might happen in the classroom and as a group we discuss how we can solve the problem.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:08.500
We want students to try different instructional strategies on each other so that they know what it's actually like as a student.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.480
A lot of the classrooms are moving away from pen and paper, so as part of the teacher education program they prepare us to use the latest technologies.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:27.880
Students will learn to be a smart board expert, use document cameras, ipads and online resources that are available in today's classrooms.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.840
Bridgewater's teacher education program is really strong because not only are we learning valuable information in their classrooms,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.280
but we get to go to surrounding schools and apply that same knowledge that we are learning.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.320
Bridgewater College does an excellent job at getting teacher candidates out into the classrooms as early as sophomore year.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:55.640
We try to make sure that students have a wide variety of experiences across grade levels and kinds of schools where they get academic and cultural diversity.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.760
For us at Bridgewater, student teaching lasts an entire semester.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:12.880
Many schools might choose for you to go 7 1/2 weeks in one placement and 7/12 in another, but we have found that the full semester really gives our candidates an opportunity to see what real teaching is like.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.120
I think students should consider Bridgewater because the program is highly individualized and personal for you.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.180
The professors really try to have a student-centered classroom.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:34.080
To be a teacher you really have to have a passion to be in the classroom and the Bridgewater program really helps you to dig deep to find out what you want to teach.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.300
Bridgewater has produced two national teachers of the year within that past few years, which shows how successful our program is.
