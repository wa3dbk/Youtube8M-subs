execution<00:03:28.260> delays<00:03:28.560> have<00:03:29.060> basically<00:03:30.060> caused<00:03:30.360> a

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
execution delays have basically caused a

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.750 
execution delays have basically caused a
lot<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:30.750> emotional<00:03:31.320> grief<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.740> family<00:03:32.130> but

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
lot of emotional grief to the family but

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.900 
lot of emotional grief to the family but
forty<00:03:33.240> five<00:03:33.540> percent<00:03:34.310> execution<00:03:35.310> delays<00:03:35.670> in

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
forty five percent execution delays in

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.440 
forty five percent execution delays in
three<00:03:36.390> cities<00:03:36.660> right<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:38.190> basically<00:03:38.670> if<00:03:39.270> you

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
three cities right so basically if you

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.690 
three cities right so basically if you
look<00:03:39.660> at<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:40.350> know<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:41.010> main<00:03:41.190> reason<00:03:41.580> behind

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
look at you know the main reason behind

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.780 
look at you know the main reason behind
that<00:03:42.000> is<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.680> NCR<00:03:43.680> is<00:03:43.800> contributed<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.459> lot<00:03:44.490> to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
that is that NCR is contributed a lot to

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.020 
that is that NCR is contributed a lot to
that<00:03:45.270> only<00:03:46.200> twenty-three<00:03:46.709> percent<00:03:47.030> projects

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
that only twenty-three percent projects

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.270 
that only twenty-three percent projects
have<00:03:48.180> got<00:03:48.360> executed<00:03:48.690> in<00:03:49.200> NCR<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:50.040> that's

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
have got executed in NCR and that's

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.310 
have got executed in NCR and that's
primarily<00:03:50.610> because<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.990> number<00:03:52.290> of

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
primarily because of the number of

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.199 
primarily because of the number of
projects<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.100> are<00:03:53.220> nounced<00:03:53.640> over<00:03:53.820> here<00:03:54.000> are

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
projects that are nounced over here are

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.580 
projects that are nounced over here are
very<00:03:54.420> large<00:03:54.830> compared<00:03:55.830> to<00:03:55.890> MMR<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.410> BM<00:03:58.410> are

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
very large compared to MMR and BM are

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.250 
very large compared to MMR and BM are
the<00:03:59.459> other<00:03:59.640> big<00:03:59.880> reason<00:04:00.209> is<00:04:00.360> that<00:04:00.420> you<00:04:01.140> know

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
the other big reason is that you know

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.980 
the other big reason is that you know
the<00:04:02.130> real<00:04:02.700> estate<00:04:02.880> market<00:04:03.000> really<00:04:03.570> picked<00:04:03.780> up

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
the real estate market really picked up

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.949 
the real estate market really picked up
after<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.770> subprime<00:04:05.130> crisis<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:05.850> many<00:04:06.750> many

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
after the subprime crisis and many many

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.020 
after the subprime crisis and many many
projects<00:04:07.410> were<00:04:07.530> announced<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.580> developers

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
projects were announced the developers

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.730 
projects were announced the developers
did<00:04:09.209> not<00:04:09.360> have<00:04:09.600> that<00:04:09.630> kind<00:04:10.080> of<00:04:10.170> execution

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
did not have that kind of execution

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.920 
did not have that kind of execution
bandwidth<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.400> when<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.330> market<00:04:12.630> started<00:04:12.870> to

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
bandwidth and when the market started to

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.300 
bandwidth and when the market started to
pick<00:04:13.110> up<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.500> there<00:04:13.650> was<00:04:13.770> this<00:04:13.950> private

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
pick up and there was this private

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.800 
pick up and there was this private
equity<00:04:14.580> opportunity<00:04:15.060> also<00:04:15.209> there<00:04:15.540> so<00:04:15.690> they

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
equity opportunity also there so they

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.530 
equity opportunity also there so they
kind<00:04:16.260> of<00:04:16.470> used<00:04:17.190> funds<00:04:17.489> from<00:04:17.700> one<00:04:18.180> of<00:04:18.270> the<00:04:18.359> land

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
kind of used funds from one of the land

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.599 
kind of used funds from one of the land
banks<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.170> buy<00:04:19.410> procure<00:04:19.770> more<00:04:20.010> other<00:04:20.370> land

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
banks and that has been the main reason

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.040 
banks and that has been the main reason
why<00:04:22.200> projects<00:04:23.130> have<00:04:23.310> got<00:04:23.550> delayed<00:04:24.050> over

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
why projects have got delayed over

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.170 
why projects have got delayed over
