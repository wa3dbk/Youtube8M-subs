00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.790
 There are 130 million animals in the world 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.070
 animal experiment killed twelve of them 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.910
 millions in the eu and among these 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.070
 twelve million are 31,400 cats and 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.190
 dogs per year in the animal experiments 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.100
 Die and 11,000 monkeys in Austria 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.480
 There are 400 animal testing laboratories 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.820
 most of them in vienna 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.129
 in Innsbruck in graz and in salzburg 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.300
 but some also in linz and to 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.129
 example in Lower Austria in 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.650
 Seibersdorf in himberg and in orth 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.170
 the danube and there are in per year 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.809
 Austria received 20,000 applications 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.820
 animal experiment projects and 200,000 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.489
 Attempted animals are killed each year 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.180
 that means at least every three minutes 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.760
 an experimental animal dies in Austria 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.330
 and that's the whole 24 hours per 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.330
 day through 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:17.659
 [Music] 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.850
 [Music] 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.549
 and what are these attempts in 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.100
 Austria now made every third 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.350
 trial only aimed at a 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.440
 cure method for humans or animals 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.020
 to find and try of these 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.399
 only finds a small percentage 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.440
 really a cure or a cure 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.420
 drug and of these little ones 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.229
 percentage of in animal experiment 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.580
 then 92 are successful 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.170
 people are unsuccessful or even dangerous 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.539
 another third of the animal experiments 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.979
 is a pure compatibility test 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.690
 or toxicity test for 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.190
 industrial chemicals but also for 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.500
 Cosmetics for all manufactured 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.690
 Products with which you as a person in 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.670
 contact can come and the third 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.080
 third of the animal experiments 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.880
 excluding the curiosity 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.400
 so-called basic research easy 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.120
 to increase people's knowledge 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.850
 expand 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.410
 Let's look at a few examples for 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.140
 Animal experiments in Austria in the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.080
 for example, there were 22 years ago 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:32.130
 baboons with the poison of a cobra one 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.900
 poison snake poisoned by a blood 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.450
 cause shock in these animals 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.180
 at 16 baboons the thigh was 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.610
 sawed and then together again 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.940
 operated with a metal pins in the 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.100
 Bone was inserted eight beagle 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.910
 bitch has broken her teeth out 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.070
 and then implanted with dental implants 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.880
 a certain wait in between 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.810
 just to look like this 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.940
 Dental implants if you have a longer one 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.160
 time after taking out the teeth 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.760
 wait how they develop like themselves 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.130
 which ultimately hold in the bit 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.070
 twelve cats have the animals 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.769
 lived medically and then has 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.810
 all different places electrodes 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.430
 scheduled and electrical stimulation 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.140
 performed on the vocal chords though 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.660
 also with different nerves 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.880
 but you also have corn and for example 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.130
 Partydrogen as extra she feeds around 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.709
 to look like they react to it 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.820
 has even noticed in behavioral tests 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.790
 Do you want to be depressed? 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.820
 Button has been administered coffee and 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.250
 also green tea and then looked when 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.370
 if you 're infected with cancer in diez ob 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.180
 that in some form this 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.500
 Cancer development shirt or slows down 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.600
 You have 50 rabbits that is one 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.680
 Austrian animal experiment in one 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.450
 tied and has a metal cup 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.600
 then this mug in boiling water 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.410
 dived for severe burns 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.300
 inflict 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.850
 and then you have different games 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.240
 played to look like the skin 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:33.800
 respond to these burns 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:35.680
 [Music] 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.550
 we see it all different 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.199
 Animal experiments in Austria are the 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.599
 Curiosity alone serves as one 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.159
 can be called unnecessary and therefore 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:45.620
 Therefore, we do not want to belong in a prohibited 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:48.460
 a new animal experiment law that until 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:52.069
 must be set in mid-november 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:55.520
 that each animal experiment is a trade off 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:57.229
 is subject to the sense and the 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.539
 use this experiment for the 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.090
 people has on one side and that 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:04.460
 he harms the affected animals 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.349
 does away with the other and only if the 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.240
 use is not direct and big enough 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:11.210
 is supposed to be such a trial 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.190
 allowed and require transparent 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.620
 Every attempt should be made public 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.240
 be on your own website 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.650
 should give a retrospective rating 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.180
 to determine if that 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.379
 approval procedure whether the approval 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.270
 was justified 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.759
 And it's supposed to be an upper control 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.199
 to give a trial lawyer 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:31.250
 similar to the animal welfare ombudswoman 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:33.050
 bask in the animal welfare law freedom 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.690
 science is in the constitution 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.500
 that is why animal welfare must be equivalent to 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.150
 be raised to constitutional status 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.219
 this way the wheat chaff 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.270
 isolated the unnecessary animal experiments 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:46.270
 can be prohibited
