and<00:00:05.000> for<00:00:05.330> me<00:00:05.480> it's<00:00:05.810> always<00:00:05.960> the<00:00:06.140> Dabba<00:00:06.500> in<00:00:06.860> the

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
and for me it's always the Dabba in the

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.060 
and for me it's always the Dabba in the
mine<00:00:07.640> City<00:00:07.910> game<00:00:08.149> as<00:00:08.990> you<00:00:09.200> know<00:00:09.350> they've<00:00:09.559> we've

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
mine City game as you know they've we've

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.709 
mine City game as you know they've we've
spent<00:00:10.340> a<00:00:10.370> lot<00:00:10.430> of<00:00:10.550> money<00:00:10.700> this<00:00:10.910> season<00:00:11.150> now<00:00:11.450> and

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
spent a lot of money this season now and

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:13.480 
spent a lot of money this season now and
I<00:00:12.200> think<00:00:12.740> it'll<00:00:12.890> make<00:00:13.040> it<00:00:13.100> even<00:00:13.460> more

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
I think it'll make it even more

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.580 
I think it'll make it even more
interesting<00:00:13.910> and<00:00:14.360> so<00:00:14.780> being<00:00:14.990> a<00:00:15.080> local<00:00:15.260> lad

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
interesting and so being a local lad

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.380 
interesting and so being a local lad
that's<00:00:15.740> definitely<00:00:16.309> the<00:00:16.970> game<00:00:17.150> I<00:00:17.180> look

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
that's definitely the game I look

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.070 
that's definitely the game I look
forward<00:00:17.720> to

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
forward to

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.790 
forward to
I've<00:00:18.470> got<00:00:18.680> a<00:00:18.710> few<00:00:18.950> city<00:00:19.880> mates<00:00:20.150> as<00:00:20.419> well<00:00:20.599> and<00:00:20.840> he

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
I've got a few city mates as well and he

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.440 
I've got a few city mates as well and he
would<00:00:21.890> be<00:00:22.160> the<00:00:22.220> SolidFire<00:00:22.550> to<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:22.970> game<00:00:23.180> it's

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450 
would be the SolidFire to the game it's

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.530 
would be the SolidFire to the game it's
a<00:00:23.810> big<00:00:24.619> big<00:00:24.950> occasion<00:00:25.369> for<00:00:25.489> the<00:00:25.610> city<00:00:25.849> and<00:00:26.090> I

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
a big big occasion for the city and I

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.179 
a big big occasion for the city and I
think<00:00:26.930> it's<00:00:27.050> made<00:00:27.200> it<00:00:27.320> more<00:00:27.410> interesting<00:00:27.739> in

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
think it's made it more interesting in

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.580 
think it's made it more interesting in
the<00:00:28.849> recent<00:00:29.270> years

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.560 

probably<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:32.710> same<00:00:32.920> three<00:00:33.579> or<00:00:33.700> four<00:00:33.879> clubs

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
probably the same three or four clubs

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.590 
probably the same three or four clubs
and<00:00:34.809> Chelsea<00:00:35.500> Arsenal<00:00:35.950> and<00:00:36.670> I<00:00:37.390> think

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
and Chelsea Arsenal and I think

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.819 
and Chelsea Arsenal and I think
Liverpool<00:00:38.020> do<00:00:38.320> better<00:00:38.800> this<00:00:38.980> season<00:00:40.290> man<00:00:41.290> said

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.630 

maybe<00:00:44.829> Aston<00:00:45.250> Villa<00:00:46.050> probably<00:00:47.050> you<00:00:47.829> same<00:00:48.100> you

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
maybe Aston Villa probably you same you

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.479 
maybe Aston Villa probably you same you
say<00:00:48.850> in<00:00:48.909> black<00:00:49.150> they<00:00:49.540> taught<00:00:49.809> them<00:00:50.019> and<00:00:50.489> you

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
say in black they taught them and you

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:52.619 
say in black they taught them and you
know<00:00:51.579> it'd<00:00:51.730> be<00:00:51.760> a<00:00:51.850> bit<00:00:52.120> difficult<00:00:52.300> I<00:00:52.600> think

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
know it'd be a bit difficult I think

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.299 
know it'd be a bit difficult I think
it'll<00:00:53.110> be<00:00:53.260> another<00:00:53.440> one<00:00:53.589> I'm<00:00:53.769> ceilings<00:00:54.159> where

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
it'll be another one I'm ceilings where

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.790 
it'll be another one I'm ceilings where
a<00:00:54.579> lot<00:00:54.940> of<00:00:55.030> team<00:00:55.210> to<00:00:55.390> be<00:00:55.570> in<00:00:55.809> different<00:00:56.260> in<00:00:56.589> you

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
a lot of team to be in different in you

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.139 
a lot of team to be in different in you
know<00:00:56.920> I<00:00:56.949> don't<00:00:57.159> think<00:00:57.370> it's<00:00:57.519> this<00:00:57.699> going<00:00:57.940> to<00:00:58.000> be

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
know I don't think it's this going to be

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.860 
know I don't think it's this going to be
you<00:00:58.989> know<00:00:59.019> the<00:00:59.199> top<00:00:59.470> for<00:01:00.479> Tottenham<00:01:01.479> did<00:01:01.690> well

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
you know the top for Tottenham did well

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.850 
you know the top for Tottenham did well
last<00:01:01.899> season

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.969 

Barcelona<00:01:05.860> in<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.369> Milan<00:01:07.920> definitely<00:01:08.920> the

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
Barcelona in the Milan definitely the

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.850 
Barcelona in the Milan definitely the
two<00:01:09.220> that<00:01:09.369> you<00:01:09.430> look<00:01:09.640> forward<00:01:09.880> to<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:11.470> play<00:01:11.680> in

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
two that you look forward to to play in

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.070 
two that you look forward to to play in
home<00:01:12.040> obviously<00:01:12.430> they<00:01:12.820> are<00:01:13.690> in<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:13.869> final

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
home obviously they are in the final

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.219 
home obviously they are in the final
last<00:01:14.650> season<00:01:15.100> and<00:01:15.940> then<00:01:16.150> the<00:01:16.240> Milan<00:01:16.479> did<00:01:16.990> very

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
last season and then the Milan did very

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:18.840 
last season and then the Milan did very
well<00:01:17.320> if<00:01:17.560> I<00:01:17.710> thought<00:01:17.890> he<00:01:18.130> played<00:01:18.520> well

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
well if I thought he played well

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.850 
well if I thought he played well
throughout<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.420> season<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.080> moist<00:01:20.710> he's

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
throughout the season and moist he's

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.950 
throughout the season and moist he's
over<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.190> wet<00:01:21.369> and<00:01:21.850> so<00:01:22.360> he<00:01:22.479> definitely<00:01:22.869> got

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
over the wet and so he definitely got

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.260 
over the wet and so he definitely got
her<00:01:23.110> look<00:01:23.350> out<00:01:23.500> for<00:01:23.649> them<00:01:23.770> to<00:01:23.940> Real<00:01:24.940> Madrid

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
her look out for them to Real Madrid

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.719 
her look out for them to Real Madrid
maybe<00:01:25.539> as<00:01:25.960> well<00:01:26.170> so<00:01:26.500> we're<00:01:27.340> looking<00:01:27.549> forward

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
maybe as well so we're looking forward

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.620 
maybe as well so we're looking forward
to<00:01:27.909> that

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
to that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.780 
to that
yeah<00:01:30.630> it's<00:01:30.810> difficult<00:01:31.520> we've<00:01:32.520> got<00:01:32.760> a

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
yeah it's difficult we've got a

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.210 
yeah it's difficult we've got a
brilliant<00:01:33.390> squad<00:01:33.840> now<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.350> gaffer's<00:01:34.680> boys<00:01:34.890> on

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
brilliant squad now the gaffer's boys on

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.060 
brilliant squad now the gaffer's boys on
new<00:01:35.550> editions<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.530> they've<00:01:37.530> all<00:01:37.680> look<00:01:37.860> very

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
new editions and they've all look very

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.930 
new editions and they've all look very
well<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.430> pre-season<00:01:40.130> so<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.400> know<00:01:41.520> it's

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
well in pre-season so you know it's

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.670 
well in pre-season so you know it's
gonna<00:01:42.060> be<00:01:42.240> hard<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:43.200> everyone's<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.650> to

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
gonna be hard what everyone's going to

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.320 
gonna be hard what everyone's going to
have<00:01:43.800> to<00:01:43.920> play<00:01:44.100> well<00:01:44.340> but<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.030> think<00:01:45.090> that's

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
have to play well but I think that's

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.820 
have to play well but I think that's
better<00:01:45.540> for<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> team<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.710> know

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
better for the team and you know

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.590 
better for the team and you know
hopefully<00:01:47.100> from<00:01:47.490> there<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.330> bring<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
hopefully from there it can bring the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.820 
hopefully from there it can bring the
best<00:01:48.750> out<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.990> all<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> players<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.620> we've

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
best out of all the players that we've

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.470 
best out of all the players that we've
got<00:01:49.980> it's<00:01:50.520> gonna<00:01:50.820> be<00:01:50.940> hard<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.270> mean<00:01:51.360> you're

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480

thing is that you know we're a team and

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.520 
thing is that you know we're a team and
whoever's<00:02:00.420> playing<00:02:00.570> we<00:02:00.810> all<00:02:00.840> want<00:02:01.140> everyone

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.820 

I'd<00:02:06.970> have<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.210> say<00:02:07.360> Spain<00:02:08.020> probably<00:02:08.560> for<00:02:08.710> this

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
I'd have to say Spain probably for this

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.630

and<00:02:09.399> most<00:02:09.550> of<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.820> time<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.990> then<00:02:11.140> once<00:02:11.290> guy

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
and most of the time and then once guy

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.930 
and most of the time and then once guy
this<00:02:12.640> it's<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.510> good<00:02:13.690> league<00:02:13.900> it's<00:02:14.410> quick<00:02:14.710> and

you<00:02:15.940> know<00:02:16.090> it's<00:02:16.240> very<00:02:16.300> exciting

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.880 

it's<00:02:20.350> difficult<00:02:21.330> obviously<00:02:22.330> we've<00:02:22.890> really

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
it's difficult obviously we've really

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.730 
it's difficult obviously we've really
all<00:02:23.980> go<00:02:24.130> into<00:02:24.310> language<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.510> but<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:26.080> always

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.790 
all go into language it but I always
have<00:02:27.130> always<00:02:27.340> said<00:02:27.790> Barcelona<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:28.810> we'll

stick<00:02:30.040> with<00:02:30.070> that

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.530 

it's<00:02:34.000> time<00:02:34.240> I'm<00:02:34.510> gonna<00:02:34.630> go<00:02:34.810> Barcelona

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.649 

Emeline<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:42.010> was<00:02:42.519> very<00:02:42.790> strong<00:02:43.030> last<00:02:43.269> season

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
Emeline it was very strong last season

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.360 
Emeline it was very strong last season
and<00:02:43.780> they've<00:02:44.439> got<00:02:44.590> some<00:02:44.739> good<00:02:44.920> players<00:02:45.129> as

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
and they've got some good players as

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.000 
and they've got some good players as
long<00:02:45.519> as<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.760> can<00:02:45.879> keep<00:02:46.450> hold<00:02:46.689> of<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:47.140> lot<00:02:47.739> of<00:02:47.829> em

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
long as it can keep hold of a lot of em

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.800 
long as it can keep hold of a lot of em
then<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.430> think<00:02:48.609> they're<00:02:48.819> you<00:02:49.510> know<00:02:49.540> they've

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
then I think they're you know they've

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.619 
then I think they're you know they've
been<00:02:50.219> definitely<00:02:51.219> up<00:02:51.310> there<00:02:51.340> for<00:02:51.730> doing<00:02:52.390> well
