00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:11.299
 I have qualities I am good 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.299
 I can do something good but I never imagined 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.140
 his voice is a given childbirth 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.359
 the singer and find that 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.250
 jodoin and maritime worried 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.630
 even though we bought an expo young people can walk job elsewhere 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:29.479
 you return to the same price for lack of charges referred is probably a 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:33.260
 moment you see things that make me the most lack of asking key questions 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.400
 it will be organized a decade 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.400
 help so you put me our good plans for a year 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.500
 but still the most beautiful thing that happened to me 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.100
 belga 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.610
 baby doc 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.780
 a few hours more fun 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.960
 more than 1,200 places 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.960
 hegheim the road that the trash singer 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.920
 the ice cream adventurers room it's a big call to take because I do not 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.270
 project proto marseille 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.270
 this offer is not your case ouattara and poignant 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.290
 but it's always complicated like that 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.300
 as if you had 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.300
 as you feel like a little bit abandoned 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.870
 it's like everything but in our country 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.560
 in fact parents especially 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.200
 you did not know 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.910
 much less than at the opportune moment as we say in French all that we 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.030
 was tight that he was in discussion in France to be able to 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.250
 for all these people but percent 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.620
 but that's because it's in every country and how I think the most 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.230
 important is first and foremost 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.620
 this homework 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.040
 in the fortune entourage for a movie who died for the 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.080
 I was lucky to have a family 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.950
 Simao who taught me very well 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.590
 and then I came across my wife 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.070
 who is there and who is a person who is also 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.720
 who is very familiar who passes this information because her husband and who 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.149
 and who makes things 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:17.379
 his 10th for for for the family cocoon 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.459
 it's uncomfortable at first because the record was twelve days 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.439
 Of the history 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.729
 we are just normal of its success 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:28.339
 the north does not see itself go on thus in fact what I like what I do is 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:31.579
 safe 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:32.609
 it is really nice 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.639
 useless stuff to allow less than two hours between a little bit of what 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.749
 what I was given 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.999
 on the other hand he decided new things 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:43.949
 facing the mortar 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:45.939
 in which case there is even more like this 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.659
 - magazine 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.329

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.329
