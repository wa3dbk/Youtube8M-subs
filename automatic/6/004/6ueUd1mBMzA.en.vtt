started floating around that the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.870 
started floating around that the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
Patriots had manipulated the footballs

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.810 
Patriots had manipulated the footballs
in<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.390> way<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.990> was<00:00:31.650> meant<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.250> help<00:00:32.489> the

in a way that was meant to help the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.790 
in a way that was meant to help the

Patriots win and Louis if I understand

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.190 
Patriots win and Louis if I understand
correctly<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.399> was<00:00:35.520> very<00:00:35.790> cold<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.390> day<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
correctly it was very cold that day in a

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.100 
correctly it was very cold that day in a
New<00:00:37.500> England<00:00:37.829> at<00:00:37.920> foxboro<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:39.840> balls

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
New England at foxboro and the balls

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.130 
New England at foxboro and the balls
were<00:00:40.410> allegedly<00:00:41.129> deflated<00:00:42.000> because<00:00:42.629> that

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
were allegedly deflated because that

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.190 
were allegedly deflated because that
would<00:00:43.379> help<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:44.280> quarterbacks<00:00:45.000> grip<00:00:45.899> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
would help the quarterbacks grip the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.170 
would help the quarterbacks grip the
balls<00:00:46.469> better<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.280> what<00:00:47.430> I'm<00:00:47.550> confused<00:00:48.090> about

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
balls better but what I'm confused about

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.330 
balls better but what I'm confused about
with<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.629> with<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.160> hypothesis<00:00:50.160> is

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
with this with this hypothesis is

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.010 
with this with this hypothesis is
wouldn't<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.300> helped<00:00:51.750> both

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
wouldn't this have helped both

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.130 
wouldn't this have helped both
quarterbacks<00:00:52.530> equally<00:00:53.600> well<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.840> was<00:00:55.020> all

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
quarterbacks equally well this was all

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.760 
quarterbacks equally well this was all

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
some sort and it just went completely

some sort and it just went completely
viral<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.559> referees<00:01:02.070> are<00:01:02.399> handling<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
what's happening with them I would

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.899 
what's happening with them I would
assume<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:07.979> they're<00:01:08.280> using<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> same

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
assume that if they're using the same

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.969 
assume that if they're using the same
ball<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> period<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.229> time<00:01:10.409> yes<00:01:10.740> both

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
ball for a period of time yes both

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.469 
ball for a period of time yes both
quarterbacks<00:01:11.369> would<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:11.790> throwing<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> same

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
quarterbacks would be throwing the same

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.469 
quarterbacks would be throwing the same
deflated<00:01:12.990> ball<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.799> even<00:01:14.640> if<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.090> ball<00:01:15.299> were

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
deflated ball and even if the ball were

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.560 
deflated ball and even if the ball were
slightly<00:01:15.750> deflated<00:01:16.140> only<00:01:16.820> in<00:01:17.820> possession

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
slightly deflated only in possession

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.240 
slightly deflated only in possession
while<00:01:18.900> under<00:01:19.200> possession<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> Patriots

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
while under possession of the Patriots

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.880 
while under possession of the Patriots
there<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.790> no<00:01:21.000> way<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.960> would<00:01:22.200> rude<00:01:22.500> and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
there is no way that that would rude and

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.149 
there is no way that that would rude and
in<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.490> 45<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.240> seven<00:01:24.600> football<00:01:25.350> game<00:01:25.590> yeah<00:01:25.979> and

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
in a 45 to seven football game yeah and

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.160 
in a 45 to seven football game yeah and
it<00:01:26.460> will<00:01:26.640> away<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.000> think<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> argument<00:01:27.630> this

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
it will away I think the argument this

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.899 
it will away I think the argument this
one<00:01:28.500> thing<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.799> started<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.250> was<00:01:29.400> there<00:01:29.790> was

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
one thing that started it was there was

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.910 
one thing that started it was there was
an<00:01:30.060> interception<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.960> believe<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.380> was<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
an interception I believe it was and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.399 
an interception I believe it was and
after<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.610> interception<00:01:33.119> that's<00:01:33.600> where<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
after that interception that's where the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.560 
after that interception that's where the
Colts<00:01:34.860> got<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> ball<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.790> was<00:01:35.880> presumably<00:01:36.390> a

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
Colts got a ball that was presumably a

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.510 
Colts got a ball that was presumably a
ball<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.079> only<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.439> Patriots<00:01:37.950> were<00:01:38.100> using

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
ball that only the Patriots were using

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.800 
ball that only the Patriots were using
if<00:01:38.640> they<00:01:38.790> were<00:01:38.850> not<00:01:39.090> have<00:01:39.329> turned<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.689> ball

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
if they were not have turned the ball

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.310 
if they were not have turned the ball
over<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:41.040> paid<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.670> Colts<00:01:42.090> players<00:01:42.479> thought

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
over the paid the Colts players thought

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.410 
over the paid the Colts players thought
the<00:01:43.500> ball<00:01:43.710> felt<00:01:44.070> weird<00:01:44.490> after<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> change<00:01:45.210> of

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
the ball felt weird after the change of

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.179 
the ball felt weird after the change of
possession<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.110> brought<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.500> over<00:01:46.590> somewhere

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
possession and brought it over somewhere

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.530 
possession and brought it over somewhere
and<00:01:47.430> that's<00:01:47.549> where<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.939> idea<00:01:48.090> may<00:01:48.450> have

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
and that's where the idea may have

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.530 
and that's where the idea may have
stemmed<00:01:48.840> from<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.590> was<00:01:49.740> only<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
stemmed from that this was only the

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.880 
stemmed from that this was only the
Patriots<00:01:51.540> balls<00:01:51.840> but<00:01:52.170> clearly<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.680> didn't

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
Patriots balls but clearly it didn't

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.499 
Patriots balls but clearly it didn't
work<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.100> well<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.970> suspicious

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
work that well because the suspicious

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.899 
work that well because the suspicious
ball<00:01:54.750> was<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> ball<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.920> was<00:01:56.250> taken<00:01:56.610> up<00:01:56.729> but

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
ball was a ball that was taken up but

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.670 
ball was a ball that was taken up but
that<00:01:57.119> was<00:01:57.270> caught<00:01:57.509> for<00:01:57.780> an<00:01:57.840> interception<00:01:58.350> by

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
that was caught for an interception by

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.639 
that was caught for an interception by
the<00:01:58.740> Colts<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.579> really<00:02:00.030> seems<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.689> me<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.170> uh

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the Colts it really seems to me like uh

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.520 
the Colts it really seems to me like uh
uh<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:03.060> grasping<00:02:03.630> at<00:02:03.659> straws<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.409> be

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
uh just grasping at straws to be

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.459 
uh just grasping at straws to be
perfectly<00:02:04.890> honest<00:02:05.750> people<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.110> accuse

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
perfectly honest people like to accuse

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.619 
perfectly honest people like to accuse
the<00:02:07.740> Patriots<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.429> cheating<00:02:08.910> there<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.599> a

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
the Patriots of cheating there is a

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.180 
the Patriots of cheating there is a
thing<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:09.899> happened<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> while<00:02:10.500> back<00:02:10.560> where

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
thing that happened a while back where

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.100 
thing that happened a while back where
the<00:02:11.580> Patriots<00:02:12.060> had<00:02:12.209> someone<00:02:12.660> trying<00:02:12.959> to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
the Patriots had someone trying to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.920 
the Patriots had someone trying to
figure<00:02:13.349> out<00:02:13.379> other

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
figure out other

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.550 
figure out other
teams<00:02:14.079> uh<00:02:14.439> signals<00:02:15.280> uh<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.870> think<00:02:17.379> that's

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
teams uh signals uh and I think that's

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.470 
teams uh signals uh and I think that's
what's<00:02:17.769> kinda<00:02:18.219> started<00:02:18.640> all<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.790> this<00:02:18.939> and<00:02:19.329> now

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
what's kinda started all of this and now

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.420 
what's kinda started all of this and now
they<00:02:19.659> think<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.650> coach<00:02:20.890> in<00:02:21.129> the<00:02:21.219> team

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
they think that the coach in the team

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.479 
they think that the coach in the team
are<00:02:21.640> just<00:02:21.819> all<00:02:21.969> cheaters<00:02:22.269> but<00:02:23.140> um<00:02:23.469> it<00:02:24.040> was<00:02:24.219> just

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
are just all cheaters but um it was just

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.309 
are just all cheaters but um it was just
it<00:02:24.700> was<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:25.000> was<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.120> just<00:02:25.629> a<00:02:25.750> whooping<00:02:26.049> that's

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
it was it was it just a whooping that's

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.869 
it was it was it just a whooping that's
all<00:02:26.469> it<00:02:26.620> was<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:27.099> other<00:02:27.189> thing<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.489> I<00:02:27.640> think

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
all it was the other thing that I think

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.089 
all it was the other thing that I think
people<00:02:28.120> may<00:02:28.209> be<00:02:28.269> forgetting<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:28.959> that<00:02:28.989> uh<00:02:29.620> what

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
people may be forgetting is that uh what

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.069 
people may be forgetting is that uh what
sometimes<00:02:30.579> happens<00:02:30.700> with<00:02:31.000> car<00:02:31.329> tires<00:02:31.689> which

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
sometimes happens with car tires which

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.839 
sometimes happens with car tires which
is<00:02:32.290> if<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:32.680> have<00:02:32.709> them<00:02:33.099> inflated<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.819> a

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
is if you have them inflated to a

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.360 
is if you have them inflated to a
certain<00:02:34.180> pressure<00:02:34.389> during<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.109> summer<00:02:35.409> here

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370

my<00:02:41.980> life<00:02:42.159> uh<00:02:42.840> when<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:44.049> when<00:02:44.379> it<00:02:44.469> then<00:02:44.590> gets

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
my life uh when you when it then gets

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.490

very<00:02:44.950> cold<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:46.120> pressure<00:02:46.480> change<00:02:46.930> can

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
very cold the pressure change can

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.250 
very cold the pressure change can
actually<00:02:47.950> make<00:02:48.159> the<00:02:48.340> car<00:02:48.810> realize<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:49.840> the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
actually make the car realize that the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.199 
actually make the car realize that the
tires<00:02:50.530> are<00:02:50.769> no<00:02:50.919> longer<00:02:51.159> inflated<00:02:51.790> enough<00:02:52.060> and

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
tires are no longer inflated enough and

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.729 
tires are no longer inflated enough and
you<00:02:52.269> have<00:02:52.389> to<00:02:52.480> add<00:02:52.599> additional<00:02:52.930> air<00:02:53.409> when<00:02:53.650> it

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
you have to add additional air when it

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.229 
you have to add additional air when it
gets<00:02:53.919> very<00:02:53.980> cold<00:02:54.340> wouldn't<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.209> be

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
gets very cold wouldn't it be

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.000 
gets very cold wouldn't it be
conceivable<00:02:55.989> Louis<00:02:56.319> that<00:02:56.470> if<00:02:56.560> these<00:02:56.739> balls

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
conceivable Louis that if these balls

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.789 
conceivable Louis that if these balls
were<00:02:57.250> inflated<00:02:57.909> somewhere<00:02:58.389> indoors<00:02:58.799> then

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
were inflated somewhere indoors then

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.289 
were inflated somewhere indoors then
they're<00:03:00.010> brought<00:03:00.040> out<00:03:00.489> into<00:03:00.669> the<00:03:00.760> very<00:03:01.030> cold

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
they're brought out into the very cold

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.699 
they're brought out into the very cold
temperatures<00:03:01.599> that<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:02.079> could<00:03:02.260> have<00:03:02.409> some<00:03:02.620> of

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
temperatures that you could have some of

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.190 
temperatures that you could have some of
the<00:03:02.829> same<00:03:02.859> effect<00:03:03.459> couldn't<00:03:03.849> you<00:03:03.969> you<00:03:04.930> could

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
the same effect couldn't you you could

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.920 
the same effect couldn't you you could
the<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:06.159> air<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:06.909> know<00:03:07.000> air<00:03:07.269> expands<00:03:07.719> as<00:03:07.900> it

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
the the air you know air expands as it

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.629 
the the air you know air expands as it
gets<00:03:08.200> hotter<00:03:08.409> so<00:03:08.799> of<00:03:08.950> course<00:03:09.159> when<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.519> gets

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
gets hotter so of course when it gets

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.000 
gets hotter so of course when it gets
colder<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.120> opposite<00:03:10.510> happens<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:11.469> could

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
colder the opposite happens and I could

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.280 
colder the opposite happens and I could
see<00:03:12.159> that<00:03:12.280> happening<00:03:12.730> but<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:13.689> this<00:03:13.989> is<00:03:14.139> all

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
see that happening but the this is all

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.949 
see that happening but the this is all
just<00:03:14.500> nonsense<00:03:15.010> um<00:03:15.359> people<00:03:16.359> just<00:03:16.689> don't<00:03:16.840> like

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
just nonsense um people just don't like

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.210 
just nonsense um people just don't like
the<00:03:17.109> Patriots<00:03:17.530> because<00:03:17.620> they've<00:03:17.889> been<00:03:18.040> so

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
the Patriots because they've been so

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.829 
the Patriots because they've been so
successful<00:03:18.400> over<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.150> past<00:03:19.799> 14<00:03:20.799> years
