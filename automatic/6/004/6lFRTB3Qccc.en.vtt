to just walk outside and on the way I

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.900

Totoro has on his belly so it will blend
in<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.509> my<00:02:09.780> belly<00:02:10.080> when

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
in to my belly when

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.660 
in to my belly when
wearing<00:02:11.090> my<00:02:11.569> Totoro<00:02:12.170> cosplay<00:02:12.769> then<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.489> other

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
wearing my Totoro cosplay then the other

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.610 
wearing my Totoro cosplay then the other
side<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:14.329> going<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.689> be<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.959> solid<00:02:15.290> gray<00:02:15.560> so

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
side is going to be the solid gray so

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.509 
side is going to be the solid gray so
that<00:02:16.159> I<00:02:16.310> can<00:02:16.790> use<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.390> at<00:02:17.599> other<00:02:17.810> times<00:02:18.140> and

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
that I can use it at other times and

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.130 
that I can use it at other times and
people<00:02:19.519> won't<00:02:19.579> be<00:02:19.760> like<00:02:19.939> what<00:02:20.329> is<00:02:20.659> that<00:02:20.810> design

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
people won't be like what is that design

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.520 
people won't be like what is that design
that's<00:02:21.469> supposed<00:02:21.769> to<00:02:21.859> be<00:02:22.060> so<00:02:23.319> and<00:02:24.319> then<00:02:24.439> the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
that's supposed to be so and then the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.929 
that's supposed to be so and then the
straps<00:02:24.769> are<00:02:24.859> going<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:25.040> be<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.219> gray<00:02:25.370> as<00:02:25.609> well

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
straps are going to be the gray as well

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.569

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
probably could have gotten away with

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.240 
probably could have gotten away with
like<00:02:29.930> three<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.319> a<00:02:30.379> half<00:02:30.560> but<00:02:30.799> I<00:02:30.859> wanted<00:02:31.069> to<00:02:31.159> be
