 bain marie we already have a 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.260
 little advance to the steps for how 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.730
 the mixtures have to be cooled 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.170
 exactly we already have 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.670

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.560

 I had seen 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.680

 I love it and a hint of 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.720
 we have exactly here to hit your 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.080

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.500

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.420
 We're going to be here in a bain-marie during 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.260
 some times are nice mom too me 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.870
 I have to do 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.910
 bain marie for that chocolate blava no 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.860
 we can advance this a little bit what 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.410
 we can leave my life there because 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.480
 we have low but we are melted in the 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.300
 white chocolate that seems to melt 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.970
 it's from your device that you love me 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.740
 I love, I love, I love, it 's happy 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.170
 using the microwave which I 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.670
 I have certain reservations but she 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.940
 love really is happy with her 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.909
 microwave then doll 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.670
 of 4 meters from the clean river here 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.790
 look at you 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.530
 You can not care much for yourself but 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.470
 size maria 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.259
 he is not touching it and there are people who use 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.540
 the water bath and if the water touches the 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.990
 correct technique of a bain-marie is 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.330
 this way but you have to respect first 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.090
 fondant agent who came and his bath 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.740
 Mary inside the container with water 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.420
 then as variations are not 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.560
 it's good to remember what we're going to do 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.230
 let's make our conchitas 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.440
 thumbnails 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.230
 I'm going to make a puff with watching 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.730
 watch the doll as he loves the car 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.349
 it's not that I tell you one thing you know that 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.379
 has the microwave for example the 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.330
 technique of chocolate is to put what 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.970
 add a temperature lower it to 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.470
 temper good I told them half forgiveness 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.810
 they returned half if they have 200 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.080
 grams of chocolate put 100 to the micro 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.730
 they take it out they move it they add the others 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.590
 100 grams that have chocolate and already 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.000
 from temperas and you stop to 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.190
 chocolates very well is that already well 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.530
 tempered clear that although, but when 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.170
 we do not have it right this I put it 30 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.780
 seconds and I like it ready is now ready 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.390
 I'm working I can put it in other 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.819
 10 15 seconds plus seconds 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.709
 now we have previously whipped cream 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.060
 done now we already have a mix 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.960
 notice very well signal we already have 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.710
 mixtures made 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:24.050
 the bases of both the lemon and the 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:28.310
 chocolate here we have what I already 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.770
 I did look, I'm going to leave it here and now 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.720
 I will put the terminals but murcia 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:38.600
 what we mean mus is a spin that cross 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.170
 is a foam and knows that the only thing 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.270
 We were integrating it was air when 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.790
 you at home or when you read a 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.000
 recipe and say bus and carry grenetina 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.000
 being ready really is not a luxury is 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.540
 a gelatin a gratin because the mus 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.150
 means nothing more integration of haiti 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.780
 that you see the base of the lemon mousse as 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.390
 it's heavy and it's going to thicken a lot more and 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.460
 this base of lemon mousse can 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.990
 serve to fill tartlets now yes 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.140
 let's see by your side the study with my 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.140
 mom 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.519
 because it's perfect 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.940
 because it has some layers going to 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.370
 win a beautiful cup yes sir I continue 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.570
 here where I did not waste it and 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.540
 I think we leave them as we have now 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.780
 as it is in its final decoration and I continue 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.300
 here 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.920
 mixing because I want you to see how it goes 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.620
 to finish curdling as if really 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.569
 really it was a scrambled egg a 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.460
 little compacted 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:44.080
 look how it starts to thicken too 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.080
 White Chocolate Mousse 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.770
 but if not, look for the kids and 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.770
 all that is wonderful 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.280
 I keep making my mousse base 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.800
 lemon remember that we are going to use some 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.199
 delicious miniature shells that I'm going to 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.600
 make a tablet stand that is a spray 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:06.030
