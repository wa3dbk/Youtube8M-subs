00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.119
 for talking about a single guitarist who 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.380
 the logical thing would be to go through periods while 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.870
 at each moment hear different 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:39.960
 but good guitarists will certainly 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.960
 recommended more not to do the classics 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.960
 of rock 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.010
 all the classics and I'll say with 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.739
 much more modern people and more 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.690
 but I think that then in one nothing 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.690
 that for ages listening to different 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.829
 undoubtedly the most important thing for me is the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.829
 melody and melody 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.210
 that you can sing what you have 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.969
 certain hook to identify the 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.150
 song is not only that 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:24.520
 while starting to progress 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.520
 a song with its melody and that I have 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.170
 the advice that I can give to people who 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.190
 start playing what it is to practice 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.790
 practice 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:38.640
 a lot of diagnoses well 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.350
 of being alone focused on exercises or 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.840
 just centered on the front of the ix or 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.750
 songs not combining a bit of everything 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.820
 this to have a good technical base 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.070
 and then have of course a good 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.929
 harmonious basis and resources at the time of 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.659
 play listening to a lot of music and 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:02:00.920
 studying and taking out of doing of the disc 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.630
 and more because of youtube 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.110
 I read that all the people arrived 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.110
 chewed 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.360
 currently it would be stratocaster a 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:20.390
 reissue of him 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:23.180
 of 62 a modification that has and my 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.220
 favorite if I need more sound 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.890
 country gomas telecaster by logically 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.430
 take one out but this is a little bit 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.790
 battle guitar and I would use it 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.910
 almost that situation since 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.620
 cleansed 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.610
 sorry 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.610
 I'm two clean 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.260
 and 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.000
 and that's what I'm looking for as a guitar 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.180
 principal if they could only use 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.310
 a part then would be this concept of 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.609
 super strata and the shooters and in the 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.609
 site 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.090
 good wide favorite really 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.420
 it is difficult depending on the sound that 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.340
 you need 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.400
 at the time of recording of playing live 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.950
 it's more of a favorite 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.660
 for example now I am using a 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.410
 link with a member looks ravel 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.520
 custom defend that we have achieved 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.950
 precious things that work very well 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.950
 pedals then the base very clean 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.090
 and 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.500
 yes 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.250
 and if it 's a bit more distortion to 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.459
 whatever it takes to get well it has 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.459
 much 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.920
 and 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.780
 but depending on the situation 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.700
 theirs have the quality of equipment 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.410
 especially at a professional level and power 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.490
 have the skin that has more saturation 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.490
 more solid 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.530
 I am here not very simple lic and 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.840
 apparently simple at the time of 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.600
 ride but that really effective and that 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.430
 good 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.430
 we choose pentatonic of if minor 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.660
 of all ages 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.190
 then I will make a vertex of the 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:41.230
 note the note like this 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.230
 What I do is when I go up 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:45.939
 also the third string goes up then 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.939
 It is low 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.169
 on the second string 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.180
 with finger 2 in the third 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.140
 Quick 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.050
 Y 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.240
 all right
