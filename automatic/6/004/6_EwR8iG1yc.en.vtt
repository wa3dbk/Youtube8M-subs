00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello youtube people are alright with 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.910
 You guys this is my first video first. 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.540
 of many and I intend to tell 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.880
 you about that battery the battery 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.970
 external power bank external charger 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.980
 It's turning this little box to fever. 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.150
 everyone knows that it comes from Paraguay or 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.820
 so come from china 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.779
 It is certainly not even in China that many of these 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.570
 Appliances are a hand in the wheel for you 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.840
 that I'm going to me too that walks in the middle 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.420
 on the street uses the phone so much 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.140
 a tip for you guys can use it 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.040
 conscious because there are reports that exist 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.329
 many false substances in the market and has 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.960
 some precautions I want to show 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.360
 For you, for example, I joined the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.600
 site of another brand is called 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.149
 xiaoming tea a man something like this 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.300
 or a video of a Japanese in the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.699
 factory saying is how to find out 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.920
 as if she really is if she is 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.700
 true or not then I'll show 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.250
 for you 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.010
 This is a generic here. 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:16.080
 that was generic has a function without 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:19.140
 flashlight has two usb ports you do not have a 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.570
 entry to charging and two right to 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.700
 charging the device in case of 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.500
 tablet a cell phone anything 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.700
 so what happens to your battery 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.189
 huh 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.310
 She does not come, nothing written, she's not saying. 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.350
 which has short circuit protection then the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.640
 that I wanted this circuit protection 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.880
 she is 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.060
 If there is any one a problem with the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.220
 battery or with a device it cuts 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.740
 immediately load that is right 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.220
 it protects the device from damage is 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.320
 damage the appliance and these new 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.720
 this one in particular 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.939
 I have already discovered that it is false because 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:03.119
 because like listening in the video of the boy she 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.320
 when you turn it on when you call 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.469
 she has to carry 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.270
 immediately so far so good, she 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.370
 loads everything immediately 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.920
 only one thing he taught one thing 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.959
 important 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.660
 a test to see if it has protection 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.239
 against short circuit what happens 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.290
 you turn on the end of that right 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.870
 no car leave it where 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.800
 supposedly charge the device and 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:35.330
 another can see what I'm going to put here 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.180
 She'll call you then, she does not exist. 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.360
 device connected to it is then 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.660
 Wrong, you can not call me like that. 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:51.370
 and another thing when you tighten 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:55.120
 The button that I'm going to make now is important. 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:03:00.350
 do the following put this cable here 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:03.170
 load in charge rather it was to call 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.410
 she calls and keeps charging is because 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.000
 it has no shock protection 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.830
 counterpoint short circuit then a is 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.940
 It's half dangerous for you to charge the device. 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.220
 in the handset 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.799
 in case he called and this should not 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.079
 happens because this is loading the 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.329
 own battery and may cause 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.570
 circuit and blow up their own 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:30.890
 the device can be this can explode 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:33.109
 something else these devices 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.079
 when it arrives at a certain load it 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.940
 it does not cut when it is full 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.480
 full battery 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.549
 You have to turn it off manually. 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.890
 Why do not you turn it off? 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.859
 loading if you continue loading 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.739
 it can cause an explosion 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.720
 who rehearses a fire in your house 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.989
 so I recommend you leave 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.950
 more or less more than 8 9 hours until 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:04.160
 fourth luizinho here Ã“ porta luizinho de 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.350
 Lynch on the market will have 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.269
 have this indicator 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:13.730
 I even took one that looks like a 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:15.650
 white keychain and it loaded during and 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.329
 stayed for two days carrying 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.220
 He has a red light and a blouse. 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.690
 blue then when you connect the 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.289
 charging device 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.510
 it turns blue and when it is 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:29.180
 carrying the light turns red 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.610
 the right would be your light to pay, right? 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.160
 as the load reaches the end 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.440
 trees then paid was more than 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.080
 two days of charging and that device 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:44.600
 It scared me, so I traded for 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:46.400
 s by that one from here but it seems that it is seems 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.200
 that flour from the same bag always knows 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.840
 We want you to use it. 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.700
 this device can only use what you have 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.540
 to be careful about this kind of thing 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.970
 huh 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.680
 boot to load screens until Wednesday 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.530
 Woman keeps blinking after you 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:04.100
 immediately store the load because 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.440
 It's a sign that it's full because it 's personal. 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.610
 I'm releasing this video is mine. 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.930
 first video right 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.240
 the first of many I do not want 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.940
 share with you my own 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.800
 Something I learned that I 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.250
 I learn something that I discover right? 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.980
 so some people will always have a 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:26.510
 Sentinel 7 Always some thirst for 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:28.790
 teach you there and thank you if you 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.100
 like the video gives a like if not 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.570
 liked also can slip that the 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.250
 people are going to try to do something 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.180
 better, I'll try to do something 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.460
 best 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.730
 So that's it, I'm going to post videos from 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:44.290
 This is not just a matter of 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.290
 one thing, thank you very much
