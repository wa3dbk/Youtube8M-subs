of videos that kind of clear up some of
the<00:00:19.740> myths<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.279> using<00:00:21.060> synthetic<00:00:21.240> oil<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.109> we

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
the myths of using synthetic oil and we

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.009 
the myths of using synthetic oil and we
talked<00:00:23.250> about<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:24.090> know<00:00:24.180> does<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.570> oil<00:00:24.720> cause

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
talked about you know does the oil cause

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.130 
talked about you know does the oil cause
leaks<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.890> we<00:00:26.010> touched<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.400> how<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:27.140> synthetic

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
leaks and we touched on how a synthetic

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.779 
leaks and we touched on how a synthetic
oil<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.619> kind<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:28.890> make<00:00:29.010> its<00:00:29.189> way<00:00:29.310> past<00:00:29.609> some

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
oil can kind of make its way past some

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.269 
oil can kind of make its way past some
of<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.970> buildup<00:00:30.359> on<00:00:30.480> worn<00:00:30.779> out<00:00:30.900> seals<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.650> you

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
of the buildup on worn out seals so you

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.940 
of the buildup on worn out seals so you
know<00:00:32.369> may<00:00:32.579> or<00:00:32.669> may<00:00:32.820> not<00:00:33.290> but<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.559> did<00:00:34.770> get<00:00:34.890> a

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
know may or may not but we did get a

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
question after we post a series about is

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.580 
question after we post a series about is
it<00:00:38.340> okay<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.670> switch<00:00:39.059> back<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.360> forth<00:00:39.600> if<00:00:40.410> you

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
it okay to switch back and forth if you

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.530 
it okay to switch back and forth if you
need<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.070> from<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.940> synthetic<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.510> a

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
need to from a synthetic to a

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.660 
need to from a synthetic to a
non-starter<00:00:43.530> sure<00:00:43.710> yeah<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:43.980> mean<00:00:44.160> synthetic

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
non-starter sure yeah I mean synthetic

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.869 
non-starter sure yeah I mean synthetic
oils<00:00:45.210> are<00:00:45.860> all<00:00:46.860> synthetic<00:00:47.070> oils<00:00:47.489> used<00:00:47.670> for

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
oils are all synthetic oils used for

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.729 
oils are all synthetic oils used for
automotive<00:00:48.390> formulation<00:00:48.930> should<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.230> say<00:00:49.410> are

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
automotive formulation should I say are

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.370 
automotive formulation should I say are
compatible<00:00:50.430> with<00:00:50.610> mineral

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
compatible with mineral

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.930 
compatible with mineral
about<00:00:52.380> the<00:00:52.560> only<00:00:52.590> synthetic<00:00:53.340> base<00:00:53.610> stop

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
about the only synthetic base stop

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
find was mineral oil you can top it off

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.290 
find was mineral oil you can top it off
with<00:01:15.360> mineral<00:01:16.280> Wow<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.790> interesting

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
with mineral Wow it's just interesting

with mineral Wow it's just interesting
well<00:01:19.110> another<00:01:19.350> response<00:01:20.280> we<00:01:20.460> got<00:01:20.640> was

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
well another response we got was

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.380 
well another response we got was
regarding<00:01:22.710> additives<00:01:23.250> some<00:01:23.880> people<00:01:24.180> say<00:01:24.360> that

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
regarding additives some people say that

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.320 
regarding additives some people say that
he<00:01:24.630> used<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:25.670> conventional<00:01:26.670> oil<00:01:26.700> with<00:01:27.210> an

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
he used a conventional oil with an

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.030 
he used a conventional oil with an
additive<00:01:27.690> they<00:01:27.869> really<00:01:28.080> liked<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.830> it<00:01:28.950> a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
additive they really liked and is it a

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.040 
additive they really liked and is it a
good<00:01:29.130> idea<00:01:29.250> if<00:01:29.610> they<00:01:29.729> switch<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.149> a<00:01:30.390> synthetic

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
good idea if they switch to a synthetic

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.900 
good idea if they switch to a synthetic
to<00:01:31.440> continue<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.009> add<00:01:32.130> another<00:01:32.340> bottle<00:01:32.820> of

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
to continue to add another bottle of

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.660 
to continue to add another bottle of
something<00:01:33.259> don't<00:01:34.259> ever<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.619> can't<00:01:35.250> think<00:01:35.550> of

recommends the use of additives in the
reason<00:01:41.910> being<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:43.410> not<00:01:43.590> just<00:01:43.649> what's<00:01:44.100> in

the oil when you build a finished

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.499 
the oil when you build a finished
product<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:47.340> an<00:01:47.670> order<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.240> put

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
product it's an order that you put

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.300 
product it's an order that you put
together<00:01:48.690> and<00:01:49.140> at<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.500> temperature<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.039> put

interesting it's not only what's in the
oil<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:11.670> when<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.090> went<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.420> what

oil it's when it went and what
temperature<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.350> was<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.890> basement

with<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.220> center<00:02:29.430> lick<00:02:29.610> technology<00:02:30.180> so

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
with the center lick technology so

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.910 
with the center lick technology so
that's<00:02:30.810> really<00:02:30.989> meant<00:02:31.290> what<00:02:31.440> made<00:02:31.620> us<00:02:31.739> who<00:02:31.890> we

well as the oxidation resistance will be

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.030 
well as the oxidation resistance will be
on<00:02:35.940> even<00:02:36.420> one<00:02:36.540> other<00:02:36.690> synthetics<00:02:37.140> off<00:02:37.290> let's

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
on even one other synthetics off let's

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.800 
on even one other synthetics off let's
do<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.250> it's<00:02:38.670> been<00:02:38.790> fifteen<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.360> twenty<00:02:39.630> five

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
do that it's been fifteen to twenty five

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.890 
do that it's been fifteen to twenty five
percent<00:02:39.840> under<00:02:40.470> finished

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.750 

that's<00:02:44.439> what<00:02:44.680> we<00:02:44.799> focus<00:02:45.220> on<00:02:45.370> because<00:02:45.610> that's

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
that's what we focus on because that's

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.270 
that's what we focus on because that's
really<00:02:46.090> what's<00:02:46.299> defined

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
really what's defined

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.390 
really what's defined
I<00:02:47.310> always<00:02:47.819> tell<00:02:48.000> people<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.510> lot<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:48.990> people

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
I always tell people a lot of people

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.800 
I always tell people a lot of people
define<00:02:50.400> products<00:02:50.910> by<00:02:51.030> well<00:02:51.270> as<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.480> minerals

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
define products by well as it minerals

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.410 
define products by well as it minerals
and<00:02:51.959> synthetic<00:02:52.080> what<00:02:52.890> base<00:02:53.550> stock<00:02:53.819> visit<00:02:54.270> how

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
and synthetic what base stock visit how

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.449 
and synthetic what base stock visit how
much<00:02:54.630> was<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.900> percentage<00:02:55.200> guys<00:02:55.860> just<00:02:56.250> think

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
much was the percentage guys just think

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.150 
much was the percentage guys just think
of<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:56.610> base<00:02:57.030> stock<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.600> being<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.870> carrier

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
of that base stock is being a carrier

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.410 
of that base stock is being a carrier
absolutely<00:02:59.160> synthetic<00:02:59.610> is<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.760> better<00:03:00.000> carrier

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
absolutely synthetic is a better carrier

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.960 
absolutely synthetic is a better carrier
but<00:03:01.050> what's<00:03:01.260> doing<00:03:01.680> all<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.130> work<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.580> that

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
but what's doing all the work is that

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.490 
but what's doing all the work is that
fifteen<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.420> twenty<00:03:03.630> five<00:03:03.780> percent<00:03:03.810> at<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.380> is

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
fifteen to twenty five percent at it is

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.710 
fifteen to twenty five percent at it is

the same forces you know if you can't

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.900 
the same forces you know if you can't
use<00:04:05.380> a<00:04:05.410> vampire<00:04:05.830> pump<00:04:06.100> one<00:04:06.310> time<00:04:06.490> they<00:04:06.700> pulled

the<00:04:06.970> plug<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.240> next<00:04:07.480> time<00:04:07.630> and<00:04:08.200> expect<00:04:08.500> those

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
the plug the next time and expect those

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.650 
the plug the next time and expect those
to<00:04:09.040> be<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.280> bit<00:04:09.490> more<00:04:09.610> pairs<00:04:09.850> so<00:04:10.270> it's<00:04:10.420> really

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
to be a bit more pairs so it's really

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.530 
to be a bit more pairs so it's really
it's<00:04:11.430> that's<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.610> best<00:04:12.730> way<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.030> do<00:04:13.240> other

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
it's that's the best way to do other

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.930 
it's that's the best way to do other
than<00:04:13.630> that<00:04:13.860> there's<00:04:14.860> really<00:04:14.920> no<00:04:15.430> true<00:04:15.760> way

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
than that there's really no true way

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.340 
than that there's really no true way
other<00:04:16.150> than<00:04:16.239> loosing<00:04:16.540> with<00:04:16.660> manufacturers

because<00:05:21.190> then<00:05:21.400> becomes<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:21.940> issue<00:05:22.180> is<00:05:22.930> the

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
because then becomes the issue is the

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.810 
because then becomes the issue is the

numbers<00:06:52.320> by<00:06:52.500> I<00:06:52.860> think<00:06:53.070> it's<00:06:53.190> up<00:06:53.670> to<00:06:53.910> three

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
numbers by I think it's up to three

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.230 
numbers by I think it's up to three
actual<00:06:54.840> number<00:06:55.170> so<00:06:55.410> we've<00:06:55.620> got<00:06:55.770> 91<00:06:56.430> is<00:06:56.700> like

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 
actual number so we've got 91 is like

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.850 
actual number so we've got 91 is like
night<00:06:57.450> before<00:06:57.750> right<00:06:58.290> and<00:06:58.530> the<00:06:58.650> cool<00:06:58.830> thing

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
night before right and the cool thing

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.920 
night before right and the cool thing
about<00:06:59.040> that<00:06:59.460> is<00:06:59.790> not<00:07:00.120> only<00:07:00.240> to<00:07:00.390> the<00:07:00.420> booster<00:07:00.810> we

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
about that is not only to the booster we

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.420 
about that is not only to the booster we
seem<00:07:01.080> to<00:07:01.230> develop<00:07:01.620> in<00:07:01.740> place<00:07:01.980> that's<00:07:02.190> great

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430 
seem to develop in place that's great

seem to develop in place that's great
it's<00:07:02.970> actually<00:07:03.360> a<00:07:03.600> stabilizer<00:07:04.290> well<00:07:04.590> so<00:07:04.950> it

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.460 
it's actually a stabilizer well so it

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.629 
it's actually a stabilizer well so it
comes<00:07:05.670> back<00:07:05.910> to<00:07:06.090> the<00:07:06.180> effects<00:07:06.480> at<00:07:06.660> the<00:07:06.840> ethanol

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:09.639 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:12.209

00:07:12.209 --> 00:07:12.219 
absorb water intend to gel it's going to

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:14.999 
absorb water intend to gel it's going to
stabilize<00:07:12.729> the<00:07:12.909> fuel<00:07:13.409> and<00:07:14.409> that's<00:07:14.740> kind<00:07:14.979> of

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:15.009 
stabilize the fuel and that's kind of

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:16.290 
stabilize the fuel and that's kind of
considering<00:07:15.400> that<00:07:15.550> those<00:07:15.729> people<00:07:15.909> who<00:07:16.090> want

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:16.300 
considering that those people who want

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.909 
considering that those people who want
an<00:07:16.389> octane<00:07:16.689> boost<00:07:16.960> don't<00:07:17.199> drive<00:07:17.439> every<00:07:17.680> day<00:07:17.710> in
