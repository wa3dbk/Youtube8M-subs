00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.149
 if you close your eyes you imagine a typical 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:10.050
 california landscape is likely to 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.570
 imagine many palms 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.150
 however the care of these trees 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.190
 has a cost the lives of the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.220
 palm pruners that frequently 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.970
 are at risk of drowning asphyxiation and 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.970
 other dangers 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.800
 our main news that night a 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.410
 palm becomes a deadly trap 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.570
 the authorities say that a man who 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.239
 I pruned a tree died after being 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.520
 trapped and asphyxiated firefighters 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.710
 they work frantically cutting the 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:47.430
 leaves to find the victim below 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.430
 of foliage roberto garcia 35 years 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.460
 was the most out of my age 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.410
 and we beat them with 4 years 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.989
 and the day that happened to my brother 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.690
 until now it was more impossible it was not 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.690
 I could believe 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.479
 to pure two you can here from the house 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.640
 and I told him that it was not because he 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.710
 I looked pretty tired 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.130
 and he told me no mom not to put it out 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.020
 both half an hour hard pruning each palm 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.979
 and not any more 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.979
 he did not return 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.700
 the face of california program investigates 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.829
 the deaths that occurred at work 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.659
 we created this video to honor the 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.759
 Roberto's memory and to help 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.679
 prevent tragedies like this from coming back 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.729
 to happen 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.729
 let's remember what happened that day 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.560
 the owner of a house hired a 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.540
 gang of workers so that 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.890
 can several palms very high in their 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.229
 home 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.450
 Roberto had pruned palms for many 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.190
 years but none of the members of the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.229
 gang were certified as 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.119
 tree carriers did not even have 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.510
 contractors' licenses in pruning 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.510
 trees 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.530
 they had worked for many hours that 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.750
 day when Roberto started climbing the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.570
 fourth tree that he played during that 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.810
 day used a ladder to 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.400
 start to climb was tied to the trunk and 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.180
 He climbed up to reach the dead leaves 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.180
 from the palm 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.760
 but when I get to the leaves I climb by 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:27.129
 under them and started cutting from 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.170
 down what puts the climbers in 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.610
 serious danger of falling or 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.610
 slide over the leaves 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.910
 Roberto began to tear off the leaves 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.160
 dead with their hands when suddenly 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.470
 the crown of the heavy leaves 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.489
 detached 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.379
 stopping it against the trunk of the tree 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.379
 and making breathing difficult 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.840
 the lifeguards arrived at the place without 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.810
 But to rescue workers in 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.640
 palms can be very complicated about 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.069
 all when the trees are in the 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.370
 rear gardens located far from the 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.769
 Also, Roberto was hidden 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.780
 under the leaves and although they were used 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.360
 trucks with stairs and a group of 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.170
 search and rescue to locate it not 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.060
 They could arrive in time apparently 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.280
 weight of the leaves of the palm was 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.700
 on his chest making it difficult 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.700
 breathing 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.400
 how could this have been prevented 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.670
 first of all it must be guaranteed that 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.040
 the workers that can palms 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.439
 have been trained and certified by 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.159
 the tri care industry association for the 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:43.170
 international arboriculture society 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:45.540
 if a worker is not certified 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.780
 someone else who it is must 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.420
 supervise your work 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.400
 When pruning a tree, companies must 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.200
 use a truck with a basket or a 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.959
 lifting platform with protection 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.000
 against falls this allows the 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:03.400
 workers stay away from 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.400
 the leaves while doing their job 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.080
 However, if you do not have a truck with 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.660
 layette the workers should use 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.220
 best practices that include a 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.250
 climbing technique that places the 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.930
 worker above the leaves you 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.140
 will climb out of the palms 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.970
 using the double loop technique stepping 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.890
 over the dead leaves all towards 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.890
 up until you reach the mere crown 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:35.599
 is going to tie the heart of the palm 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:37.960
 and from there it will start from the top towards 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:40.030
 down doing his job 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.919
 and will never be in that danger of 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.800
 be inside the leaves so that 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.470
 will not fall on the owners of 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.669
 house should only hire companies from 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.669
 care of trees that are 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.930
 certified and are licensed these 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.789
 are the people who are going to be 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.250
 insured and will comply with the 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.740
 security rules so check 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.810
 your credentials so much to protect 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.720
 workers and to protect 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.759
 you as a home owner in places 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.710
 where there are palms the departments of 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.419
 firefighters must develop and implement 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.300
 workers rescue plans 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:16.240
 trapped that includes written scripts 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.880
 for dispatchers a combination 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.340
 adequate personal equipment including 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.470
 at least two trucks with stairs a 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.930
 Fireman truck in case of fire and 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.570
 ideally a lifting platform 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.370
 and training for each firefighter to 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.289
 that everyone is prepared in 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.839
 rescue cases in palms 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.849
 we had about six or seven rescues 

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:41.580
 with fatalities per year in palms in the 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:43.409
 Los Angeles County this is a type 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.419
 rescue very dangerous and is 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.639
 happening often enough that 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.770
 We need to establish good plans and 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:53.210
 good training to handle these 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.210
 rescues properly 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.430
 our industry can be one of the 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.230
 more dangerous than there are 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.720
 and that's the first thing I'll think 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:10.580
 every day I want to make sure that everyone 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:13.240
 return home every day safe and sound 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:16.039
 and over a year and a half he died 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.110
 I for me as if I have hardly been 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.120
 warned that clean 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.410
 but other people hopefully and that no longer 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.969
 what happened to us happened to us 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:27.069
 we 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:27.069
 and he 's just starting to live
