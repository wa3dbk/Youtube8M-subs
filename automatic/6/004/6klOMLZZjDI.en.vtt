great hey thanks okay so just in a
nutshell<00:00:16.550> here<00:00:16.910> what<00:00:17.090> what<00:00:17.539> is<00:00:17.630> a<00:00:17.660> parallel

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
nutshell here what what is a parallel

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:19.660 
nutshell here what what is a parallel
insight<00:00:18.589> and<00:00:18.740> what<00:00:18.830> does<00:00:18.920> it<00:00:18.949> do<00:00:19.130> so<00:00:19.460> prevalent

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
insight and what does it do so prevalent

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.909 
insight and what does it do so prevalent
sites<00:00:20.000> are<00:00:20.150> new<00:00:20.470> development<00:00:21.470> environment

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:21.919 
sites are new development environment

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:23.650 
sites are new development environment
for<00:00:22.369> visual<00:00:22.550> studio<00:00:22.580> for<00:00:23.060> doing<00:00:23.240> a<00:00:23.330> GPU

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
for visual studio for doing a GPU

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.929 
for visual studio for doing a GPU
development<00:00:24.109> so<00:00:24.199> then<00:00:24.320> look<00:00:24.740> cute<00:00:25.189> and<00:00:25.400> shader

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
development so then look cute and shader

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.790 
development so then look cute and shader
and<00:00:26.060> graphics<00:00:26.480> developmental<00:00:27.019> great<00:00:27.499> great

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
and graphics developmental great great

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.980 
and graphics developmental great great
so<00:00:28.070> so<00:00:28.640> what<00:00:28.789> are<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:28.999> key<00:00:29.419> things<00:00:29.449> here<00:00:29.779> again

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
so so what are the key things here again

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.540 
so so what are the key things here again
we<00:00:30.140> know<00:00:30.230> we<00:00:30.349> have<00:00:30.380> an<00:00:30.650> env<00:00:30.890> perfed<00:00:31.310> that's

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
we know we have an env perfed that's

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.280 
we know we have an env perfed that's
been<00:00:31.669> used<00:00:31.820> in<00:00:31.939> the<00:00:31.999> past<00:00:32.060> yes<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:32.870> how<00:00:33.230> would

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
been used in the past yes so how would

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.569 
been used in the past yes so how would
you<00:00:33.380> say<00:00:33.620> this<00:00:33.829> is<00:00:33.980> really<00:00:34.100> different<00:00:34.370> from

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
you say this is really different from

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:35.979 
you say this is really different from
the<00:00:34.730> previous<00:00:34.820> tool<00:00:35.180> so<00:00:35.329> that's<00:00:35.539> really<00:00:35.750> sort

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
the previous tool so that's really sort

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.500 
the previous tool so that's really sort
of<00:00:36.079> pun<00:00:36.469> next<00:00:36.920> okay<00:00:37.430> we've<00:00:37.760> taken<00:00:37.969> that<00:00:38.149> basic

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
of pun next okay we've taken that basic

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.299 
of pun next okay we've taken that basic
concept<00:00:38.899> we<00:00:39.110> expanded<00:00:39.530> out<00:00:39.680> the<00:00:39.890> number<00:00:40.190> of

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
concept we expanded out the number of

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.400 
concept we expanded out the number of
directions<00:00:40.430> which<00:00:41.000> was<00:00:41.239> about<00:00:41.570> should<00:00:41.989> offer

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
directions which was about should offer

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.990 
directions which was about should offer
really<00:00:42.890> a<00:00:42.920> lot<00:00:43.129> of<00:00:43.219> benefits<00:00:43.579> both<00:00:43.760> on<00:00:43.910> the

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
really a lot of benefits both on the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.430 
really a lot of benefits both on the
debug<00:00:44.239> inside<00:00:44.539> and<00:00:44.719> the<00:00:44.840> performance<00:00:45.289> side

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
debug inside and the performance side

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.750 
debug inside and the performance side
now<00:00:45.800> I<00:00:45.829> hear<00:00:46.039> this<00:00:46.190> is<00:00:46.340> integrated<00:00:46.730> with

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
now I hear this is integrated with

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.869 
now I hear this is integrated with
visual<00:00:47.090> studio<00:00:47.149> is<00:00:47.600> it<00:00:47.780> just<00:00:47.989> visual<00:00:48.350> studio

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
visual studio is it just visual studio

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.400 
visual studio is it just visual studio
2008-2010<00:00:49.879> what<00:00:50.090> does<00:00:50.180> it<00:00:50.239> work<00:00:50.390> with<00:00:50.570> so<00:00:50.809> 2008

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
2008-2010 what does it work with so 2008

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.930 
2008-2010 what does it work with so 2008
right<00:00:51.590> now<00:00:51.769> in<00:00:51.949> our<00:00:52.010> current<00:00:52.399> beta<00:00:52.609> i'm

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
right now in our current beta i'm

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.299 
right now in our current beta i'm
working<00:00:53.180> on<00:00:53.359> 2010<00:00:53.840> support<00:00:54.260> so<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:55.070> know<00:00:55.160> in<00:00:55.250> a

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
working on 2010 support so you know in a

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:56.470 
working on 2010 support so you know in a
few<00:00:55.340> weeks<00:00:55.579> we<00:00:55.760> should<00:00:55.789> have<00:00:56.000> that<00:00:56.030> ready<00:00:56.359> to

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
few weeks we should have that ready to

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.750 
few weeks we should have that ready to
go<00:00:56.600> excellent<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:57.530> does<00:00:57.980> this<00:00:58.129> only<00:00:58.309> work<00:00:58.640> with

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
go excellent so does this only work with

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.990 
go excellent so does this only work with
NVIDIA<00:00:59.149> GPUs<00:00:59.890> so<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:01.429> shader<00:01:01.670> debugger

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
NVIDIA GPUs so the the shader debugger

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.849 
NVIDIA GPUs so the the shader debugger
is<00:01:02.120> is<00:01:02.690> something<00:01:03.109> that<00:01:03.230> we<00:01:03.350> hook<00:01:03.500> into<00:01:03.679> our

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
is is something that we hook into our

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:04.770 
is is something that we hook into our
own<00:01:03.980> Harvard

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
own Harvard

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.510 
own Harvard
because<00:01:04.989> that's<00:01:05.560> up<00:01:05.770> we<00:01:05.920> were<00:01:06.040> actually<00:01:06.159> live

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
because that's up we were actually live

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.990 
because that's up we were actually live
debugging<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.180> GPU<00:01:07.630> on<00:01:07.869> the<00:01:08.110> hardware<00:01:08.380> itself

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
debugging the GPU on the hardware itself

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.480 
debugging the GPU on the hardware itself
but<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.270> API<00:01:10.990> level<00:01:11.320> functionality<00:01:12.130> can<00:01:12.430> be

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
but the API level functionality can be

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.539 
but the API level functionality can be
used<00:01:13.020> that's<00:01:14.020> great<00:01:14.229> so<00:01:14.500> what<00:01:15.100> would<00:01:15.190> you<00:01:15.250> say

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
used that's great so what would you say

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.280 
used that's great so what would you say
are<00:01:15.580> like<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.030> top<00:01:16.240> three<00:01:16.570> things<00:01:16.810> you<00:01:17.049> really

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
are like the top three things you really

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.660 
are like the top three things you really
want<00:01:17.500> people<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:17.770> be<00:01:17.890> excited<00:01:18.310> about<00:01:18.369> when

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
want people to be excited about when

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.340 
want people to be excited about when
they're<00:01:18.820> looking<00:01:19.360> and<00:01:19.659> thinking<00:01:19.690> about<00:01:20.140> using

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
they're looking and thinking about using

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.920 
they're looking and thinking about using
nvidia<00:01:21.310> parallel<00:01:21.700> site<00:01:22.000> so<00:01:22.300> number<00:01:22.479> one<00:01:22.720> is<00:01:22.750> a

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
nvidia parallel site so number one is a

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.149 
nvidia parallel site so number one is a
hardware-based<00:01:23.259> you<00:01:23.500> to<00:01:23.619> demote<00:01:23.830> so

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
hardware-based you to demote so

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.520 
hardware-based you to demote so
basically<00:01:24.580> its<00:01:25.000> individual<00:01:25.899> studio<00:01:26.200> using

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
basically its individual studio using

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.469 
basically its individual studio using
this<00:01:26.640> familiar<00:01:27.640> you<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:28.000> visual<00:01:28.149> studio

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
this familiar you the visual studio

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.450 
this familiar you the visual studio
interface<00:01:28.869> even<00:01:29.530> have<00:01:29.649> pulled<00:01:29.920> debugger<00:01:30.310> that

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
interface even have pulled debugger that

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.950 
interface even have pulled debugger that
looks<00:01:30.580> just<00:01:30.759> like<00:01:31.060> you<00:01:31.240> give<00:01:31.630> I<00:01:31.720> can<00:01:31.869> see

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
looks just like you give I can see

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.940 
looks just like you give I can see
pupils<00:01:32.380> let's<00:01:32.590> move<00:01:32.740> one<00:01:33.030> number<00:01:34.030> two<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.509> our

pupils let's move one number two is our

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.550 
pupils let's move one number two is our

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
combined CPU GPU and else so this gives

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.340

to visual studio you'll notice that we

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.420 
to visual studio you'll notice that we
can<00:02:26.170> see<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:26.470> same<00:02:26.620> frame<00:02:26.890> over<00:02:27.160> here<00:02:27.310> now

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
can see the same frame over here now

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.630 
can see the same frame over here now
same<00:02:27.670> frame<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.420> also<00:02:28.750> which<00:02:29.620> event<00:02:30.370> in<00:02:30.519> which

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
same frame and also which event in which

same frame and also which event in which
piece<00:02:30.850> of<00:02:30.880> geometry<00:02:31.180> Rama<00:02:31.690> is<00:02:31.959> also<00:02:32.350> sick<00:02:33.250> so

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
piece of geometry Rama is also sick so

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.250 
piece of geometry Rama is also sick so
between<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.090> HUD<00:02:34.269> and<00:02:34.299> then<00:02:34.780> hopefully<00:02:35.170> us

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
between the HUD and then hopefully us

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.990 
between the HUD and then hopefully us
all<00:02:35.440> about<00:02:35.530> focus<00:02:36.130> in<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.280> little<00:02:36.519> bit<00:02:36.670> so<00:02:36.850> go

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
all about focus in a little bit so go

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.390 
all about focus in a little bit so go
ahead<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.239> keep<00:02:37.390> going<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:38.410> now<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:38.950> can<00:02:39.280> also

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
ahead and keep going so now you can also

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.280

more about the event that we were
looking<00:02:44.739> at

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
looking at

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.920 
looking at
very<00:02:45.190> cool<00:02:45.340> here's<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:45.849> geometry<00:02:46.510> for<00:02:46.780> that

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
very cool here's the geometry for that

very cool here's the geometry for that
draw<00:02:47.170> hull<00:02:47.440> here<00:02:48.250> are<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.459> textures<00:02:48.910> so<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.150> can

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
draw hull here are the textures so I can

quick<00:03:05.230> exactly<00:03:06.010> can<00:03:06.099> see<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.340> full<00:03:06.489> list

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
quick exactly can see the full list

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.370 
quick exactly can see the full list
what's<00:03:06.910> happening<00:03:07.239> in<00:03:07.330> there<00:03:07.480> exactly

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
what's happening in there exactly

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.589 
what's happening in there exactly
alright<00:03:08.680> so<00:03:09.519> now<00:03:09.819> one<00:03:10.000> other<00:03:10.030> really<00:03:10.300> cool

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
alright so now one other really cool

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.610 
alright so now one other really cool
thing<00:03:10.840> is<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.400> ability<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:13.440> do<00:03:14.440> this

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
thing is is the ability to do this

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.229 
thing is is the ability to do this
combined<00:03:15.340> cpu<00:03:15.730> GPU<00:03:15.760> pipe<00:03:16.390> trace

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
combined cpu GPU pipe trace

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.449 
combined cpu GPU pipe trace
so<00:03:19.239> you<00:03:19.329> can<00:03:19.420> see<00:03:19.569> here<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:19.870> have<00:03:20.189> let<00:03:21.189> me<00:03:21.280> zoom

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
so you can see here I have let me zoom

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.869 
so you can see here I have let me zoom
out<00:03:21.609> a<00:03:21.670> little<00:03:21.760> bit<00:03:22.090> i<00:03:22.299> have<00:03:23.249> cpu<00:03:24.249> information

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
out a little bit i have cpu information

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.670 
out a little bit i have cpu information
here<00:03:25.120> like<00:03:25.389> for<00:03:25.569> instance<00:03:25.659> core<00:03:26.079> utilization

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
here like for instance core utilization

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.110 
here like for instance core utilization
for<00:03:26.859> for<00:03:27.099> this<00:03:27.189> is<00:03:27.340> on<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.459> dual-core<00:03:27.879> bomb

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
for for this is on a dual-core bomb

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.089 
for for this is on a dual-core bomb
right<00:03:28.569> as<00:03:28.780> we<00:03:28.900> see<00:03:29.019> two<00:03:29.170> cores<00:03:29.469> you<00:03:29.829> can<00:03:29.950> also

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
right as we see two cores you can also

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.699 
right as we see two cores you can also
see<00:03:30.340> which<00:03:30.549> processes<00:03:31.030> were<00:03:31.180> running<00:03:31.709> purple

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
see which processes were running purple

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.289 
see which processes were running purple
means<00:03:32.739> that<00:03:33.189> hey<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.609> wasn't<00:03:33.790> our<00:03:33.939> process

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
means that hey that wasn't our process

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:35.429 
means that hey that wasn't our process
running<00:03:34.510> that<00:03:34.719> was<00:03:34.810> something<00:03:34.989> else<00:03:35.139> running

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 
running that was something else running

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:36.929 
running that was something else running
in<00:03:35.590> a<00:03:35.620> fetal<00:03:35.769> mouse<00:03:36.189> over<00:03:36.489> it<00:03:36.579> you<00:03:36.639> can<00:03:36.790> see

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:36.939 
in a fetal mouse over it you can see

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.420 
in a fetal mouse over it you can see
what<00:03:37.090> process<00:03:37.450> that<00:03:37.629> was<00:03:37.780> now<00:03:38.739> as<00:03:38.980> we<00:03:39.159> drill

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
what process that was now as we drill

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.129 
what process that was now as we drill
down<00:03:39.459> more<00:03:39.849> you<00:03:40.359> can<00:03:40.480> actually<00:03:40.599> see<00:03:40.750> what<00:03:41.019> was

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
down more you can actually see what was

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.979 
down more you can actually see what was
running<00:03:41.439> on<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.650> GPU<00:03:42.010> so<00:03:42.370> i<00:03:42.639> can<00:03:43.180> see<00:03:43.420> memory

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
running on the GPU so i can see memory

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.959 
running on the GPU so i can see memory
transfers<00:03:44.439> that<00:03:44.560> happen<00:03:44.889> on<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.099> GPU<00:03:45.430> between

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:45.969 
transfers that happen on the GPU between

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:48.569 
transfers that happen on the GPU between
the<00:03:46.030> GPU<00:03:46.389> area<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.379> cpu<00:03:47.769> so<00:03:47.980> so<00:03:48.340> you<00:03:48.430> can

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
the GPU area and the cpu so so you can

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:49.770 
the GPU area and the cpu so so you can
actually<00:03:48.700> see<00:03:48.879> those<00:03:49.090> transfers<00:03:49.569> that<00:03:49.659> are

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
actually see those transfers that are

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.140 
actually see those transfers that are
having<00:03:50.019> CPU<00:03:50.530> GPU<00:03:50.769> you<00:03:51.489> can<00:03:51.639> really<00:03:51.760> see<00:03:51.969> all

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
having CPU GPU you can really see all

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.640 
having CPU GPU you can really see all
the<00:03:52.269> full<00:03:52.480> details<00:03:52.870> that<00:03:53.049> are<00:03:53.139> happening<00:03:53.290> to

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
the full details that are happening to

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.709 
the full details that are happening to
throughout<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.159> system<00:03:54.340> not<00:03:54.939> just<00:03:55.000> on<00:03:55.510> the

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:55.719 
throughout the system not just on the

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:58.080 
throughout the system not just on the
nvidia<00:03:56.049> GPU<00:03:56.530> but<00:03:57.069> across<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.549> entire<00:03:57.819> scheme

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
nvidia GPU but across the entire scheme
