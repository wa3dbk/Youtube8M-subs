00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.610
 Oh 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.770
 Hi Hi 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.150
 it had been a while I had not done 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.160
 videos I did not have too much morale 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.900
 so I did not have too much cat 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.330
 videos but today I wanted you 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.980
 share a little tip for 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.960
 unwanted hair that you have on 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.850
 the face ie the of the fact as 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.340
 the mustache or sometimes you have 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:35.090
 down on the cheeks on the mandant I 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.489
 do not know but it's a mask 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.550
 actually that will help you really 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.600
 fight that down that you have on the 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.110
 face that you have trouble with you 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.020
 get rid of 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.840
 it will save you hair removal that month 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.610
 for me I think I think it's 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.660
 push back a bit more hair there is 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.399
 who say it does not do too much 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.630
 pushed but I know a lot of 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.710
 people who epilate their mustache and 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.290
 frankly I think the stoves are 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.760
 inch really thicker and maybe 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.230
 that it's in the beginning but I know 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.790
 a person who spies his mustache 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.329
 for a while and she has some 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.880
 mustache 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:09.020
 so I do not know why that's it 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.999
 maybe all the people do not 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.590
 are not the same but if you want 

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:13.369
 avoid hair removal at the same because 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.149
 it is very painful 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.889
 I invite you to look at the mask that 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.499
 I made for you, so you 

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:23.840
 will simply need turmeric then 

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:26.259
 turmeric is a is actually a spice 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.869
 it's an Indian spice 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.969
 that's mustard color and it's a 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.529
 spice in general that concert for 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:36.499
 cook on the other hand I do not recommend 

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:38.060
 the the turmeric cooking I you 

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:40.639
 rather advise of alain buyo store 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.240
 an organic store sorry and ask for 

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:45.709
 turmeric one trying to take the one that 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.340
 do not like you because if you do 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:51.770
 a mask with the kit the ass with the 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.479
 turmeric cooking you are going to stay 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.919
 with the faces a little bit orange and 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.810
 have a hard time getting him off because 

00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:03.049
 it's pretty pigmented so it's us 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.060
 will need turmeric and either you take from 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.159
 water either you take milk that's 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.960
 as you want anyway will be the 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.650
 even 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.260
 it will have the same effect I have put 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.240
 the water so you take it around for the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.750
 face you take about 2 spoons to 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.060
 soup 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.120
 well there I made my mask that everything to 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.940
 time and you simply 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.069
 a fat actually you add the milk or 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.330
 water as and when not too much 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.860
 because you have to go slowly 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
 a little by little for really that 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.590
 make a patina we should add some 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.720
 the powder if it's too liquid 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:40.209
 so here we have to make it 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.769
 dough like this here you are at 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.150
 to lure with a brush I took a 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.970
 brush simply with a foundation 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.350
 and then you and I are you 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.590
 advise to spread it all over the face 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.570
 you can do that on the top 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.920
 from the lip or that's where you want 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.330
 where there is tibet but me 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.690
 also advises to do it all over the 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.300
 face 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.000
 because turmeric is not just a 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.030
 very good actually I did not explain to you 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.760
 Turmeric for hair is something 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.489
 thing in fact that will make your hair 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.680
 the root is weakened and as 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.190
 and as lara the hair will grow less 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.500
 thick and 26 as if you were doing a 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.150
 hair removal but it will be a mask it's up to 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.380
 to say that the hair vallat silva was 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.900
 tired with the patient pleasure the 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.440
 power of the piss and in 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.180
 tiresome 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.519
 it will grow less and less it's up to 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.739
 to say that there the hair will weaken 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.989
 so I advise you to put it 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.150
 also all over the face because the 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.910
 turmeric is also a very very good 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:44.079
 mask for blackheads and also 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.160
 for the problems of paul 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.630
 aging etc 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.920
 so I advise you to do it on 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.840
 all the face so that will really make a 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.060
 produced for many things at the same 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.790
 time it will not be specially that 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.750
 for the down but it will be also 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.730
 reduce your blackhead problems 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.930
 your acne problems and the 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.840
 aging of your break it's up to 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.340
 to say that it will help you also I was told 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.170
 also that it could help clear up 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.060
 the face so to test 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.430
 it's really cheap at all you 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.799
 go organic shop or magazine 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.739
 specialized tracks and you ask 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.260
 especially turmeric not turmeric 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.400
 kitchens but turmeric I think the 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.699
 organic turmeric will be very 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.830
 well so here you are doing team has 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:29.030
 and you do it once a week 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.320
 that's enough until if you 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.060
 want it to be for the down you the 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.660
 do until you have more than 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.699
 down or when otherwise it will mass 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.289
 daily for your face for 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.770
 give a little more pep to your 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.350
 face 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.000
 so here it was the little video that 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.270
 I wanted to do you today and 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.669
 I hope I do get back to 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.960
 videos because I really 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.060
 not want to make videos I do not know 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.400
 not why I had not wanted 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.229
 in fact I do not even know how to explain 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.970
 why but I had not given 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.710
