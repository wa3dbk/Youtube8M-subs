00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
know what's arteburn we wanted to stick

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.770 
know what's arteburn we wanted to stick
to<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.610> burn<00:00:35.880> at<00:00:36.149> at<00:00:37.140> first<00:00:37.590> we<00:00:38.010> tried<00:00:38.780> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
to the burn at at first we tried the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.110 
to the burn at at first we tried the
Thunder<00:00:40.530> Lord<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.280> problem<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
Thunder Lord but the problem with the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.819 
Thunder Lord but the problem with the
Thunder<00:00:42.420> Lord<00:00:42.629> was<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.559> be<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.309> far<00:00:44.550> damage<00:00:45.059> and

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
Thunder Lord was it be so far damage and

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.470 
Thunder Lord was it be so far damage and
he<00:00:46.829> would<00:00:47.129> pretty<00:00:47.489> much<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.149> our<00:00:48.270> face

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
he would pretty much get up in our face

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.610 
he would pretty much get up in our face
and<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:48.960> would<00:00:49.140> do<00:00:49.289> enough<00:00:49.530> damage<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:50.219> him<00:00:50.550> in

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
and we would do enough damage to him in

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.310 
and we would do enough damage to him in
which<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:53.120> you<00:00:54.120> know<00:00:54.239> before<00:00:54.660> he<00:00:54.750> gets<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.110> us

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
which I you know before he gets to us

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.720 
which I you know before he gets to us
and<00:00:55.500> then<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:55.649> had<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.920> rotate<00:00:56.190> all<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.579> way

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
and then we had to rotate all the way

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.889 
and then we had to rotate all the way
around<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:58.109> other<00:00:58.379> server<00:00:58.739> tour<00:00:59.090> and<00:01:00.090> you

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
around to the other server tour and you

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.340 
around to the other server tour and you
you<00:01:01.440> know<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:02.280> not<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.000> bad<00:01:03.390> tactic<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.199> do

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
you know it's not a bad tactic to do

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.219 
you know it's not a bad tactic to do
that<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:05.010> whenever<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.729> get<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.299> across<00:01:06.840> in

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
that but whenever you get like across in

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.570 
that but whenever you get like across in
that<00:01:07.350> little<00:01:07.560> corner<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.070> really<00:01:08.369> really

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
that little corner it's really really

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.880 
that little corner it's really really
hard<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.000> get<00:01:09.119> out<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.900> spot<00:01:10.140> just

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
hard to get out of that spot just

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.260 
hard to get out of that spot just
because<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.670> all<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:13.680> enemies<00:01:14.270> corralling

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
because of all of the enemies corralling

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.780 
because of all of the enemies corralling
you<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.659> most<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.710> enemies<00:01:16.860> inside<00:01:17.549> this

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
you and most of the enemies inside this

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.499 
you and most of the enemies inside this
map<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.210> arteburn<00:01:18.900> row<00:01:19.710> does<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.250> art<00:01:20.549> so

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
map is arteburn row does have art so

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.070 
map is arteburn row does have art so
with<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.960> burn<00:01:22.200> inside<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.990> you<00:01:24.990> know

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
with the burn inside of it it you know

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.660 
with the burn inside of it it you know
like<00:01:25.290> shanks<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.860> kill<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.130> two<00:01:26.400> shots

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
like shanks can kill you in two shots

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.690 
like shanks can kill you in two shots
and<00:01:27.090> anything<00:01:27.540> else<00:01:27.689> like<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.310> so<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.520> best

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
and anything else like that so the best

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.600 
and anything else like that so the best
tactic<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.270> we<00:01:30.450> found<00:01:30.720> was<00:01:31.400> pretty<00:01:32.400> much

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
tactic that we found was pretty much

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.200 
tactic that we found was pretty much
just<00:01:33.270> spray<00:01:34.079> Adam<00:01:34.500> grab<00:01:35.100> weapons<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.850> spray

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
just spray Adam grab weapons and spray

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.230 
just spray Adam grab weapons and spray
Adam<00:01:36.479> with<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.470> patients<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.009> time<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.970> was

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
Adam with the patients in time that was

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.499 
Adam with the patients in time that was
the<00:01:39.780> best<00:01:40.020> method<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.740> we<00:01:40.920> found<00:01:41.479> we<00:01:42.479> found

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the best method that we found we found

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.899 
the best method that we found we found
that<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.140> was<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.350> best<00:01:43.470> method<00:01:43.920> because<00:01:44.340> it

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
that it was the best method because it

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.289 
that it was the best method because it
knocked<00:01:45.840> him<00:01:46.079> backwards<00:01:46.649> whenever<00:01:47.610> it

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
knocked him backwards whenever it

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.120 
knocked him backwards whenever it
knocked<00:01:48.600> backwards<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.380> know<00:01:49.500> he<00:01:49.710> couldn't

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
knocked backwards you know he couldn't

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.960 
knocked backwards you know he couldn't
teleport<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.820> us<00:01:51.060> or<00:01:51.950> anything<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.310> so

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
teleport to us or anything like that so

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.870 
teleport to us or anything like that so
in<00:01:54.930> my<00:01:55.320> eyes<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.860> feel<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:56.369> that'd<00:01:56.610> be<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
in my eyes I feel like that'd be the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.280 
in my eyes I feel like that'd be the
best<00:01:57.030> method<00:01:57.540> with<00:01:57.810> weapons<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.740> light<00:01:58.979> and

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
best method with weapons of light and

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.440 
best method with weapons of light and
everything<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.680> nature<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:03.060> did

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
everything in that nature and I did

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.959 
everything in that nature and I did
enjoy<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.380> know<00:02:04.409> effort<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.579> mean<00:02:05.850> it

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
enjoy you know effort this I mean it

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.630 
enjoy you know effort this I mean it
only<00:02:06.090> took<00:02:06.299> us<00:02:06.360> three<00:02:06.689> turns<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.520> was

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
only took us three turns and that was

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.219 
only took us three turns and that was
actually<00:02:08.879> our<00:02:09.149> first<00:02:09.390> time

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
actually our first time

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.860 
actually our first time
on<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.800> using<00:02:11.159> patience<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.819> only<00:02:12.659> two<00:02:12.840> of

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
on just using patience and only two of

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.339 
on just using patience and only two of
us<00:02:13.110> actually<00:02:13.319> use<00:02:13.590> patients<00:02:14.150> vital<00:02:15.349> because

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
us actually use patients vital because

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.649 
us actually use patients vital because
me<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.680> laser<00:02:16.980> use<00:02:17.430> patients<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.060> times<00:02:18.269> and

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
me and laser use patients and times and

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.160

sly<00:02:34.410> /<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:35.610> mean<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:37.319> don't<00:02:37.530> even<00:02:37.680> need

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
sly / I mean so you don't even need

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.369 
sly / I mean so you don't even need
three<00:02:38.700> full<00:02:41.299> patients<00:02:42.299> and<00:02:42.450> times<00:02:42.629> to<00:02:43.140> take

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
three full patients and times to take

three full patients and times to take
him<00:02:43.560> down<00:02:43.590> but<00:02:44.489> that<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.420> mean<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.140> very

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
him down but that I mean it is a very

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.699 
him down but that I mean it is a very
very<00:02:46.620> good<00:02:46.890> method<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.340> use<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.870> is

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
very good method to use and it is

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.319 
very good method to use and it is
actually<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.220> fastest<00:02:50.760> method<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:51.180> we

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
actually the fastest method that we

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.539 
actually the fastest method that we
found<00:02:51.569> to<00:02:51.840> do<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.290> know<00:02:52.410> they're<00:02:52.650> like<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.370> said

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
found to do you know they're like I said

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.030 
found to do you know they're like I said
this<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.150> our<00:02:54.450> method<00:02:54.900> there's<00:02:55.200> probably

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
this is our method there's probably

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.259 
this is our method there's probably
other<00:02:56.370> ways<00:02:56.819> of<00:02:57.299> using<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:57.840> method<00:02:58.260> in<00:02:58.470> which

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
other ways of using the method in which

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.009 
other ways of using the method in which
you<00:03:00.269> know<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.959> help<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.069> feed<00:03:02.220> them<00:03:02.400> but<00:03:03.390> you

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
you know to help to feed them but you

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.229 
you know to help to feed them but you
know<00:03:04.140> what<00:03:04.170> weapons<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.829> light<00:03:05.040> with<00:03:05.640> the

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
know what weapons of light with the

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.960 
know what weapons of light with the
patience<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:06.840> time<00:03:07.049> it<00:03:07.470> increases<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.519> takes

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
patience and time it increases it takes

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.259 
patience and time it increases it takes
it<00:03:09.120> out<00:03:09.239> a<00:03:09.390> lot<00:03:09.690> faster<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.220> mean<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:12.090> is

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
it out a lot faster so I mean this is

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.550 
it out a lot faster so I mean this is
the<00:03:12.359> way<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:12.660> I'm<00:03:12.810> gonna<00:03:12.959> stick<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.440> on

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
the way that I'm gonna stick to it on

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.740 
the way that I'm gonna stick to it on
art<00:03:13.739> burn<00:03:13.920> in<00:03:14.129> the<00:03:14.310> future<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.910> know<00:03:15.269> it's<00:03:15.599> going

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
art burn in the future I know it's going

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.259 
art burn in the future I know it's going
to<00:03:15.810> be<00:03:15.989> different<00:03:16.230> because<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.910> know<00:03:18.060> in

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
to be different because you you know in

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.830 
to be different because you you know in
a<00:03:18.690> few<00:03:18.720> weeks<00:03:19.310> heck<00:03:20.310> next<00:03:20.639> week<00:03:20.970> there<00:03:21.599> might

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
a few weeks heck next week there might

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.199 
a few weeks heck next week there might
not<00:03:21.870> even<00:03:22.079> be<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.680> burn<00:03:22.980> just<00:03:23.370> call<00:03:23.549> us<00:03:23.730> so

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
not even be a burn just call us so

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.670 
not even be a burn just call us so
you're<00:03:24.510> gonna<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:25.139> know<00:03:25.260> it's<00:03:25.410> gonna<00:03:25.500> be<00:03:25.650> a

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
you're gonna you know it's gonna be a

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.050 
you're gonna you know it's gonna be a
lot<00:03:25.799> harder<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.310> which<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:26.669> have<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.819> run

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
lot harder in which you have to run

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.750 
lot harder in which you have to run
around<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.750> actually<00:03:27.900> try<00:03:28.169> to<00:03:28.230> survive<00:03:28.760> while
