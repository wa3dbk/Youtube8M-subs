it's purple and it's leopard print and
it's<00:05:30.510> just<00:05:30.720> black<00:05:30.990> on<00:05:31.320> the<00:05:31.350> inside<00:05:32.030> big<00:05:33.030> I

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
it's just black on the inside big I

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.550 
it's just black on the inside big I
guess<00:05:34.110> would<00:05:34.440> be<00:05:34.470> like<00:05:34.740> a<00:05:34.770> good<00:05:35.010> beach<00:05:35.190> bag<00:05:35.220> um

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
guess would be like a good beach bag um

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.770 
guess would be like a good beach bag um
but<00:05:37.560> it<00:05:37.860> was<00:05:38.100> unclear<00:05:38.520> in<00:05:39.060> store<00:05:41.270> ten<00:05:42.270> dollars

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
but it was unclear in store ten dollars

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.160 
but it was unclear in store ten dollars
I<00:05:42.900> think<00:05:43.280> about<00:05:44.280> that<00:05:44.600> then<00:05:45.600> I<00:05:45.990> got<00:05:46.590> this<00:05:47.130> um

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
I think about that then I got this um

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.630 
I think about that then I got this um
bathing<00:05:49.170> suit<00:05:49.440> cover-up<00:05:49.950> but<00:05:50.190> I<00:05:50.250> guess<00:05:50.490> it

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
bathing suit cover-up but I guess it

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.400 
bathing suit cover-up but I guess it
could<00:05:50.790> kind<00:05:51.060> of<00:05:51.120> also<00:05:51.300> be<00:05:51.600> worn<00:05:51.780> as<00:05:51.990> a<00:05:52.020> dress

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
could kind of also be worn as a dress

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.500 
could kind of also be worn as a dress
but<00:05:52.830> it's<00:05:52.890> like<00:05:53.250> black<00:05:53.640> and<00:05:53.670> it<00:05:54.030> has<00:05:54.150> paint

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
but it's like black and it has paint

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.990 
but it's like black and it has paint
splatter<00:05:54.930> and<00:05:55.260> it<00:05:55.590> matches<00:05:55.890> my<00:05:56.310> gaming<00:05:56.580> suit

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
splatter and it matches my gaming suit

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.020 
splatter and it matches my gaming suit
which<00:05:57.270> is<00:05:57.420> why<00:05:57.540> the<00:05:57.600> reason<00:05:58.320> why<00:05:58.440> I<00:05:58.470> bought<00:05:58.710> it

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030
