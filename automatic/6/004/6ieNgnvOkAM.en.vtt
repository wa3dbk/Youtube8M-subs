00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
let me here to get a little bit of a

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.650 
let me here to get a little bit of a
nest<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.710> my<00:00:22.830> battery<00:00:23.250> however<00:00:23.850> you'll<00:00:24.480> see

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
nest on my battery however you'll see

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.810 
nest on my battery however you'll see
the<00:00:24.810> harness<00:00:25.170> came<00:00:25.800> with<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.039> relay<00:00:28.820> plastic

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
the harness came with the relay plastic

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.090 
the harness came with the relay plastic
push<00:00:30.060> pins<00:00:32.870> follow<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.079> down<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.590> got<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.739> fuse

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
push pins follow it down it's got a fuse

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.330 
push pins follow it down it's got a fuse
I<00:00:35.370> believe<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.969> 30<00:00:36.660> amp<00:00:37.160> and<00:00:38.160> then

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
I believe it was a 30 amp and then

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.610 
I believe it was a 30 amp and then
obviously<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:39.000> positive<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.930> negative<00:00:40.350> lead

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
obviously a positive and negative lead

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.459 
obviously a positive and negative lead
and<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> marine<00:00:42.420> deep-cycle<00:00:42.930> battery

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
and I have a marine deep-cycle battery

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.660 
and I have a marine deep-cycle battery
that<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.829> had<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.640> bolted<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> post

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
that I had it bolted to the post

the<00:00:52.190> only<00:00:52.370> thing<00:00:52.519> I<00:00:52.579> really<00:00:52.879> didn't<00:00:53.089> like

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
the only thing I really didn't like

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.729 
the only thing I really didn't like
about<00:00:53.420> it<00:00:53.690> was<00:00:53.809> that<00:00:53.839> when<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:54.320> lights<00:00:54.559> are

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
about it was that when the lights are

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.729 
about it was that when the lights are
off<00:00:54.949> that<00:00:55.280> light<00:00:55.550> stays<00:00:55.879> red<00:00:56.379> but<00:00:57.379> is<00:00:57.500> pretty

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
off that light stays red but is pretty

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.829 
off that light stays red but is pretty
bright<00:00:58.039> at<00:00:58.219> night<00:00:58.250> driving<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.239> I<00:00:59.570> kind<00:00:59.780> of

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
bright at night driving so I kind of

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:01.959 
bright at night driving so I kind of
tucked<00:01:00.079> it<00:01:00.229> out<00:01:00.350> of<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.530> way<00:01:00.679> and<00:01:01.670> that<00:01:01.850> was

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
tucked it out of the way and that was

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.329 
tucked it out of the way and that was
kind<00:01:02.179> of<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.359> easiest<00:01:02.629> place<00:01:02.960> to<00:01:02.989> put<00:01:03.619> it<00:01:03.769> with

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
kind of the easiest place to put it with

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.249 
kind of the easiest place to put it with
the<00:01:04.519> kick<00:01:04.940> panel<00:01:05.269> that<00:01:05.449> comes<00:01:05.659> off<00:01:05.930> you<00:01:06.110> can

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
the kick panel that comes off you can

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.340 
the kick panel that comes off you can
thread<00:01:06.530> it<00:01:06.619> down<00:01:06.680> in<00:01:07.119> and<00:01:08.119> I<00:01:08.240> had<00:01:08.539> the<00:01:09.080> leads

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
thread it down in and I had the leads

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.840 
thread it down in and I had the leads
coming<00:01:09.680> off<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.039> battery<00:01:10.399> come<00:01:10.670> right

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
coming off the battery come right

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.090 
coming off the battery come right
through<00:01:10.880> one<00:01:11.180> of<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.390> factory<00:01:11.840> plugs<00:01:12.740> on<00:01:12.979> the

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
try to get some nighttime shots for ya

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.300 
try to get some nighttime shots for ya
thing<00:01:39.300> I<00:01:39.420> liked<00:01:39.720> was<00:01:39.900> they<00:01:40.530> actually<00:01:40.710> provided

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
thing I liked was they actually provided

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.860 
thing I liked was they actually provided
the<00:01:41.640> amber<00:01:42.630> covers<00:01:43.140> for<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> LED<00:01:44.460> pod<00:01:44.760> I<00:01:45.150> like

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
the amber covers for the LED pod I like

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.480 
the amber covers for the LED pod I like
this<00:01:46.080> because<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.440> actually<00:01:46.620> had<00:01:46.920> yellow<00:01:47.220> fog

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
this because I actually had yellow fog

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.040 
this because I actually had yellow fog
lights<00:01:47.760> that<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.090> beads<00:01:48.330> actually<00:01:48.750> took<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
lights that the beads actually took the

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.010 
lights that the beads actually took the
place<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.820> think<00:01:50.910> that'll<00:01:51.330> make<00:01:51.360> winter

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
place of so I think that'll make winter

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.560 
place of so I think that'll make winter
driving<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:53.460> know<00:01:53.580> a<00:01:53.610> lot<00:01:53.850> easier<00:01:54.300> and

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
driving you know a lot easier and

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.310 
driving you know a lot easier and
offroad<00:01:55.440> I<00:01:55.680> think<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:55.950> will<00:01:56.010> be<00:01:56.100> great

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
offroad I think it will be great

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.860 
offroad I think it will be great
