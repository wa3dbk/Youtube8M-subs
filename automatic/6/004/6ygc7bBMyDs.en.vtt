okay<00:00:00.949> this<00:00:01.949> is<00:00:02.129> Andy<00:00:02.460> again<00:00:03.589> we<00:00:04.589> are<00:00:04.680> going<00:00:04.950> to

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
okay this is Andy again we are going to

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.039 
okay this is Andy again we are going to
pick<00:00:05.310> up<00:00:05.460> from<00:00:05.730> where<00:00:05.790> we<00:00:06.000> left<00:00:06.150> on<00:00:06.690> the

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
pick up from where we left on the

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.540 
pick up from where we left on the
Fighting<00:00:07.680> Temptations<00:00:07.859> song<00:00:10.130> just<00:00:11.130> so<00:00:11.370> we

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
Fighting Temptations song just so we

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.789 
Fighting Temptations song just so we
correct<00:00:11.940> some<00:00:12.210> mistakes<00:00:12.240> we<00:00:13.230> have<00:00:13.259> made<00:00:13.380> in

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
correct some mistakes we have made in

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.929 
correct some mistakes we have made in
the<00:00:13.950> previous<00:00:14.130> video<00:00:14.580> we<00:00:15.170> said<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:18.410> was<00:00:19.410> a

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
the previous video we said the a was a

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.420 
the previous video we said the a was a
first<00:00:20.939> inversion<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.830> was<00:00:22.980> not<00:00:23.130> quite

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
first inversion and that was not quite

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.689 
first inversion and that was not quite
correct<00:00:23.640> because<00:00:24.260> this<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.830> second

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
correct because this is a second

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.990 
correct because this is a second
inversion<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.869> minor<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:29.160> root<00:00:29.369> position<00:00:29.400> is

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
inversion a minor in root position is

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.780 
inversion a minor in root position is
played<00:00:30.359> with<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:31.219> see<00:00:35.930> if<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.559> made<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.489> last

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
played with a see if we made the last

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.869 
played with a see if we made the last
note<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> chord<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:41.010> bottom<00:00:41.430> note<00:00:41.670> like

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
note of the chord the bottom note like

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.500 
note of the chord the bottom note like
we're<00:00:42.120> taking<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.510> heat<00:00:42.930> down<00:00:43.170> late<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.129> day

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
we're taking the heat down late on day

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.810 
we're taking the heat down late on day
so<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.600> becomes<00:00:45.989> second<00:00:46.649> inflation<00:00:47.160> not<00:00:47.430> first

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
so it becomes second inflation not first

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.610 
so it becomes second inflation not first
inversion<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.750> said<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.110> was<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.289> first

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
inversion so we said it was a first

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.400 
inversion so we said it was a first
inversion<00:00:49.920> now<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.489> second<00:00:50.850> inversion

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
inversion now it's a second inversion

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.670 
inversion now it's a second inversion
okay<00:00:52.910> that's<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.079> mistake<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.649> think

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
okay that's that is the mistake I think

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.290 
okay that's that is the mistake I think
we<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.399> made<00:00:56.640> all<00:00:57.629> right<00:00:58.760> just<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.910> recap

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
we have made all right just to recap

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:19.510 
we have made all right just to recap
what<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.719> did<00:01:01.820> last<00:01:02.820> time<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.899> go<00:01:04.080> again

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.070 

right<00:01:20.500> now<00:01:21.500> we<00:01:21.560> play<00:01:22.100> again<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:23.510> same<00:01:23.750> thing

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
right now we play again the same thing

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.800 
right now we play again the same thing
up<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.799> same<00:01:25.040> way<00:01:25.250> we<00:01:25.460> played<00:01:25.790> it<00:01:25.970> but<00:01:26.630> it's

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
up the same way we played it but it's

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.290 
up the same way we played it but it's
almost<00:01:26.960> different<00:01:27.380> it's<00:01:28.280> not<00:01:28.400> exactly<00:01:29.119> the

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
almost different it's not exactly the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.780 
almost different it's not exactly the
same<00:01:29.540> way<00:01:29.690> we<00:01:29.869> played<00:01:30.170> on<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:30.979> right<00:01:31.340> hand<00:01:31.610> we

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
same way we played on the right hand we

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.640 
same way we played on the right hand we
still<00:01:32.090> start<00:01:32.360> with<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.840> same<00:01:33.050> E<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:35.390> C<00:01:35.720> this

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
still start with the same E and C this

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.590 
still start with the same E and C this
is<00:01:36.830> middle<00:01:37.070> C<00:01:37.340> by<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.580> way<00:01:38.080> there<00:01:39.080> we<00:01:39.320> go<00:01:40.600> we

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
is middle C by the way there we go we

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.620 
is middle C by the way there we go we
sort<00:01:41.810> of<00:01:41.869> play<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:43.040> F<00:01:43.250> on<00:01:43.520> down<00:01:43.759> this<00:01:44.000> time<00:01:44.270> we

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
sort of play the F on down this time we

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.290 
sort of play the F on down this time we
don't<00:01:44.869> play<00:01:45.080> together<00:01:45.140> with<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:45.860> C<00:01:46.100> but<00:01:47.030> when

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
don't play together with the C but when

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.800 
don't play together with the C but when
we<00:01:47.450> throw<00:01:47.750> in<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.350> G<00:01:48.970> we<00:01:49.970> throw<00:01:50.240> in<00:01:50.420> together

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
we throw in the G we throw in together

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.090 
we throw in the G we throw in together
with<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.229> see

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
with the see

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.410 
with the see
so<00:01:52.730> how<00:01:52.909> do<00:01:52.970> we<00:01:53.120> do<00:01:53.360> that<00:01:53.570> we<00:01:54.170> go

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.649 

right<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.400> then<00:01:59.400> instead<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.880> doing<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.630> a

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
right and then instead of doing the a

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.460 
right and then instead of doing the a
that'll<00:02:01.409> played<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.950> last<00:02:02.190> time<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.970> that

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
that'll played the last time like that

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.740 
that'll played the last time like that
because<00:02:04.470> this<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:05.370> actual<00:02:05.880> fact<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.479> part

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
because this in actual fact is the part

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.990 
because this in actual fact is the part
of<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.080> F<00:02:07.229> chord<00:02:07.619> we<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.160> played<00:02:08.490> the<00:02:08.729> top

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
of the F chord we just played the top

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.350 
of the F chord we just played the top
notes<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.590> time<00:02:10.920> we<00:02:11.730> won't<00:02:11.910> play

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
notes of it so this time we won't play

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.360 
notes of it so this time we won't play
that<00:02:12.390> hope<00:02:12.959> not<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.290> play<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.680> bottom<00:02:13.920> notes

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
that hope not to play the bottom notes

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.370 
that hope not to play the bottom notes
which<00:02:14.610> is<00:02:14.840> going<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.990> be<00:02:16.170> F<00:02:16.470> and

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
which is going to be F and

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.630 
which is going to be F and
so<00:02:18.740> how<00:02:18.950> do<00:02:19.010> we<00:02:19.220> do<00:02:19.610> that<00:02:19.910> we<00:02:20.480> do<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:20.840> like<00:02:21.020> so

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.370 

this<00:02:25.640> is<00:02:25.850> just<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.240> keep<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.630> effect<00:02:27.080> as<00:02:27.230> if

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
this is just to keep that effect as if

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.360 
this is just to keep that effect as if
it's<00:02:27.530> going<00:02:27.800> down

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
it's going down

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.470 
it's going down
so<00:02:28.550> again

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.949 

all<00:02:34.050> right<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:35.370> if<00:02:35.790> we<00:02:35.849> looked<00:02:36.300> at<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.750> base

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
all right so if we looked at the base

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:44.890 
all right so if we looked at the base
again<00:02:37.739> it<00:02:38.670> plays<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.000> same<00:02:39.390> thing<00:02:39.720> see

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.100 

all<00:02:45.379> right<00:02:45.590> so<00:02:46.310> together<00:02:46.549> it<00:02:46.909> goes

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.250 

okay<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:51.590> then<00:02:51.710> you<00:02:51.830> still<00:02:52.070> do<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.520> tell<00:02:52.850> me

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
okay and then you still do that tell me

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.200 
okay and then you still do that tell me
now<00:02:54.260> this<00:02:54.530> time<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:54.920> play<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.160> full<00:02:55.610> Jew<00:02:55.910> card

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
now this time you play the full Jew card

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:03.510 
now this time you play the full Jew card
on<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.540> right<00:02:56.690> hand

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.149 
you can still play the octave down if
you<00:03:24.390> like<00:03:24.569> or<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.170> can<00:03:25.230> just<00:03:25.590> keep<00:03:25.769> it<00:03:25.950> that

way and then we go and play a minor
first<00:03:28.290> inversion<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.980> mean<00:03:29.340> sorry

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:39.589 
first inversion I mean sorry
a<00:03:29.849> minor<00:03:30.510> Android<00:03:30.840> position<00:03:38.239> then<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:39.299> go

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
a minor Android position then you go

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.690 
a minor Android position then you go
back<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:39.870> G

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.960 

playing<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.540> hog<00:03:43.690> cave<00:03:43.990> down<00:03:44.490> but<00:03:45.490> this<00:03:45.700> time

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
playing the hog cave down but this time

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.390 
playing the hog cave down but this time
we<00:03:46.090> don't<00:03:46.270> run<00:03:46.569> back<00:03:46.810> down<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.319> same<00:03:47.530> way<00:03:47.800> we

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
we don't run back down the same way we

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.510 
we don't run back down the same way we
have<00:03:48.580> done<00:03:48.819> in<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.120> previous<00:03:49.270> video<00:03:50.140> so<00:03:50.620> we

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
have done in the previous video so we

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.880 
have done in the previous video so we
will<00:03:51.910> remain<00:03:52.150> with<00:03:52.360> that<00:03:52.390> G<00:03:52.690> again<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:56.620> we<00:03:56.740> sort

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
will remain with that G again so we sort

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.350 
will remain with that G again so we sort
of<00:03:57.010> run<00:03:57.340> back<00:03:57.640> up<00:03:57.850> to<00:03:58.060> e<00:03:58.270> so<00:03:58.660> G<00:04:00.959> then<00:04:01.959> we<00:04:02.020> go<00:04:02.350> to<00:04:02.380> F

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
of run back up to e so G then we go to F

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.310 
of run back up to e so G then we go to F
and<00:04:04.500> on<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.680> days<00:04:05.920> were<00:04:06.190> playing<00:04:06.610> a<00:04:07.030> d<00:04:07.510> so<00:04:08.290> that

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
and on the days were playing a d so that

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.620 
and on the days were playing a d so that
qualifies<00:04:09.070> as<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.370> D<00:04:09.610> minor<00:04:09.940> seventh<00:04:11.340> alright

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
qualifies as a D minor seventh alright

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.250 
qualifies as a D minor seventh alright
so<00:04:13.630> let's<00:04:13.989> do<00:04:14.230> that<00:04:14.260> part<00:04:14.440> again<00:04:16.019> what<00:04:17.019> do<00:04:17.169> we

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
so let's do that part again what do we

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.120 
so let's do that part again what do we
do<00:04:17.410> then

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:31.149 

and<00:04:23.250> then<00:04:23.430> we<00:04:23.580> go<00:04:23.760> back<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.140> up<00:04:25.890> again

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:31.159 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:33.100 

and<00:04:31.550> then<00:04:31.759> you<00:04:31.879> sort<00:04:32.059> of<00:04:32.149> played<00:04:32.419> similarly

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
and then you sort of played similarly

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.930 
and then you sort of played similarly
with<00:04:33.289> the<00:04:33.499> way<00:04:33.649> we<00:04:33.830> played<00:04:34.129> you<00:04:34.369> know

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:47.530 

again

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.310 

right<00:04:48.160> so<00:04:49.160> let's<00:04:49.520> do<00:04:49.730> that<00:04:50.180> slowly<00:04:50.630> up<00:04:50.960> and

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
right so let's do that slowly up and

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.130 
right so let's do that slowly up and
down<00:04:51.590> like<00:04:52.430> that<00:04:52.760> now<00:04:53.360> we're<00:04:53.540> going<00:04:53.720> to<00:04:53.840> play

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
down like that now we're going to play

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.460 
down like that now we're going to play
the<00:04:54.380> two<00:04:54.650> parts<00:04:55.100> together<00:04:55.910> now<00:04:56.420> so<00:04:57.170> it<00:04:57.230> goes

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
the two parts together now so it goes

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:14.400 
the two parts together now so it goes
first<00:04:58.460> part

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:50.350 

and<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:15.130> second<00:05:15.520> one

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.879 

right<00:05:51.129> that's<00:05:52.129> what<00:05:52.310> we<00:05:52.430> do<00:05:52.610> and<00:05:52.879> then<00:05:53.120> in<00:05:53.479> the

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
right that's what we do and then in the

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.110 
right that's what we do and then in the
upcoming<00:05:54.889> video<00:05:55.189> we'll<00:05:55.400> do<00:05:55.610> the<00:05:55.789> bridge

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
upcoming video we'll do the bridge

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.510 
upcoming video we'll do the bridge
section<00:05:56.449> which<00:05:57.439> is<00:05:57.620> slightly<00:05:57.860> different<00:05:58.189> from

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
section which is slightly different from

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.820 
section which is slightly different from
this<00:05:58.759> one<00:05:59.000> but<00:05:59.210> then<00:05:59.870> it<00:05:59.990> drives<00:06:00.229> back<00:06:00.560> to<00:06:00.710> the

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
this one but then it drives back to the

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.429 
this one but then it drives back to the
same<00:06:01.069> thing<00:06:01.340> and<00:06:01.610> that's<00:06:01.969> the<00:06:02.210> whole<00:06:02.389> song<00:06:02.659> so

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:03.439 
same thing and that's the whole song so

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:07.090 
same thing and that's the whole song so
up<00:06:03.680> until<00:06:03.830> next<00:06:04.129> time<00:06:04.400> goodbye
