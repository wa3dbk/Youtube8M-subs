00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.750
 clear lines flowing shapes 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.799
 own character design that once 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.769
 to inspire 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:16.170
 We are to visit in audi design model 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.500
 studio of the form designer in ingolstadt 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.640
 Here are the ideas of the audi 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.399
 vehicle designs on their long way to the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.239
 serial model for the first time physically 

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:27.110
 designed 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:29.640
 with great precision and handmade 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.349
 Lifelike models are created here 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.349
 so-called claim models 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:45.350
 The material is high-tech working with 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.070
 You can also use clay industry plasticine 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.910
 saying 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.000
 the big difference to do is that 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.250
 Here we apply this process 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.680
 So it can be in the plastic state 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.750
 Apply material and then more 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.730
 to be able to work in a cold state 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.730
 can repeat as often as you like 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.430
 microfine glass beads and one 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.620
 oil of paraffin and grow 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:20.860
 make sure that the plastilin 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:22.870
 remains supple and malleable and can 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.320
 can reapply with everything 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.930
 represent mirror grille as a rod 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.540
 do not not stink 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.450
 great for audi is the visualization 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.860
 with the help of the models an essential 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.580
 step in the development of new 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.340
 concepts 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.550
 Although the designs of the designer arise 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.810
 first on paper and on the computer 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.610
 Nevertheless, the craft of the 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.960
 Form designers teams still today 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.120
 inevitable handiwork is very 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.010
 important you have to see the right 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.180
 Computer models are good but you can 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.980
 because not see everything 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.330
 you do not get the right feeling 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:08.860
 for volume surface and proportion 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:10.600
 the only possibility with the claim 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.480
 I can just model an interior 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.830
 comprehend learn experience also correct 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.780
 in the true sense of the word I can 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.880
 touch things I can commit myself 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.530
 I have to be able to walk around it 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.530
 It must also be able to watch it outdoors 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.360
 that helps me the best presentation on 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.510
 nothing is the challenge 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.989
 is just when you have a sketch of 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.950
 designer a two-dimensional this ins 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.230
 into the 3d and then the clear 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.239
 lines and surfaces to get in the way 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.250
 dena that are typical with the 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.410
 model phase starts for the audi 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.840
 designer and form a gestalter 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.090
 common creative process in its 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.650
 Both go to the optimum shape 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.020
 wrestle 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.540
 desire and reality claim and 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.020
 feasibility must be carefully balanced 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.570
 become 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.290
 Now it shows if the ideas of the designer 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.730
 also withstand in reality 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.380
 the human being at a certain part 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.960
 or on a special surface 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.450
 everything works directly about it 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.160
 He knows why he uses the plane for example 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.980
 oriented in a specific direction 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.960
 and there it can explain to me and then 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.400
 Can he advise me can offer here 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.740
 an area or a part for example 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.450
 easier or more dynamic 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.610
 and he can explain how to do that 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.530
 It can be an open one 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.880
 discussion and at the end we find 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.870
 actually always a good compromise 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.520
 a good solution 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.680
 This plastilin lasts for two years 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.000
 Process of first models in scale 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.540
 one to four 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.690
 permanent until the finished design process 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.460
 Optimize and refine 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.650
 at the end also for the 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.040
 Designers and designers a real one 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:58.930
 pay is when a new series 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:04:01.390
 actually implemented by the tape rolls 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.610
 were then on the street and you 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.350
 likes to think back where to go longer 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.590
 needed until then was perfect 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.510
 that's nice when you see that 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.730
 the input of the rag has that the 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.420
 then comes clean and built 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.420
 it will be nice 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.810
 our world continues to evolve 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.130
 and thus all influences and 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.590
 they also relate quite often 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.660
 our models because we put that yes 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.660
 because what should please in the future
