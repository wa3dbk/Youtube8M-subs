00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.160
 hello friends look today I 'm going to 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.990
 to make Catalan cream and the ingredients 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:14.190
 milk are the cinnamon eggs on the branch 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:18.180
 lemon rind sugar and corn flour 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:24.480
 cornstarch and apart for sugar candy 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.480
 and then a clay pot and a saucepan 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.189
 The first thing we are going to do is turn on 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:35.930
 the fire and we're going to put it halfway 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:40.960
 nor low to half and we will put the bucket and 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.960
 we are going to put the milk first 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.540
 of the milk we will leave a little that is 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.150
 to undo the flour then let's 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:00.400
 put the cinnamon 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.400
 let's put lemon rinds 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.960
 and the sugar 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.530
 And all this we will move to 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.050
 the sugar is melting down a 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.900
 little bit 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.240
 and when it starts to boil I explain 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.870
 while the milk is heating up 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.410
 let's go ahead and let's separate 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.750
 the yolk eggs of the white one because 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.170
 we will only serve what is the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.170
 bud 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:43.770
 and we will put them in the saucepan 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.770
 well now we make them eggs 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.090
 now we take a glass 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.780
 and we put this remaining milk 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.920
 we add 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.920
 corn flour 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.130
 [Music] 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.850
 we dissolve it well that it melts well 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.850
 with milk 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.130
 and we have undone the flour and now this 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.100
 we are going to add it to the egg 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.130
 and then we will move everything not 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.250
 we saw everything just fine mixed 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.250
 [Music] 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.900
 look now it starts to boil now let's go 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.209
 to add the preparation 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.049
 here inside little by little and let's go 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.049
 spinning it 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.980
 well now the next thing we're going to 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:57.740
 to do is loosen the fire to a minimum and 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.330
 this if you do not stop spinning and you know 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.240
 why first so that it does not 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.819
 paste under the saucepan and second so that 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.340
 do not do it 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.700
 the one that moves the milk away when it starts 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:15.430
 boil especially moving like this 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.430
 we will leave it for 5 minutes 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.230
 five minutes have passed and look how it's going 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.530
 starting to look you see how you are going 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.660
 thinking good then now we'll go like this 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.420
 without stopping to give appointment either 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.760
 You see how it starts to boil since the 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.920
 let's leave three minutes to go 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.970
 making the suck this so that it ends 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.340
 thicken well 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.920
 the three minutes have already passed and look 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.900
 how is now only the 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.400
 let's leave two more minutes than in 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.560
 total will be ten and it is already 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.560
 the two more minutes have already passed and 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:56.019
 we extinguish the fire we take the casserole 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:59.090
 mud and we're going to put it here then 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.370
 once placed in the clay pot the 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.500
 let's let it warm up that 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.069
 cool almost and then we will do the 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.069
 candy 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.310
 [Applause] 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.220
 Now let's take a saucepan and we'll 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.810
 light the fire and we will put it 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.200
 Behold 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:23.200
 neither low nor half in between 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.860
 let's put it here on fire and you 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.350
 let's add the sugar 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.550
 and let's go 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.550
 like watching it 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.530
 Look, it's already catching, it's called 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:43.870
 taking heat the dipper and you have to go 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.300
 moving 6 carefully in principle 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:50.010
 now let's stop giving it 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.409
 turns three minutes 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.929
 [Music] 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:56.509
 in principle he had said three minutes 

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:59.539
 but with two enough to look is that if 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:03.139
 we leave bad more then bitter a bit 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:05.719
 now we turn off the fire then we have 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.619
 to take with the spoon and you will 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:08.619
 making the ornament 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.770
 we have already put all the candy here 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.960
 you have the presentation to follow all the 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.289
 steps as I said I have one left 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.430
 very good cream I hope you do it 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.430
 you like it and until next time
