well<00:00:02.129> welcome<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.730> part<00:00:02.939> three<00:00:03.270> of<00:00:03.300> why<00:00:04.049> people

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
well welcome to part three of why people

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.559 
well welcome to part three of why people
really<00:00:04.740> can't<00:00:05.130> lose<00:00:05.279> weight<00:00:05.549> it's<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.180> hormone

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
really can't lose weight it's a hormone

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.299 
really can't lose weight it's a hormone
problem<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.170> hormone<00:00:07.529> we<00:00:07.680> discussed<00:00:08.130> was

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
problem the hormone we discussed was

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.980 
problem the hormone we discussed was
leptin<00:00:08.730> but<00:00:08.880> there<00:00:09.030> are<00:00:09.150> other<00:00:09.330> hormones<00:00:09.809> like

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
leptin but there are other hormones like

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.740 
leptin but there are other hormones like
insulin<00:00:10.130> what<00:00:11.130> we<00:00:11.280> discussed<00:00:11.790> was<00:00:12.150> that

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
insulin what we discussed was that

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.810 
insulin what we discussed was that
hormone<00:00:13.200> problems<00:00:13.710> today<00:00:14.009> are<00:00:14.160> not<00:00:14.309> problem

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
hormone problems today are not problem

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.849 
hormone problems today are not problem
with<00:00:14.969> having<00:00:15.120> needing<00:00:15.599> more<00:00:15.750> hormones<00:00:16.260> the

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
with having needing more hormones the

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.830 
with having needing more hormones the
problem<00:00:17.400> really<00:00:17.580> happens<00:00:18.090> at<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.330> cell<00:00:18.630> in

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
problem really happens at the cell in

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.380 
problem really happens at the cell in
the<00:00:19.289> fact<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.070> receptor<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
the fact that it's the receptor to the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.359 
the fact that it's the receptor to the
hormones<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:22.380> really<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.010> reason<00:00:23.340> why

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
hormones it's really the reason why

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.920 
hormones it's really the reason why
people<00:00:23.550> can't<00:00:24.119> lose<00:00:24.300> weight<00:00:24.449> today<00:00:24.750> what<00:00:24.900> I

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
people can't lose weight today what I

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.929 
people can't lose weight today what I
love<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.380> tell<00:00:25.560> patients<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:26.070> look<00:00:26.340> if<00:00:26.550> you've

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
love to tell patients is look if you've

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.460 
love to tell patients is look if you've
followed<00:00:27.180> me<00:00:27.390> around<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.960> ate<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.230> way<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.380> eat

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
followed me around and ate the way I eat

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.089 
followed me around and ate the way I eat
and<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.640> exercise<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.570> way<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.750> exercise<00:00:31.410> most

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
and you exercise the way I exercise most

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.220 
and you exercise the way I exercise most
of<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.399> still<00:00:32.730> could<00:00:32.940> not<00:00:32.969> lose<00:00:33.300> weight<00:00:33.540> you

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
of you still could not lose weight you

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.590 
of you still could not lose weight you
might<00:00:34.410> be<00:00:34.530> able<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.770> lose<00:00:35.000> 510<00:00:36.000> pounds<00:00:36.239> but

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
might be able to lose 510 pounds but

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.889 
might be able to lose 510 pounds but
then<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.930> stops<00:00:37.290> why<00:00:37.620> because<00:00:38.129> your<00:00:38.520> body

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
then it stops why because your body

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.990 
then it stops why because your body
hormonal<00:00:39.899> e<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.320> unable<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:41.129> burn<00:00:41.550> fat<00:00:41.969> you

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
hormonal e is unable to burn fat you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.819 
hormonal e is unable to burn fat you
know<00:00:42.360> what<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:42.719> not<00:00:42.930> your<00:00:43.200> fault<00:00:43.469> because

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
know what it's not your fault because

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.680 
know what it's not your fault because
you<00:00:43.980> fail<00:00:44.309> or<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.579> break<00:00:44.910> all<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.329> different

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
you fail or you break all the different

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.170 
you fail or you break all the different
diets<00:00:46.079> because<00:00:46.590> your<00:00:46.890> body<00:00:47.100> really<00:00:47.760> gives<00:00:48.030> in

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
diets because your body really gives in

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.580 
diets because your body really gives in
to<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.360> craving<00:00:48.870> because<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.230> doesn't<00:00:49.500> want

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
to the craving because it doesn't want

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.830 
to the craving because it doesn't want
to<00:00:49.649> cannibalize<00:00:50.219> itself<00:00:50.700> any<00:00:50.910> longer<00:00:51.660> and

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
to cannibalize itself any longer and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.410 
to cannibalize itself any longer and
that<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.649> fact<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:53.039> hormone<00:00:53.370> problem<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.940> how

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
that is in fact a hormone problem so how

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.569 
that is in fact a hormone problem so how
do<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.350> become<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> fat<00:00:56.250> burner

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
do we get you to become a fat burner

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.670 
do we get you to become a fat burner
because<00:00:56.940> really<00:00:57.180> that's<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.780> key<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.379> got<00:00:58.500> to

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
because really that's the key you got to

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.439 
because really that's the key you got to
fix<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.010> hormones<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.910> means<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.180> got<00:01:00.329> to

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
fix the hormones that means you got to

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.689 
fix the hormones that means you got to
fix<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.719> hormone<00:01:01.050> receptor<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:01.949> video<00:01:02.609> 2

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
fix the hormone receptor so on video 2

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.570 
fix the hormone receptor so on video 2
we<00:01:03.210> gave<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.049> these<00:01:04.589> three<00:01:05.010> things<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.519> are

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
we gave you these three things that are

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.750 
we gave you these three things that are
driving<00:01:06.090> cellular<00:01:06.930> inflammation<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.920> really

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
driving cellular inflammation and really

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.730 
driving cellular inflammation and really
that's<00:01:09.060> where<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> hormone<00:01:09.960> receptors<00:01:10.530> are

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that's where the hormone receptors are

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.490 
that's where the hormone receptors are
so<00:01:11.280> we<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.150> fix<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.960> cellular

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
so we have to fix the cellular

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560 
so we have to fix the cellular
inflammation<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:14.220> fix<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.580> hormone<00:01:15.030> receptor

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
inflammation to fix the hormone receptor

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.440 
inflammation to fix the hormone receptor
these<00:01:16.080> three<00:01:16.409> things<00:01:16.710> bad<00:01:17.070> fats<00:01:17.460> getting<00:01:18.240> rid

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
these three things bad fats getting rid

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.749 
these three things bad fats getting rid
of<00:01:18.479> bad<00:01:18.750> fats<00:01:19.080> which<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.950> problem<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.490> itself

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
of bad fats which is a problem in itself

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.550 
of bad fats which is a problem in itself
because<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.600> really<00:01:21.840> don't<00:01:21.960> know<00:01:22.170> what<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
because we really don't know what the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.140 
because we really don't know what the
bad<00:01:22.740> fats<00:01:23.070> are<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.460> we're<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.759> discuss

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
bad fats are and we're going to discuss

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.780 
bad fats are and we're going to discuss
that<00:01:24.180> sugar<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.350> grains<00:01:25.680> removing<00:01:26.220> all<00:01:26.400> sugar

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
that sugar and grains removing all sugar

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.330 
that sugar and grains removing all sugar
and<00:01:26.880> grains<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.570> really<00:01:28.290> one<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> magic

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
and grains is really one of the magic

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.190 
and grains is really one of the magic
things<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.820> down<00:01:30.000> regulate<00:01:30.450> inflammation<00:01:30.600> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
things to down regulate inflammation and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.140 
things to down regulate inflammation and
fix<00:01:31.500> these<00:01:31.650> hormone<00:01:32.070> receptors<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.850> of

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
fix these hormone receptors and of

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.480 
fix these hormone receptors and of
course<00:01:33.420> toxins<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.560> hidden<00:01:34.920> cause<00:01:35.159> The

cause well guess what these three things

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.210 
cause well guess what these three things
really<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.079> things<00:03:01.319> that<00:03:01.470> he<00:03:01.650> alluded<00:03:02.069> to

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
that drives inflammation and he's right

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.809 
that drives inflammation and he's right
on<00:03:04.109> the<00:03:04.230> money<00:03:04.379> you<00:03:05.099> know<00:03:05.190> he<00:03:05.310> talked<00:03:05.549> about<00:03:05.790> a

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
on the money you know he talked about a

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.199 
on the money you know he talked about a
fad<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.720> most<00:03:06.989> people<00:03:07.640> fear<00:03:08.640> that<00:03:09.060> is

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
actually a fad that we actually need and

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.009 
actually a fad that we actually need and
in<00:03:11.459> studies<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.209> are<00:03:12.540> showing<00:03:12.629> that

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
in studies that are showing that

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.270 
in studies that are showing that
actually<00:03:13.349> can<00:03:13.500> reverse<00:03:13.829> some<00:03:14.099> of<00:03:14.220> these

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
actually can reverse some of these

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.000 
actually can reverse some of these
conditions<00:03:14.819> saturated<00:03:15.750> fat<00:03:15.959> there's<00:03:16.440> not<00:03:16.620> one

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
conditions saturated fat there's not one

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.409

piece of scientific literature that
really<00:03:18.900> truly<00:03:19.440> supports<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.639> fact<00:03:20.849> that

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
really truly supports the fact that

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.300 
really truly supports the fact that
saturated<00:03:21.540> fat<00:03:21.630> is<00:03:22.049> leading<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.950> some<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.250> the

saturated fat is leading to some of the

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.099 
saturated fat is leading to some of the
problems<00:03:23.819> that<00:03:23.880> we<00:03:24.060> associate<00:03:24.540> with<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.989> in

problems that we associate with it in
cholesterol<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.190> course<00:03:26.459> has<00:03:26.819> been

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
cholesterol of course has been

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.900 
cholesterol of course has been
victimized<00:03:27.569> and<00:03:27.780> really<00:03:28.410> is<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.769> key<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.669> fixing

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
victimized and really is a key to fixing

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.789 
victimized and really is a key to fixing
some<00:03:30.299> of<00:03:30.389> these<00:03:30.480> conditions<00:03:30.989> so<00:03:31.169> we<00:03:31.590> want

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
some of these conditions so we want

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.559 
some of these conditions so we want
these<00:03:31.950> good<00:03:32.160> fats<00:03:32.430> but<00:03:32.760> here's<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.150> bad<00:03:33.329> one

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
these good fats but here's the bad one

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.089 
these good fats but here's the bad one
he<00:03:33.750> talked<00:03:34.019> about<00:03:34.139> it<00:03:34.440> I'm<00:03:34.590> going<00:03:34.829> to<00:03:34.950> talk

he talked about it I'm going to talk
about<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.519> it's<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:36.000> hidden<00:03:36.239> fat<00:03:36.629> everybody

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
about it it's the hidden fat everybody

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.229 
about it it's the hidden fat everybody
out<00:03:37.530> there<00:03:37.769> y'all<00:03:38.069> get<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.519> fact<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:38.940> it's

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
out there y'all get the fact that it's

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.140 
out there y'all get the fact that it's
margarine<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.980> know<00:03:41.099> trans<00:03:41.519> fats<00:03:41.879> and

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
margarine and you know trans fats and

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.119 
margarine and you know trans fats and
hydrogenated<00:03:42.750> oils<00:03:43.139> those<00:03:43.410> are<00:03:43.590> bad<00:03:43.739> fats

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
hydrogenated oils those are bad fats

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.129 
hydrogenated oils those are bad fats
right<00:03:44.790> but<00:03:45.000> what<00:03:45.150> about<00:03:45.180> polyunsaturated

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
right but what about polyunsaturated

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.699 
right but what about polyunsaturated
fatty<00:03:47.129> acids<00:03:47.639> what<00:03:47.910> are<00:03:48.030> those<00:03:48.709> vegetable

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
fatty acids what are those vegetable

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.680 
fatty acids what are those vegetable
oils<00:03:49.949> are<00:03:50.099> the<00:03:50.129> number<00:03:50.609> one<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:51.180> we<00:03:51.359> see<00:03:51.599> in

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
oils are the number one that we see in

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.059 
oils are the number one that we see in
most<00:03:51.900> of<00:03:52.079> the<00:03:52.199> products<00:03:52.620> that<00:03:52.680> we're<00:03:52.889> eating

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
most of the products that we're eating

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.280 
most of the products that we're eating
so<00:03:53.730> yeah<00:03:53.940> you<00:03:54.000> have<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.389> read<00:03:54.569> ingredients<00:03:55.139> but

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
so yeah you have to read ingredients but

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.930 
so yeah you have to read ingredients but
these<00:03:55.410> vegetable<00:03:55.949> oils<00:03:56.160> ironically<00:03:56.699> enough

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
these vegetable oils ironically enough

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.819 
these vegetable oils ironically enough
for<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.180> fats<00:03:57.449> these<00:03:57.690> polyunsaturated<00:03:58.109> fatty

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
for the fats these polyunsaturated fatty

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.920 
for the fats these polyunsaturated fatty
acids<00:03:59.280> are<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.790> fats<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.269> our<00:04:00.419> government

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
acids are the fats that our government

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.330 
acids are the fats that our government
bodies<00:04:01.230> are<00:04:01.349> supposed<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.620> be<00:04:01.739> protecting<00:04:02.250> us

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
bodies are supposed to be protecting us

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.250 
bodies are supposed to be protecting us
they're<00:04:02.489> telling<00:04:02.790> us<00:04:02.849> to<00:04:02.910> eat<00:04:03.030> but<00:04:03.930> here's<00:04:04.109> the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
they're telling us to eat but here's the

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.009 
they're telling us to eat but here's the
problem<00:04:04.410> in<00:04:05.030> themselves<00:04:06.030> they're<00:04:06.180> fine<00:04:06.480> when

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
problem in themselves they're fine when

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.750 
problem in themselves they're fine when
polyunsaturated<00:04:07.470> fats<00:04:08.250> in<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.489> form<00:04:08.699> of

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
polyunsaturated fats in the form of

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.849 
polyunsaturated fats in the form of
vegetable<00:04:09.299> oils<00:04:09.540> or<00:04:09.690> in<00:04:10.079> vegetables<00:04:10.650> they're

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
vegetable oils or in vegetables they're

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.559 
vegetable oils or in vegetables they're
okay<00:04:11.190> but<00:04:11.220> when<00:04:11.489> we<00:04:11.609> pull<00:04:11.879> them<00:04:12.090> from<00:04:12.329> there

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
okay but when we pull them from there

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.379 
okay but when we pull them from there
now<00:04:13.379> they<00:04:13.560> oxidize<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.519> they<00:04:15.030> drive

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
now they oxidize and they drive

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.569 
now they oxidize and they drive
inflammation<00:04:16.169> remember<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.680> cell<00:04:16.949> if<00:04:17.430> you

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
inflammation remember the cell if you

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.810 
inflammation remember the cell if you
draw<00:04:17.849> the<00:04:17.910> cell<00:04:18.359> again<00:04:19.250> this<00:04:20.250> is<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.489> cell

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
draw the cell again this is a cell

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.760 
draw the cell again this is a cell
membrane<00:04:21.000> made<00:04:21.479> up<00:04:21.630> of<00:04:21.780> two<00:04:21.989> layers<00:04:22.200> of<00:04:22.530> fat

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
membrane made up of two layers of fat

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.100 
membrane made up of two layers of fat
fat<00:04:23.400> attracts<00:04:23.849> fat<00:04:24.180> so<00:04:24.690> we<00:04:24.780> know<00:04:24.930> these

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
fat attracts fat so we know these

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.780 
fat attracts fat so we know these
vegetables<00:04:25.740> just<00:04:26.039> like<00:04:26.190> trans

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
vegetables just like trans

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.890 
vegetables just like trans
that's<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.240> these<00:04:27.330> things<00:04:27.600> you<00:04:27.780> know<00:04:27.810> these

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
that's and these things you know these

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.800 
that's and these things you know these
um<00:04:28.340> hydrogenated<00:04:29.340> oils<00:04:29.760> they<00:04:30.120> make<00:04:30.420> their<00:04:30.660> way

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
um hydrogenated oils they make their way

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.930 
um hydrogenated oils they make their way
into<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.320> cell<00:04:31.710> membrane<00:04:32.160> drive<00:04:32.700> the

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
into the cell membrane drive the

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.360 
into the cell membrane drive the
inflammation<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:33.840> they<00:04:34.170> blunt<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.980> hormone

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
inflammation and they blunt the hormone

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.640 
inflammation and they blunt the hormone
receptor<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.450> now<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:36.660> end<00:04:36.900> up<00:04:37.020> in<00:04:37.170> insulin

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
receptor so now you end up in insulin

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.770 
receptor so now you end up in insulin
resistance<00:04:38.160> or<00:04:38.280> leptin<00:04:38.640> resistance<00:04:38.790> fat

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
resistance or leptin resistance fat

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.560 
resistance or leptin resistance fat
causes<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:41.070> problem<00:04:41.520> it's<00:04:41.670> these<00:04:41.820> bad<00:04:42.150> fats

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
causes the problem it's these bad fats

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.780 
causes the problem it's these bad fats
but<00:04:43.050> adding<00:04:43.470> in<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.800> saturated<00:04:44.280> fats<00:04:44.610> the

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
but adding in the saturated fats the

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.970 
but adding in the saturated fats the
cholesterol<00:04:45.240> fats<00:04:45.450> look<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:46.110> book<00:04:46.380> to<00:04:46.590> get<00:04:46.770> is

we've gotten fatter as a nation more
obesity<00:05:08.940> and<00:05:09.390> guess<00:05:09.840> what<00:05:10.080> this<00:05:10.530> year<00:05:10.770> more

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
obesity and guess what this year more

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
obesity and guess what this year more
people<00:05:11.250> are<00:05:11.310> going<00:05:11.400> to<00:05:11.460> die<00:05:11.610> from<00:05:11.820> heart

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
people are going to die from heart

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.400 
people are going to die from heart
disease<00:05:12.330> than<00:05:12.540> ever<00:05:12.690> so<00:05:12.870> how<00:05:13.050> is<00:05:13.110> it<00:05:13.200> working

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
disease than ever so how is it working

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.230 
disease than ever so how is it working
out<00:05:13.620> for<00:05:13.950> us<00:05:14.100> it's<00:05:14.280> not<00:05:14.430> working<00:05:14.760> out<00:05:14.850> good<00:05:15.090> at

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
out for us it's not working out good at

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.360 
out for us it's not working out good at
all<00:05:15.420> so<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.140> fact<00:05:16.410> is<00:05:16.590> let<00:05:16.890> me<00:05:17.010> be<00:05:17.190> the<00:05:17.340> first

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
all so the fact is let me be the first

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.910 
all so the fact is let me be the first
to<00:05:17.640> tell<00:05:17.910> you<00:05:18.000> you<00:05:18.300> need<00:05:18.540> the<00:05:18.750> fat<00:05:18.990> but<00:05:19.590> watch

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
to tell you you need the fat but watch

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.220 
to tell you you need the fat but watch
out<00:05:20.190> because<00:05:20.610> it's<00:05:21.090> these<00:05:21.450> fats<00:05:21.750> that<00:05:21.930> you<00:05:22.080> may

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
out because it's these fats that you may

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.320 
out because it's these fats that you may
think<00:05:22.590> are<00:05:22.680> bad<00:05:22.890> are<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:23.400> very<00:05:23.700> fats<00:05:24.030> that<00:05:24.180> you

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
think are bad are the very fats that you

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.870 
think are bad are the very fats that you
