00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.500 
like both things going on here I think
those<00:06:25.380> are<00:06:25.560> just<00:06:25.680> classic<00:06:26.250> letters<00:06:26.610> which<00:06:27.210> I

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
those are just classic letters which I

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.600 
those are just classic letters which I
see<00:06:27.720> what's<00:06:27.900> going<00:06:28.110> on<00:06:28.230> here<00:06:28.530> Easy's<00:06:29.340> he's

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
doing something a little bit more

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.730 
doing something a little bit more
rebellious<00:06:32.070> over<00:06:32.520> here<00:06:32.670> but<00:06:33.260> he's<00:06:34.260> gonna<00:06:34.500> come

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.350 
rebellious over here but he's gonna come
with<00:06:34.920> something<00:06:35.280> that<00:06:35.460> we<00:06:35.580> don't<00:06:35.700> expect

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
with something that we don't expect

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.360 
with something that we don't expect
well<00:06:37.110> I'm<00:06:37.260> liking<00:06:37.620> the<00:06:37.710> boat<00:06:37.920> -<00:06:38.130> I<00:06:38.160> think

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
well I'm liking the boat - I think

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.920 
well I'm liking the boat - I think
there's<00:06:38.580> to<00:06:38.700> do<00:06:38.820> very<00:06:39.090> different<00:06:39.210> approaches

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
there's to do very different approaches

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.200 
there's to do very different approaches
the<00:06:40.230> one<00:06:40.410> on<00:06:40.590> the<00:06:40.920> right<00:06:41.220> here<00:06:41.430> with<00:06:42.090> the

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
the one on the right here with the

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.690 
the one on the right here with the
letters<00:06:42.690> is<00:06:42.990> much<00:06:43.260> more<00:06:43.410> graphic<00:06:43.950> I<00:06:44.100> think<00:06:44.370> and

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
letters is much more graphic I think and

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.940 
letters is much more graphic I think and
maybe<00:06:45.420> a<00:06:45.540> traditional<00:06:45.750> statement<00:06:46.470> this<00:06:46.770> over

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:46.950 
maybe a traditional statement this over

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.800 
maybe a traditional statement this over
here<00:06:47.250> is<00:06:47.460> it's<00:06:47.730> you<00:06:48.120> know<00:06:48.210> there's<00:06:48.390> much<00:06:48.660> more

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
here is it's you know there's much more

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.420 
here is it's you know there's much more
going<00:06:48.990> on<00:06:49.170> compositionally<00:06:50.070> there's<00:06:50.250> much

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
going on compositionally there's much

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.820 
going on compositionally there's much
more<00:06:50.610> going<00:06:50.670> on<00:06:51.150> I<00:06:51.330> think<00:06:51.540> inception<00:06:51.990> lake<00:06:52.200> so

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
more going on I think inception lake so

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.200 
more going on I think inception lake so
I'm<00:06:52.980> looking<00:06:53.280> forward<00:06:53.550> to<00:06:53.790> seeing<00:06:54.000> what

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
I'm looking forward to seeing what

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.940 
I'm looking forward to seeing what
happens<00:06:54.240> at<00:06:54.720> the<00:06:54.810> end<00:06:54.840> it<00:06:55.500> was<00:06:55.650> always<00:06:55.860> a

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
happens at the end it was always a

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.740 
happens at the end it was always a
different<00:06:56.460> on<00:06:56.700> the<00:06:56.850> right<00:06:57.030> here<00:06:57.300> you<00:06:57.330> got<00:06:57.510> Abel

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.750 
different on the right here you got Abel

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.410 
different on the right here you got Abel
going<00:06:58.350> with<00:06:58.770> the<00:06:59.100> lettering<00:06:59.400> he's<00:06:59.850> also<00:07:00.090> going

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:00.420 
going with the lettering he's also going

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.170 
going with the lettering he's also going
to<00:07:00.600> incorporate<00:07:00.930> the<00:07:01.380> iconic<00:07:01.950> green<00:07:02.310> into<00:07:03.030> it

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
to incorporate the iconic green into it

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.390 
to incorporate the iconic green into it
which<00:07:03.390> is<00:07:03.570> obviously<00:07:03.900> very<00:07:03.960> important<00:07:04.830> and

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 
which is obviously very important and

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.950 
which is obviously very important and
then<00:07:05.610> you<00:07:05.730> go<00:07:05.850> over<00:07:06.030> to<00:07:06.060> massive<00:07:06.510> here<00:07:06.720> on<00:07:06.840> the

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
then you go over to massive here on the

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.810 
then you go over to massive here on the
left<00:07:07.230> we<00:07:07.740> kind<00:07:07.950> of<00:07:08.010> quite<00:07:08.220> tell<00:07:08.520> what<00:07:08.550> he's

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:08.820 
left we kind of quite tell what he's

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.760 
left we kind of quite tell what he's
trying<00:07:09.060> to<00:07:09.090> do<00:07:09.210> with<00:07:09.330> the<00:07:09.450> logo<00:07:09.750> right<00:07:09.960> now<00:07:10.170> but

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
trying to do with the logo right now but

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.320 
trying to do with the logo right now but
you<00:07:10.920> can<00:07:11.100> see<00:07:11.310> that<00:07:11.490> he's<00:07:11.670> gonna<00:07:11.880> get<00:07:12.180> very

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
you can see that he's gonna get very

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.360 
you can see that he's gonna get very
explosive<00:07:12.900> right<00:07:13.350> now<00:07:13.530> and<00:07:13.770> maybe<00:07:13.920> unleash

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370 
explosive right now and maybe unleash

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.190 
explosive right now and maybe unleash
something<00:07:14.670> that<00:07:15.060> we're<00:07:15.450> not<00:07:15.570> ready<00:07:15.780> for<00:07:16.020> and<00:07:16.170> I

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:16.200 
something that we're not ready for and I

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.440 
something that we're not ready for and I
think<00:07:16.410> it's<00:07:16.590> gonna<00:07:16.740> be<00:07:16.980> quite<00:07:17.370> a<00:07:17.460> battle<00:07:17.640> we're

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:18.450 
think it's gonna be quite a battle we're

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.150 
think it's gonna be quite a battle we're
gonna<00:07:18.570> let<00:07:18.810> these<00:07:18.990> guys<00:07:19.050> continue<00:07:19.830> to<00:07:19.860> paint

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 
gonna let these guys continue to paint

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.220 
gonna let these guys continue to paint
but<00:07:20.580> we're<00:07:20.850> gonna<00:07:20.970> take<00:07:21.180> a<00:07:21.210> break<00:07:21.450> so<00:07:21.780> stay

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:22.230 
but we're gonna take a break so stay

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.490 
but we're gonna take a break so stay
tuned<00:07:22.410> for<00:07:22.620> more<00:07:22.770> of<00:07:22.890> the<00:07:22.980> chosen<00:07:23.160> one
