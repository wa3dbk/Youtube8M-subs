 minutes how to install a filter to 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.750
 activated carbon on sink this solution

 carbonite model his nanny a reference 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.870
 quality in the field of filtration 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.879
 three filter cartridges are 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.429
 available depending on the flow rate 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.530
 you need and presence or 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:48.530
 no calca in your tap water 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:59.460
 first step we take out the filter of 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.559
 his cardboard he is delivered ready to pose and 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.999
 includes an adapter allowing 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.190
 use it with all faucets 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:07.190
 existing ones with the exception of 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:19.230
 step 2 we start with davis and the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:20.480
 foamer in place on our cock we 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:26.960
 notice that he 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:28.880
 setting up the adapter on 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:36.950
 inserts the seal provided and referred 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:38.690
 the adapter on the faucet we live without 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.090
 Following the connection Robin Evans on the 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.310
 tap it is this little valve that 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.230
 will allow the quick choice of obtaining 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.230
 of a filtered or unfiltered water 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.770
 let's move on now to the installation of 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.420
 the vegetarian cartridge we consume 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.700
 a lot of vegetables and wish to have 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.040
 enough flow for in addition to 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.260
 the drinking water have a clean water and 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.380
 pure to wash our organic fruits and vegetables 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.229
 cook rice pasta soups make 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.020
 coffee herbal teas so we opted 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.390
 for the cartridge afp pÃ¼rro that we 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.530
 offers a very comfortable flow of 6 to 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.510
 10 liters per minute we unscrew the base 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.550
 insert the cartridge into the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.910
 portfolio titles and we revive this the 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.910
 pedestal 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.800
 for the first watering of the 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.140
 cartridge should be returned 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.690
 the filtration unit to open the 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.790
 valve valves to wait for filling 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.500
 filter and let the water flow 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.000
 for five minutes so as to 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.950
 remove the air still present in the 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.610
 casing is to evacuate the residues of 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.610
 charcoal 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.030
 the installation is now complete there 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.300
 we only have to taste our 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.300
 organic
