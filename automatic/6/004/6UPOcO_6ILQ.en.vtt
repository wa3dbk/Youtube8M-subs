00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
also some ignitable gas in here so fire

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.969 
also some ignitable gas in here so fire
arrows<00:00:59.579> are<00:00:59.789> your<00:00:59.969> friend<00:01:00.800> for<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.949> tomb<00:01:02.219> so

I think there's four torches you can
light<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:10.020> they're<00:01:10.320> not<00:01:10.470> all<00:01:10.770> immediately

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
light and they're not all immediately

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390

of see where you need to go but the key
to<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.780> puzzle<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.530> lighting<00:01:32.220> up<00:01:32.369> all<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
to this puzzle is lighting up all the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.580 
to this puzzle is lighting up all the
ignitable<00:01:33.750> options<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.439> like

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
ignitable options and so if you like

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.980 
ignitable options and so if you like
that<00:01:37.799> gasps<00:01:38.040> those<00:01:38.340> burnable<00:01:38.850> objects<00:01:39.329> get

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
that gasps those burnable objects get

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.920 
that gasps those burnable objects get
out<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.320> your<00:01:40.470> way<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.579> climb<00:01:41.850> up<00:01:44.930> but

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
out of your way and you can climb up but

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.719 
out of your way and you can climb up but
you<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.380> careful<00:01:46.799> because<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
you have to be careful because the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.080 
you have to be careful because the
flammable<00:01:48.390> gas<00:01:49.130> replaces<00:01:50.130> itself<00:01:50.460> very<00:01:51.000> very

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
flammable gas replaces itself very very

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.330 
flammable gas replaces itself very very
quickly<00:01:51.540> so

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
quickly so

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.249 
quickly so
once<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.090> blow<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.420> up<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.600> got<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.049> climb<00:01:55.200> up

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
once you blow it up you got to climb up

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.170 
once you blow it up you got to climb up
right<00:01:55.590> away<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.890> get<00:01:56.100> past<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:57.560> blow<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.590> up

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
right away to get past it blow it up

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.060 
right away to get past it blow it up
climb<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.360> up<00:02:00.390> Lera<00:02:00.810> let's<00:02:01.079> go<00:02:01.290> let's<00:02:01.560> go<00:02:01.770> come

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
climb on up Lera let's go let's go come

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.230 
climb on up Lera let's go let's go come
on<00:02:02.159> time's<00:02:02.430> a-wastin<00:02:02.850> go<00:02:02.970> go<00:02:03.149> go<00:02:03.329> go<00:02:03.509> all<00:02:03.890> right

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
on time's a-wastin go go go go all right

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.050 
on time's a-wastin go go go go all right
and<00:02:06.240> then<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.780> get<00:02:06.899> up<00:02:07.049> here<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.910> is

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
and then you get up here and this is

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
where I got a little confused for a

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.630 
where I got a little confused for a
second<00:02:10.769> but<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.890> turns<00:02:11.160> out<00:02:11.370> there's<00:02:11.580> some

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
second but it turns out there's some

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.390 
second but it turns out there's some

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.250 
rid of and another torch there at the
top<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:17.610> then<00:02:18.209> once<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.569> get<00:02:18.690> all<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:18.989> lit

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
top and then once you get all that lit

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.600 
top and then once you get all that lit
you<00:02:19.560> can<00:02:19.739> see<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.099> there's<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.370> little

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
you can see that there's a little

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.000 
you can see that there's a little
climbing<00:02:20.849> wall<00:02:21.290> across<00:02:22.290> from<00:02:22.500> where<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.709> jump

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
climbing wall across from where you jump

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.890 
climbing wall across from where you jump
so<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.430> just<00:02:23.849> jump<00:02:24.720> hit<00:02:25.170> square<00:02:26.420> catch<00:02:27.420> on<00:02:27.690> and
