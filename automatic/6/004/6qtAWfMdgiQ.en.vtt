00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.810 
helpful to put points in which is

increasingly health of all champions by
8%

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
8%

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.020 
8%
now<00:03:15.990> 8%<00:03:16.530> doesn't<00:03:16.770> seem<00:03:16.860> like<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.070> lot<00:03:17.310> but<00:03:17.850> it

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
now 8% doesn't seem like a lot but it

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.880 
now 8% doesn't seem like a lot but it
will<00:03:18.300> help<00:03:18.540> in<00:03:18.810> those<00:03:18.900> Clarke<00:03:19.200> situations<00:03:19.740> now

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
will help in those Clarke situations now

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.070 
will help in those Clarke situations now
trust<00:03:20.370> me<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.580> does<00:03:20.730> help<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.030> lot<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.840> goes<00:03:22.050> a

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
trust me it does help a lot it goes a

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.350 
trust me it does help a lot it goes a
long<00:03:22.230> way<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.620> didn't<00:03:23.160> put<00:03:23.250> any<00:03:23.400> points<00:03:23.730> in<00:03:23.880> this

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
long way I didn't put any points in this

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.930 
long way I didn't put any points in this
stat<00:03:24.980> because<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.100> increases<00:03:26.400> your

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
stat because it increases your

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.970 
stat because it increases your
resistance<00:03:27.390> against<00:03:27.690> energy<00:03:28.110> damage<00:03:28.410> now<00:03:28.950> I

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
resistance against energy damage now I

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.530 
resistance against energy damage now I
don't<00:03:29.160> know<00:03:29.310> what<00:03:29.430> energy<00:03:29.730> damage<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.150> exactly

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
don't know what energy damage is exactly

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.570 
don't know what energy damage is exactly
I<00:03:30.630> guess<00:03:31.050> it's<00:03:31.260> Electro's<00:03:31.650> passive<00:03:32.010> something

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
I guess it's Electro's passive something

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.890 
I guess it's Electro's passive something
like<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:32.880> which<00:03:33.180> gives<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:33.510> damage<00:03:33.780> on

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
like that which gives you damage on

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.170 
like that which gives you damage on
every<00:03:34.170> hit<00:03:34.320> that<00:03:34.470> he<00:03:34.530> put<00:03:34.710> on<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:34.920> enemy<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:36.150> I

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
every hit that he put on the enemy so I

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.370 
every hit that he put on the enemy so I
don't<00:03:36.390> have<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.540> problem<00:03:36.720> with<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:37.080> I<00:03:37.200> could

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
don't have a problem with that I could

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.260 
don't have a problem with that I could
be<00:03:37.530> wrong<00:03:37.710> about<00:03:37.980> what<00:03:38.370> this<00:03:38.520> is<00:03:38.670> so<00:03:38.910> if<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.090> am

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
be wrong about what this is so if I am

am okay admit my failures and my flaws

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.830 
am okay admit my failures and my flaws
but<00:03:44.220> don't<00:03:44.490> be<00:03:44.640> too<00:03:44.940> adamant<00:03:45.510> about<00:03:45.600> them

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
but don't be too adamant about them

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.590 
but don't be too adamant about them
because<00:03:46.140> I<00:03:46.290> do<00:03:46.350> get<00:03:46.680> pissed<00:03:46.920> off<00:03:47.100> quite<00:03:47.400> easily

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
because I do get pissed off quite easily

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.940 
because I do get pissed off quite easily
so<00:03:48.600> yeah<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.780> don't<00:03:48.959> put<00:03:49.050> any<00:03:49.200> points<00:03:49.440> in<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.709> I

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
so yeah I don't put any points in that I

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.620 
so yeah I don't put any points in that I
also<00:03:50.459> didn't<00:03:50.670> put<00:03:50.760> any<00:03:50.880> points<00:03:51.180> in<00:03:51.300> increased

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
also didn't put any points in increased

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.410 
also didn't put any points in increased
block<00:03:51.840> proficiency<00:03:52.440> because<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.850> don't<00:03:54.330> really

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
block proficiency because I don't really

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.560 
block proficiency because I don't really
block<00:03:54.720> too<00:03:54.900> much<00:03:55.050> I<00:03:55.790> stand<00:03:56.790> there<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.390> dodge

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
block too much I stand there and I dodge

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.720 
block too much I stand there and I dodge
I<00:03:57.840> swipe<00:03:58.080> left<00:03:58.290> whenever<00:03:58.890> enemy<00:03:59.459> shouldn't

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
I swipe left whenever enemy shouldn't

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.790 
I swipe left whenever enemy shouldn't
attack<00:03:59.910> me<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.240> that<00:04:00.930> helps<00:04:01.200> minimize<00:04:01.650> the

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
attack me and that helps minimize the

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.830 
attack me and that helps minimize the
damage<00:04:02.100> completely<00:04:02.670> there<00:04:03.209> are<00:04:03.330> some<00:04:03.600> things

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
damage completely there are some things

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.030 
damage completely there are some things
obviously<00:04:03.990> that<00:04:04.260> you<00:04:04.320> cannot<00:04:04.590> dodge<00:04:04.830> by

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
obviously that you cannot dodge by

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.370 
obviously that you cannot dodge by
swiping<00:04:05.280> left<00:04:05.430> like<00:04:06.270> Hawkeye<00:04:06.870> specials<00:04:07.290> you

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
swiping left like Hawkeye specials you

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.780 
swiping left like Hawkeye specials you
can<00:04:07.530> toss<00:04:07.740> them<00:04:07.920> they'll<00:04:08.070> follow<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:08.459> storm

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
can toss them they'll follow you storm

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.949 
can toss them they'll follow you storm
second<00:04:09.150> special<00:04:09.300> will<00:04:09.540> follow<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:09.930> wherever

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
second special will follow you wherever

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:10.520 
second special will follow you wherever
you<00:04:10.260> go

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
you go

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.990 
you go
Thor<00:04:10.920> second<00:04:11.280> special<00:04:11.459> will<00:04:11.700> follow<00:04:11.880> you

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
Thor second special will follow you

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.880 
Thor second special will follow you
wherever<00:04:12.030> you<00:04:12.420> go<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:13.230> those<00:04:13.470> your<00:04:13.650> will<00:04:13.740> just

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
wherever you go so those your will just

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.220 
wherever you go so those your will just
stand<00:04:14.100> back<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.310> block<00:04:14.670> so<00:04:15.360> I<00:04:15.780> don't<00:04:16.020> find

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
stand back and block so I don't find

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.430 
stand back and block so I don't find
that<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:16.560> needed<00:04:16.920> this<00:04:17.100> for<00:04:18.260> very<00:04:19.260> much

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
that I needed this for very much

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.349 
that I needed this for very much
honestly<00:04:20.100> so<00:04:20.549> I<00:04:20.609> don't<00:04:20.730> put<00:04:20.820> any<00:04:20.940> points<00:04:21.209> there

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
honestly so I don't put any points there

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.840 
honestly so I don't put any points there
and<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:22.650> one<00:04:22.800> after<00:04:22.950> that<00:04:23.130> is<00:04:23.400> increased

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
and the one after that is increased

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.840 
and the one after that is increased
perfect<00:04:24.360> block<00:04:24.540> by<00:04:24.780> 1%<00:04:25.260> now<00:04:25.830> I<00:04:25.860> don't<00:04:26.070> draw

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
perfect block by 1% now I don't draw

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.150 
perfect block by 1% now I don't draw
so<00:04:27.000> perfect<00:04:27.270> block<00:04:27.480> is<00:04:27.720> way<00:04:28.530> or<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.860> question

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
so perfect block is way or the question

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.530 
so perfect block is way or the question
for<00:04:29.340> me<00:04:29.430> because<00:04:29.610> I<00:04:29.910> don't<00:04:30.060> really<00:04:30.150> need<00:04:30.390> to

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
for me because I don't really need to

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.790 
for me because I don't really need to
put<00:04:30.720> points<00:04:30.870> there<00:04:31.140> so<00:04:31.230> I<00:04:31.260> just<00:04:31.410> put<00:04:31.560> points

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
put points there so I just put points

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.440 
put points there so I just put points
here<00:04:31.980> and<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:32.340> put<00:04:32.640> the<00:04:32.730> rest<00:04:32.880> of<00:04:32.970> my<00:04:33.090> points<00:04:33.360> in

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
here and I put the rest of my points in

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.950 
here and I put the rest of my points in

the only reason many people are saying

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.280 
the only reason many people are saying
put<00:04:36.030> all<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.390> points<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:36.690> offense<00:04:36.990> don't<00:04:37.170> be

little<00:04:40.560> bit<00:04:40.770> in<00:04:40.830> defense<00:04:41.100> because<00:04:41.340> I<00:04:41.490> have

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
little bit in defense because I have

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.370 
little bit in defense because I have
characters<00:04:42.060> that<00:04:42.240> scale<00:04:42.480> with<00:04:42.630> health<00:04:42.840> for

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
characters that scale with health for

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.170 
characters that scale with health for
instance<00:04:43.620> I've<00:04:43.710> got<00:04:43.860> that<00:04:44.010> pool<00:04:44.190> on<00:04:44.520> my<00:04:44.700> main

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
instance I've got that pool on my main

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.490 
instance I've got that pool on my main
theme<00:04:45.390> I<00:04:45.570> one<00:04:46.530> of<00:04:46.590> my<00:04:46.680> main<00:04:46.800> themes<00:04:47.040> and<00:04:48.080> he<00:04:49.080> has

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
theme I one of my main themes and he has

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.560 
theme I one of my main themes and he has
regeneration<00:04:50.040> like<00:04:50.370> everyone<00:04:50.730> knows<00:04:50.850> and<00:04:51.150> it

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
regeneration like everyone knows and it

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.750 
regeneration like everyone knows and it
scales<00:04:51.900> with<00:04:52.050> his<00:04:52.290> maximum<00:04:52.740> health<00:04:52.800> so<00:04:53.580> if<00:04:53.670> I

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
scales with his maximum health so if I

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.590 
scales with his maximum health so if I
increase<00:04:53.880> his<00:04:54.210> health

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
increase his health

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
increase his health
that<00:04:54.870> means<00:04:55.050> I'm<00:04:55.140> increasing<00:04:55.530> his

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
that means I'm increasing his

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.960 
that means I'm increasing his
regeneration<00:04:55.920> which<00:04:56.340> means<00:04:56.520> I'm<00:04:56.610> increasing

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
regeneration which means I'm increasing

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.240 
regeneration which means I'm increasing
his<00:04:57.030> stats<00:04:57.440> now<00:04:58.440> that<00:04:58.590> helps<00:04:58.740> for<00:04:58.950> me

your<00:06:00.000> total<00:06:00.210> hero<00:06:00.390> rating<00:06:00.660> mine<00:06:01.290> was<00:06:01.530> the<00:06:01.890> same

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
your total hero rating mine was the same

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.930 
your total hero rating mine was the same
as<00:06:02.460> it<00:06:02.610> is<00:06:02.670> right<00:06:02.910> now<00:06:02.940> and<00:06:04.490> it<00:06:05.490> has<00:06:05.610> increased

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
as it is right now and it has increased

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.550 
as it is right now and it has increased
but<00:06:06.090> the<00:06:06.150> PIO<00:06:06.390> for<00:06:06.660> my<00:06:06.780> champion<00:06:07.200> is<00:06:07.290> increased

but the PIO for my champion is increased

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.320 
but the PIO for my champion is increased
quite<00:06:07.830> significantly<00:06:07.890> I<00:06:08.520> guess<00:06:08.820> that's<00:06:09.030> a<00:06:09.120> bug

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
quite significantly I guess that's a bug
