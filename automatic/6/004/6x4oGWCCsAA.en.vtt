let's go have a word with our engineers

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.110 
let's go have a word with our engineers
here<00:00:57.260> in<00:00:57.409> the<00:00:57.500> lab<00:00:57.739> we<00:00:58.670> were<00:00:58.790> given<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.089> task

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
here in the lab we were given the task

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.500 
here in the lab we were given the task
of<00:00:59.600> building<00:00:59.809> a<00:01:00.140> gravity<00:01:00.530> car<00:01:00.800> so<00:01:01.730> in<00:01:02.180> order<00:01:02.330> to

totally be a full grounded power we tied

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.080 
totally be a full grounded power we tied
the<00:01:07.900> string<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:09.620> front<00:01:09.860> axle<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:10.460> tied

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
the string to the front axle and tied

motion<00:01:23.840> is<00:01:24.380> no<00:01:24.530> longer<00:01:25.070> there<00:01:26.110> we<00:01:27.110> were<00:01:27.260> able

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
motion is no longer there we were able

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.150 
motion is no longer there we were able
to<00:01:28.180> adjust<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.480> distance<00:01:29.750> car<00:01:30.590> is<00:01:30.680> able<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.010> go

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
to adjust the distance car is able to go

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.060 
to adjust the distance car is able to go
by<00:01:32.000> figuring<00:01:32.390> out<00:01:32.420> an<00:01:32.630> equation<00:01:32.960> it<00:01:33.740> gives<00:01:33.920> us

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
by figuring out an equation it gives us

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.210 
by figuring out an equation it gives us
the<00:01:34.220> approximate<00:01:34.730> distance<00:01:35.150> to<00:01:35.330> Carl<00:01:35.540> travel

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
the approximate distance to Carl travel

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.690 
the approximate distance to Carl travel
one<00:01:37.220> foot<00:01:37.490> up<00:01:37.610> your<00:01:37.790> will<00:01:38.780> give<00:01:38.930> us<00:01:39.220> five<00:01:40.220> feet

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
one foot up your will give us five feet

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.570 
one foot up your will give us five feet
and<00:01:40.940> distance<00:01:41.980> we<00:01:42.980> hope<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:43.280> like<00:01:43.400> our

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
one thing we don't do well we don't joke

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.120
