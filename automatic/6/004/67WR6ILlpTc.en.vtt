00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.979
 let's all welcome onu video and 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.420
 we are here in the how-to tutorial 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:08.389
 put a layout in our video of 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.550
 pokemon episode series whatever in 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.690
 this case I have this that is mine is 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.610
 very simple is at the request of 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.559
 Subscriber is making this video and 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.760
 it is very simple the only thing that you have to 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.130
 to do or if it is with the photoshop as well 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.529
 If this is fabric, that is already your 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.820
 I 'm going to tell you how to do it 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.260
 here and good I put here my pokemon and 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.270
 here the medals but they are the least 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.970
 here good I have the each episode 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.380
 the Greeks giving just in case and here 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.699
 I have the last one that as you can see here I have 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.890
 we put all the medals that I'm going 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.090
 getting and how good that 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.550
 you can download understand perfectly 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.410
 the medals of everything but let's what 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.610
 essential once recorded with the singing 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.920
 already the episode to those who created us 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.640
 these files here we have the video what 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.220
 what would be like that 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.750
 here we had the video and since we had 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.750
 the audio is very simple 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.800
 the 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:03.570
 the first one and also the video here I have 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.519
 this good and the audio 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.300
 it is very simple what we have to do 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.550
 is to drag the video to the fast 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.250
 and make the aaiÃºn to the size of the file 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.520
 video and the audio here is more than 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.560
 same 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.790
 As you can see now, it looks messy, not 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.979
 it's very simple you have to be 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.220
 insert another video track and here 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.960
 We add this to felt the same way the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.520
 video 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.740
 we will eliminate the audio track that 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.780
 believe us we would be a video 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.830
 loose and one of the video along with his 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.990
 audio is that simple now but 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.000
 we have to go here to the incognito this 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.250
 that will make us track movement here and 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.750
 we will have to do it as 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.720
 we see here we are left with the archives 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.570
 because with the X we were playing here 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.810
 we'll smaller as I have already 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.610
 said how do you have to go doing it 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.840
 It's very simple and I have the 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.790
 templates then save the templates 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.780
 with the templates with this up to me 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.150
 case I 'm going to do it fast I'm going to put 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.070
 barber part of the tree 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.080
 and I've moved it so I'm going to 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.290
 reset add again 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:12.540
 does not expect to eliminate the clues that I have 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:14.790
 wrong done we insert another video track 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.920
 and here we will be created this we will eliminate 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.209
 and that's it and when we have the 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.730
 templates saved and all once 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:25.930
 saved everything let's put the template 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.060
 and we are going to do it also in the second 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.830
 this would be template 2 and that 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.530
 we would have to do with this good to 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.000
 see if we still go badly we have to 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.530
 come here to what would come to be 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.230
 that puts me for the organization the 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.310
 event cuts and more of the same if 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.799
 for example the first screen is this 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.349
 we would do so they would see us as you see 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.650
 on screen 1 I'm going to put it with 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.930
 he with the template there is 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.640
 well and in the second more of the same 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.050
 here we would do so 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:05.230
 it's very simple we already had the embedded 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.230
 and then only here I do not 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.430
 and we already have what was being everything 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.230
 well put and that we would have more power 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.570
 control if we recorded with the sound 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.430
 with very high audio in the application 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.930
 of the moment or the application that 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.730
 use to record the emulator 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.440
 we have to control the audio this 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.170
 would come to be the audio of one of one of 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.700
 these is the audio of the game and the other is 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.920
 the audio of your myth then with this 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.350
 we balance we lower and raise the volume 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.690
 that we need and that's it 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.670
 simple we would take the project and 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.870
 file render like and well then 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.300
 render them and that's the format that 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.010
 ronde the icex render so I do not expect anything 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.080
 that you liked the video that you have 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.450
 It's helpful if you have any 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.370
 doubt or any comment is not to 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.690
 whatever problem whatever it is I 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.550
 you say in the comments and I will help you 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.050
 with the highest possible quality so 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.550
 I do not expect anything if you liked the video that 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.200
 vote, I like favorites and see you in
