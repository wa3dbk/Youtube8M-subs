00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:09.790
 Hello everyone, Alexander, and today I 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.599
 I'll tell you how to glue the film on your 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.969
 sony xperia z1 compact 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.610
 film is presented by red line 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.770
 This is a quality German film which 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.750
 made of polymers perfect 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.210
 smoothes protects the touch screen 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.070
 from scratches and damage this film 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.040
 You can buy our store at the most 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:34.930
 better price and so let's first 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:38.260
 open the sachet box and see 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:43.510
 what we have is picking kit 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:47.339
 we are the film itself and the cloth means 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.409
 Before sticking a film, it's important to remember that 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.589
 the best option is as soon as you 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.149
 removed the previous film immediately glue 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:59.230
 next for what it needs to not 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:05.409
 dust we get let's get 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:11.920
 we remove the old film neatly 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:15.160
 film now we look we check the screen on 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.260
 subject to dust if we have here 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.950
 there is 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:23.490
 we also wipe it carefully 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.490
 care not to hit 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.490
 which one 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.140
 like dust removed further now we take 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:46.369
 through the film itself the film is glued 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.369
 two stages take st-1 a little over 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.189
 tear and then exactly 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:01.880
 I may not work because a 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.880
 angle to and here it is very important exactly for sure 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:17.150
 stick it see you already have a blade there 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.340
 hit the tape 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.569
 my that she will not act 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.830
 that is the most important thing is to shoot the film 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.870
 film sticking time to follow 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:34.220
 no dust got there 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:37.220
 What exactly precisely and neatly need 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.220
 to make 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:50.840
 The chance to stick the film correctly at you 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:54.790
 only one as a matter of fact now we take 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.790
 film and smooth accordingly 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.920
 as we see the given film data on 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.050
 it was glued enough was cotton and why 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.030
 need to follow with why am I saying exactly 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.500
 you need to monitor the dust to not 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:13.310
 was let's now 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.190
 then after you pasted the outer 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.190
 do not take this layer internally 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.800
 here air bubbles chose it nothing 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:32.770
 terrible they are quietly squeezed out here 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:32.770
 in such a way, it bubbles from 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:47.819
 dust bubble they are not like 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:55.450
 squeeze can not show from this side 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:56.489
 I will show you why I fell 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.969
 vodka 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:06.489
 One speck of dust I still got here 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:09.430
 and that without doing it wrong 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:13.709
 images of the bladder is not removed it 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:19.620
 for this reason you need to be very careful 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:19.620
 glue the film and repeat that 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.250
 the ability to stick a film you will be 1 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.259
 that is, if you unstick it once 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.250
 stuck the second rhinestone remove and re-stick 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:32.169
 you will not have the opportunity will not be 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.110
 so if you want to if you yourself 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.430
 the film is not able to glue of course much 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:43.449
 better to use the services 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:52.690
 specialists further in order to take off 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:05:00.280
 take this film office knife here 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:05:04.750
 this way does not remove and then 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.940
