00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.550
 Well, my doc, I talked directly 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:10.940
 scary feature or it would be the end 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.940
 of humanity 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.150
 hello we together the film factory now 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.880
 is there for you the ww2 frankenstein 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.240
 that he so improved this updater 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.590
 asks a 2.0 version story plays 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.000
 but again with frankenstein 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.130
 he was also a stain 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.470
 parts of the body were patched together 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.179
 plays end fight and meanwhile 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.160
 but in our time in the 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.870
 underworld gives dark forces the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.540
 try to conquer the power and the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.820
 leader of the evil demon clan 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.010
 tiberius wants to go to the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.230
 takeover of the world also the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.550
 destroy people all together and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.510
 So the world will be destroyed again 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.710
 threatened but he also wants to use it 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.390
 all this somehow in the way 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.670
 Do not give anything to a white one 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.039
 do not know yet in which conflict 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.870
 Guess is how gloomy and how 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.469
 gone crazy and how crazy that looks 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.469
 that you are here 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:26.920
 frankenstein the rumors are true me 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.300
 was brought to life 200 years ago 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.300
 I am like nobody else 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.280
 with a strength and speed 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.250
 Endurance is superior to man 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.479
 put these gifts in 1 in a war 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.479
 the du is already involved 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.710
 I go my own way 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.530
 you can not trust the human heart 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.220
 Eating nothing can ruin your meal 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.220
 stop 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:07.270
 come with me there is an army of 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.660
 monsters like 10,000 mio it would be the end 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.660
 of humanity 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.180
 it ends tonight 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.810
 When I met you , I looked 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.030
 in yours and though I am a darkness 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.930
 scale one is only a monster if one 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.930
 behave as once 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.900
 you do not have to force frankenstein 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.010
 God will damn you 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.990
 the basic idea is an old-fashioned one 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.150
 oldschool history a bit like that 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.890
 spice to get into the here and now 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.510
 I think first you can do a lot 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.670
 just make the frankenstein 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.170
 history has a lot of potential 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.090
 and then you have to say that too 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.330
 overall look of the whole 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.850
 he is quite neat 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.190
 but unfortunately in the implementation simply 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.570
 really there was something there everywhere 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.980
 So if I'm here with the edding now 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.240
 so black dots would paint 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.490
 that's not easy anymore 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.890
 Missing everywhere, she is bad 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.870
 It is so cheap but that's it 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.060
 not the problem but the script 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.410
 I do not know what you're doing for it 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.140
 must take care of such dialogues 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.110
 rauszuhauen always so exaggerated serious 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.690
 I stay online where I am 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.970
 sentence he says and promises himself 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.300
 I have always seen the original in the original 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.950
 in operated so bettman 3.0 that he is 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.170
 annoying it is ridiculous rather 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.330
 involuntarily funny as exciting 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.280
 is and that's the basic topic 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.910
 the film does not mean it's the movie 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.590
 should be and also may be and 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.350
 That's why this movie is just 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.150
 really so if so now 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.560
 all points of criticism would be the film 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.200
 maybe a below average 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.000
 but leaves the acting power 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.650
 just to be desired though good 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.690
 I am my record here 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.090
 pictures here, I have just one 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.640
 silly film factory issued for the 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.260
 best male side roll for everything 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.520
 a matter of time and here he delivers 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.560
 have nothing so there can also be 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.000
 director somehow not the people 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.550
 stretch out they can do it 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.630
 do not call anything because not at all 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.190
 somehow it is necessary that it is so 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.229
 bad together again 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.470
 it is always so fragmentary cut 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:50.620
 pretty strange transitions and also 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.390
 overall he is much too long in which they 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.919
 Before that, it was always the same 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.440
 So it actually happens 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.090
 minute 10 there is an attack of the must 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.860
 must be warded off three to four 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.240
 what a stupid shit in the camera 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.150
 say then it works again 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.610
 go on with that the demons with the 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.290
 fire to be sent back to hell 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.940
 there would be a classic for me 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.700
 Candidate for his golden raspberry 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.140
 would be stupid but the good thing for the film 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.520
 is that one at the end of the year if you can 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.990
 must always the whole calendar year 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.910
 sailor that snot again 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.170
 forgot and that's why he gets 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.060
 then there is no price for the 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.950
 worst movie with me he is with 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.720
 security among the nominees and 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.310
 Now I'm upset enough 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.460
 it is now a frankenstein 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.890
 I think that's not shit bad 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.570
 to view my personal tax 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.540
 ratings are accordingly 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.520
 really bad two out of ten points 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.290
 it's almost one for me 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.960
 small insolence the movie so that 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.690
 normal cinemagoer likes to continue 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.220
 be the genre fans there's something else 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.230
 can win and the little bit 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.270
 find it cooler because it really is 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.040
 nothing is expected, that may be 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.740
 but a complete one for me 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.720
 total failure that really only be through 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.350
 basic layout a bit 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.790
 can score 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.560
 that was it and that's why 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.510
 it scores two out of ten points 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.350
 there are my rituals frankenstein the 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.600
 film was just a small one 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.670
 catastrophe but I'll give you two 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.230
 possibilities to watch movies or 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.180
 reviews to watch movies from the great 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.950
 they were the ones you want to see below 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.040
 I know about it if you like that again 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.600
 a new version of old history 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.100
 and you make today's world and 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.870
 which today's time brings what would be 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.940
 that writes in the comments or 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.290

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.730
