the water frequently because what

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.150 
the water frequently because what
happens<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.359> people<00:00:25.320> know<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.619> brown<00:00:25.890> part

happens is people know this brown part

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.599 
happens is people know this brown part
right<00:00:26.340> here<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.119> an<00:00:27.269> enzyme<00:00:27.510> inhibitor

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
right here this is an enzyme inhibitor

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.669 
right here this is an enzyme inhibitor
in<00:00:29.609> other<00:00:29.760> words<00:00:29.910> if<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.150> eat<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.679> it's

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
in other words if you eat that it's

in other words if you eat that it's
going<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.890> stop<00:00:32.099> your<00:00:32.250> digestion<00:00:32.700> you're

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
going to stop your digestion you're

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.790 
going to stop your digestion you're
going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.660> hard<00:00:33.780> time<00:00:34.020> digesting<00:00:34.230> other

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
going to have hard time digesting other

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.160 
going to have hard time digesting other
foods<00:00:35.309> because<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.840> main<00:00:36.989> purpose

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
foods because of it and the main purpose

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.950 
foods because of it and the main purpose
is<00:00:37.380> because<00:00:37.500> when<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> seed<00:00:38.040> falls<00:00:38.750> gets<00:00:39.750> into

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
is because when the seed falls gets into

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.110 
is because when the seed falls gets into
the<00:00:40.050> ground<00:00:40.320> try<00:00:40.950> some<00:00:41.129> nestle<00:00:41.430> down<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.879> turn

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
the ground try some nestle down and turn

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.470 
the ground try some nestle down and turn
itself<00:00:42.360> into<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.719> plant<00:00:43.370> well<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.940> brown<00:00:45.120> part

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
itself into a plant well the brown part

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.400 
itself into a plant well the brown part
is<00:00:45.600> stopping<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:47.640> outside<00:00:48.149> from<00:00:48.570> from<00:00:49.110> eating

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
is stopping the outside from from eating

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.170 
is stopping the outside from from eating
up<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> seed<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.010> killing<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.579> digesting

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
up the seed and killing it and digesting

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.869 
up the seed and killing it and digesting
it<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.539> turning<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.930> back<00:00:52.050> into<00:00:52.079> soil<00:00:52.879> it's

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
it and turning it back into soil it's

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.869 
it and turning it back into soil it's
holding<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.350> has<00:00:55.500> time<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.760> know

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
holding it so it has time to you know

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.200 
holding it so it has time to you know
like<00:00:57.230> grow<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> little<00:00:58.469> chute<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.010> turn<00:00:59.910> into<00:01:00.180> a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
like grow a little chute and turn into a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.200 
like grow a little chute and turn into a
big<00:01:00.420> giant<00:01:00.660> almond<00:01:01.050> tree<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:03.059> eat

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
you eat too many you might even actually

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.390 
you eat too many you might even actually
get<00:01:09.630> constipated<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.560> get<00:01:10.710> stomach<00:01:11.130> pains

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.740 
they're all soaked I peel them so that
they're<00:01:21.330> like<00:01:21.770> peeled<00:01:23.030> then<00:01:24.030> what<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.390> I

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
they're like peeled then what I do is I

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.399 
they're like peeled then what I do is I
have<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.970> have<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> food<00:01:27.450> dehydrator<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:28.170> an<00:01:28.229> X

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
have I have a food dehydrator it's an X

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.890 
have I have a food dehydrator it's an X
caliper<00:01:28.920> model<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.939> lay<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.600> tray

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
caliper model and I lay it on the tray

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.350 
caliper model and I lay it on the tray
overnight<00:01:31.409> also<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.860> only<00:01:32.369> keep<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.700> 115

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
overnight also I only keep that 115

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.090 
overnight also I only keep that 115
degrees<00:01:33.600> because<00:01:33.869> if<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.049> put<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.259> over<00:01:34.500> 150

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
degrees because if you put it over 150

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.319 
degrees because if you put it over 150
degrees<00:01:35.369> you're<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.670> kill<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.060> seed

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
degrees you're going to kill that seed

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.539 
degrees you're going to kill that seed
and<00:01:36.570> really<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.320> wanted<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.650> live<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.430> want

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
and really you wanted to live you want

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.760 
and really you wanted to live you want
the<00:01:38.729> nutrients<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:40.140> know<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.409> little<00:01:40.560> thing

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the nutrients you know this little thing

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.980 
the nutrients you know this little thing
is<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> powerhouse<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:42.210> vitamins<00:01:42.840> and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
is like a powerhouse of vitamins and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.840 
is like a powerhouse of vitamins and
minerals<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.590> get<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.829> think<00:01:43.979> about<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.430> it

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
minerals you get to think about that it

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.289 
minerals you get to think about that it
has<00:01:45.030> everything<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.320> create<00:01:46.649> whole
