00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
on the card this potentially could have

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.530 
on the card this potentially could have
actually<00:02:43.890> saved<00:02:44.280> Dan<00:02:44.580> Wheldon<00:02:44.850> because<00:02:45.360> he

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
actually saved Dan Wheldon because he

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.479 
actually saved Dan Wheldon because he
launched<00:02:45.900> over<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.350> rear<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.770> car<00:02:47.130> from<00:02:47.370> the

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.430 
launched over the rear the car from the
wheel<00:02:47.700> now<00:02:48.390> they<00:02:48.510> have<00:02:48.690> these<00:02:48.810> tower<00:02:49.080> guards

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
name kind of flexible not very well on

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.840 
name kind of flexible not very well on
on<00:02:56.430> there<00:02:56.670> but<00:02:57.000> huh<00:02:57.739> so<00:02:58.739> yeah<00:02:59.160> this<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.489> Chevy

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
on there but huh so yeah this is a Chevy

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.070 
on there but huh so yeah this is a Chevy
and<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.360> engine<00:03:00.510> cover<00:03:00.810> back<00:03:01.050> case

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
and this is the engine cover back case

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.460 
and this is the engine cover back case
the<00:03:01.620> engine<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.040> located<00:03:02.459> right<00:03:02.610> there<00:03:03.470> and

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
the engine is located right there and

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.080 
the engine is located right there and
usually<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:05.010> can<00:03:05.190> just<00:03:05.400> kind<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.730> take<00:03:05.940> that

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
usually you can just kind of take that

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.180 
usually you can just kind of take that
off<00:03:06.300> but<00:03:07.050> unfortunately<00:03:07.709> I<00:03:07.770> made<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.070> where

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
off but unfortunately I made it to where

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.830 
off but unfortunately I made it to where
you<00:03:08.310> can't<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:08.760> they<00:03:09.150> actually<00:03:09.480> made<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.720> to

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
you can't and they actually made it to

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.060 
you can't and they actually made it to
where<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.080> wheels<00:03:10.230> don't<00:03:10.410> even<00:03:10.709> turn<00:03:10.890> this

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
where the wheels don't even turn this

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.770 
where the wheels don't even turn this
year<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.670> can<00:03:11.700> kind<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.060> bend<00:03:12.330> them<00:03:12.540> but

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
year that you can kind of bend them but

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.270 
year that you can kind of bend them but
I<00:03:12.810> mean<00:03:13.170> they're<00:03:13.290> not<00:03:13.410> meant<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.769> turn<00:03:13.980> which

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
I mean they're not meant to turn which

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.800 
I mean they're not meant to turn which
is<00:03:14.430> very<00:03:14.610> disappointing<00:03:14.760> put<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.690> little

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
is very disappointing put a little

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.330 
is very disappointing put a little
antenna<00:03:16.170> there<00:03:16.380> is<00:03:16.530> where<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.739> fuel<00:03:16.980> goes<00:03:17.160> in

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
antenna there is where the fuel goes in

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.370 
antenna there is where the fuel goes in
right<00:03:17.489> there<00:03:17.760> right<00:03:18.630> near<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.870> driver<00:03:19.140> which

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
right there right near the driver which

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.259 
right there right near the driver which
is<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.530> tee<00:03:20.130> bit<00:03:20.459> dangerous<00:03:20.640> but<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.209> know<00:03:21.360> well

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
is a tee bit dangerous but you know well

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.289 
is a tee bit dangerous but you know well
you<00:03:24.269> can<00:03:24.390> kind<00:03:24.630> of<00:03:24.690> see<00:03:24.750> in<00:03:25.080> there<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:26.150> like<00:03:27.150> this

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
you can kind of see in there I like this

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.060 
you can kind of see in there I like this
Cameron<00:03:27.720> they<00:03:27.840> have<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:28.019> new<00:03:28.140> camera<00:03:28.410> angle<00:03:28.769> or

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
Cameron they have a new camera angle or

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.690 
Cameron they have a new camera angle or
right<00:03:29.370> about<00:03:29.580> here<00:03:31.100> which<00:03:32.100> is<00:03:32.250> actually<00:03:32.549> I

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
right about here which is actually I

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.580 
right about here which is actually I
that<00:03:32.970> it's<00:03:33.180> more<00:03:33.360> about<00:03:33.480> here<00:03:34.140> which<00:03:34.440> is

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
that it's more about here which is

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.590 
that it's more about here which is
actually<00:03:34.739> pretty<00:03:35.130> cool<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:36.030> they<00:03:36.180> actually

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
actually pretty cool and they actually

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.050 
actually pretty cool and they actually
have<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.780> new<00:03:36.959> camera<00:03:37.230> angle<00:03:37.739> on<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:38.670> mirror

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
have a new camera angle on this mirror

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.240 
have a new camera angle on this mirror
right<00:03:39.269> here<00:03:39.650> it's<00:03:40.650> kind<00:03:40.799> of<00:03:40.890> hard<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:41.100> get<00:03:41.190> a

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
right here it's kind of hard to get a

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.220 
right here it's kind of hard to get a
camera<00:03:41.489> angle<00:03:41.790> but<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:41.940> can<00:03:42.030> see<00:03:42.750> driving<00:03:43.170> the

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
camera angle but you can see driving the

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.250 
camera angle but you can see driving the
cars<00:03:43.440> they<00:03:43.650> race<00:03:43.860> along<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:45.180> yeah<00:03:45.660> you<00:03:45.900> can<00:03:46.080> the

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
cars they race along so yeah you can the

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.660 
cars they race along so yeah you can the
wing<00:03:46.440> is<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.739> little<00:03:47.010> bit<00:03:47.100> different<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.519> road

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
wing is a little bit different the road

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.370 
wing is a little bit different the road
course<00:03:47.880> one<00:03:48.090> kind<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.480> banks<00:03:48.840> up<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:49.049> little<00:03:49.260> bit

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
course one kind of banks up a little bit

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.300 
course one kind of banks up a little bit
more<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:49.680> this<00:03:49.769> is<00:03:49.950> more<00:03:50.190> flat<00:03:52.130> from<00:03:53.130> my

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
more and this is more flat from my

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.400 
more and this is more flat from my
understanding<00:03:53.480> Tony<00:03:54.480> Kanaan<00:03:54.690> actually<00:03:55.260> did

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
understanding Tony Kanaan actually did

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.070 
understanding Tony Kanaan actually did
not<00:03:55.440> race<00:03:55.739> this<00:03:55.950> car<00:03:56.480> they<00:03:57.480> made<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.720> diecast

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
not race this car they made the diecast

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.110 
not race this car they made the diecast
right<00:03:58.410> after<00:03:58.709> they<00:03:58.980> announced<00:03:59.430> they<00:03:59.760> were

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
right after they announced they were

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.000 
right after they announced they were
going<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.330> switch<00:04:00.510> paint<00:04:00.750> schemes<00:04:01.049> I<00:04:01.320> don't

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
going to switch paint schemes I don't

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.220 
going to switch paint schemes I don't
exactly<00:04:02.220> remember<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.630> one<00:04:03.750> that<00:04:03.930> he's<00:04:04.049> using

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
exactly remember the one that he's using

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.770 
exactly remember the one that he's using
now<00:04:04.530> but<00:04:04.950> i'll<00:04:05.940> show<00:04:06.090> you<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.269> bottom<00:04:06.600> of<00:04:06.720> it

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
now but i'll show you the bottom of it
