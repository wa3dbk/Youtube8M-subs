00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
why is this not a thing why can we not

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.800 
why is this not a thing why can we not

there even the Rope go to and from like
that<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.539> would<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.140> cool<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.679> mean<00:02:02.189> think

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
that that would be so cool I mean think

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.590 
that that would be so cool I mean think
of<00:02:02.399> all<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> cool<00:02:02.820> things<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.299> do

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
of all the cool things that you can do

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.819 
of all the cool things that you can do
this<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.439> just<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.710> small<00:02:04.860> example<00:02:06.619> you<00:02:07.619> got<00:02:07.799> a

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
this is just a small example you got a

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.360 
this is just a small example you got a
boat<00:02:08.039> dock<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:09.239> looks<00:02:09.420> like<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.569> boat<00:02:09.810> dock

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.970 

dinner<00:02:14.370> bone<00:02:14.519> I<00:02:14.760> want<00:02:15.569> this<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.650> hope<00:02:16.680> I'm

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
dinner bone I want this and I hope I'm

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.650 
dinner bone I want this and I hope I'm
not<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.280> only<00:02:17.400> one<00:02:17.519> all<00:02:18.060> right<00:02:18.239> so<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.510> only

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
not the only one all right so the only

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.449 
not the only one all right so the only
downside<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.379> this<00:02:19.410> whole<00:02:19.680> thing<00:02:19.920> as<00:02:20.160> soon<00:02:20.340> as

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
downside of this whole thing as soon as

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.670 
downside of this whole thing as soon as
you<00:02:20.519> log<00:02:20.760> out<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.150> log<00:02:21.239> back<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:21.989> these<00:02:22.380> ropes

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
you log out and log back in these ropes

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.410 
you log out and log back in these ropes
are<00:02:22.799> gone<00:02:23.010> they<00:02:23.489> don't<00:02:23.670> stick<00:02:23.880> around<00:02:24.120> and

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
are gone they don't stick around and

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.940 
are gone they don't stick around and
that<00:02:24.510> really<00:02:24.780> sucks<00:02:25.049> because<00:02:25.290> this<00:02:25.620> could<00:02:25.769> be

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
that really sucks because this could be

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.479 
that really sucks because this could be
a<00:02:25.980> very<00:02:26.510> very<00:02:27.510> awesome<00:02:28.019> decorative<00:02:28.410> tool<00:02:28.739> just

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
a very very awesome decorative tool just

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.280 
a very very awesome decorative tool just
for<00:02:29.670> some<00:02:29.849> smaller<00:02:30.239> detail<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:30.959> can<00:02:31.140> put

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
for some smaller detail that you can put

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.410 
for some smaller detail that you can put
into<00:02:31.560> your<00:02:31.680> world<00:02:31.910> like<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:32.940> said<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.329> know

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
this is my single player world and I

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.949 
this is my single player world and I
focus<00:02:35.400> on<00:02:35.519> putting<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.910> lot<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.180> small<00:02:36.569> detail

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
focus on putting a lot of small detail

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.160 
focus on putting a lot of small detail
into<00:02:37.170> things<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.709> this<00:02:38.579> would<00:02:38.819> be<00:02:39.019> awesome<00:02:40.019> to

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
into things and this would be awesome to

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.839 
into things and this would be awesome to
have<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.680> don't<00:02:40.799> understand<00:02:41.400> why<00:02:41.519> this<00:02:41.579> is<00:02:41.700> a

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
have I don't understand why this is a

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.089 
have I don't understand why this is a
thing<00:02:42.150> isn't<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:43.019> thing<00:02:43.200> but<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:43.920> mean

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
thing isn't a thing but I mean

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.259 
thing isn't a thing but I mean
especially<00:02:44.190> for<00:02:44.640> something<00:02:44.880> like<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:45.000> boat

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
especially for something like a boat

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.699 
especially for something like a boat
dock<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.690> looks<00:02:45.840> really<00:02:46.049> cool<00:02:46.200> but<00:02:46.349> even<00:02:46.590> for

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
dock that looks really cool but even for

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:47.990 
dock that looks really cool but even for
some<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.010> smaller<00:02:47.310> details<00:02:47.400> like

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000
