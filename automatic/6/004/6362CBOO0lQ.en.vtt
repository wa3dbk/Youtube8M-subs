 the hill was high and because I was a beginner I did what it does not do

 negative Nestor there are no women who are gold running min so I tried to 

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:47.149
 think positively and visualize the final goal of year and a half but at 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.030

 but I knew it was not like that 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.860
 and I felt happy Christmas 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.520
 I also knew that even if I stopped and abandoned the race, I would still 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.010
 losses 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.380
 there I began to pray haiti itself on the marathon route 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.119
 I had the strength to be firm and finish the race 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.540
 when running 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.880

 viciano theme saying and shields and teeth 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.970

 my husband was right there 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.489

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.069
