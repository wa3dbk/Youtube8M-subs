00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
liberties with the character I think

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.760 
liberties with the character I think
that's<00:02:00.810> what<00:02:01.079> will<00:02:01.320> cause<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.649> much

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
that's what will cause so much

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.060 
that's what will cause so much
controversy<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:03.079> now<00:02:04.079> they<00:02:04.740> don't<00:02:04.829> want<00:02:05.009> to

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070

don't know how much they actually got

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.400 
don't know how much they actually got
probably<00:02:25.330> like<00:02:25.420> just<00:02:25.690> five<00:02:25.840> minutes<00:02:26.080> or<00:02:26.290> so

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
probably like just five minutes or so

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.949 
probably like just five minutes or so
I'm<00:02:26.680> probably<00:02:27.310> not<00:02:27.519> even<00:02:27.790> ah<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:30.780> was<00:02:31.780> willing

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
I'm probably not even ah I was willing

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.509 
I'm probably not even ah I was willing
to<00:02:32.080> give<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.290> chance<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:32.739> really<00:02:33.010> was<00:02:33.160> i<00:02:33.370> was

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
to give a chance I really was i was

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.059 
to give a chance I really was i was
willing<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.790> give<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:33.970> chance<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.450> see<00:02:34.599> what

willing to give a chance to see what

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:43.050 
willing to give a chance to see what
what<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.160> deal<00:02:36.370> was<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:41.730> guess<00:02:42.730> we'll<00:02:42.940> never

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
what the deal was I guess we'll never

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.670 
what the deal was I guess we'll never
know<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:46.420> Wonder<00:02:46.780> Woman<00:02:47.049> show<00:02:47.080> that<00:02:47.530> never

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
know the Wonder Woman show that never

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.550 
know the Wonder Woman show that never
was<00:02:48.360> but<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:49.569> was<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.750> lot<00:02:49.959> of<00:02:50.019> things<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.470> was

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
was but it was a lot of things it was

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.259 
was but it was a lot of things it was
the<00:02:50.680> costume<00:02:51.099> it<00:02:51.250> was<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.459> casting<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.150> was

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
the costume it was the casting it was

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.550 
the costume it was the casting it was
the<00:02:52.360> fact<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.690> she<00:02:52.870> had<00:02:52.989> three<00:02:53.140> identities

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
the fact that she had three identities

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.819 
the fact that she had three identities
instead<00:02:53.920> of<00:02:54.010> two<00:02:54.329> I<00:02:55.329> thought<00:02:56.049> was<00:02:56.200> fighting

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
instead of two I thought was fighting

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:05.819 
instead of two I thought was fighting
against<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.250> show<00:02:57.900> I<00:03:02.160> think<00:03:03.599> the<00:03:04.599> idea<00:03:05.140> of

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
against the show I think the idea of

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.650 
against the show I think the idea of
warranty<00:03:06.430> of<00:03:06.519> a<00:03:06.610> television<00:03:07.060> series<00:03:07.269> is

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
warranty of a television series is

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.580 
warranty of a television series is
probably<00:03:08.819> going<00:03:09.819> to<00:03:09.910> be<00:03:10.000> dead<00:03:10.269> for<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.540> while<00:03:11.310> I

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
probably going to be dead for a while I

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.990 
probably going to be dead for a while I
was<00:03:14.590> really<00:03:14.860> but<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.130> was<00:03:15.340> really<00:03:15.549> hoping<00:03:15.700> for

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
was really but I was really hoping for

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.830 
was really but I was really hoping for
this<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.239> work<00:03:16.269> out<00:03:18.060> not<00:03:19.060> that<00:03:19.209> I<00:03:19.329> was<00:03:19.510> agreeing

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
this to work out not that I was agreeing

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.509 
this to work out not that I was agreeing
with<00:03:19.930> everything<00:03:20.109> that<00:03:20.440> they<00:03:20.560> did<00:03:20.620> but<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.489> was

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
with everything that they did but I was

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.270 
with everything that they did but I was
hoping<00:03:21.790> that<00:03:22.329> it<00:03:22.870> would<00:03:23.739> everything<00:03:24.069> would

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
hoping that it would everything would

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.590 
hoping that it would everything would
work<00:03:24.310> itself<00:03:24.760> out<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.090> it'll<00:03:25.239> be<00:03:25.329> a<00:03:25.359> great

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
work itself out and it'll be a great

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.569 
work itself out and it'll be a great
show<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:26.350> know<00:03:26.560> like<00:03:26.920> it<00:03:27.010> wouldn't<00:03:27.220> start<00:03:27.430> off

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
show you know like it wouldn't start off

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.140 
show you know like it wouldn't start off
great<00:03:27.880> but<00:03:28.120> it<00:03:28.269> will<00:03:28.359> end<00:03:28.510> up<00:03:28.750> great<00:03:29.190> but<00:03:30.190> it

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
great but it will end up great but it

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.479 
great but it will end up great but it
didn't<00:03:31.810> even<00:03:31.870> start<00:03:32.290> out<00:03:32.590> but<00:03:32.950> didn't<00:03:33.280> didn't
