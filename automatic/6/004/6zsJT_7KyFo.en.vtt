I<00:00:01.820> feel<00:00:02.820> like<00:00:03.000> I'm<00:00:03.179> not<00:00:03.270> balanced<00:00:03.780> by<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.220> by

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
I feel like I'm not balanced by the by

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.350 
I feel like I'm not balanced by the by
the<00:00:05.279> same<00:00:05.779> walls<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:07.259> rails<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:08.150> just<00:00:09.150> the

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
the same walls and rails and just the

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.799 
the same walls and rails and just the
same<00:00:09.540> paths<00:00:10.080> that<00:00:10.410> everybody<00:00:10.830> takes<00:00:11.809> every

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
same paths that everybody takes every

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.860 
same paths that everybody takes every
day<00:00:13.490> like<00:00:14.490> people<00:00:15.059> move<00:00:15.330> around<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.690> city

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
day like people move around the city

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.349 
day like people move around the city
like<00:00:16.049> ants<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.760> and<00:00:17.760> I'm<00:00:17.850> kind<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.180> doing

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
like ants and and I'm kind of doing

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.090 
like ants and and I'm kind of doing
something<00:00:18.660> different<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.289> I'll<00:00:19.560> enjoy<00:00:19.890> that

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
something different and I'll enjoy that

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.090 
something different and I'll enjoy that
a<00:00:20.130> lot<00:00:20.340> parkour<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.449> about<00:00:21.990> overcoming<00:00:22.230> mental

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
a lot parkour is about overcoming mental

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.880 
a lot parkour is about overcoming mental
and<00:00:23.279> physical<00:00:23.400> obstacles<00:00:24.180> as<00:00:24.470> an<00:00:25.470> art<00:00:25.680> it's

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
and physical obstacles as an art it's

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.060 
and physical obstacles as an art it's
about<00:00:26.250> moving<00:00:27.150> efficiently<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:28.140> through<00:00:28.859> and

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
about moving efficiently and through and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.429 
about moving efficiently and through and
over<00:00:29.400> under<00:00:29.820> obstacles<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.900> making<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.380> work

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
over under obstacles and making it work

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.729 
over under obstacles and making it work
for<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.059> but<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.300> apply<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:34.260> lot<00:00:34.559> of

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
for you but it can apply to a lot of

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.180 
for you but it can apply to a lot of
things<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.130> your<00:00:35.219> life<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.840> progress<00:00:36.840> by

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
things in your life I progress by

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.560 
things in your life I progress by
envisioning<00:00:38.190> what<00:00:38.610> I'm<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.059> do<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
envisioning what I'm going to do and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.880 
envisioning what I'm going to do and
then<00:00:39.719> once<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:39.989> make<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.290> happen<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.710> real<00:00:40.829> life

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
then once I make it happen in real life

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.729 
then once I make it happen in real life
I<00:00:41.309> feel<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> sense<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.870> accomplishment

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
I feel like a sense of accomplishment

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.700 
I feel like a sense of accomplishment
and<00:00:44.280> achievement<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.289> that's<00:00:46.289> that's<00:00:46.500> why<00:00:46.680> I

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
and achievement and that's that's why I

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.450 
and achievement and that's that's why I
keep<00:00:46.860> coming<00:00:46.920> back<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.610> when<00:00:48.890> I'm<00:00:49.890> when<00:00:50.399> I'm

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
keep coming back to it when I'm when I'm

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.479 
keep coming back to it when I'm when I'm
trying<00:00:50.700> something<00:00:50.940> new<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.949> don't<00:00:52.949> really<00:00:53.219> push

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
trying something new I don't really push

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.670 
trying something new I don't really push
my<00:00:53.670> limit<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.149> lot<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.930> I'm<00:00:55.079> not<00:00:55.230> too<00:00:55.469> scared

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
my limit a lot and so I'm not too scared

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.490 
my limit a lot and so I'm not too scared
of<00:00:55.920> anything<00:00:56.149> just<00:00:57.149> if<00:00:57.360> if<00:00:57.629> I'm<00:00:57.960> pushing<00:00:58.350> my

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
of anything just if if I'm pushing my

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.229 
of anything just if if I'm pushing my
limit<00:00:58.829> too<00:00:59.010> far<00:00:59.219> that's<00:00:59.430> when<00:00:59.640> I'm<00:00:59.730> afraid<00:01:00.030> but

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
limit too far that's when I'm afraid but

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.569 
limit too far that's when I'm afraid but
so<00:01:00.780> long<00:01:00.899> as<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.109> practice<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.710> know<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.489> do

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
so long as I practice I know I can do

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.140 
so long as I practice I know I can do
something<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.710> was<00:01:04.710> doing<00:01:05.010> like<00:01:05.400> bricks<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
something I was doing like bricks to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.539 
something I was doing like bricks to
bricks<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.810> know<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.200> basic<00:01:08.130> precision

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
bricks you know and just basic precision

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.670 
bricks you know and just basic precision
small<00:01:08.939> things<00:01:09.360> like<00:01:09.479> six<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.020> seven<00:01:10.350> feet<00:01:10.380> or

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
small things like six to seven feet or

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.010 
small things like six to seven feet or
so<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.580> keep<00:01:11.729> practicing<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.420> over<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
so and you keep practicing and over the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.740 
so and you keep practicing and over the
course<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.350> time<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.650> get<00:01:13.830> distance<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.750> just

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
course of time you get distance and just

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.960 
course of time you get distance and just
like<00:01:15.869> rail<00:01:16.080> rail<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.860> rail<00:01:16.890> Precision's<00:01:17.460> it's

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
like rail rail to rail Precision's it's

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.520 
like rail rail to rail Precision's it's
a<00:01:18.090> lot<00:01:18.240> more<00:01:18.270> fear<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.720> overcome<00:01:19.110> because<00:01:19.290> it's

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
a lot more fear to overcome because it's

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.890 
a lot more fear to overcome because it's
a<00:01:19.590> smaller<00:01:19.710> landing<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:21.479> when<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.750> get

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
a smaller landing and it when you get

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.990 
a smaller landing and it when you get
say<00:01:22.290> like<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> nine<00:01:22.860> ten<00:01:23.159> foot<00:01:23.369> precision<00:01:23.820> it

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
say like a nine ten foot precision it

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.960 
say like a nine ten foot precision it
just<00:01:24.210> feels<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:24.600> great<00:01:27.950> just<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.340> when

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
just feels really great just it's when

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.999 
just feels really great just it's when
you're<00:01:30.119> practicing<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.750> lot<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.290> develop<00:01:31.890> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
you're practicing a lot you develop a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.219 
you're practicing a lot you develop a
sort<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.369> muscle<00:01:32.729> memory<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:34.020> really

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
sort of muscle memory and you can really

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.310 
sort of muscle memory and you can really
feel<00:01:34.520> what<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.750> know<00:01:36.780> that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
feel what you can do and you know that

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.170 
feel what you can do and you know that
would<00:01:37.439> be<00:01:37.560> too<00:01:37.770> far<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.640> feel<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.090> your

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
would be too far just to feel it in your

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.480 
would be too far just to feel it in your
body

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.510 

I<00:01:45.020> don't<00:01:46.020> feel<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.590> I'm<00:01:46.770> putting<00:01:47.070> myself<00:01:47.159> in

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
I don't feel like I'm putting myself in

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.219 
I don't feel like I'm putting myself in
danger<00:01:47.549> when<00:01:48.149> i'm<00:01:48.360> out<00:01:48.810> here<00:01:48.869> training

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
danger when i'm out here training

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.990 
danger when i'm out here training
because<00:01:49.710> that's<00:01:50.280> actually<00:01:50.399> why<00:01:50.729> I'm<00:01:50.850> out<00:01:50.939> here

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
because that's actually why I'm out here

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.710 
because that's actually why I'm out here
so<00:01:51.330> I<00:01:51.360> don't<00:01:51.420> get<00:01:51.659> hurt<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.409> trained<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:52.979> that

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
so I don't get hurt I I trained so that

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.969 
so I don't get hurt I I trained so that
so<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.750> if<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.020> ever<00:01:55.049> put<00:01:55.530> myself<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.920> a

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
so that if I ever put myself in a

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.830 
so that if I ever put myself in a
situation<00:01:56.009> where<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.970> to<00:01:57.000> use<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.539> skills

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
situation where I have to use the skills

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.730 
situation where I have to use the skills
in<00:01:58.110> an<00:01:58.619> emergency<00:01:59.060> I<00:02:00.060> am<00:02:01.049> less<00:02:01.229> likely<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.649> get
