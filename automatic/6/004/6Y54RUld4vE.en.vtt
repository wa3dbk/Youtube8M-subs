going<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.880> start<00:00:09.150> off<00:00:09.269> by<00:00:09.300> wedging<00:00:09.809> my<00:00:09.960> clay

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
going to start off by wedging my clay

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.879 
going to start off by wedging my clay
make<00:00:12.059> sure<00:00:12.300> it's<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.630> nice<00:00:12.809> smooth<00:00:13.230> even

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
make sure it's a nice smooth even

make sure it's a nice smooth even
mixture<00:00:15.020> and<00:00:16.020> then<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.330> would<00:00:18.330> take<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.480> small

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
mixture and then I would take a small

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.230 
mixture and then I would take a small
amount<00:00:19.189> and<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.310> would<00:00:20.460> shape<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.880> into<00:00:21.029> a

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
amount and I would shape it into a

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.519 
amount and I would shape it into a
carrot<00:00:21.900> shaped<00:00:22.439> coil<00:00:23.090> now<00:00:24.090> I'm<00:00:24.930> going<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.350> show

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
carrot shaped coil now I'm going to show

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.810 
carrot shaped coil now I'm going to show
you<00:00:25.590> how<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.859> make<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> handle<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
you how to make a handle that is a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.359 
you how to make a handle that is a
pre-made<00:00:29.820> bent<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:31.619> allow<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.250> get

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
pre-made bent and we allow it to get

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.280 
pre-made bent and we allow it to get
weather<00:00:32.550> hard<00:00:32.820> before<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.510> attach<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.140> as

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
weather hard before we attach it as

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.500 
weather hard before we attach it as
opposed<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.309> there<00:00:35.579> are<00:00:35.700> other<00:00:35.850> methods<00:00:36.120> where

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
opposed to there are other methods where

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.709 
opposed to there are other methods where
you<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.780> use<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.950> make<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> handle<00:00:38.670> directly<00:00:39.510> on

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
you can use to make a handle directly on

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.889 
you can use to make a handle directly on
a<00:00:39.780> mug<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.800> pull<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> beginner

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
a mug and pull it but for a beginner

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.150 
a mug and pull it but for a beginner
this<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.710> nice<00:00:43.950> way<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:45.120> learn<00:00:45.469> so<00:00:46.469> I'm<00:00:46.739> going

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
this is a nice way to learn so I'm going

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.830 
this is a nice way to learn so I'm going
to<00:00:47.190> make<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:48.590> handle<00:00:49.670> by<00:00:50.670> again<00:00:51.059> making<00:00:51.690> a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
to make a handle by again making a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.760 
to make a handle by again making a
carrot<00:00:52.879> kind<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.969> shape<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:55.230> if<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.469> gently

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
carrot kind of shape and if you gently

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.500 
carrot kind of shape and if you gently
twist<00:00:56.100> those<00:00:56.309> ends<00:00:56.640> opposite<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.180> helps<00:00:57.390> you

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
twist those ends opposite it helps you

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.389 
twist those ends opposite it helps you
to<00:00:57.600> keep<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.899> somewhat<00:00:58.260> round<00:01:00.590> if<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:02.250> are

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
to keep it somewhat round if you are

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.780 
to keep it somewhat round if you are
making<00:01:02.960> handles<00:01:03.960> for<00:01:04.199> say<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.589> two<00:01:04.890> cups<00:01:05.460> I

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
making handles for say like two cups I

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.469 
making handles for say like two cups I
would<00:01:06.330> do<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> minimum<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.080> say<00:01:07.850> three<00:01:08.850> handles

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
would do a minimum of say three handles

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.390 
would do a minimum of say three handles
three<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.930> four<00:01:10.110> handles<00:01:10.500> because<00:01:10.890> inevitably

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
three to four handles because inevitably

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.330 
three to four handles because inevitably
you<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:12.140> one<00:01:13.140> or<00:01:13.290> two<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.770> are<00:01:13.920> better<00:01:14.070> than

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
you have one or two that are better than

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.179 
you have one or two that are better than
the<00:01:14.580> others<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.990> my<00:01:16.140> students<00:01:16.799> always

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the others so for my students always

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.910 
the others so for my students always
make<00:01:17.850> extra<00:01:18.030> handles

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.260 

once<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.640> get<00:01:23.700> my<00:01:24.480> carrot<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:26.010> made<00:01:26.280> then<00:01:27.030> I'm

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
once I get my carrot it's made then I'm

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.480

use those plastic trays that are in the
classroom<00:03:58.040> or<00:03:58.430> you<00:03:58.579> can<00:03:58.730> use<00:03:58.909> a<00:03:58.939> plastic<00:03:59.719> bag

classroom or you can use a plastic bag
just<00:04:00.680> don't<00:04:00.980> put<00:04:01.189> it<00:04:01.280> directly<00:04:01.400> on<00:04:01.760> wood<00:04:02.139> now

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
just don't put it directly on wood now

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.199 
just don't put it directly on wood now
already<00:04:03.590> you<00:04:03.799> can<00:04:03.950> see<00:04:04.099> this<00:04:04.280> one<00:04:04.519> is<00:04:04.760> not<00:04:05.000> so

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
already you can see this one is not so

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.970 
already you can see this one is not so
desirable<00:04:05.599> because<00:04:06.139> it<00:04:06.260> has<00:04:06.409> a<00:04:06.439> couple<00:04:06.650> chunks

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
desirable because it has a couple chunks

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.240 
desirable because it has a couple chunks
there<00:04:07.280> I<00:04:07.430> might<00:04:08.060> be<00:04:08.239> able<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:08.540> fix<00:04:08.719> that<00:04:09.219> with<00:04:10.219> a

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
there I might be able to fix that with a

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.030 
there I might be able to fix that with a
little<00:04:10.459> bit<00:04:10.579> of<00:04:10.730> water<00:04:10.909> here<00:04:11.949> kind<00:04:12.949> of

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
little bit of water here kind of

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.170 
little bit of water here kind of
pressing<00:04:13.459> it<00:04:13.579> with<00:04:13.699> my<00:04:13.849> foam<00:04:14.150> on<00:04:14.389> the<00:04:14.510> side

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
pressing it with my foam on the side

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.580 
pressing it with my foam on the side
there<00:04:17.180> we<00:04:17.269> go

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:28.559 

that<00:04:21.590> looks<00:04:21.739> much<00:04:21.920> better<00:04:21.980> already

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.460 

okay

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
okay

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.620 
okay
and<00:04:30.980> that's<00:04:31.190> how<00:04:31.370> you<00:04:31.430> make<00:04:31.670> a<00:04:31.700> fake<00:04:32.180> pulled

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
and that's how you make a fake pulled

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.200 
and that's how you make a fake pulled
handle
