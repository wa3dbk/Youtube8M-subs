00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.360
Buddy.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.880
Wake up already.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.860
We have the painting.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.060
Do you remember the meeting point?

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.280
We're already on our way.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.560
Good. I'll be here with the other half of the money.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.300
Give it gas!

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.880
...the painting "Painting III" from the known Spanish-French artist Marcel Rodrigueras, was stolen today in broad daylight by at least 3 heavily armed robbers...

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.260
The artist, living in our country since the Second Spanish Civil War in 1981,  is considered one of the most influential characters on today's artistic landscape.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.040
The painting is part of his known series "Paintings", thanks to which he gained global recognition.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.960
...the popularity of this specific piece suggest that the hit might have been hired by a private party--

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.100
You are literally retarded

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.360
Maybe it's not that big of a deal.
We could just glue it together.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.600
And you are even more retarded than him.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.120
First of all, I'm gonna call our contact, who said he'd be here already.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.420
Doesn't answer.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.740
What the fuck do you mean with that?

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.560
He simply doesn't pick up the phone.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.600
Do you find it funny, you cunt?

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.040
We just lost half a million--

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.300
-Calm your nipples.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.940
Yeah, of course I'm gonna calm down.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.700
With a stolen painting known by all of the country, broken, and the guy who gave us the job missing

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.980
Put the gun down.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.160
You are fucking out of your mind!

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.560
Drop it!

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.600
Aw, shucks

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.420
That's what I get for working with idiots

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.600
Actually I'm not even mad.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.420
And thus concluded the inauguration of the Austro-Hungarian Contemporary Arts convention

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.620
With the shocking revealing of the painting "Painting III", a study about violence and human greed...

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.700
...by hand of the renowned painter Marcel Rodrigueras.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.780
Yeah, well, what's a better way of displaying that idea than hiring 3 sociopaths and making them kill each other for a snuff film?

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.880
Shortly after, painter Sushuosne delighted the audience with an interesting performance--

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.940
This is the life!

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:37.300
No matter what I do, critics love it. I should try shitting on a can just to see if someone said something.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.180
Who would have said that in 20 years I'd come to see such progress in the world of painting.
