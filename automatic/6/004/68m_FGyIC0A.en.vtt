00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.040
 xbox conference of the last e3 2013 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.200
 where they passed a trailer that showed the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.969
 master boss walking on a planet 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.250
 where the environment looks like a desert 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.440
 like ice or snow eye this is my 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.690
 opinion if I'm wrong can you tell me in 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.090
 the comments hehe following with the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.399
 video the boss is walking with 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.320
 a layer when suddenly from the inside 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.239
 from the ground, what appears to be a 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.550
 Sphinx of War Ford Runner will be 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.410
 can see the master chief holding what 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.539
 that seems to be the cortana chip the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.460
 boss turns to the sphinx after what 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.619
 which in the end after that comes the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.750
 name of gilo although if they are fixed between 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.180
 the clouds formed the number 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.520
 this is due to the fact that initially 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.890
 was going to show the full title but it 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.960
 decided to remove the 5 to keep the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.620
 emotion of the fans in the game time 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.020
 then a little before the a-3 2014 it 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.940
 published an image of the game where 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.880
 confirmed the true title of the game 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.770
 called halo 5 guardians above 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.500
 name you can see a new character 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.510
 which is a spartan 4 wielding a rifle 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.610
 of battle and under the name can be 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.010
 see the master chief holding a rifle 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.740
 of assault finally came the day of the 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.840
 a-3 2014 where three four three 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.210
 industries gave us more details about 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.340
 the five guardians showing us a 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.110
 new trailer where we can see the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.539
 master chief in the mission of the station 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.610
 cairo when the master boss goes out to 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.890
 space to return to the covenant 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.080
 subwave but soon you can see 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.180
 which is a recording of the master boss in 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.910
 the event of the cairo station which 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.920
 is being seen by the new spark the 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.960
 which was revealed to be an agent to 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.119
 look like oni since in the picture 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.950
 where you saw it for the first time you could 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.170
 see the sign of the oni in his armor 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.090
 Following the trailer he 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.550
 know the name of the sparta in which 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.319
 is james which is in a kind 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.660
 of the room where I was watching the 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.790
 recording of the master boss when he flips 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.530
 towards the window in your viewer you can 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.750
 see that the inquisitor is also there 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.450

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.830
 the trailer we could see a base in the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.959
 space where the team spartans 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.390

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.310

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.650
 of this new way of playing one of 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.660
 they are spartan eye skills 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.790
 these skills are not the same as 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.920

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.989

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.290

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.850
 Spartan skills will return those of 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.370

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.040
