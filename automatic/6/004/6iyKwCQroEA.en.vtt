00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.720
 you hear the new diesel v8 in porsche 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.720
 cayenne 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.350
 with this new 42 liter biturbo v8 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.450
 motor Advanced tied cayenne be 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.000
 diesel offer during the known 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.340
 cayenne diesel with smaller v6 engine 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.830
 for best efficiency if possible 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.380
 athletic performance is demonstrated 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.970
 the new cayenne s diesel maximum 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.730
 sportiness at the highest possible 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.680
 Outwardly, efficiency is different 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.220
 the new in this program hardly of 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.220
 his brothers 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.050
 at the front, however, is newest 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.540
 technique retired sitting in the apron 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.670
 a radar sensor that measures the distance 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.230
 the rule tempomat with appropriate 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.060
 data and so on 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.790
 warn of rear-end collisions 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.530
 Even the tail seems familiar there wearing 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.450
 the new the known cayenne s 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.809
 Lettering we already from gasoline 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.809
 know 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.990
 but that it's the diesel 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.009
 The small version deals with this 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.009
 Lettering on the side 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:25.180
 at the look under the sheet metal dress shows 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.180
 the new 4 2 liter turbo v8 engine 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.610
 he offers the v6 diesel significantly 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.730
 performance around it this power of 283 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.540
 kilowatts and turns of 850 meters 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.530
 is an eight-cylinder diesel and in the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.410
 six-cylinder diesel we have 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.210
 of 180 kilos and 550 newton meters 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.490
 ie it this much higher 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.770
 positioned as the base model v6 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.390
 diesel 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.550
 But there are also similarities 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.680
 to be switched to the smaller brother 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.080
 both via an eight-speed tiptronic s 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.130
 automatic and both have 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.740
 start-stop function as standard on board 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.320
 It helps to save fuel so that the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.420
 cayenne s diesel only cuts 8.3 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.760
 liter on 100 kilometers should need 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.650
 but who the industries feel 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.340
 the high torque he loves comes 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.340
 fast on more 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.000
 in four-wheel drive, however 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.360
 differ the diesel and the as 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.360
 diesel 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.030
 in the cayenne s this so-called 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.200
 Schengen system means we drive 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.180
 mainly about in the axis and 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.540
 switches electronically controlled lamella 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.550
 the front axle to the v6 diesel have 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.950
 we post a transfer case that 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.710
 purely mechanically controlled have the 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.300
 possibility for the sds rather the lamella 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.060
 individually the distribution to the front 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.040
 adjust 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.290
 this flexible all-wheel-drive system comes too 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.120
 at the new carrera 4 for use 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.010
 in normal operation underlined the hack 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.880
 Stressed drive the sportiness of the 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.230
 cayenne s diesel on more difficult and 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.000
 distribute more demanding underground 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.390
 the forces depending on need to all 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.390
 four wheels 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.230
 that it is also on rough ground 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.280
 Comfort remains to ensure active 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.280
 damper and air suspension 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.400
 even with this career it is this 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.570
 the landing gear beyond any doubt 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.270
 air suspension can be really good 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.910
 drive through the country at motor must 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.690
 one say this is 4.2 liters v8 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.070
 bÃ¤renstark 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.860
 he makes 280 kw or 3 182 ps and the 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.630
 850 newton meters allow constant 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:49.120
 Acceleration up to a top speed 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:51.850
 of 252 the interior encloses its 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.080
 Passengers as usual with so much noble 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.090
 material that even high 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.850
 speeds thanks to the increased 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.360
 sitting position like gentle gliding 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.360
 appear 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.160
 hmm 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.090
 at the touch of a button, the driver can 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.990
 damper and the athlete in the 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.120
 same basin 

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:24.380
 the pressure on the sports button increases that 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.380
 responsiveness of the motor 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.970
 No one needs so much power 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.190
 unless you see one 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.530
 German cayenne s this one 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.960
 Horse trailer or a big ship 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.020
 then you need torque power in 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.820
 all areas and if you now the 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.490
 choice would have been between a cayenne s 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.930
 petrol or a cayenne s diesel for 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.470
 which would be from Vollmer 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.470
 decide 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:58.869
 that depends on where I live 

00:04:55.989 --> 00:05:00.580
 the title is the main topic of the 

00:04:58.869 --> 00:05:02.409
 meet as the ones sold in europe 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.309
 America is a strong auto market has 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:08.110
 sell v8 gasoline diesel cayenne s 

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:10.089
 So diesel is mainly for the 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.389
 friends strong drives in europe 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:12.389
 thought
