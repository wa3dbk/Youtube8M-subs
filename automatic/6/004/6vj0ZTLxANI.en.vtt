00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
going to look like personally I think

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.450 
going to look like personally I think
I'm<00:00:48.719> starting<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.140> lean<00:00:49.379> towards<00:00:49.770> cyborg<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
I'm starting to lean towards cyborg a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.459 
I'm starting to lean towards cyborg a
little<00:00:50.760> bit<00:00:50.879> more<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:51.449> rather<00:00:51.750> than<00:00:51.989> dragon

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
little bit more now rather than dragon

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.319 
little bit more now rather than dragon
but<00:00:52.590> they<00:00:52.649> both<00:00:52.890> look<00:00:53.190> super<00:00:53.610> super<00:00:53.760> cool<00:00:54.149> I

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
but they both look super super cool I

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.479 
but they both look super super cool I
think<00:00:54.809> comic<00:00:55.170> book<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.469> cyborg<00:00:55.949> may<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.250> my

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
think comic book and cyborg may be my

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.979
