00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.320 
that loss in January so from a stylistic
standpoint<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.830> think<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:08.190> fight<00:03:08.430> it's<00:03:08.670> it's

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
standpoint I think this fight it's it's

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.540 
standpoint I think this fight it's it's
a<00:03:09.420> very<00:03:09.450> winnable<00:03:10.020> fight<00:03:10.170> for<00:03:10.650> miles<00:03:10.830> jury<00:03:11.220> and

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
a very winnable fight for miles jury and

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.310 
a very winnable fight for miles jury and
Edson<00:03:11.850> Barboza<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:12.540> thought<00:03:12.990> looked<00:03:13.170> pretty

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
Edson Barboza I thought looked pretty

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.960 
Edson Barboza I thought looked pretty
flat<00:03:13.620> against<00:03:13.890> Michael<00:03:14.190> Johnson<00:03:14.640> so<00:03:14.760> both<00:03:14.940> of

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
flat against Michael Johnson so both of

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.520 
flat against Michael Johnson so both of
them<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.330> think<00:03:15.390> are<00:03:15.630> correcting<00:03:16.110> issues<00:03:16.380> from

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
them I think are correcting issues from

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.720 
them I think are correcting issues from
their<00:03:16.650> last<00:03:16.800> fight<00:03:17.010> sure<00:03:17.160> but<00:03:17.370> at<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.550> same

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
their last fight sure but at the same

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.850 
their last fight sure but at the same
time<00:03:17.910> I<00:03:18.090> like<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:18.780> fight<00:03:19.020> I<00:03:19.050> think<00:03:19.320> Barbosa

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
time I like this fight I think Barbosa

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.410 
time I like this fight I think Barbosa

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.730 
I think for tyron woodley sees a path to
the<00:04:33.360> title<00:04:33.720> and<00:04:33.870> he's<00:04:34.110> gonna<00:04:34.260> take<00:04:34.440> fights

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
the title and he's gonna take fights

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.470 
the title and he's gonna take fights
that<00:04:34.920> are<00:04:34.980> gonna<00:04:35.190> get<00:04:35.430> him<00:04:35.520> that<00:04:36.000> much<00:04:36.210> closer

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
that are gonna get him that much closer

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.180 
that are gonna get him that much closer
very<00:04:36.870> true<00:04:37.200> and<00:04:37.230> there's<00:04:37.830> something<00:04:38.040> that's

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
very true and there's something that's

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.790 
very true and there's something that's
probably<00:04:38.639> not<00:04:38.940> said<00:04:39.389> that<00:04:40.020> that's<00:04:40.560> a

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
probably not said that that's a

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.500 
probably not said that that's a
difficult<00:04:41.010> fight<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.850> talking<00:04:42.210> about<00:04:42.330> Jake

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
difficult fight you talking about Jake

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.970 
difficult fight you talking about Jake
Ellenberger<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:43.169> where<00:04:43.320> he<00:04:43.500> is<00:04:43.680> right<00:04:43.950> now

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
Ellenberger and where he is right now

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.310 
Ellenberger and where he is right now
Jake<00:04:44.700> Ellenberger<00:04:44.910> when<00:04:45.450> he<00:04:45.630> is<00:04:45.750> on<00:04:45.960> can

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
Jake Ellenberger when he is on can

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.980 
Jake Ellenberger when he is on can
compete<00:04:46.650> with<00:04:46.710> anybody<00:04:47.370> ranked<00:04:48.330> in<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.450> top<00:04:48.720> 5

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
compete with anybody ranked in the top 5

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.320 
compete with anybody ranked in the top 5
and<00:04:49.020> top<00:04:49.290> 10<00:04:49.710> he's<00:04:49.889> athletic<00:04:50.040> he's<00:04:50.550> explosive

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
and top 10 he's athletic he's explosive

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.480

he<00:04:51.660> has<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:51.990> background<00:04:52.470> sometimes<00:04:52.800> we've

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
he has the background sometimes we've

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.460 
he has the background sometimes we've
just<00:04:53.790> seen<00:04:53.940> it<00:04:54.150> seems<00:04:54.480> to<00:04:54.720> be<00:04:54.810> a<00:04:54.840> mental<00:04:55.260> issue

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
just seen it seems to be a mental issue

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.250 
just seen it seems to be a mental issue
but<00:04:55.860> when<00:04:56.010> Jake<00:04:56.280> Ellenberger<00:04:56.550> is<00:04:57.090> on<00:04:57.419> he<00:04:58.080> is<00:04:58.110> a

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
but when Jake Ellenberger is on he is a

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.960 
but when Jake Ellenberger is on he is a
Hellion<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:58.919> so<00:04:59.040> for<00:04:59.280> tyron<00:04:59.610> woodley<00:04:59.640> it's

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
Hellion and so for tyron woodley it's

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.130 
Hellion and so for tyron woodley it's
like<00:05:00.090> well<00:05:00.210> I<00:05:00.330> don't<00:05:00.600> know<00:05:00.720> what<00:05:00.900> Jake

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
like well I don't know what Jake

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.960 
like well I don't know what Jake
Ellenberger<00:05:01.350> is<00:05:01.740> gonna<00:05:01.890> show<00:05:02.100> up<00:05:02.280> it<00:05:02.520> would<00:05:02.940> be

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
Ellenberger is gonna show up it would be

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.120 
Ellenberger is gonna show up it would be
terrible<00:05:03.630> if<00:05:03.780> I<00:05:04.169> get<00:05:04.350> the<00:05:04.470> very<00:05:04.650> good<00:05:04.919> Jake

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
terrible if I get the very good Jake

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.680 
terrible if I get the very good Jake
Ellenberger<00:05:05.310> and<00:05:05.730> he<00:05:05.820> kind<00:05:06.000> of<00:05:06.060> pulls<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.480> rug

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
Ellenberger and he kind of pulls the rug

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.070 
Ellenberger and he kind of pulls the rug
out<00:05:06.720> of<00:05:07.440> my<00:05:07.620> shot<00:05:08.160> to<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.600> 175<00:05:09.600> pounds<00:05:09.930> yeah<00:05:10.050> a

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
out of my shot to the 175 pounds yeah a

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.290 
out of my shot to the 175 pounds yeah a
70<00:05:10.500> pound<00:05:10.680> championship<00:05:11.220> so<00:05:11.400> it<00:05:11.790> makes<00:05:12.060> sense

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
70 pound championship so it makes sense

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.610 
70 pound championship so it makes sense
why<00:05:12.540> you<00:05:12.570> wouldn't<00:05:12.960> want<00:05:13.080> to<00:05:13.140> take<00:05:13.260> this<00:05:13.410> fight

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
why you wouldn't want to take this fight

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.840 
why you wouldn't want to take this fight
because<00:05:13.800> ellenberger<00:05:14.310> is<00:05:14.370> a<00:05:14.430> tough<00:05:14.640> fight<00:05:14.820> for

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
because ellenberger is a tough fight for

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.630 
because ellenberger is a tough fight for
anybody<00:05:15.240> UFC<00:05:15.870> 189<00:05:16.260> it<00:05:16.590> probably<00:05:17.310> will<00:05:17.460> turn

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
anybody UFC 189 it probably will turn

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.130 
anybody UFC 189 it probably will turn
out<00:05:17.760> to<00:05:17.790> be<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.120> most<00:05:18.270> purchased<00:05:18.810> UFC

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
number one it's probably gonna be number
