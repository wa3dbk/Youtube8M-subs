00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.390 

so<00:00:06.090> you're<00:00:06.420> making<00:00:06.570> water<00:00:07.350> out<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:07.650> thin<00:00:07.980> air

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
so you're making water out of thin air

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.220 
so you're making water out of thin air
and<00:00:08.520> water<00:00:08.730> out<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:08.910> thin<00:00:09.030> air<00:00:09.180> so<00:00:09.960> we've<00:00:10.080> got

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
and water out of thin air so we've got

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.010 
and water out of thin air so we've got
an<00:00:10.290> endless<00:00:10.590> supply<00:00:11.240> the<00:00:12.240> water<00:00:12.600> in<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.020 
an endless supply the water in the

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.629 
an endless supply the water in the
atmosphere<00:00:13.320> there's<00:00:14.160> eight<00:00:14.309> times<00:00:14.520> more

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
atmosphere there's eight times more

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.460 
atmosphere there's eight times more
water<00:00:14.789> in<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.240> atmosphere<00:00:15.270> and<00:00:15.930> then<00:00:16.350> there

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
water in the atmosphere and then there

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.210 
water in the atmosphere and then there
isn't<00:00:16.740> all<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.920> rivers<00:00:18.289> 4.3<00:00:19.289> liters<00:00:19.650> per<00:00:20.070> hour

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
isn't all the rivers 4.3 liters per hour

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.180 
isn't all the rivers 4.3 liters per hour
in<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.940> room<00:00:21.240> yeah<00:00:22.050> which<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.350> thirty-nine

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.190 
in this room yeah which is thirty-nine

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.040 
in this room yeah which is thirty-nine
percent<00:00:23.370> relative<00:00:23.700> humidity<00:00:24.390> okay<00:00:24.870> and

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
percent relative humidity okay and

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.540 
percent relative humidity okay and
that's<00:00:25.230> very<00:00:25.440> that's<00:00:25.770> very<00:00:25.920> low<00:00:26.310> relative

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
that's very that's very low relative

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.270 
that's very that's very low relative
humidity<00:00:26.790> think<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:28.050> ambient<00:00:28.770> air<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.250> it

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.280 
humidity think the ambient air so it

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.820 
humidity think the ambient air so it
does<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.670> atmosphere<00:00:30.210> Americans<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
does the atmosphere Americans in the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.049 
does the atmosphere Americans in the
system<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:33.000> goes<00:00:33.210> through<00:00:33.540> into<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> patented

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
system it goes through into a patented

patent<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.270> device

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.690 

once<00:00:48.200> the<00:00:48.350> water<00:00:48.530> condenses<00:00:49.070> on<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:49.280> coil<00:00:49.520> it

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
once the water condenses on the coil it

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.670 
once the water condenses on the coil it
comes<00:00:49.910> out<00:00:50.030> of<00:00:50.090> the<00:00:50.210> coil

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
comes out of the coil

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.500 
comes out of the coil
or<00:00:52.070> off<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.280> coil<00:00:52.670> a<00:00:52.880> new<00:00:52.940> little<00:00:53.300> reservoir

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
or off the coil a new little reservoir

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.620 
or off the coil a new little reservoir
gets<00:00:54.020> pumped<00:00:54.320> up<00:00:54.440> into<00:00:54.710> a<00:00:54.740> carbon<00:00:55.130> filter

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
gets pumped up into a carbon filter

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.670 
gets pumped up into a carbon filter
comes<00:00:56.630> through<00:00:56.810> the<00:00:56.930> carbon<00:00:57.230> filter<00:00:57.500> just

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
comes through the carbon filter just

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.680 
comes through the carbon filter just
gravity<00:00:58.040> feed<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:58.970> then<00:00:59.120> goes<00:00:59.390> through<00:00:59.660> a

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
gravity feed and then goes through a

so<00:03:10.630> what<00:03:11.050> we<00:03:11.230> have<00:03:11.440> is

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
so what we have is

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.800 
so what we have is
illusion<00:03:12.280> where<00:03:12.610> we<00:03:12.940> made<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.150> device<00:03:13.510> that

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
illusion where we made a device that

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.630 
illusion where we made a device that
installs<00:03:14.470> into<00:03:14.800> a<00:03:14.830> light<00:03:15.010> fixture<00:03:15.160> well<00:03:15.550> in

installs into a light fixture well in

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.670 
installs into a light fixture well in
five<00:03:15.849> minutes<00:03:16.060> it's<00:03:16.300> very<00:03:16.510> simple<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:17.470> thing

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
five minutes it's very simple the thing

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.900 
five minutes it's very simple the thing
that's<00:03:17.830> really<00:03:17.980> expensive<00:03:18.220> about<00:03:18.670> adding

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
that's really expensive about adding

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.400 
that's really expensive about adding
lighting<00:03:19.209> controls<00:03:19.569> is<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:19.870> you<00:03:20.019> typically

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
lighting controls is that you typically

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.830 
lighting controls is that you typically
have<00:03:20.530> to<00:03:20.680> run<00:03:20.830> control<00:03:21.220> wiring<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:22.390> each<00:03:22.540> light

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
have to run control wiring to each light

fixture in our case we're using wireless
RF<00:03:26.280> communications<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.519> once<00:03:28.239> we've<00:03:28.450> added

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
RF communications and once we've added

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.540 
RF communications and once we've added
that<00:03:28.900> digital<00:03:29.230> communications<00:03:29.920> we<00:03:30.280> can<00:03:30.430> do

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
that digital communications we can do

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.550

any kind of control on the lights we can

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.410 
any kind of control on the lights we can
upload<00:03:32.890> a<00:03:32.950> schedule<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.760> eat<00:03:33.910> each<00:03:34.209> light

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
upload a schedule to eat each light

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.809 
upload a schedule to eat each light
fixture<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.170> not<00:03:35.860> only<00:03:35.980> can<00:03:36.250> we<00:03:36.280> do<00:03:36.430> that<00:03:36.580> but

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
fixture and not only can we do that but

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.910
