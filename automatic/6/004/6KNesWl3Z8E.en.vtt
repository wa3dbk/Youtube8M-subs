bushing<00:00:10.590> back<00:00:10.769> there<00:00:11.330> now<00:00:12.330> are<00:00:12.360> chained<00:00:12.900> line

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
bushing back there now are chained line

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.070 
bushing back there now are chained line
is<00:00:13.290> directly<00:00:13.650> up<00:00:13.910> so<00:00:14.910> actually<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.480> short<00:00:15.809> shaft

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
is directly up so actually a short shaft

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.779 
is directly up so actually a short shaft
it<00:00:16.350> for<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.590> share<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.800> another<00:00:17.130> half<00:00:17.310> an<00:00:17.520> inch

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
it for the share of another half an inch

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.750 
it for the share of another half an inch
it<00:00:17.910> would<00:00:17.940> imperfect<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.890> put<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.220> tank<00:00:20.430> on<00:00:20.640> it

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
it would imperfect so I put a tank on it

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.900 
it would imperfect so I put a tank on it
to<00:00:21.199> say<00:00:22.199> sure<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.650> down<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.580> know<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.699> may
