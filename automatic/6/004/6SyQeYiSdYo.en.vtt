00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.990
 the parcours today declared the first time 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.670
 title I was all alone 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.500
 sebastian the camera I have you yes 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.790
 now many different moves 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.740
 taught and then I have one 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.680
 single omitted the very first 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:49.370
 actually should be able to go here 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:51.440
 then we'll look at everything again 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.570
 So you know yes and of course 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.930
 Appropriate step marks again 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.930
 participate 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.430
 talking to one or two further 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.540
 accompany 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.540
 just the best 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.590
 Well 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.290
 demir canceled 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.310
 as if here goes down the jumps 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:34.050
 main thing different about monkey ball 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:38.119
 go through the arms here are 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.119
 birth go since not 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.750
 sebastian what would happen if i did 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.310
 when synchronously my legs over the side 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.720
 and we have that extra 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.090
 Exactly I am not a freak one 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.210
 Just fix that if I am now 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.670
 Just like that, or I'll look 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:02.890
 I am actually quite good my name is 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:07.020
 That's why you talk now and then 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.369
 Just leave the arm that's how easy it is 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.830
 as soon as your legs need space around 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.980
 get through made the man makes her 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.180
 her arm makes her arm still easy 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.520
 when you look at his two but now 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.440
 on the fast and now after 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.450
 right one jumps one shifts one 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:31.000
 actually his whole weight on the 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.680
 elegance and if you do it the other way 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.510
 if you do it, you have it all 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.000
 weight on the right hand exactly at 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.360
 if you are now the whole man 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.190
 On board your judge is gone 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.350
 and your left hand is kind of like that 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.420
 then diagonally on the pole 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.410
 bangs if it is so then comes yes 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.550
 actually not really over it 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.790
 have two legs 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.070
 and they go since I over the right 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.270
 arm has to go then he will look quite 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:07.450
 actually so out of both arms my trees 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:10.209
 go down with the hand off 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.840
 Feet over it and put it on it was 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.550
 actually already 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.580
 and because it was so beautiful, we'll do it 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.610
 still us the terror remains right me 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.610
 Left 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.850
 what would be good example 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.130
 wants to make out if you are saying 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.330
 you want it then is pretty much at risk 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.100
 I'll follow her here for a while 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.320
 the lower has less space for the legs 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.540
 here , the legs have a bit 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.070
 continue to get high 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.540
 however, it is pretty easy if 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.640
 I want it over here even missing 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:44.560
 a bit off the rack 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:48.120
 All right, well then I would say 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.120
 again looking clean
