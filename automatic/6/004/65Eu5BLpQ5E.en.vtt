00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.880
 mainly in the aftermath or 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.590

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.250

 that I recommend you have this 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.789
 beautiful writing that to me the personal 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.949
 I love many people have that is 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.420
 like a little repetitive of the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.680
 writing style of tahara more and for me 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.840
 I love saying that really 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.970
 conveys the feeling of 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.050
 characters I love that book too 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.730
 has a plot or is it so interesting 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.410
 but I want to read and naismith 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.180
 mainly because I want to know with 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.650
 who is juliette ok for those who do not 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.690
 you know, I'm time warner 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.970
 it may be a fucking wretch 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.430
 but I love warner at least 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.590
 of the second book was like that and after 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.630
 to read chapter 62 of a rabuni for 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.650
 those who read a bravo know me that 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.010
 you already know what I'm 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.510
 talking 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.770
 and good if I want to know how they end 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.940
 the characters I want to know with whom 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.060
 you want jullier I want to know how 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.650
 all the rebellion that is 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.210
 happening in these books so I'm 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.040
 very excited to read this dogma 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.390
 either you also fall the end of a 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.800
 trilogy and I also want to read it 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.900
 mainly but I want to know with 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.460
 who is america the first book of 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.810
 I really liked it, it's called the 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.080
 selection but is that they have not only read 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.580
 It is quite feminine but I also think 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.050
 that some children may like it but 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.460
 do not go into these books thinking that it's going 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.869
 to be a super dystopia and that is going to 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.729
 serve that exceeds a turkey and leash 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.210
 billions and I do not know that this book is more 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.130
 well as of princesses and take and play 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.050
 with dresses and that so if they do not have 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.000
 to write only a dystopia with 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.590
 action and adventures because it is a is not what 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.390
 which is I really hope that america 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.220
 finish with 2000 prince maximum because 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.900
 I will have to do it, I despair too 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.490
 psuv exists a by means has killed in 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.350
 the first book 200 and someone this 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.710
 master although I never knew it is worth it 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.960
 up to own 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.190
 I feel subject I am very anxious 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.930
 put to be free to see here I want to 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.880
 besides I want to get it because 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.080
 have seen that cover is beautiful the 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.790
 next agent be free between one of 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.990
 glass or it does not even have title 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.060
 but I'm already surpassing those 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.830
 problems because you see that the end of the 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.740
 second book they did not leave with a 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.970
 cliffhanger and I hate you to do that 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.050
 besides that also tells you some 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.750
 revelations that I really do 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.729
 They left like in shock because I 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.110
 I thought it was going to happen what happened so 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.819
 I do want to know what happens between that 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.530
 book because really that the first and 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.390
 second book have not disappointed me have 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.980
 been very very good and brackets not 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.980
 you have only read I recommend them if you 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.090
 like the epic fantasy go read it 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.130
 because now that I recommend them a 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.019
 heap is the next one is must upload if 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.360
 were not yesterday is the third book of 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.920
 the trilogy of the dark truth of the sea 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.810
 back and it's called the first book of 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.790
 Spanish this trilogy is characterized 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.070
 mainly in that you have a 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.140
 narrator that is not reliable or that is 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.880
 you can not be sure that what 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.920
 is still telling you is true or 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.300
 lie or if they are hallucinations there are people 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.100
 that bothered him that he was not sure 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.780
 about what was happening for me in 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.880
 Personally I loved it because it gave me a 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.140
 mystery feeling even bigger and 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.220
 although you do not believe it, there were some 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.770
 parts in which we did 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.810
 this book ok not scared that I am 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.810
 I'm going to die of fear but if I'm 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.160
 as well as with chills and that 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.630
 because there are scenes that are pretty kuyt 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.130
 and in the second book they left us with 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.330
 huge cliff hanger so I'm super 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.740
 idle to know what will happen in the 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.360
 third book the next to the sad 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.890
 book of the series of drivers there are like 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.120
 by sea and without stopping the plot these 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.650
 books speed in different what 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.170
 I usually find in literature 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.900
 juvenile plus that even though yes 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.520
 has a little bit of romance that does not dull 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.810
 the main plot of the book but to 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.370
 Sometimes what I'm reading happens to me 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.709
 something super interesting suddenly 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.890
 they find the love of their life and the plot 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.090
 you forget it stays by the bottom so 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.530
 in this book, that does not happen 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.700
 the prince these books cost me a 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.800
 little read it because it has management 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.180
 writing a little different so there's 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.010
 that take a few pages to 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.470
 be able to get used to that but after 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.330
 that's what I flew through these books 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.980
 because you will see that they were very very good 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.959
 true that there are some characters that I 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.370
 they love and yes I am very excited 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.750
 for this book so I want to know already 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.490
 what will happen in this in the 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.290
 next is charlotte round by 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.420
 jennifer news in the third of the 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.709
 false prince series this series me 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.320
 I like it a lot because even though it is 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.400
 intended for younger readers who 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.799
 I 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.260
 14 years old, I still like it a lot because 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.640
 does not have a super simple plot and if the 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.980
 writing of these books is pretty 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.360
 good and the plot is even better I like 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.159
 very much the main character and I like 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.439
 quite the address with which it is 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.420
 taking the author this series reminds me 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.370
 a little bit to the demon king series for 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.750
 sindeu the maxim a series of fantasy 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.310
 epic that is my true favorites 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.900
 if they are not read they are also 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.729
 I recommend a series that I love 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.989
 but yes good returning to the subject and the 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.419
 last book of center this book of the 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.160
 series dedicated color fail tim frank 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.650
 will make these very thorny series of the 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.270
 series they gave you fail a series that to 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.289
 Although it was not perfect because the 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.669
 two first books was a little bit 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.530
 weak and the main protagonists 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.870
 a little frustrating those first two 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.430
 books was evolving to the point 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.960
 that I really liked it and I liked it 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.850
 he wanted to read this series of those 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.500
 I'm talking to you they saw bacon 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.389
 will enjoy in this series we have a 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.400
 main character so it's 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.770
 quite refreshing to be able to read about the 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.970
 male point of view because the 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.099
 female protagonists can be a 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.720
 a little frustrating and desperate 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.370
 they have to admit what they want 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.760
 know that girls can be a 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.890
 bit 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.750
 and I'm really excited about 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.250
 read this book I really like the 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.370
 writer as it has here Braque 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.740
 awarded to improved as an author in these 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.420
 books feels very different to being 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.740
 original and you did not like the 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.690
 books that really original steel
