00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.199

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.800
 welcome, I am Miguel, as I said 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.210
 I put that name to AlfÃ s, wait 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.430
 you forget me 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.099
 if I forgot, there is also my 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.860
 assistant of the Maria channel did you know that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.430
 You were going to say this but well it's good

 follow them with this what news 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.410
 Now that you were going to say this news 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.180
 of today when we were like this in 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.030
 this what news I am going to present 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.820
 of why windows xp will die in few 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.460
 days what I want to say that it's over 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.899
 the support for windows xp on April 8 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.530
 of 2014 as well as windows xp of 32 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.250
 bits as well as 64-bit and the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.049
 date is confirmed according to microsoft 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.070
 before talking about the reason we'll talk 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.500
 of this mini windows xp analysis 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.829
 windows xp is 12 years old to the majority of 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.520
 the users use this system windows 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:20.310
 xp launched on October 25, 2001 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.759
 the support of zerbi pack 1 launched on 9 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.729
 November 2002 and ended on 10 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.280
 October 2006 later launched the 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.280
 service pack 2 update on 6 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.549
 August 2004 and ended on 13 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.829
 July 2010 and finally the service 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.130
 pack 3 that everyone uses to most of the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.319
 people was released on May 6 , 2008 and 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.189
 ends as I told you on April 8 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:50.250
 of 2014 and it would be a historic farewell 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.590
 since windows xp had 12 years using 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.840
 this system in my opinion because it has 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.689
 maximum performance to improve the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.299
 speed up on my computer that I have 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.479
 has 12 processes that do close the 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.459
 unnecessary applications I can also 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.640
 open classic programs and games 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:11.009
 windows 95 and without problems included the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.110
 portable programs since the version of 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.019
 windows 7 and 8 bring problems of 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.290
 incompatibility and 64 - bit worse 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.210
 as the game ihop in country 1 and 2 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.000
 It has bad colors 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.980
 or also the portable text that you 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.670
 closes unexpectedly or programs 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.470
 of third parties and so on is this happening 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.350
 in windows 7 with the problems of 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.530
 incompatibility since windows xp takes 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.750
 no problems or unexpected closures 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.780
 Now I'm going to tell you the reasons why 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.240
 windows xp will die these days let me 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.110
 talk about the reason it 's okay Maria with 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.270
 taste that you do number 1 windows xp 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.030
 is more than 12 years old since they created 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.700
 this operating system since 2001 and 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.090
 will die in 2014 as the date says 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.700
 No. 2 shipping systems 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.160
 operatives like windows 7 and windows 8 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.070
 they are the ones who use the most in the latter 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.680
 four years since windows xp is falling 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.410
 slowly sales and use of 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.890
 equipment to users around the world 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.920
 in my personal opinion number 3 the 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.600
 updates to return from 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.370
 it will end in a sweet custard since 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.010
 this operating system can the 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.690
 generational god and now windows 7 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.730
 windows 8 are the newest number 4 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.430
 if there will be updates of 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.490
 windows xp can happen winds of 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.490
 bring you hacker virus speed watts 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:44.160
 trojan and so on and finally the number 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.380
 5 driver updates 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.380
 visual basic de industrales net 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.020
 framework directx etcetera also 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.750
 would paralyze in the support of windows xp 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.200
 also in my personal opinion so 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.940
 if they continue using windows xp not 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.430
 it means that you are never going to 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.980
 learn or if it appears windows xp has 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.040
 expired will close the system or other 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.880
 boludeces xd the this does not affect the 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.400
 operating system my current team 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.340
 what is affected are the threats of 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.430
 virus 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:22.820
 etc well now we go for the questions 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:27.020
 of today varied questions and I 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:31.310
 I will answer good Maria answer me 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:34.910
 questions question number one scared 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:38.180
 windows xp or you have windows 7 or 8 such 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.970
 as I said I keep using windows xp and not 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.300
 I'll change anything like that on windows 7 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.900
 or 8 are also faster because 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.379
 I have 21 4 fingers, 80 gigahertz points and 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.440
 2 gigabytes and I can also play and open 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:57.680
 classic programs of windows 95 and 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.500
 portable programs question number 2 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.900
 because windows xp is the best system 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.810
 for its performance and comparing with 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.930
 windows 7 and the 8 good in its performance 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.880
 windows xp is the fastest for pc 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.949
 old when I close applications 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.440
 unnecessary in the manager 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.870
 tasks and it leaves me up to 12 processes 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.810
 open which occupies 100 megabytes of 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.509
 memory when installing windows 7 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.870
 had more than 30 open processes and 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:29.180
 it occupied 350 megabytes of memory that 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.610
 headache closed the processes 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.560
 unnecessary and left me like 20 processes 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.650
 although it supports the direct 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.590
 11 and 12 since windows xp supports 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:42.020
 until the direct 9 also in windows 7 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.800
 have incompatibility problems like 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.900
 classic and portable games and programs 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.970
 with respect to windows 8 what does not 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.620
 like are the menus beginnings and the one of 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.290
 incompatibility of programs and games 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.080
 from windows 95 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:59.570
 so windows xp was the best that yes 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.980
 in my personal opinion and also for 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:06.500
 those who have an old pc 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.210
 windows xp analyze the support too 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.250
 Games and Applications 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.770
 hundreds of people will also be made 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.720
 the accounting can be that also 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.600
 will stop launching applications 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.690
 third for windows xp this happens with 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.930
 adobe cs 6 sony vegas microsoft office 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:26.330
 2013 etcetera that only works with 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.669
 windows 7 and 8 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.099
 the only thing that has third-party support 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:34.370
 are the browsers firefox and chrome 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:36.620
 brookings torrent etcetera let's hope that 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:40.040
 do not happen in this too although only 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:42.770
 will leave windows updates xp 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.410
 last question be the majority of 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:48.620
 Latin America or just induces xp in these 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:51.320
 last years the equator in the premises and 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:54.050
 the fibers few people boost windows xp 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.480
 for games and the internet because to the 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:59.330
 most use windows 7 and at the same time 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.790
 windows 8 do not forget to do 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.730
 comments if in your country continue to use 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:06.140
 windows xp leave your opinion in the
