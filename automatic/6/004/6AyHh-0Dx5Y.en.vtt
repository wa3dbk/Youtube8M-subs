this so he switches out the solid off
with<00:00:17.640> me<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.910> whole<00:00:18.029> game<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.359> he<00:00:18.840> ends<00:00:19.560> up

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
with me the whole game and he ends up

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.370 
with me the whole game and he ends up
using<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:20.130> because<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.520> tried<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.900> actually

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
using it because I tried to actually

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.259 
using it because I tried to actually
switch<00:00:22.740> my<00:00:22.920> gun<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.400> nasher<00:00:23.789> after<00:00:24.119> each
