00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
this rock so look at this rock right

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.850 
this rock so look at this rock right
here<00:00:32.040> jump<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.530> then<00:00:34.530> use<00:00:34.829> your

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
here jump on that and then use your

so jump then jetpack make sure you jump

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.270 
so jump then jetpack make sure you jump
and<00:00:40.050> jet<00:00:40.260> pack<00:00:40.440> but<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.800> get<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.950> perfect

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
and jet pack but you can get a perfect

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.369 
and jet pack but you can get a perfect
view<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.360> battlefield<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.290> look

view the battlefield and you can look
into<00:00:43.770> their<00:00:43.890> base<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:45.090> pretty<00:00:45.300> money<00:00:46.789> you'll

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
into their base it's pretty money you'll

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.639 
into their base it's pretty money you'll
see<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> timer<00:00:48.450> counts<00:00:48.899> down<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.379> a

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
see that the timer counts down and a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.500 
see that the timer counts down and a
thing<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.980> note<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.309> like<00:00:50.550> timer<00:00:51.149> was<00:00:51.360> at

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
thing to note is that like timer was at

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.619 
thing to note is that like timer was at
two<00:00:51.719> if<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.110> jump<00:00:52.440> back<00:00:52.649> up<00:00:53.210> so<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.390> jump

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
two if you jump back up so if I jump

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.930 
two if you jump back up so if I jump
back<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:54.960> right<00:00:55.199> now<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:56.399> timer's<00:00:56.730> going<00:00:56.850> to

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
back up right now the timer's going to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.760 
back up right now the timer's going to
be<00:00:57.030> pretty<00:00:57.180> low<00:00:57.480> again<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.469> what<00:00:58.590> you're<00:00:58.680> going

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
be pretty low again so what you're going

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.110 
be pretty low again so what you're going
to<00:00:58.829> want<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.129> do<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.550> got<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.850> let<00:00:59.969> that

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
to want to do is you got to let that

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.970 
to want to do is you got to let that
time<00:01:00.329> reset<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:00.930> jump<00:01:01.199> down<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.500> maybe<00:01:01.620> count

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
time reset so jump down and maybe count

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.219 
time reset so jump down and maybe count
to<00:01:02.250> 10<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:03.030> two<00:01:03.780> three<00:01:04.769> four<00:01:05.519> five<00:01:06.229> six

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
to 10 so one two three four five six

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.120 
to 10 so one two three four five six
seven<00:01:07.560> eight<00:01:08.460> nine<00:01:09.500> ten<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.710> then<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:10.920> jump

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
seven eight nine ten and then we jump

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.420 
seven eight nine ten and then we jump
back<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:12.200> well<00:01:13.200> if<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.560> could<00:01:13.710> get<00:01:13.830> up<00:01:13.979> there<00:01:14.010> god

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
back up well if I could get up there god

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.109 
back up well if I could get up there god
damn<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:15.560> come<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:17.400> we<00:01:17.520> get<00:01:17.640> back<00:01:17.759> up<00:01:17.970> there

damn it come on so we get back up there

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.570 
damn it come on so we get back up there
and<00:01:18.299> our<00:01:18.750> time<00:01:18.960> has<00:01:19.080> reset<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.560> 10<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.430> got
