00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.599
 as with so many brands it seems 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.980
 renault history repeating itself 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.820
 we are dealing with the third here 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.180
 generation 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.910
 scénic was the space car of the brand 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.199
 after the facelift of the first generation 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.660
 the so-called rx4 with 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.580
 four-wheel drive fits present 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.769
 this also happened with the second generation 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.140
 only after the facelift with the conquest too 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.420
 some tough version that just 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.750
 front-wheel drive was that 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.720
 outside renault with this scénic xmod 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.640
 continue on that principle the car is on the 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.559
 outside what send become that see 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.489
 we here on the black edges 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.409
 we also see that on the eyelashes 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.729
 solid which was amp form 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.890
 behind too 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.990
 and the car is also slightly higher 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.549
 wheels three centimeters to be precise 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.799
 which became the ground clearance 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.799
 getting bigger but that's not all 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.509
 another feature of that series 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.460
 x moth tires are also mounted 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.140
 standard with a snarl burn you 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.420
 must have coarse profile and that the car 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.890
 give more options than the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.299
 paved road on wood 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.369
 because despite that it's over 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.079
 front wheel drive 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.929
 has that car indeed more 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.979
 possibilities on mud snow and others 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.979
 types of substrate 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.850
 nice to hear 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.100
 seller 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.130
 do not 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.490
 others come 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.490
 water 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.519
 genome talks about this 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.580
 scénic xmod 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:13.620
 about the so-called xtended grip and that 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.450
 is operated with a button on the 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.030
 center console 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.190
 the button has three positions and with that is 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.290
 to influence the sp 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.360
 sp normally ensures that if the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.519
 wheels grip it 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.190
 engine power is tempered and that and 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.200
 possibly even at braking on 3 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.580
 the muddy wet slippery around the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.670
 we can ground that right 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.040
 and therefore miss this external group 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.450
 system has been added by genome 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.010
 you could compare it to one 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.860
 button that we put on some cars in the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.890
 with which sp can be turned off with that 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.209
 button and becomes the psp program 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.220
 different 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.349
 now it is a bit unclear 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.599
 including a stand for slippery 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.040
 substrate and a so-called expert 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.290
 stand at the stands 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.239
 work up to a speed of 40 kilometers 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.480
 per hour but what a difference between them 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.129
 two positions that a is not clear if 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.290
 we update the documentation if necessary 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.790
 and it will not be d either 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.980
 clear when they are with that car 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.980
 ride on such a surface 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.470
 below 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.810
 and then another important thing because 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.200
 often additions are immediately expensive 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.740
 800 euros on the short version of the semi 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.930
 renault delivers this i melted version 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.590
 in addition, the necessary engines can be used 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.500
 and 115hp single two-liter turbo 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.720
 this 130hp of the same single with 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.950
 two liter turbo and on the diesel side 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:01.220
 both just five and 1.6 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.350
 DC and you can even have it Dec. 5 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.709
 with the gearbox with double 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.350
 link are supplied for 800 euros 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.570
 gives that car anyway because different impression 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.980
 and that already appears after the first few 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.390
 months of say buy in the Netherlands 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.390
 quite a hit 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.319
 fill
