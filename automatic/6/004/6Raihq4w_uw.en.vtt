00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.640
 We are going to prepare blood sausage volovanes and 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.970
 apple the ingredients that we need 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.530
 they are volvans bought black pudding 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.160
 taste that can be rice or 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.220
 onion apple pine nuts brown sugar and 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.340
 if we do not have white sugar and we're going to 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.670
 start by picking the blood sausage in our 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.529
 rice case let's cut a couple of 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.750
 little slices then we will not prepare 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.609
 Many of you already know that I do not give ingredients 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.649
 because this will have to be calculated 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.690
 you according to the diners that you 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.179
 are you going to serve them or the amount of 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.280
 volovanes that you want to prepare and 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:42.699
 we crumble the blood sausage in a pan 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.769
 hot with a drop of oil and the 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.850
 let's sauté well until it's a 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:52.120
 little toast we put it on a plate 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.359
 and we take our apple which we're going 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.739
 to chop in very small cubes the most 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.739
 little ones that we can 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.970
 once we have our little pieces of 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:10.450
 apple let's fill the gun with 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.149
 the blood pudding is almost tight 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.700
 above all without reaching the 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:18.280
 stuffing everything but we squeeze it in there 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.640
 so that it fits quite we put the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.240
 apple cubes and powders with 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.820
 brown sugar we take the torch and what 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.090
 We substitute a little bit until the 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.149
 sugar caramelice we put a couple 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.250
 of piñón cited and ready we have 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.649
 our blackberry and apple volovanes 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.780
 what you see and that if you do not have a blowtorch 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:44.050
 you can always light the grill 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.659
 oven to the maximum and put them in the oven 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.610
 seconds until you see that the sugar 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.289
 it has become caramel if not also 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.100
 you can serve them directly with the 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.960
 Sprinkled sugar are also rich 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.899
 they are another great idea together with our 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.520
 volcanic recipe of sobrasada 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.240
 perfect for these holidays and you 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.240
 I recommend that you try them because they are 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.240
 delicious
