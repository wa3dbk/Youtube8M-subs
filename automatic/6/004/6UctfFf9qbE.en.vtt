international<00:04:19.100> I<00:04:20.330> think<00:04:21.330> it's<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.570> sense<00:04:21.810> of

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
international I think it's the sense of

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.980 
international I think it's the sense of
adventure<00:04:22.080> because<00:04:22.919> we're<00:04:23.729> not<00:04:23.970> going<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.570> I
