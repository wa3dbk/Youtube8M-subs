00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.920
 then goal of the exercise we will determine 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.870
 the magnetic field created by a wrong 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.220
 it's very often used its share create 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.389
 magnetic fields it's in the 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.969
 particle accelerators 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.420
 we'll see why is it 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.940
 often used so here the wrong I 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.770
 recovered here are the sons that's the meaning of the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.270
 current on the filters is important 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.010
 because it's very important 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.590
 that's what will allow us to do the 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.800
 suitable directions I recall the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.949
 amp theorem that we will use that 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.690
 says that traffic on a one 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.989
 contour crossed by lines of 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.590
 current is equal to bx wings that's 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.120
 the circulation and galamus 0 sum 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.620
 algebraic current 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.050
 why this game of bric I remember 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.000
 that conventions are that if we 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.969
 orients a surface like this one 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.699
 calculated circulation of bella on it 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.280
 it's normal so a circuit in 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.629
 dancing it will be good sense positive 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.239
 it must be circulated in this sense 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:08.400
 still currents that goes up which 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:12.710
 crosses like this positively and the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.710
 others negatively 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.470
 ok that's what we're going to apply here 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.330
 okay so we start by looking 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:29.820
 first calls that's Theorem 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:31.799
 of ampere theorem tempers a wind of 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.210
 to apply it, we must determine the 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.829
 conditions of application but it is necessary 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.170
 determine b its direction its meaning that to 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.759
 day his geography actually before 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.350
 start before applying that otherwise 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.110
 it's not what contours sought 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:52.110
 all right first thing we look at them 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:55.020
 invariants this what ultimately we get 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:01.409
 says this z in coordinates 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:05.820
 cylindrical in zrr was a n point so 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.710
 we say b is a function of rtt to z but 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.259
 and do not even lug around all 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.930
 inset this case york moorings 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.180
 we see that if we turn around the tire 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.340
 finally the current density does not 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.650
 do not change a gift that there is a spear by 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.530
 square centimeters per meter by the 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.420
 lengths but it does not change so we get 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.760
 said that puts a variant shares and adam that 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.799
 b it will depend only on r and 2 helpers who 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.030
 we find no others to variant 6 is 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:37.790
 vari riom it's here 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.489
 r varies we do not know it so 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.129
 that's where the variance is 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.950
 an invariant this second keeps them 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.260
 symmetries then I trace another path 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.500
 a little side otherwise we're missing it 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:56.359
 am here if we prince the wrong here we see 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.870
 that plans actually going through there 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:05.569
 that these are symmetry plants and whose 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:08.599
 bb is perpendicular to these plants 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.889
 symmetry and therefore consequently berry 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.989
 every time father supplies the plans 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.769
 turning the b and finally he's on 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.440
 a circle 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.599
 here and that's what we see the burrow 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.280
 here from this drawing wac friend babies 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.280
 and tours actually 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.230
 here we know it's on a circle 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.819
 the singing lines of besson 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:41.900
 circles not here here 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:41.900
 b and in jeans or singing line 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.950
 who are the circle 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.300
 1 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.040
 so there we can apply we can 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.810
 apply in peace we will take a 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.030
 surface first question is at hem to 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.950
 the outside as a humble and they say 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.150
 so what is the value of b in this 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.280
 point Monday will resume and we will do 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:10.260
 move kiss on use radius 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:13.110
 r there you have to do a little bit a little 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:17.519
 complementary drawing if I imagine I 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:23.370
 cut it all off the wrong side m is 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:33.630
 there and then we see that the currents make 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:36.810
 it turns me on and then goes back for that too 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.790
 that it goes back up if we actually take 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:45.500
 side there the guy tell me that here it is 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:50.669
 we will calculate the circulation b 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:52.440
 traffic bdl Segala what advance 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.600
 and recede b on a circle of a radius 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.520
 rb constant since it depends only on 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.560
 glass on this circle there for that one 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.419
 studies in fact did the work 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:06.919
 preliminary determination of plants 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:11.250
 symmetry with sending that made fx 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:13.380
 on the circle and m then that my faith a 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.669
 shed of a dorian circle sap that makes 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:19.070
 two beers 2 ft rd alarm at the 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.110
 traffic 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.580
 second thing finally the other term here 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.070
 there to determine this rolin museum 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.620
 week I tinkered outside here 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:33.090
 what do we see this evil of the junk but 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:35.400
 a blow we have the current actually who 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.050
 goes in one direction then a shot he passes 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.370
 in the other direction so in fact we see 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.840
 that there is so much 2.2 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.650
 two current lines that cut into 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.770
 a sense that in the other is the story 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:52.100
 of the algebraic sum we see that 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.630
 finally it will give zero since the 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.610
 only measure we knew before telling him 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.990
 negatively but after one who is 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.240
 positive and as they are identical you 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.690
 leash cancels so we see that mu 0 is 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:08.180
 rejoice of equal life 0 so when one is 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:13.310
 outside m and outside 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:15.970
 mu 0 algebraic sum and y equal 0 that 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:20.060
 means it 's all that's good 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:22.010
 equal to 0 outside it is equal to zero 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.910
 well, we do not stop there because 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.280
 do we go look inside 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:30.289
 now but in point m 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:32.150
 inside m inside the tuna and 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:35.840
 there obviously we found a b on fact 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:39.620
 the same design is like that 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.680
 reach to imagine the ten that happens 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.450
 like that we have the right colors 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:48.979
 we see that it is outside of the wrong as 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.520
 this is how it is and we take 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:54.830
 m 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:57.320
 inside here is here like on the 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.690
 night inside and we look there and 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.490
 the convoy crate had we see that if 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.500
 this time the museum rosso majorique 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.940
 he is pro null since we see well 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.320
 that there are more warrior currents 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.630
 I stop 40 under the water that comes 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.280
 well well oriented well counted 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.870
 positively but hey it would not have 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.180
 changed it's the other way would have 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.979
 nothing changed at all so the traffic 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:21.740
 it's still the same so it's 2 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:26.240
 pi rb equal to user pink algebraic sum 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:31.010
 biya ny current last almost 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:33.979
 so that makes b win to mu 0 and it on 

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.599
 two girls show off 

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:39.669
 vector we put a nice stop in May 

00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:43.840
 +0 here it is she is inside 

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:43.840
 ok here
