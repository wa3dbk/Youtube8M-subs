00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.460
 hello, guys, how are you doing sutep and 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.099
 here we are again in the minecraft and 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.740
 today we are going to do a tutorial that 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.529
 popular vote is worth a lot of 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.480
 you have sent me messages by 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.820
 please make me a slime farm 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.079
 It's perfect, I 'm going to do it in a 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.189
 I had not planned to do it at the beginning 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.619
 because there are already many companions 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.570
 youtubers who have done tutorials of 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.700
 how to make airlines farm but good 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.500
 I'm going to make my version as 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.110
 I did that is a little bit different from the 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.670
 of the rest good this is the area in the 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.070
 How beautiful in the interchange here 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.170
 I have the main mine where I took the 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.240
 first materials and what I did is what 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.010
 typical a staircase down below the whole 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.850
 well when I get to the mother stone 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.820
 I climbed 12 the citi to back 12 heights 12 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.040
 blocks I made some long ones 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.240
 corridors with some area like that from there 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.580
 what do you see 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.530
 in this case it says of 2 and as you see me 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.320
 out there are quite a few lines out there with the 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.520
 normal lighting of any aisle 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.260
 guys, I recommend you kill him with 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.730
 the hand there are many people who tell me 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.530
 I was that the other day came out and I 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.020
 I killed him and I did not get any balls 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.400
 slime dale with the hand dale with the hand 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.320
 ok because with what it is with the sword 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.350
 you tend to kill them and many times not 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.690
 none come out as you see is 3 x 2 is 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.120
 say 3 high by 2 and says some 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.220
 zones out there is worth where I usually 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.130
 go out in those areas I usually leave 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.020
 even the greatest thing that there is worth now 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.970
 is in difficult mode then tend to 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.190
 get out more in difficult mode but as you see 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.530
 it does not have to be exactly in the 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.630
 slams farm on the mother stone to me 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.630
 I tend to leave more here than the area 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.520
 of esplanade that is right in the area 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.530
 lowest d 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.570
 from the map as you can see here in the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.390
 Lower area right now does not appear 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.179
 none instead on the stairs 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.829
 going up the stairs in the block in 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:57.280
 the blocks of height number twelve there 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:59.590
 I got a lot of money and this is another 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.079
 thing that I wanted you to see this is a 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.610
 let's say monster generator is worth here 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.039
 you are going to see a spider if it comes out 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.860
 first but then I have everything covered 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.349
 It's dark and like some windows with 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.430
 another area that expands quite a lot 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.260
 it's pretty big 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.170
 I made a rather long extension and 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.269
 background he made a few recesses and I put 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.829
 let's say this area as a window 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.860
 can shoot arrows you see here 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:25.450
 many monsters come out I say is in 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.220
 difficult mode whereby the monsters 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.470
 that there are now two moments 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.730
 they are quite good I did not bring many 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.400
 arrows but good still giving ay 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.709
 I get rid of all of them and even 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.010
 this spider is also around here and 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.659
 simply what you have to do is 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.159
 for one written for example do 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.519
 any fast with the little corner I open and 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:48.680
 came in to pick up what friend of a great 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:51.000
 called I'll give candela takes bandida 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.610
 and I brought up that is makes me the 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.140
 tiger jump well perfect you see and 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.540
 I collect all the material is a way of 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.549
 to be able to have material also and that 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.530
 they usually do quite little damage and in 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.900
 this case mission three hearts to me 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.370
 come more more skeletons because as 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.260
 I said before they will be on motorbike mode 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.200
 difficult then tend to come more 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.450
 but good and now what I'm going to do is 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.209
 I'm going to cut out when I edit the video I'm going 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.560
 to put a piece also of what is 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.480
 of the world of the guys with whom 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.310
 yesterday he was there on hand from luis h vale 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.349
 because I want you to see also how 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.209
 they made their area their farm is 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.700
 line is much bigger than mine 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.799
 As you can see mine is a size that good 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.220
 it is considerable to have and ground the bottom 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.470
 on the other hand it has water has nothing but 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.770
 height is not much in contrast to look at the 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.650
 they 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.220
 the height is huge they did it from a 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.840
 brutally dynamited the lower area and 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.340
 get to the mother stone dynamited 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.160
 very much you can see that they even have 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.530
 diamonds covered him with dirt and says 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.720
 that really enough goes to the 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.730
 principle usually costs in guys too 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.680
 tell you that at the beginning it usually costs a 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.980
 little that the slams appear but 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.340
 once you are more than one or two days 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.069
 of the game is to say days that spend days 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.769
 in the game 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.689
 and you have it in difficult mode or good in 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.109
 easy they are also leaving is when 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:13.939
 they start to come out pretty slides worth the 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.409
 true that here has a lot 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:17.509
 work logically here were three 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.070
 people who were dedicated to doing this and 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.570
 it's much faster than making it one 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.310
 as I did mine but they are good 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.810
 different ways that they come out 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.570
 both are effective 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.130
 mine doing the side aisles 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.099
 what is at an approximate height 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.229
 of 12 blocks and they doing it in 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:35.410
 this case with quite large waterfalls 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.820
 of lava you see that the stone is bad 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.560
 waterfalls of water lava etcetera and 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.150
 covering ground now yes also me 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.310
 they say that lately where it comes out 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.560
 much is a few side aisles that 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.750
 they have just stone mother and with no 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.639
 a lot of lighting them for example me 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.560
 recommend that there is not much 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:56.969
 lighting that is say they even 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:59.189
 here there is enough there is too much then 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:00.689
 It's a matter of you going to try me 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:01.229
 I recommend that you do both 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:03.419
 how did I do 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.729
 I went down to the mother stone I made a 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.119
 excavation and dynamite there but to no 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.459
 more power that I stayed pretty hollow 

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:14.069
 not as tall as here, but 

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:15.959
 good that I stayed pretty hollow and 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.539
 then I put it with lights and made a 

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:21.209
 area of ​​land made an area without anything 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.949
 earth simply the mother stone I made 

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:25.199
 another area where there is a little bit of 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.299
 Wash water combine a little bit is worth the truth 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.759
 that has come out more for the areas that 

00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:31.559
 they have are illuminated just as well 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:34.990
 that is to say that it does not have an illumination 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:37.600
 out of the ordinary not so much 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.000
 torch as it has many people and others 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.070
 I do not have a lot of washes 's not in 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.230
 where is the justite lighting look 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.370
 as in these holes of here you see with 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.340
 our gap lighting that is 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.770
 adjusts and for example in this case it is 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.360
 where else they come to them they say 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.310
 that in this area here that has 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.260
 lighting but there is something out what 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.420
 normal is where they get the most 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.940
 lately it seems that in the end to the 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.620
 slams likes holes 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.840
 he does not like things so so so 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.160
 huge are discovered good 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.570
 guys, nothing else is approaching 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.520
 in the end just tell you what 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.730
 Share with our friends you give to 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:17.160
 sub if you want more videos I hope so 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.160
 like and we see them in minecraft
