mag to a very mainstream mag all saying

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.709 
mag to a very mainstream mag all saying
this<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> top<00:01:02.640> freeride<00:01:03.180> skis<00:01:03.539> on

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
this is one of the top freeride skis on

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.299 
this is one of the top freeride skis on
the<00:01:03.750> market<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> reason<00:01:04.830> for<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.040> is

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the market and the reason for that is

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.399 
the market and the reason for that is
it's<00:01:05.489> free<00:01:05.729> ride<00:01:05.909> specific<00:01:06.510> technology<00:01:07.170> being

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
it's free ride specific technology being

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.830 
it's free ride specific technology being
the<00:01:07.560> metal<00:01:07.890> matrix<00:01:08.100> what<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.150> did<00:01:09.360> instead<00:01:09.510> of

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the metal matrix what we did instead of

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.840 
the metal matrix what we did instead of
putting<00:01:10.170> metal<00:01:10.350> edge<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.920> edge<00:01:11.070> tip<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.640> tail

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
putting metal edge to edge tip to tail

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.250 
putting metal edge to edge tip to tail
which<00:01:12.090> would<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.330> made<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.630> very<00:01:12.810> heavy<00:01:13.170> and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
which would have made it very heavy and

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.560 
which would have made it very heavy and
a<00:01:13.619> bit<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.979> dead<00:01:14.220> ski<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:15.119> only<00:01:15.299> put<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
a bit of a dead ski we only put the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.210 
a bit of a dead ski we only put the
metal<00:01:15.840> where<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.170> need<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:16.860> removed

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
metal where you need it and we removed

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.219 
metal where you need it and we removed
it<00:01:17.340> where<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.610> don't<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.630> removed<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.080> at

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
it where you don't so we removed it at

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.289 
it where you don't so we removed it at
the<00:01:19.350> tips<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.159> very<00:01:20.189> lightweight<00:01:20.670> for

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
the tips so it's a very lightweight for

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.570 
the tips so it's a very lightweight for
swing<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.229> we've<00:01:22.380> put<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.890> right<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
swing and we've put it right at the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.730 
swing and we've put it right at the
initiation<00:01:24.420> contact<00:01:24.990> points<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.500> tip<00:01:25.710> and

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
initiation contact points in the tip and

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.010 
initiation contact points in the tip and
tail<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.400> responsiveness<00:01:27.060> initiating<00:01:27.869> and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
tail for responsiveness initiating and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.109 
tail for responsiveness initiating and
powering<00:01:28.320> out<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.680> your<00:01:28.770> turns<00:01:29.040> we<00:01:29.790> also<00:01:29.970> have

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
powering out of your turns we also have

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.330 
powering out of your turns we also have
these<00:01:30.479> Forks<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.979> ski

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
these Forks you can see it in the ski

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.520 
these Forks you can see it in the ski
it's<00:01:32.610> three-dimensional<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.900> prongs<00:01:34.320> that

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
it's three-dimensional that prongs that

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.260 
it's three-dimensional that prongs that
stick<00:01:34.829> out<00:01:34.950> under<00:01:35.250> your<00:01:35.400> foot<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.970> that's

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
stick out under your foot and that's

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.760 
stick out under your foot and that's
just<00:01:36.390> going<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.630> act<00:01:36.840> almost<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> serrated

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
just going to act almost like a serrated

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.679 
just going to act almost like a serrated
edge<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.310> give<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.549> pressure<00:01:38.939> points<00:01:39.420> under

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
edge to give you pressure points under

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.780 
edge to give you pressure points under
your<00:01:39.810> foot<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.170> dig<00:01:40.409> into<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> hard<00:01:40.950> pack<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
your foot to dig into the hard pack the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.969 
your foot to dig into the hard pack the
metal<00:01:42.030> matrix<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.630> really<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.530> stiffens

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
metal matrix and it really it stiffens

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.010 
metal matrix and it really it stiffens
the<00:01:44.070> ski<00:01:44.310> up<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.670> makes<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.090> very<00:01:45.360> rigid<00:01:45.899> at

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the ski up and makes it very rigid at

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.020 
the ski up and makes it very rigid at
high<00:01:46.229> speeds<00:01:46.680> which<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.490> know<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.820> need

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
high speeds which is you know you need

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.670 
high speeds which is you know you need
that<00:01:48.240> when<00:01:48.479> you're<00:01:48.630> tanking<00:01:48.990> down<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.500> Hill

know the 100 I would definitely take out
of<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.330> quiver<00:03:36.569> and<00:03:36.780> then<00:03:37.230> Tom<00:03:37.620> Cruise<00:03:37.860> and

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
of the quiver and then Tom Cruise and

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.009 
of the quiver and then Tom Cruise and
groomers<00:03:38.400> I<00:03:38.580> would<00:03:38.879> pull<00:03:39.030> out<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.269> 90<00:03:39.599> and<00:03:39.750> go

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
groomers I would pull out the 90 and go

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.379 
groomers I would pull out the 90 and go
rip<00:03:40.230> it
