00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.610
 voiced Kuzma 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.750
 good evening my name is michael davis 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.750
 thank 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.760
 before the start of the offensive would like 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.540
 explain a couple of size terms 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.029
 Show Business 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.119
 It considered that humorists say in general and 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.630
 Horsemen say funny so I became 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.119
 the vampire 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:35.649
 she has her original abdominal 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:38.070
 I consider you to be engrossed 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.070
 how much 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:48.610
 There are two ways to perform tricks 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:55.070
 will give a round of applause and an option like us 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:01:05.269
 doing it now no no it's too late 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:08.180
 style you want impressions of truth 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.780
 Speaking a simple trick like that 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.780
 to react 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.110
 on a gun jugglers can do it not 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.110
 looking 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.770
 looks at the hall 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:37.090
 glad to see you 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.090
 great dress cheese 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:50.290
 and now break the sequence to 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.290
 lead a new object 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.720
 watch me put the third ball in 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.720
 composition 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.930
 i do these unusual tricks for the case 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.930
 if there is an angler in the hall 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:39.810
 you should be wondering why I quit 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:39.810
 copper there too 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.450
 i'm just teasing you i can use 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.560
 all these balls 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.560
 true without these 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.370
 I would like to show a small sketch 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.370
 who called me the same measures on a motorcycle 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:31.650
 it was stupid not at all what usually 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.650
 like 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:44.190
 and it scares the baron himself is not so important 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:47.910
 how much in terms of quantity if 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.390
 turns on gravity commanding the earth 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.450
 suck 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.450
 we 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:04:01.939
 sorry i can't control my 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:05.290
 sense of humor a bit of a run I can 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:05.290
 try to get poorer bowling ball 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.560
 with the egg is naturally the enemy of the ball for 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.560
 bowling 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.690
 the third thing salt trick is to 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.700
 eat an apple in the process of juggling 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.700

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.710
 donate him to an Indian juggler 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:05.890
 repeat you once more you must 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:15.130
 throw it in time because your 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:17.410

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.910
 drummer 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.330
 you must throw high so that I can 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.770
 to catch 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.820
 different and I will juggle in one 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.820
