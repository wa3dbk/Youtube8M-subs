00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.039

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.799

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.420
 white ac to get better product for 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.960
 to visualize it is I have the cabbage here 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.729
 cut 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.990
 The better I thin, the better I can. 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.009
 cut very thin 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.140
 it is already washed and drained 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:22.080
 here I have the mayonnaise and if you use 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.159
 light version best for you your body 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.549
 thank 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.840
 I have here is so in the ramadinha the law 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:34.350
 so do not even do anything and I 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.100
 I have here the atom one're in the water 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.119
 Natural 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:43.890
 He does not have to look at what I do I choose 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.600
 this one afloat a pebble and then a 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.329
 a little piece of cake in it to get the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.649
 Soda, I'll do it, all the cans. 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.479
 to punish your olive 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.610
 It's a lot and I must do it if I can 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.820
 bit of the flavor of it but I do by 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.790
 cause of the sodium that comes in 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.590
 and then this is it people so I'm going to put 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.800
 everybody make it a little bigger and I'll 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.680
 to mix all this I'll put 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.020
 nese quantity here I think it's ideal that 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.090
 I think it's good I put mayonnaise because 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.010
 Do's and the kids like it very much. 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.690
 You know if I make coleslaw that 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.380
 sir and put a little mayonnaise 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.680
 they start perfect is already without mayonnaise 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.990
 they like that he knows he needs to eat 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:33.630
 and you can also put olives 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.610
 Corn and go to him that that salad 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.190
 noodles okay did you do in 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.320
 her channel that I find very cool is worth 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.520
 Too bad, you go check it out. 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.290
 so it 's more or less what you 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.240
 can put an ingredient of this salad 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.490
 pasta that you use is that each 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.610
 uses a different ingredient to make 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.600
 so what to bring to the boss car here 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.220
 in the case né the pilot piece that is the cabbage 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.440
 tom né 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.660
 the others you can vary so far 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.360
 okay right is putting up xuxa can 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.760
 put put will be chopped some 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.590
 thing that replaces meat is good 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.440
 I'll be back in a week for you guys. 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.410
 Go see if it's good or it's here. 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.270
 button that is already squeezed and drained 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.410
 I told you so, I passed. 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.540
 little water to take the sodium out 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.730
 that I spend so very quickly and I'm 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.620
 washing just to get a 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.580
 little of the sodium you despise 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.170
 the water already gets a little scratched and here 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.930
 I gather I'll put it all together in a 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:38.010
 It is better to have a bowl and this line 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.420
 did not give much of my container 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.100
 which is a bit smaller than would be ideal 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.230
 for this salad he is busy with 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.670
 gelatine in the refrigerator so that neither 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.970
 it is too big but this one 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.130
 Amount is enough for us, alice 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.800
 not as yet only the larger children and 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.140
 My husband, I took a little bit here. 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.239
 without anything just the cabbage and carrot because 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.560
 I thought it was going to be a lot for us. 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.020
 I do not like to keep things like 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.239
 mayonnaise so in the afternoon we enjoy 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.650
 here at dinner 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.390
 so what I added was that I was a 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.820
 bit of green smell is only 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.590
 panties even a little and if you 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.510
 like bittersweet you can add 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.190
 also small apple gets very 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.600
 delicious you do not do much question 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.930
 these things do not 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.239
 and the children too 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.609
 coast so that's got to 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.840
 Well, I hope you have 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.530

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.220
