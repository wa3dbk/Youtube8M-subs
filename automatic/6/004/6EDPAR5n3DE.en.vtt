00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.049 
comm in this episode of rigging
techniques<00:00:44.160> I'm<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.670> show<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
techniques I'm going to show you the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.640 
techniques I'm going to show you the
method<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.480> rigging<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.870> top<00:00:46.200> section<00:00:46.530> of

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
method of rigging the top section of

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.920 
method of rigging the top section of
trunk<00:00:46.890> down<00:00:47.190> onto<00:00:47.460> itself<00:00:47.820> otherwise<00:00:48.570> known

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
trunk down onto itself otherwise known

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.700 
trunk down onto itself otherwise known
as<00:00:48.960> book<00:00:49.290> hitching<00:00:51.110> okay<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.410> got<00:00:52.559> to

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
as book hitching okay so we just got to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.759 
as book hitching okay so we just got to
top<00:00:52.860> off<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.190> small<00:00:53.460> section<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:54.710> so<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
top off this small section here so to

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:57.320 
top off this small section here so to
start<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.280> I've<00:00:56.430> tied<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.790> the<00:00:56.879> pulley<00:00:57.090> book

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
start with I've tied on the pulley book

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.180 
start with I've tied on the pulley book
using<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.760> cow<00:00:59.760> hitch<00:01:00.559> this<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> great<00:01:02.040> knot

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
using a cow hitch this is a great knot

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.710 
using a cow hitch this is a great knot
to<00:01:02.339> use<00:01:02.550> as<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.180> get<00:01:03.449> it

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
to use as you can get it

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.980 
to use as you can get it
they<00:01:04.680> pulley<00:01:05.070> really<00:01:05.610> snug<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:06.420> high<00:01:06.780> up<00:01:06.930> as

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
they pulley really snug as high up as

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.779 
they pulley really snug as high up as
you<00:01:07.050> can<00:01:07.140> or<00:01:07.440> as<00:01:07.530> if<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.800> use<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> running

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:08.789 
you can or as if you use a running

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:10.880 
you can or as if you use a running
bowline<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.869> tend<00:01:10.050> to<00:01:10.110> get<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.289> lot<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.619> slack

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
bowline you tend to get a lot of slack

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.609 
bowline you tend to get a lot of slack
which<00:01:11.550> means<00:01:11.789> a<00:01:11.940> lot<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.360> drop<00:01:12.690> on<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.259> section

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
which means a lot of drop on the section

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.370 
which means a lot of drop on the section
that<00:01:13.680> you're<00:01:13.770> topping<00:01:14.100> off<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.170> first

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
that you're topping off so the first

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.660 
that you're topping off so the first
thing<00:01:16.500> I'm<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.740> do<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.220> pull<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> bit<00:01:17.640> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
thing I'm going to do is pull a bit a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.020 
thing I'm going to do is pull a bit a
slack<00:01:17.940> through<00:01:18.149> and<00:01:20.030> tie<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> slipknot<00:01:22.910> it's<00:01:23.910> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
slack through and tie a slipknot it's a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.420 
slack through and tie a slipknot it's a
slip<00:01:24.630> lots<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.899> directional<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.190> you've<00:01:26.310> got

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
slip lots of directional so you've got

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.540 
slip lots of directional so you've got
to<00:01:26.520> do<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.880> right<00:01:27.030> direction<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.630> that

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
to do it in the right direction so that

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.040 
to do it in the right direction so that
the<00:01:29.550> pulley<00:01:29.820> box<00:01:30.090> stops<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.720> doesn't<00:01:30.930> pull

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
the pulley box stops it and doesn't pull

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.100 
the pulley box stops it and doesn't pull
it<00:01:31.140> through<00:01:32.090> now<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.450> means<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:33.929> work

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
it through now it means you can work

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
it through now it means you can work
with<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.289> lot<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.590> slack<00:01:34.830> rather<00:01:35.280> than<00:01:35.929> fighting

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
with a lot of slack rather than fighting

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:58.620 
with a lot of slack rather than fighting
the<00:01:38.240> rope<00:01:39.240> falling<00:01:39.960> through

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:07.660 

so<00:01:59.630> now<00:01:59.780> at<00:02:00.440> the<00:02:00.560> end<00:02:00.620> of<00:02:00.830> your<00:02:00.920> line<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:06.670> wrap

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
so now at the end of your line and wrap

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:19.280 
so now at the end of your line and wrap
it<00:02:07.850> around<00:02:07.910> once<00:02:08.330> for<00:02:08.600> a<00:02:08.630> half<00:02:08.960> hitch<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:13.330> then

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.410 

you<00:02:20.290> want<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.560> tie<00:02:20.770> on<00:02:23.550> using<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.760> running

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
you want to tie on using a running

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:36.890 
you want to tie on using a running
bowline<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.830> that's<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.190> main<00:02:27.370> knot<00:02:32.040> and

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.220 

we'll<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:39.450> put<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.480> stopper<00:02:40.810> knot<00:02:41.020> in<00:02:41.140> the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
we'll just put a stopper knot in the

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.590 
we'll just put a stopper knot in the
tail<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:43.330> then<00:02:44.850> tuck<00:02:45.850> that<00:02:45.970> underneath<00:02:46.240> just

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
tail and then tuck that underneath just

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.750 
tail and then tuck that underneath just
so<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:46.930> doesn't<00:02:47.170> get<00:02:47.290> caught<00:02:47.980> in<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.250> chainsaw

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
so it doesn't get caught in the chainsaw

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.520 
so it doesn't get caught in the chainsaw
and<00:02:49.140> then<00:02:50.140> just<00:02:50.350> pull<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.800> slack<00:02:51.040> through

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
and then just pull the slack through

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:00.590 
and then just pull the slack through
like<00:02:53.530> so<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:57.610> then<00:02:57.760> finally<00:02:59.100> pull<00:03:00.100> out<00:03:00.250> the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
like so and then finally pull out the

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.320 
like so and then finally pull out the
Slipknot<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:05.520> it's<00:03:06.520> running<00:03:07.000> straight

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
Slipknot so that it's running straight

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.130 
Slipknot so that it's running straight
through<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.690> pulley<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:10.450> just<00:03:10.660> before<00:03:10.900> we<00:03:10.960> do

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
through the pulley so just before we do

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.450 
through the pulley so just before we do
the<00:03:11.260> back<00:03:11.470> cut<00:03:11.740> I'm<00:03:11.920> just<00:03:12.070> going<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.220> make<00:03:12.400> a

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
the back cut I'm just going to make a

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.250 
the back cut I'm just going to make a
little<00:03:13.180> nick<00:03:13.330> on<00:03:13.420> either<00:03:13.570> side<00:03:13.840> just<00:03:13.870> through

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
little nick on either side just through

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.520 
little nick on either side just through
the<00:03:14.350> back<00:03:14.730> just<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.910> prevent<00:03:16.270> the<00:03:16.840> bark<00:03:17.140> really

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
the back just to prevent the bark really

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.080 
the back just to prevent the bark really
holding<00:03:18.070> on<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.370> last<00:03:18.520> minute<00:03:18.820> because<00:03:19.060> we

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
holding on that last minute because we

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.660 
holding on that last minute because we
want<00:03:19.300> it<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.420> snap<00:03:19.720> off<00:03:19.930> clean<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:23.490> we're<00:03:24.490> all

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670
