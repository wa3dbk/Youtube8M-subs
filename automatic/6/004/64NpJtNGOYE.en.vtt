the<00:01:12.420> Jewish<00:01:12.720> people<00:01:13.140> which<00:01:13.290> seems<00:01:13.530> odd<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.830> me

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
the Jewish people which seems odd to me

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.039 
the Jewish people which seems odd to me
if<00:01:14.340> he's<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> Jew<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:15.090> him<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> be<00:01:15.420> persecuting

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
if he's a Jew for him to be persecuting

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.050 
if he's a Jew for him to be persecuting
the<00:01:16.170> Jews<00:01:16.200> great<00:01:16.799> point<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.460> think<00:01:17.700> he's

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the Jews great point so I think he's

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.300 
the Jews great point so I think he's
gonna<00:01:18.150> be<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> Gentile<00:01:19.380> he's<00:01:19.619> gonna<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.950> someone

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
gonna be a Gentile he's gonna be someone

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.740 
gonna be a Gentile he's gonna be someone
though<00:01:20.430> who's<00:01:20.640> going<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.030> come<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.540> scene

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750
