return to a three ball cascade we'll put

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:35.130 
return to a three ball cascade we'll put
two<00:03:24.269> balls<00:03:24.510> in<00:03:24.750> one<00:03:24.810> hand<00:03:25.049> like<00:03:25.590> this

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.260 

we'll<00:03:35.770> throw<00:03:36.010> them<00:03:36.250> trying<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:36.760> keep<00:03:37.090> the

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
we'll throw them trying to keep the

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.059 
we'll throw them trying to keep the
higher<00:03:37.540> ball<00:03:37.870> on<00:03:38.080> the<00:03:38.170> floor<00:03:38.319> high<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:38.890> the

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
higher ball on the floor high and the

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.160 
higher ball on the floor high and the
one<00:03:39.340> that<00:03:39.490> is<00:03:39.670> down<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.000> other<00:03:40.360> or<00:03:40.810> not<00:03:40.990> too

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
one that is down the other or not too

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.230 
one that is down the other or not too
high<00:03:41.410> will<00:03:41.890> practice<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.490> same<00:03:42.700> throwing

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
high will practice the same throwing

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.290 
high will practice the same throwing
with<00:03:43.480> one<00:03:43.750> hand<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:44.290> then<00:03:44.890> with<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.280> other<00:03:45.490> we

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
with one hand and then with the other we

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.880 
with one hand and then with the other we
should<00:03:46.480> practice<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:47.020> same<00:03:47.200> number<00:03:47.410> of<00:03:47.530> time

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
should practice the same number of time

00:03:47.890 --> 00:04:02.479 
should practice the same number of time
with<00:03:48.130> each<00:03:48.280> hand<00:03:48.580> alternately

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.670 

we'll<00:04:03.489> take<00:04:03.730> four<00:04:04.090> balls<00:04:04.359> two<00:04:04.900> for<00:04:05.230> each<00:04:05.260> hand

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
we'll take four balls two for each hand

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.589 
we'll take four balls two for each hand
and<00:04:05.859> we'll<00:04:06.310> make<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.730> same<00:04:06.969> throwing<00:04:07.390> from

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
and we'll make the same throwing from

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.539 
and we'll make the same throwing from
Step<00:04:07.959> four<00:04:08.170> with<00:04:08.530> both<00:04:08.769> hands<00:04:09.129> at<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.430> same

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
Step four with both hands at the same

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.429 
Step four with both hands at the same
time<00:04:10.030> as<00:04:11.879> well<00:04:12.879> as<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.209> balls<00:04:13.480> at<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.780> top<00:04:14.139> are

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 
time as well as the balls at the top are

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:15.990 
time as well as the balls at the top are
the<00:04:14.500> ones<00:04:14.799> that<00:04:14.889> are<00:04:15.129> down<00:04:15.400> should<00:04:15.730> reach<00:04:15.969> the

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
the ones that are down should reach the

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.930 
the ones that are down should reach the
same<00:04:16.449> height<00:04:16.750> also<00:04:17.620> in<00:04:17.859> this<00:04:18.009> case<00:04:18.310> we'll<00:04:18.669> try

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
same height also in this case we'll try

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.240 
same height also in this case we'll try
to<00:04:19.000> follow<00:04:19.359> what<00:04:19.660> I<00:04:19.780> clear<00:04:20.139> out<00:04:20.350> in<00:04:20.709> step<00:04:20.979> 1

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
to follow what I clear out in step 1

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.240 
to follow what I clear out in step 1
they<00:04:22.210> shouldn't<00:04:22.660> get<00:04:22.990> together<00:04:23.259> the<00:04:23.889> parade

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
they shouldn't get together the parade

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.180 
they shouldn't get together the parade
or<00:04:24.669> go<00:04:24.970> to<00:04:25.030> a<00:04:25.270> different<00:04:25.539> direction<00:04:26.020> from<00:04:26.949> the

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
or go to a different direction from the

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:42.589 
or go to a different direction from the
hands<00:04:27.520> in<00:04:28.419> front<00:04:28.449> the<00:04:28.960> back<00:04:29.169> and<00:04:29.680> sides

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.469 

this<00:04:43.599> step<00:04:43.869> we<00:04:44.079> need<00:04:44.109> to<00:04:44.379> reach<00:04:44.589> the<00:04:44.799> ball

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
this step we need to reach the ball

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.269 
this step we need to reach the ball
taking<00:04:46.479> with<00:04:46.929> the<00:04:47.079> index<00:04:47.379> middle<00:04:47.709> and<00:04:47.979> thumb

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:48.279 
taking with the index middle and thumb

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:50.129 
taking with the index middle and thumb
finger<00:04:48.309> the<00:04:48.939> balls<00:04:49.209> that<00:04:49.329> goes<00:04:49.629> down<00:04:49.929> the

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
finger the balls that goes down the

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:58.169 
finger the balls that goes down the
version<00:04:55.469> will<00:04:56.469> repeat<00:04:56.829> the<00:04:56.979> step<00:04:57.249> 5<00:04:57.519> but<00:04:57.969> not

00:04:58.169 --> 00:04:58.179 
version will repeat the step 5 but not

00:04:58.179 --> 00:05:03.959 
version will repeat the step 5 but not
for<00:04:58.389> both<00:04:58.569> hands<00:04:58.899> and<00:04:59.469> then<00:04:59.739> turn<00:05:00.699> 18<00:05:01.119> day<00:05:02.969> we

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:03.969 
for both hands and then turn 18 day we

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:10.859 
for both hands and then turn 18 day we
will<00:05:04.119> practice<00:05:04.359> making<00:05:04.839> a<00:05:05.109> change<00:05:09.689> while<00:05:10.689> we

00:05:10.859 --> 00:05:10.869 
will practice making a change while we

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:12.959 
will practice making a change while we
do<00:05:11.079> the<00:05:11.229> five<00:05:11.469> ball<00:05:11.649> cascade<00:05:11.949> we<00:05:12.579> will<00:05:12.759> throw

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:12.969 
do the five ball cascade we will throw

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:15.419 
do the five ball cascade we will throw
one<00:05:13.299> ball<00:05:13.509> to<00:05:13.749> a<00:05:13.779> certain<00:05:14.169> time<00:05:14.439> and<00:05:14.799> we<00:05:15.249> will

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:15.429 
one ball to a certain time and we will

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:17.999 
one ball to a certain time and we will
catch<00:05:15.759> the<00:05:16.119> remaining<00:05:16.569> balls<00:05:16.779> we<00:05:17.349> will<00:05:17.589> repeat

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
catch the remaining balls we will repeat

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.249 
catch the remaining balls we will repeat
the<00:05:18.219> previous<00:05:18.489> steps<00:05:19.089> the<00:05:19.629> shifting<00:05:20.079> of<00:05:20.199> the

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:20.259 
the previous steps the shifting of the

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:21.959 
the previous steps the shifting of the
balls<00:05:20.649> is<00:05:20.889> paying<00:05:21.189> for<00:05:21.279> a<00:05:21.489> more<00:05:21.699> spectacular

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:21.969 
balls is paying for a more spectacular

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:28.559 
balls is paying for a more spectacular
looking<00:05:24.869> you<00:05:25.869> can<00:05:26.049> try<00:05:26.289> it<00:05:26.349> with<00:05:26.619> a<00:05:26.649> ball<00:05:27.569> with

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 
looking you can try it with a ball with

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.509 
looking you can try it with a ball with
a<00:05:28.599> different<00:05:29.109> color<00:05:29.379> from<00:05:29.679> the<00:05:29.799> folder<00:05:30.279> from

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:30.519 
a different color from the folder from

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:32.969 
a different color from the folder from
one<00:05:30.789> hand<00:05:31.119> and<00:05:31.389> the<00:05:31.449> other<00:05:31.989> one<00:05:32.439> that<00:05:32.709> has<00:05:32.949> a

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
one hand and the other one that has a

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.429 
one hand and the other one that has a
different<00:05:33.549> color<00:05:33.789> from<00:05:34.059> the<00:05:34.239> other<00:05:34.509> two<00:05:34.839> can

00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:35.439 
different color from the other two can

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:41.200 
different color from the other two can
be<00:05:35.469> the<00:05:36.129> one<00:05:36.399> you<00:05:36.669> can<00:05:36.819> throw<00:05:37.119> by<00:05:37.329> the<00:05:37.389> century

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.570 

repeat<00:05:42.210> it<00:05:42.360> again<00:05:42.750> and<00:05:42.960> again<00:05:43.080> it<00:05:44.070> will<00:05:44.310> look

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
repeat it again and again it will look

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:59.300 
repeat it again and again it will look
like<00:05:44.610> this

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:16.710
