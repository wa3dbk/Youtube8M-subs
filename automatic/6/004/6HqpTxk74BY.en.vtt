Welcome back to my Christmas craft show

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.180
I'm so excited you decided to join me today

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.900
I have a really neat and really simple craft for you

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.320
Paper snowflakes!

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.040
Now there's only a few supplies you need for this and you probably already have them at home

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.960
All you need is paper and scissors

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.500
Make sure you use kid-friendly scissors so you don't cut yourself

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.940
Now first we're going to fold our piece of paper into a square

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.800
Let's fold one side over until it reaches the other side

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.200
Now press it flat

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.060
See this extra bit of paper? We don't need that. You can cut it off

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.820
Now we have a square

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.140
Let's fold it back into a triangle

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.540
And now we're going to make an even smaller triangle

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.840
Fold one corner over to the other corner

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.900
And press it flat again

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.340
Now we have a medium sized triangle

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.840
Let's do it one more time

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.580
Fold one corner over to the other side

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.300
And press it flat

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.960
Now we have a baby triangle

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.360
Now we're going to start cutting

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.500
This is the best part because you get to design it

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.080
I like to do circles and squares and triangles

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.900
But you can do any shape you like

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.540
Make sure when you're cutting that you don't cut all the way across

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.520
Or your snowflake may fall apart

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.600
Great! Now we can unfold our snowflake and see what it looks like

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.880
You have to be really careful when you're unfolding it, sometimes it can get stuck together

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.360
It's beautiful! Let me see your snowflake.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.740
Oh wow! I love it!

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.580
You can make a bunch of these in different colors and decorate the wall

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.900
Or you could tie a string around it and hang them up

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.140
I bet your mom will love your snowflake Christmas decorations

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.040
Good job today bananas!

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.000
Merry Christmas!
