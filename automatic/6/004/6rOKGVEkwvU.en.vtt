00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:05.809
CHIBUREKKI

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.009
Today I will make chiburekki.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.079
This is the Crimean Tatar national dish.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.669
In translation "chiburekki" means "cruller".

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:21.890
Therefore we will fry in oil in a pan wok.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.609
Make the dough. It requires only flour, water and salt.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:35.170
Sift 5-6 cups of flour,

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.500
to make it be lush.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:49.820
Now add half a teaspoon of salt.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:59.400
Make a small dimple and pour 500 ml portions of water.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.460
Knead rather steep, stiff dough,

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.970
like for the dumplings.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:24.140
First by fork and then by the hands.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:41.830
If you get a sticky dough, add more flour.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.350
It turns out such a stiff dough.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.690
To knead it, you need to try hard.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:01.670
The dough is ready. We cover it with a lid and leave for 20-30 minutes.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.000
Chop onions (1-2 onions).

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.829
To do this, cut into pieces and put it in the mill.

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:17.659
You can just chop them finely with a knife.

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:29.659
Take a blender and grind.

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.929
Done.

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:37.089
Take the minced meat.

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:44.089
I have 500 grams of beef, but it is better to take a lamb.

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:55.689
Add the onion to the meat.

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:06.239
Add salt to your taste.

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.209
Necessarily add the peppers,

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.479
because chiburekki`s filling should be sharp.

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:23.249
I cried because of onion)))

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:27.569
Mix everything.

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:37.069
To this chopmeat we add 3 tablespoons of water.

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.989
Chopmeat is ready.

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.519
Now we are preparing chiburekki.

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.939
And the dough has become softened.

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:59.999
Pour into pan wok 300-500 ml of refined vegetable oil.

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:15.949
Heat the oil on a medium heat.

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:27.139
Sprinkle with flour table and roll out the dough.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:42.319
Sprinkle surface of the dough with flour, not to adhere to the rolling pin.

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:53.490
Roll out dough thinly (thickness 1.5-2 mm).

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.699
Dough turned out a lot for me. It does not fit even on the table.

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.100
Therefore take only half of the dough.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:18.629
I take the cap diameter of 16 cm and cut out piece of the dough.

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:24.089
Do not even need a knife.

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:33.540
Done! Another preform ...

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.599
It`s yet enough to demonstrate.

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:48.129
Take the chopmeat and place it on one half of preform.

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.139
Cover the chopmeat with dough

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:01.460
and very well joint edge.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:18.939
With shaped knife do wavy edge at chiburekki.

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:23.119
Does it look like chiburekki?

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:31.550
Lightly roll out it with a rolling pin to make chiburekki be flat.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.849
Do next pasties.

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:44.639
Prepared chiburekki put in boiling oil.

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.199
There will be enough two pieces for now.

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:50.779
We wait until they are browned on one side, then turn over to the other.

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:57.779
Ready chiburekki put on the grill to let drip down the excess oil.

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:09.399
Now prepare the next portion of chiburekki.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:20.860
Chiburekki are already dried. We shift them in a bowl

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:26.960
and cover with a lid.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.990
I get a whole bowl of delicious golden chiburekki.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.960
Bon appetit!

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:46.960
