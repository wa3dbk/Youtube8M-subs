00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.739
 use the key to enter 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.940

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:09.939
 limit this space here this size 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.370

 value for money far away the price of 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.030

 technical clarification is 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:59.209
 more question of value 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:04:02.480

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.080
 is mainly on the court 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.720
