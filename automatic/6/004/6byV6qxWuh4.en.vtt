00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
today it's a J here from the alive deaf

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.620 
today it's a J here from the alive deaf
team<00:00:15.320> again<00:00:15.820> and<00:00:16.820> today<00:00:17.180> I'm<00:00:17.330> gonna<00:00:17.450> have<00:00:17.599> a

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
team again and today I'm gonna have a

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.310 
team again and today I'm gonna have a
look<00:00:17.810> at<00:00:17.990> the<00:00:18.170> combo<00:00:18.950> module<00:00:19.869> so<00:00:20.869> the<00:00:20.990> convoy

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
look at the combo module so the convoy

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.859 
look at the combo module so the convoy
mojo<00:00:21.740> is<00:00:21.860> a<00:00:21.890> new<00:00:22.250> military<00:00:23.180> module<00:00:23.630> that

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
mojo is a new military module that

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.620 
mojo is a new military module that
assembles<00:00:24.770> groups<00:00:25.610> of<00:00:25.789> vehicles<00:00:26.270> into<00:00:26.599> a

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
assembles groups of vehicles into a

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.279 
assembles groups of vehicles into a
convoy<00:00:27.020> and<00:00:27.259> moves<00:00:28.220> in<00:00:28.430> between<00:00:29.140> point<00:00:30.140> to

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
convoy and moves in between point to

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.500 
convoy and moves in between point to
point<00:00:30.529> on<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:30.949> map<00:00:31.130> so<00:00:31.730> I'll<00:00:31.820> just<00:00:32.029> start<00:00:32.300> by

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
point on the map so I'll just start by

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.080 
point on the map so I'll just start by
placing<00:00:32.750> just<00:00:33.350> them

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
placing just them

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.780 
placing just them
the<00:00:35.090> convoy<00:00:35.540> module<00:00:36.050> dance

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
the convoy module dance

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.450 
the convoy module dance
as<00:00:38.510> usual<00:00:39.050> I've<00:00:39.140> got<00:00:39.380> the<00:00:39.590> profile<00:00:40.010> system

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
as usual I've got the profile system

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.360 
as usual I've got the profile system
module<00:00:40.910> the<00:00:41.540> requires<00:00:41.930> a<00:00:42.140> love<00:00:42.350> module<00:00:42.920> and

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
module the requires a love module and

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.819 
module the requires a love module and
the<00:00:43.940> admin<00:00:44.240> actions<00:00:44.660> module<00:00:45.170> damn

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.680 

okay<00:00:50.829> so<00:00:50.890> I<00:00:51.129> can<00:00:51.309> just<00:00:51.489> place<00:00:51.699> this<00:00:52.059> I've<00:00:52.539> got

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
okay so I can just place this I've got

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.189 
okay so I can just place this I've got
debug<00:00:53.109> on<00:00:53.579> low<00:00:54.579> intensity<00:00:55.120> of<00:00:55.300> convoys<00:00:55.719> and

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
debug on low intensity of convoys and

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.680 
debug on low intensity of convoys and
I'm<00:00:56.949> using<00:00:57.280> up<00:00:57.670> four<00:00:58.000> for<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.329> convoy

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
I'm using up four for the convoy

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.200 
I'm using up four for the convoy
fraction

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
fraction

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.990 
fraction
I<00:01:00.560> said<00:01:01.560> it's<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> Montreal<00:01:02.400> it's<00:01:02.640> far<00:01:02.910> out

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
I said it's the Montreal it's far out

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.100 
I said it's the Montreal it's far out
the<00:01:03.120> mission<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.660> look

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
the mission and have a look

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.440 
the mission and have a look
okay<00:01:06.070> so<00:01:06.130> we're<00:01:06.400> in<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.520> mission<00:01:06.940> we<00:01:07.090> can<00:01:07.240> see

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
okay so we're in the mission we can see

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.990 
okay so we're in the mission we can see
that<00:01:07.660> with<00:01:08.230> debug<00:01:08.680> I'm<00:01:08.860> showing<00:01:09.310> whether<00:01:09.610> the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
that with debug I'm showing whether the

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.970 
that with debug I'm showing whether the
convoy<00:01:10.420> will<00:01:10.690> start<00:01:11.680> and<00:01:11.890> stop<00:01:12.220> I<00:01:12.960> can<00:01:13.980> use

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
convoy will start and stop I can use

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.920 
convoy will start and stop I can use
admin<00:01:15.370> actions<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:16.030> show<00:01:16.060> where<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.480> actual

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
admin actions to show where the actual

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.350 
admin actions to show where the actual
Conway<00:01:17.470> vehicles<00:01:18.040> are<00:01:20.760> just<00:01:21.760> by<00:01:22.030> activating

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
Conway vehicles are just by activating

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.760 
Conway vehicles are just by activating
the<00:01:22.690> marking<00:01:23.080> units<00:01:23.440> function<00:01:25.470> okay<00:01:26.470> so<00:01:26.500> we

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
the marking units function okay so we

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.920 
the marking units function okay so we
can<00:01:26.920> see<00:01:27.100> they're<00:01:27.280> starting<00:01:27.700> at<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:27.970> airfield

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.720 

so<00:01:31.930> here's<00:01:32.170> our<00:01:32.320> convoy<00:01:32.800> getting<00:01:33.160> ready<00:01:33.340> to

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
so here's our convoy getting ready to

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.260 
so here's our convoy getting ready to
head<00:01:34.150> off<00:01:35.370> so<00:01:36.370> you've<00:01:36.520> got<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.700> variety<00:01:36.910> of

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
head off so you've got a variety of

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:46.710 
head off so you've got a variety of
different<00:01:37.840> vehicles<00:01:45.240> okay<00:01:46.240> so<00:01:46.300> that<00:01:46.570> was

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
different vehicles okay so that was

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.720 
different vehicles okay so that was
using<00:01:47.230> the<00:01:47.410> convoy<00:01:47.770> module<00:01:48.190> in<00:01:48.310> its<00:01:48.460> most

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
using the convoy module in its most

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.690 
using the convoy module in its most
simple<00:01:49.510> way<00:01:49.750> just<00:01:50.260> it'll<00:01:51.040> pick<00:01:51.310> random

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
simple way just it'll pick random

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.860 
simple way just it'll pick random
locations<00:01:52.330> and<00:01:52.740> move<00:01:53.740> around<00:01:53.980> on<00:01:54.370> the<00:01:54.490> map<00:01:54.870> you

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
locations and move around on the map you

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.440 
locations and move around on the map you
can<00:01:55.900> also<00:01:56.080> place<00:01:56.530> two<00:01:56.950> convoy<00:01:57.730> modules<00:01:58.180> so<00:01:58.360> you

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
can also place two convoy modules so you

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.300 
can also place two convoy modules so you
can<00:01:58.630> have<00:01:58.810> a<00:01:59.080> blue<00:01:59.860> full-function

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.660 

so<00:02:05.000> I<00:02:05.030> set<00:02:05.480> this<00:02:05.630> one<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:05.900> blue<00:02:06.350> for

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.550 

okay<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:12.910> I<00:02:12.940> can<00:02:13.150> say<00:02:13.330> that<00:02:13.360> now<00:02:13.630> we've<00:02:13.810> got<00:02:14.050> two

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
okay so I can say that now we've got two

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.030 
okay so I can say that now we've got two
convoys<00:02:15.070> in<00:02:15.100> progress<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:19.350> see<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.620> playful

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
convoys in progress you see the playful

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.650 
convoys in progress you see the playful
ones<00:02:21.220> are<00:02:21.370> studying<00:02:21.700> here<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.300> know<00:02:22.360> for

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
ones are studying here and you know for

00:02:22.660 --> 00:03:17.020 
ones are studying here and you know for
one<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.990> starting<00:02:23.350> heat

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.000 

ok<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.090> now<00:03:18.390> we've<00:03:18.510> got<00:03:18.690> two<00:03:18.960> factions<00:03:19.470> just

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
ok so now we've got two factions just

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.370 
ok so now we've got two factions just
random<00:03:20.520> convoys<00:03:21.090> appearing<00:03:21.780> on<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.020> map<00:03:22.200> at

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
random convoys appearing on the map at

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.880 
random convoys appearing on the map at
various<00:03:22.740> times<00:03:22.980> if<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:24.060> want<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.270> make<00:03:24.420> it

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
various times if you want to make it

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.890 
various times if you want to make it
more<00:03:25.890> realistic<00:03:26.160> though<00:03:26.610> you<00:03:27.270> can<00:03:27.450> link<00:03:27.660> them

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
more realistic though you can link them

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.260 
more realistic though you can link them
up<00:03:28.020> to<00:03:28.319> opcom<00:03:29.220> modules<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.940> then<00:03:30.090> they'll

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
up to opcom modules and then they'll

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.560 
up to opcom modules and then they'll
actually<00:03:30.390> convoy<00:03:31.200> between<00:03:31.970> locations<00:03:32.970> that

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
actually convoy between locations that

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.750 
actually convoy between locations that
the<00:03:33.690> outcome<00:03:34.110> is<00:03:34.380> already<00:03:34.890> in<00:03:35.790> control<00:03:36.300> of<00:03:37.760> so

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
the outcome is already in control of so

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.960 
the outcome is already in control of so
I'll<00:03:38.820> just<00:03:39.000> make<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.209> quick<00:03:39.450> -<00:03:39.840> faction

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
I'll just make a quick - faction

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.350 
I'll just make a quick - faction
military<00:03:41.970> placement<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:42.840> opcom<00:03:44.120> mission<00:03:45.120> and

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
military placement and opcom mission and

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.050 
military placement and opcom mission and
then<00:03:46.200> I'll<00:03:46.350> link<00:03:46.560> their<00:03:46.860> convoys<00:03:47.310> up<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.819> the

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
then I'll link their convoys up to the

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:58.150 
then I'll link their convoys up to the
outcomes

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:05:07.010 

you

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.600 

okay<00:05:08.010> so<00:05:08.070> we've<00:05:08.370> got<00:05:09.680> up<00:05:10.680> foreign<00:05:11.100> control<00:05:11.460> of

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
okay so we've got up foreign control of

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.120 
okay so we've got up foreign control of
the<00:05:11.760> North<00:05:12.000> Australis<00:05:12.690> and<00:05:13.470> blue<00:05:13.770> fur<00:05:13.980> and

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
the North Australis and blue fur and

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.450 
the North Australis and blue fur and
control<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.610> South<00:05:14.880> Estrada's<00:05:16.010> we've<00:05:17.010> got<00:05:17.250> a

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
control the South Estrada's we've got a

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.150 
control the South Estrada's we've got a
place<00:05:18.000> for<00:05:18.030> modules<00:05:18.690> so<00:05:19.320> just<00:05:19.620> need<00:05:19.800> to<00:05:19.950> think

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
place for modules so just need to think

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.490 
place for modules so just need to think
our<00:05:20.700> magic<00:05:21.180> convoy<00:05:21.510> modules<00:05:21.960> to<00:05:22.290> the<00:05:22.320> up

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
our magic convoy modules to the up

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:30.560 
our magic convoy modules to the up
commercials

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.770 

okay<00:05:31.260> so<00:05:31.320> once<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:31.830> up<00:05:32.100> comes<00:05:32.400> of<00:05:32.640> secured<00:05:33.150> um

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
okay so once the up comes of secured um

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.500 
okay so once the up comes of secured um
at<00:05:34.230> least<00:05:34.310> three<00:05:35.310> locations<00:05:35.730> they<00:05:36.210> have<00:05:36.360> to

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
at least three locations they have to

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.220 
at least three locations they have to
have<00:05:36.630> three<00:05:36.840> locations<00:05:37.020> to<00:05:37.620> set<00:05:37.830> up<00:05:37.920> convoy

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
have three locations to set up convoy

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.320 
have three locations to set up convoy
the<00:05:40.230> convoys<00:05:40.620> was<00:05:40.860> born<00:05:41.220> near<00:05:42.090> military

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
the convoys was born near military

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.240 
the convoys was born near military
locations<00:05:43.140> and<00:05:43.560> sort<00:05:43.800> of<00:05:43.860> moved<00:05:44.100> between

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
locations and sort of moved between

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.340 
locations and sort of moved between
military<00:05:44.850> locations<00:05:45.600> so<00:05:45.750> you<00:05:45.810> can<00:05:45.990> see<00:05:46.200> not

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
military locations so you can see not

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.250 
military locations so you can see not
for<00:05:46.620> one<00:05:46.820> which<00:05:47.820> is<00:05:48.060> around<00:05:48.510> some<00:05:49.080> of<00:05:49.200> the

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
for one which is around some of the

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260 
for one which is around some of the
bases<00:05:49.680> between<00:05:50.010> the<00:05:50.310> airfield<00:05:50.730> and<00:05:50.970> some<00:05:51.210> of

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
bases between the airfield and some of

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.470 
bases between the airfield and some of
the<00:05:51.330> bases<00:05:51.660> over<00:05:51.960> here<00:05:52.230> and<00:05:52.470> I'm<00:05:52.560> live<00:05:52.770> for<00:05:52.950> one

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
the bases over here and I'm live for one

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.340 
the bases over here and I'm live for one
that's<00:05:54.980> starting<00:05:55.980> over<00:05:56.130> here<00:05:56.610> going<00:05:57.450> to<00:05:57.600> Air

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
that's starting over here going to Air

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:03.340 
that's starting over here going to Air
Station<00:05:58.860> Mike<00:05:59.070> and<00:05:59.310> finishing<00:05:59.760> up<00:05:59.910> down<00:06:00.120> here

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.250 

okay<00:06:04.350> so<00:06:04.380> we<00:06:04.560> can<00:06:04.710> see<00:06:04.860> that<00:06:05.070> the<00:06:05.930> up<00:06:06.930> for

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
okay so we can see that the up for

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.040 
okay so we can see that the up for
convoy<00:06:07.650> is<00:06:07.850> moving<00:06:08.850> off<00:06:09.000> from<00:06:09.330> the<00:06:09.540> airfield

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
convoy is moving off from the airfield

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.920 
convoy is moving off from the airfield
starting<00:06:10.800> location<00:06:11.430> on<00:06:11.670> its<00:06:11.850> way<00:06:12.060> across<00:06:12.630> the

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
starting location on its way across the

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:48.340 
starting location on its way across the
to<00:06:13.830> the<00:06:13.950> eastern<00:06:14.340> side<00:06:14.610> of<00:06:14.670> Stratis

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.000 

and<00:06:48.710> here<00:06:49.010> we<00:06:49.100> can<00:06:49.250> see<00:06:49.520> the<00:06:49.700> blue<00:06:49.910> for<00:06:50.150> Conway

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.010 
and here we can see the blue for Conway

00:06:51.010 --> 00:07:08.390 
and here we can see the blue for Conway
just<00:06:52.010> filling<00:06:52.460> up<00:06:52.550> the<00:06:52.850> air<00:06:53.090> station<00:06:53.540> Mike

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.100 

so<00:07:09.400> there's<00:07:09.610> a<00:07:09.730> bit<00:07:10.180> of<00:07:10.300> a<00:07:10.360> look<00:07:10.510> at<00:07:10.630> how<00:07:10.780> to<00:07:10.840> use

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.110 
so there's a bit of a look at how to use

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.350 
so there's a bit of a look at how to use
the<00:07:11.350> convoy<00:07:11.770> modules<00:07:12.280> how<00:07:12.670> you<00:07:12.730> can<00:07:12.970> use<00:07:13.180> them

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 
the convoy modules how you can use them

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.440 
the convoy modules how you can use them
by<00:07:13.690> themselves<00:07:14.470> just<00:07:14.740> to<00:07:15.700> spawn<00:07:15.970> random

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:16.450 
by themselves just to spawn random

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.570 
by themselves just to spawn random
convoys<00:07:16.900> and<00:07:17.350> how<00:07:17.560> you<00:07:17.740> can<00:07:17.920> use<00:07:18.130> them<00:07:18.340> when

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:18.580 
convoys and how you can use them when

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.560 
convoys and how you can use them when
they're<00:07:18.820> synced<00:07:19.300> up<00:07:19.720> comm<00:07:20.020> modules<00:07:20.520> to

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:21.570 
they're synced up comm modules to

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.630 
they're synced up comm modules to
perform<00:07:22.570> convoys<00:07:23.200> between<00:07:23.770> opcom<00:07:24.340> health

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:24.640 
perform convoys between opcom health

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.820 
perform convoys between opcom health
objectives
