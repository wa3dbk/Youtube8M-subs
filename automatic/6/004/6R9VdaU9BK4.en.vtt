00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.320
 for this product clearly Peruvian and 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.070
 it is already hot we are going to take 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.070
 Firstly 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.130
 the caramelito tealita and the cabo de 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.560
 odor 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.190
 abundance for aromatizing and flavor 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.580
 I did a little bit if we were going to take the corn 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.580
 now 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.690

 let's go quinoa 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:54.120
 peking we are going to throw roasted barley 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.200
 knowing that I am 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:13.430
 today and today we have come here 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.330
 plus the young students of the race 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.070
 astronomy to be able to elaborate this 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.200
 delicious chicha de jora that is a 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.030
 clearly Peruvian product and that 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.870
 prepared according to the zones of 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.970
 production if in this case we are 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.800
 adding quinoa and we are the great 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.540
 barley but according to the area then 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.800
 add other types of cereals 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:40.250
 legumes and and it's going to have to boil 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.300
 for half an hour yes at least on average 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.820
 one hour 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.890
 once boiled well well we carry 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:50.260
 in abundant water what we are going to do 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:53.130
 It is in a clay jar of preference 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.350
 Lets put 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.980
 this since it is the chancaca is what goes 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.370
 to sweeten if it's already scratched itchy and 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.990
 let's strain that chicha de jora 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.630
 We are going to boil it and we are going to 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.730
 dilute and sweeten if we lack sugar and 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.180
 we do not have the chancaca we can 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.480
 use your car carriage alternately if 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.880
 ok perfect so then we boiled half 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.150
 hour an hour very well and that reduce the 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.390
 we throw it to the old mud 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.890
 if we can give you up to two meals 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.920
 perfectly and from there we put it to 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.610
 ferment the fermentation minimum 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.700
 recommended is 12 days and we leave in 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.500
 the liddy jar at 2 days we see and 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.040
 until ferment and we have a drink 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.410
 personal alcoholic 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.360
 now that he tells us it's different 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.940
 depending on the page area groff 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.220
 is now corn hollis the base if 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.470
 will always carry corn now but 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.810
 alternatively cereals vary 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.600
 legumes in some cases right 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.480
 only in roasted barley in other cases 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.269
 the extract 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.980
 you can be cast in this case not 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.750
 we are here you can not miss it 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.610
 kiwicha not these vary according to 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.810
 to the production area because of 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.760
 according to what the sculptor 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.830
 he produces goes adding his to his drink 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.199
 alcoholic then alternately 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.870
 also as I said, cascarita is 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:22.210
 of pineapple some raises like this for 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.710
 accompany in the boil to help 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.120
 the flavors 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.770
 and now fermentation I have tried 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.750
 teacher the school chicha 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.560
 Ayacucho in Huamanga when Holy Week 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.560
 what good 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:43.090
 to take the boat we are moving forward 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.610
 very good 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.110
 look clear in the north that custom already 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:52.770
 the small clay pots are 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:55.419
 call if there are not small and big like 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.840
 They are little chicks, big 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:02.199
 by two big declared already good 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.009
 we continue serving serving and it was 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:08.749
 against sin risk 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.749
 He has a lot of that in his house 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.729
 how long does it not say that you have to 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.919
 allow 22 days of at least two days to 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.479
 a week and then to have it at home 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.139
 we can save it in alumni any 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:25.690
 environment we put it in bottles 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.820
 that can be glass a truck 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.130
 plastic and we would receive it from 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.919
 preference to be able to cut the 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.330
 fermentation if it does not get very acidic 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:37.330
 too fermented goes too high 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.300
 severe folic acid and then it makes you acidic and 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.639
 they no longer let them be aggravated and 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:49.410
 perfect and so for the magic and the 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:49.410
 television then 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:10.139
 we already have our family swept 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.139
 so they can try and taste 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.610

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.139

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:44.710
 cost and I can seen the liters in passing 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:48.909
