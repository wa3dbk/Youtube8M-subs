00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
so we see here activation required in

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.750 
so we see here activation required in
the<00:04:15.470> phone<00:04:15.740> I<00:04:18.100> believe<00:04:19.100> this<00:04:19.250> is<00:04:19.310> something

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
believe it's a ground control so I don't
