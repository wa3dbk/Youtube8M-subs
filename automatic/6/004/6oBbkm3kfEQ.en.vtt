mean<00:03:53.940> it's<00:03:54.120> probably<00:03:54.540> if<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:55.049> millisecond

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
mean it's probably if you millisecond

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.150 
mean it's probably if you millisecond
delay<00:03:56.069> here<00:03:56.780> but<00:03:57.780> it's<00:03:57.900> not<00:03:58.049> bad

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
delay here but it's not bad

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.949 
delay here but it's not bad
all's<00:03:59.459> well<00:03:59.819> is<00:04:00.030> if<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:00.359> come<00:04:00.540> up<00:04:00.690> here<00:04:00.930> you

beta and let me show you guys how how
this<00:04:38.440> actually<00:04:38.620> looks<00:04:38.950> so<00:04:40.050> I've<00:04:41.050> tried<00:04:41.410> using

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
this actually looks so I've tried using

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.760 
this actually looks so I've tried using
also<00:04:42.040> the<00:04:42.250> Xbox<00:04:43.240> 360<00:04:43.750> controller<00:04:43.780> and<00:04:44.440> the

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
also the Xbox 360 controller and the

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.590 
also the Xbox 360 controller and the
wireless<00:04:45.340> controller<00:04:45.580> plugged<00:04:46.150> in<00:04:46.360> through

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
wireless controller plugged in through

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.240 
wireless controller plugged in through
the<00:04:46.690> wire<00:04:46.840> did<00:04:47.140> not<00:04:47.350> work<00:04:47.620> I<00:04:47.830> believe<00:04:48.010> if<00:04:48.190> you

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
the wire did not work I believe if you

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.580 
the wire did not work I believe if you
have<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.400> hard<00:04:48.700> wired<00:04:49.030> 360<00:04:49.960> controller<00:04:50.320> that

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
have a hard wired 360 controller that

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.250 
have a hard wired 360 controller that
will<00:04:50.860> work<00:04:51.150> Microsoft<00:04:52.150> is<00:04:52.390> also<00:04:52.780> putting<00:04:53.050> out

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
will work Microsoft is also putting out

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.590 
will work Microsoft is also putting out
a<00:04:53.530> in<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.370> coming<00:04:54.640> months<00:04:55.030> here<00:04:55.270> a<00:04:55.300> little

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
a in the coming months here a little

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.780 
a in the coming months here a little
wireless<00:04:56.410> adapter<00:04:57.010> that<00:04:57.160> you<00:04:57.220> can<00:04:57.430> plug<00:04:57.610> into

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
wireless adapter that you can plug into

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.910 
wireless adapter that you can plug into
your<00:04:57.880> laptop<00:04:58.200> so<00:04:59.200> that<00:04:59.230> you<00:04:59.440> don't<00:04:59.620> have<00:04:59.740> to

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
your laptop so that you don't have to

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:14.020 
your laptop so that you don't have to
wire<00:05:00.580> in<00:05:00.940> your<00:05:01.690> controller<00:05:02.170> as<00:05:02.500> well

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.870 

alright<00:05:15.030> here's<00:05:15.570> a<00:05:15.630> look<00:05:15.780> at<00:05:15.960> geometry<00:05:16.470> wars

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
alright here's a look at geometry wars

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.590 
alright here's a look at geometry wars
this<00:05:17.880> actually<00:05:18.270> works<00:05:18.620> very<00:05:19.620> well<00:05:20.600> playing

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
this actually works very well playing

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:28.540 
this actually works very well playing
the<00:05:21.690> hell<00:05:21.780> out<00:05:21.930> of<00:05:21.960> this<00:05:22.139> earlier

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:36.210 

all<00:05:29.550> right<00:05:29.759> so<00:05:30.029> here's<00:05:30.210> a<00:05:30.240> look<00:05:30.389> at<00:05:30.509> Forza

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.430 

so<00:05:36.820> again<00:05:37.030> I've<00:05:37.450> got<00:05:37.720> my<00:05:37.840> graphics<00:05:38.260> set<00:05:38.410> a

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
so again I've got my graphics set a

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.080 
so again I've got my graphics set a
medium<00:05:38.800> I<00:05:38.920> think<00:05:39.070> this<00:05:39.190> looks<00:05:39.370> pretty<00:05:39.670> well

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
medium I think this looks pretty well

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.200 
medium I think this looks pretty well
pretty<00:05:40.840> good<00:05:41.020> um

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
pretty good um

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.410 
pretty good um
the<00:05:43.210> response<00:05:43.720> time<00:05:44.880> while<00:05:45.880> it<00:05:46.000> might<00:05:46.150> be<00:05:46.300> like

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
the response time while it might be like

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.680 
the response time while it might be like
a<00:05:46.480> millisecond<00:05:47.140> off<00:05:47.350> this<00:05:47.560> is<00:05:47.770> great

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
a millisecond off this is great

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:57.150 
a millisecond off this is great
so<00:05:49.770> instead<00:05:50.770> of<00:05:50.860> watching<00:05:55.020> Super<00:05:56.020> Why<00:05:56.230> or
