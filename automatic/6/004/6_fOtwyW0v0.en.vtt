00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.610
 hello how about you salute duch sativa and 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:08.460
 this one let's talk about xbox 1 and 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:13.940
 microsoft a boy who passed good 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:19.199
 Microsoft does not own xbox one.com 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:21.920
 and it's going to be a trial of a boy who 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.350
 he has a boy who registered xbox 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.180
 one.com because you will say and it is good that you 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.130
 meta judgment that this what to others and 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.590
 it's very good it's fine very well but 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.180
 here is something that favors this 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.980
 boy suddenly did it 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.810
 you with bad intention suddenly 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.710
 he was a worker on may 2 who passed him the 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:45.670
 data but the funny thing is that this 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.030
 boy has registered xbox.com does more 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.030
 two years 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.850
 more than two years ago this xbox one.com 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.960
 was registered and obviously the people 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:02.320
 of microsoft wants yes or yes to grab the 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.600
 xbox one.com domain and you will do 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.130
 this trial and you go to all the 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.759
 legal disputes not for this 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.950
 boy do not use xbox one.com me from my 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.690
 part would say that ideally the best would be 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.430
 to pay him guys you know it's your 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.229
 domain I have said it very well there you 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.539
 we pay to let us let us use it 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.429
 but on the other hand we have if people 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.440
 from microsoft knew that this domain 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:26.080
 I was registered two years ago 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.750
 because they did not change the name to xbox 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.090
 1 So gentlemen start a dispute 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.590
 legal and the day goes to Tuesday because 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.229
 tomorrow is 'memorial day' if I'm wrong 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.970
 usa memorial day on Monday and 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.900
 that on Tuesday we will know more about 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.690
 this 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.020
 about this dispute this is all this 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.540
 domain was registered on 11 but in 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.230
 December 2011 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.910
 so out there a little face I did not know 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.680
 what is registered 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.260
 you have to give another name to the xbox 1 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.930
 no better we better hope and do 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.910
