00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:22.009
 second video of our channel 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.529
 tutorials mx before it was called jp 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:27.800
 Android let's change it because I 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:31.130
 in my cousin dani we did not go out and the 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.820
 we call mx cousins ​​tutorials but now 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.010
 is going to call tutorials in mind 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.180
 in this video we are going to show you how 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:45.760
 fix their boxes or their caps 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:49.820
 xbox for wireless controls 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.730
 Well, as you can see here we see a 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.570
 control that does not have claw like for 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.230
 piss here 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.630
 do not have here if you have since you do not have 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.870
 Well this is because we put the 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:07.619
 Earth is water 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.860
 and since it says nothing of repair, it does not 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.690
 I'm going to vote, I did not vote, it still serves 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.350
 So we see a little box that is 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.350
 complete 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.219
 so we are going to try them for 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:26.210
 What friends can you see here? 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:30.319
 a control normally with the box with 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.770
 the box that work and then you will see that 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:35.470
 one works and then for more than 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.690
 let us answer the 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.690
 the other box that is spoiled 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.160
 why 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.970
 they do not learn or because they know 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:03.320
 I could one 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:06.020
 the one thing that is still the 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.990
 the little hooks that make for the 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.319
 control and then we are going to give them 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.859
 a solution to repair it 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.859
 good 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.430
 Eastern low I need they will need 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.720
 friends so what the batteries when 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.150
 need is copper simply copper 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.360
 they are not going to spend more they can not get 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.460
 in the cables that no longer serve them as 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.460
 those of like these 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.890
 these are the short snows that bring 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.410
 copper with find in body what 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.670
 they buy but it 's very cheap more expensive than 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.640
 it costs many hours we need a 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.340
 little bit good, what they are going to do is 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.510
 the following 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.580
 what they have to do is copper 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.280
 that is to say the puñeta is going it to 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.560
 put here 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.220
 for the side where you do not have the hook 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.220
 good 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.069

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.660
 a whole necklace 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.330
 until you are developed 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.240
 and they will leave a puntita ie the 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:28.200
 final to finish it we will be 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:32.150
 and rolled like water 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.750

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:41.000
 where they have to leave this something copper 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:43.760
 jumped the alarms and then if nothing 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.500

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.030
 They are from your mom 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.030
