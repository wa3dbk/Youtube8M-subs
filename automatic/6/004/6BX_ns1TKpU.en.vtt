right twist the way I do right twist is
stick<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.900> right<00:00:25.109> needle<00:00:25.380> through<00:00:25.890> both<00:00:25.949> of

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
stick the right needle through both of

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.900 
stick the right needle through both of
the<00:00:26.580> two<00:00:26.760> stitches<00:00:27.300> as<00:00:27.980> if<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.519> knit<00:00:29.550> two

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
the two stitches as if to knit two

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.120 
the two stitches as if to knit two
together<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.500> stitch<00:00:31.740> which<00:00:31.949> is

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
together so the the stitch which is

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.920 
together so the the stitch which is
currently<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.790> left<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.329> going<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.809> be

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
currently on the left is going to be

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.229 
currently on the left is going to be
twisted<00:00:34.320> right<00:00:34.530> over<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> next<00:00:35.430> one<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:36.090> you

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
twisted right over the next one so you

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.350 
twisted right over the next one so you
stop<00:00:36.600> one<00:00:37.110> stitch<00:00:37.350> before<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.800> top<00:00:38.610> stitch<00:00:38.879> so

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
stop one stitch before the top stitch so

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.760 
stop one stitch before the top stitch so
stick<00:00:39.660> your<00:00:39.690> right<00:00:39.989> hand<00:00:40.200> needle<00:00:40.469> through

on the Left nu and now they're in the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.069 
on the Left nu and now they're in the
correct<00:00:53.760> order<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.420> one<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.690> used<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.899> be<00:00:54.989> on

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
correct order the one that used to be on

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.229 
correct order the one that used to be on
the<00:00:55.170> left<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.590> now<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> right<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:57.090> it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the left is now on the right so it

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.510 
the left is now on the right so it
twisted<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:57.840> over<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> other<00:00:58.559> one<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:59.460> the

twisted right over the other one now the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520 
twisted right over the other one now the
only<00:00:59.760> thing<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.239> they're<00:01:00.570> now<00:01:00.780> positioned

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
only thing is they're now positioned

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.910 
only thing is they're now positioned
twisted<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:03.210> needle<00:01:03.719> each<00:01:04.229> each

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
twisted on the needle each each

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.130 
twisted on the needle each each
individual<00:01:05.549> stitch<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.970> now<00:01:06.150> twisted<00:01:06.840> if<00:01:06.990> I

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
individual stitch is now twisted if I

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.880 
individual stitch is now twisted if I
knit<00:01:07.380> through<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.619> front<00:01:07.920> loop<00:01:08.040> it'll<00:01:08.430> become

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
knit through the front loop it'll become

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.410 
knit through the front loop it'll become
twisted<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.369> what<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.760> need<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.240> just

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
twisted so what I need to do is just

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.420 
twisted so what I need to do is just
knit<00:01:12.600> through<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.810> back<00:01:12.930> loop<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:14.250> untwist<00:01:14.580> it

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
knit through the back loop to untwist it

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.109 
knit through the back loop to untwist it
so<00:01:17.430> knit<00:01:17.790> through<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.000> back<00:01:18.090> loop<00:01:20.060> there<00:01:21.060> you

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
so knit through the back loop there you

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:21.530 
so knit through the back loop there you
go

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
go

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.149 
go
same<00:01:22.229> with<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.470> back<00:01:22.619> one<00:01:22.799> they're<00:01:23.009> both

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
same with the back one they're both

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.609 
same with the back one they're both
twisted<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.090> knit<00:01:24.390> through<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.600> back<00:01:24.659> loop

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.649 

and<00:01:28.619> there<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.579> go<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.880> one<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.210> used<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.540> be

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
and there you go the one that used to be

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
through the back loop loop now I'll show

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.420 
through the back loop loop now I'll show
you<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.570> left<00:01:45.810> twist<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> left<00:01:46.799> twist<00:01:46.979> um

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
they're twisted on the needle so the

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.640 
they're twisted on the needle so the
same<00:04:25.760> as<00:04:25.970> one<00:04:26.420> over<00:04:26.540> one<00:04:26.750> you<00:04:27.020> knit<00:04:27.440> through

the back loops to untwist them so they

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.600 
the back loops to untwist them so they
are<00:04:31.190> positioned<00:04:31.520> correctly<00:04:33.190> so<00:04:34.190> knit<00:04:34.460> that

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610

crept order knit the top stitch through

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:18.550 
crept order knit the top stitch through
the<00:05:11.060> back<00:05:11.210> loop<00:05:11.330> to<00:05:13.030> untwist<00:05:14.030> it<00:05:17.260> now<00:05:18.260> because

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
the back loop to untwist it now because

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.950 
the back loop to untwist it now because
these<00:05:18.770> stitches<00:05:19.430> our<00:05:19.760> position<00:05:20.270> twisted<00:05:20.780> on

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
these stitches our position twisted on

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.680 
these stitches our position twisted on
the<00:05:21.080> needle<00:05:21.380> you<00:05:21.920> need<00:05:22.070> to<00:05:22.190> slip<00:05:22.460> them<00:05:22.690> this

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
the needle you need to slip them this

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.930 
the needle you need to slip them this
way<00:05:23.900> like<00:05:24.290> through<00:05:24.530> the<00:05:24.650> back<00:05:24.800> loop<00:05:25.070> so

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
way like through the back loop so

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.580 
way like through the back loop so
they're<00:05:26.300> positioned<00:05:26.810> correctly<00:05:26.930> on<00:05:27.260> the<00:05:27.410> new

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
they're positioned correctly on the new

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.590 
they're positioned correctly on the new
right<00:05:28.040> hand<00:05:28.220> needle<00:05:28.310> so<00:05:29.090> instead<00:05:29.330> of<00:05:29.390> slipping

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
right hand needle so instead of slipping

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.310 
right hand needle so instead of slipping
them<00:05:29.930> like<00:05:30.230> this<00:05:30.500> you<00:05:31.190> know<00:05:31.310> purl<00:05:31.850> wise<00:05:32.320> you

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
them like this you know purl wise you

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.640 
them like this you know purl wise you
want<00:05:33.500> to<00:05:33.590> slip<00:05:33.830> them<00:05:34.600> through<00:05:35.600> the<00:05:36.080> back<00:05:36.320> loop

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
want to slip them through the back loop

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.830 
want to slip them through the back loop
like<00:05:36.890> that<00:05:37.130> that<00:05:38.090> way<00:05:38.240> they're<00:05:38.390> positioned

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
like that that way they're positioned

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.270 
like that that way they're positioned
correctly<00:05:38.960> so<00:05:39.650> when<00:05:39.800> you<00:05:39.890> go<00:05:40.040> back<00:05:40.250> through

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
correctly so when you go back through

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.310 
correctly so when you go back through
and<00:05:40.550> knit<00:05:40.790> the<00:05:40.910> row<00:05:41.060> later<00:05:42.050> in<00:05:42.230> the

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
and knit the row later in the

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.840 
and knit the row later in the
contrasting<00:05:42.830> color<00:05:43.040> you<00:05:43.310> don't<00:05:43.520> have<00:05:43.730> to

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
contrasting color you don't have to

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.350 
contrasting color you don't have to
worry<00:05:44.030> about<00:05:44.150> untwisting<00:05:45.140> because<00:05:45.410> I<00:05:45.530> already

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
worry about untwisting because I already

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.220 
worry about untwisting because I already
twisted<00:05:48.850> I'm<00:05:49.850> gonna<00:05:50.060> do<00:05:50.240> a<00:05:50.270> left<00:05:50.480> twist<00:05:50.690> over

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
twisted I'm gonna do a left twist over

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.530 
twisted I'm gonna do a left twist over
two<00:05:51.470> stitches<00:05:51.950> that's<00:05:52.190> one<00:05:52.430> top<00:05:52.790> stitch<00:05:53.090> but

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
two stitches that's one top stitch but

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.080 
two stitches that's one top stitch but
over<00:05:53.990> two<00:05:54.260> instead<00:05:54.710> of<00:05:54.770> over<00:05:55.100> one<00:05:55.280> using<00:05:55.970> the

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
over two instead of over one using the

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.080 
over two instead of over one using the
same<00:05:56.390> exact<00:05:56.720> technique<00:05:57.080> so<00:05:58.070> I<00:05:58.100> slip<00:05:58.580> knit<00:05:58.880> wise

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
same exact technique so I slip knit wise

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.550 
same exact technique so I slip knit wise
one<00:05:59.920> two<00:06:00.920> three<00:06:01.880> now<00:06:02.330> because<00:06:03.080> I'm<00:06:03.200> going<00:06:03.380> over

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
one two three now because I'm going over

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.070 
one two three now because I'm going over
to<00:06:03.710> so<00:06:04.220> I<00:06:04.250> slip<00:06:04.610> the<00:06:04.760> top<00:06:04.940> one<00:06:05.120> then<00:06:05.300> slip<00:06:05.570> two

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
to so I slip the top one then slip two

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.690 
to so I slip the top one then slip two
more<00:06:06.400> knit<00:06:07.400> wise<00:06:07.550> one<00:06:08.390> two<00:06:08.570> three<00:06:09.430> grab<00:06:10.430> my

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
more knit wise one two three grab my

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.120 
more knit wise one two three grab my
left<00:06:11.360> needle<00:06:11.690> through<00:06:12.140> all<00:06:12.350> three<00:06:12.650> in<00:06:12.740> a<00:06:12.830> row

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.220 

drop<00:06:16.130> them<00:06:16.340> off<00:06:16.490> the<00:06:16.640> right<00:06:16.730> hand<00:06:16.940> needle<00:06:17.230> now

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.230 
drop them off the right hand needle now

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.350 
drop them off the right hand needle now
they're<00:06:18.440> positioned<00:06:19.010> correctly<00:06:19.910> there

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
they're positioned correctly there

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.450 
they're positioned correctly there
they're<00:06:20.720> just<00:06:20.750> flipped<00:06:21.200> so<00:06:21.830> the<00:06:22.010> top<00:06:22.190> stitch

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
they're just flipped so the top stitch

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.460 
they're just flipped so the top stitch
that<00:06:22.730> was<00:06:22.910> the<00:06:23.330> farthest<00:06:23.900> on<00:06:24.050> the<00:06:24.170> right<00:06:24.320> is

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
that was the farthest on the right is

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.500 
that was the farthest on the right is
now<00:06:24.710> the<00:06:24.770> furthest<00:06:25.190> on<00:06:25.370> the<00:06:25.520> left<00:06:25.760> so<00:06:26.240> it<00:06:26.390> went

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
now the furthest on the left so it went

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.600 
now the furthest on the left so it went
over<00:06:26.870> both<00:06:27.080> the<00:06:27.110> two<00:06:27.500> now<00:06:28.070> I<00:06:28.130> just<00:06:28.250> knit<00:06:28.580> all

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
over both the two now I just knit all

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.650 
over both the two now I just knit all
three<00:06:28.910> stitches<00:06:31.120> check<00:06:32.120> in<00:06:32.270> the<00:06:32.420> correct

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
three stitches check in the correct

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.900 
three stitches check in the correct
order

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:46.010 

mmm<00:06:38.910> perfect<00:06:41.750> cut<00:06:42.750> uh<00:06:43.010> now<00:06:44.720> I'm<00:06:45.720> gonna<00:06:45.870> do<00:06:45.960> the

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
mmm perfect cut uh now I'm gonna do the

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.200 
mmm perfect cut uh now I'm gonna do the
same<00:06:46.110> thing<00:06:46.500> but<00:06:46.680> with<00:06:46.800> the<00:06:47.010> slit<00:06:47.490> stitches

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
same thing but with the slit stitches

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.020 
same thing but with the slit stitches
underneath<00:06:48.590> so<00:06:49.590> this<00:06:49.830> pattern<00:06:50.220> uses<00:06:50.520> a<00:06:50.610> lot<00:06:50.820> of

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030 
underneath so this pattern uses a lot of

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.960 
underneath so this pattern uses a lot of
twisted<00:06:51.660> stitches<00:06:51.990> over<00:06:52.440> slip<00:06:52.950> stitches<00:06:53.460> to

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:53.970 
twisted stitches over slip stitches to

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.090 
twisted stitches over slip stitches to
make<00:06:54.090> the<00:06:54.240> different<00:06:54.570> patterns<00:06:54.870> work<00:06:55.110> so<00:06:55.830> it's

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100 
make the different patterns work so it's

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.820 
make the different patterns work so it's
the<00:06:56.340> exact<00:06:56.610> same<00:06:56.640> thing<00:06:56.850> slip<00:06:57.600> one<00:06:57.930> slip<00:06:58.560> to

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
the exact same thing slip one slip to
