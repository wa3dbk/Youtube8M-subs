doesn't<00:00:52.230> really<00:00:52.500> convey<00:00:52.739> why<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:54.120> found<00:00:54.329> it

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
doesn't really convey why and I found it

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.590 
doesn't really convey why and I found it
very<00:00:54.660> strange<00:00:55.340> so<00:00:56.340> my<00:00:56.460> advice<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.360> to

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
very strange so my advice for this is to

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.389 
very strange so my advice for this is to
literally<00:00:57.840> count<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.289> him<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.890> wait<00:00:59.370> for

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
literally count to him you can wait for

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.660 
literally count to him you can wait for
him<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.699> counter<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.949> then<00:01:02.160> counter<00:01:02.520> him

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
him to counter you and then counter him

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.399 
him to counter you and then counter him
or<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.239> wait<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.750> his<00:01:03.870> attack<00:01:04.170> and

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
or you can just wait for his attack and

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.460 
or you can just wait for his attack and
count<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.710> him<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.549> attack<00:01:06.479> waiting<00:01:07.110> for

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
count to him and I attack waiting for

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.780 
count to him and I attack waiting for
the<00:01:07.530> counters<00:01:07.950> because<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.280> can't<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.670> stand

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the counters because I can't just stand

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.730 
the counters because I can't just stand
there<00:01:09.060> waiting<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.780> peri<00:01:09.990> because

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
there waiting for the peri because

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.560

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
sometimes he'll just spam a move I don't

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.929 
sometimes he'll just spam a move I don't

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
one that's the easiest to parry the big

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.499 
one that's the easiest to parry the big
charge<00:01:18.720> he<00:01:18.990> does<00:01:19.820> but<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.210> pretty<00:01:21.450> much

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
charge he does but you can pretty much

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.820 
charge he does but you can pretty much
do<00:01:21.780> all<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.960> them<00:01:22.229> he's<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.439> extremely

evasive<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.360> retort<00:01:24.780> which<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.259> really

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
evasive on the retort which is really

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.990 
evasive on the retort which is really
frustrating<00:01:25.920> because<00:01:26.340> when<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.670> land<00:01:26.909> a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
