00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
to change anything would be that it

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.690 
to change anything would be that it
would<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> pump<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.890> instead<00:01:17.430> of

think i was just really stressed out i
had<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> lot<00:01:52.770> going<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.549> beginning<00:01:53.880> of

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
had a lot going on in the beginning of

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.700 
had a lot going on in the beginning of
november<00:01:54.090> as<00:01:54.570> well<00:01:55.110> as<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> end<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.560> november

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
november as well as the end of november

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.050 
november as well as the end of november
but<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.310> beginning<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.700> was<00:01:56.820> really

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
but in the beginning I was really

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.639 
but in the beginning I was really
stressed<00:01:57.299> out<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.020> think<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.500> was

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649
