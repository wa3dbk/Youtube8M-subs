00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
online I think it was one for luck on

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.500 
online I think it was one for luck on
the<00:02:43.230> games<00:02:43.440> they<00:02:44.160> recolored<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.090> for<00:02:45.269> me<00:02:45.360> and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
the games they recolored it for me and

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.630 
the games they recolored it for me and
then<00:02:45.569> of<00:02:46.290> course<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.530> have<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.650> logo<00:02:46.890> on<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.610> Hat

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
then of course I have a logo on the Hat

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.740 
then of course I have a logo on the Hat
which<00:02:47.970> I'm<00:02:48.150> going<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.329> get<00:02:48.480> one<00:02:48.599> of<00:02:48.690> those

which I'm going to get one of those

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.300 
which I'm going to get one of those
eventually<00:02:49.079> I'm<00:02:49.739> going<00:02:49.829> to<00:02:49.920> get<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.040> hat<00:02:50.190> with

i<00:03:10.140> think<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:11.069> athletes<00:03:11.370> in<00:03:11.430> what<00:03:11.549> you<00:03:11.640> guys

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
i think the athletes in what you guys

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.100 
i think the athletes in what you guys
think<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.090> course<00:03:12.299> this<00:03:12.450> is<00:03:12.540> all<00:03:12.629> film<00:03:12.930> too

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
think of course this is all film too

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.630 
think of course this is all film too
with<00:03:13.349> a<00:03:13.379> new<00:03:13.680> camera<00:03:13.890> whoa<00:03:14.129> don't<00:03:14.370> zoom<00:03:14.489> in

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
with a new camera whoa don't zoom in

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.550 
with a new camera whoa don't zoom in
zoom<00:03:14.670> out<00:03:14.910> there<00:03:15.450> we<00:03:15.540> go<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:16.200> I'm<00:03:16.290> trying<00:03:16.440> to

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
zoom out there we go so I'm trying to

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.110 
zoom out there we go so I'm trying to
get<00:03:16.650> used<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:16.980> new<00:03:17.099> cameras<00:03:17.489> you<00:03:17.730> probably

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
get used to the new cameras you probably

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.750 
get used to the new cameras you probably
tell<00:03:18.590> it's<00:03:19.590> really<00:03:19.739> asked<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.160> tell<00:03:20.519> me<00:03:20.609> if<00:03:20.670> you

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
tell it's really asked to tell me if you

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.370 
tell it's really asked to tell me if you
enjoyed<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.329> picture<00:03:21.600> quality<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:21.989> it<00:03:22.170> I

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
enjoyed the picture quality of it I

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.539 
enjoyed the picture quality of it I
think<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.829> will<00:03:22.920> do<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.040> lot<00:03:23.220> better<00:03:23.340> for

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
think it will do a lot better for

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:24.920 
think it will do a lot better for
