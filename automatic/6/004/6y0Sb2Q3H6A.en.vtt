00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.800
 however much you search for more than you 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:03.770
 hide 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:06.350
 you sleep with me all nights 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:11.770

 That's why I adore you. You're all my life 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.799
 treasure 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.329
 ok let's start with the first 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.890
 verse of the song we are going to occupy what 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.840
 which are the minor but if removing the 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.610
 Capo and putting your finger 1 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:36.610
 the index while t 5 chord 3 ok and 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.530
 it would be like this has to ring them from this 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.460
 way ok 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.590
 just the funny one down 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.010
 and today we are going to do a little bit of 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.010
 top down 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.670
 one 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.340
 although it is very simple and then from there 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:05.550
 we went to the letter that would be occupied 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:08.780
 network seventh a greater sun a greater do 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.820
 easy simple then again a king the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.070
 seventh and a missile ok and it would be this 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.570
 way although already friends we start with 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.470
 the part of the letter with the first 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.470
 chord and the first figure 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.330
 and the city that follows is going to be only 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.910
 down in the next chords and 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.620
 he says there is love as 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.160
 but there are not two in life 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.470
 no matter how much you see 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.550
 look for forms that hide 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.870
 you sleep with me 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.400
 me every night 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.900
 and that the streets 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.110
 without any reproach 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.000
 ok friends like that would be and we come to the party 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.900
 of the palm and last of we occupy the technique 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.360
 which is to mutate with the palm and touch the 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.920
 strings down 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.920
 ok here would be an older one 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.819
 and we move to a minor or that there 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.610
 remember that we are going to turn off to mutate with 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:31.500
 the palm backwards and with the nib 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:33.120
 down you only realize in 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:39.630
 that part we put the technique of pal 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:45.320
 beauty and the rest is still ok but 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:49.550
 everything already passes the sufferings as to the 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.989
 words were taken by the wind 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.760
 ok friends after all this part of 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.680
 the verse the pal meeting we are going to pass 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.350
 now towards the strikeout to what 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.150
 more we like that is the chorus we are going to 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.860
 start we occupy the two chords 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.209
 and it would be in this way the rhythm that 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.310
 let's occupy is going to be for all the 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:11.640
 song from now on ok and it would be 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:15.110
 this in D minor seventh and says well 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.110
 sometimes return 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.200
 Y 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.200
 Y 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.380
 it will not be slower to be the 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.990
 rhythm and this can be done at home with 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.880
 calm ok you already know a lot of patience a lot 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.880
 patience and says well 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.200
 ok now I 'm going to do it with the lyrics and 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.050
 time for you to make together 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.580
 with me and we are both ok 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.580
 and this says well the choir part 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.310
 why come back 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:10.639
 of anguish 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:14.460
 the sky must 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:20.900
 jesus and wilted caresses 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:25.340
 but you're asleep you feel it caresses 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.340
 of hug to my chest 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:31.740

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.660
 ok friends realized it's very 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.160
 simple and rhythm and all the chords are 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.930
 repeat again with a small 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.980
 variation there instead of peace we do in 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.870
 the least are just ornaments ok friends 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.210
 practically the whole song would be 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.550
 rhythm and the chords are repeated 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.260
