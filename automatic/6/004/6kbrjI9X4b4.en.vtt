obviously<00:01:30.259> he<00:01:30.619> can't<00:01:30.890> do<00:01:31.069> anything<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.460> me<00:01:31.520> so

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
obviously he can't do anything to me so

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.160 
obviously he can't do anything to me so
he's<00:01:31.909> gonna<00:01:32.030> go<00:01:32.210> into<00:01:32.420> his<00:01:32.539> infinite<00:01:32.840> now

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
he's gonna go into his infinite now

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.050 
he's gonna go into his infinite now
that's<00:01:33.740> fine<00:01:34.069> I'm<00:01:34.340> gonna<00:01:34.520> go<00:01:34.700> for<00:01:34.819> the<00:01:34.880> lease

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:31.639 
up going back for the synthesis now

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.610 
up going back for the synthesis now
what's<00:02:31.909> going<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.120> happen<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:33.049> he<00:02:33.379> is

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
what's going to happen is that he is

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.679 
what's going to happen is that he is
going<00:02:33.829> to<00:02:33.980> in<00:02:34.069> a<00:02:34.099> brain<00:02:34.400> in<00:02:34.579> his<00:02:34.760> gengar<00:02:35.239> now

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
going to in a brain in his gengar now

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.360 
going to in a brain in his gengar now
the<00:02:35.750> problem<00:02:36.079> with<00:02:36.290> this<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.739> that<00:02:36.829> he

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
the problem with this is that he

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.039 
the problem with this is that he
actually<00:02:37.549> a<00:02:37.790> slug<00:02:38.150> bahlmann<00:02:38.510> Shadow<00:02:38.719> Ball<00:02:38.900> is

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
actually a slug bahlmann Shadow Ball is

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.690 
actually a slug bahlmann Shadow Ball is
only<00:02:39.170> offensive<00:02:39.620> moves<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.189> guess<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.519> first

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
only offensive moves I guess the first

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.089 
only offensive moves I guess the first
time<00:02:40.959> he<00:02:41.959> didn't<00:02:42.200> expect<00:02:42.379> me<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.709> have<00:02:42.799> bold

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
time he didn't expect me to have bold

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.649 
time he didn't expect me to have bold
proof<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.579> I<00:02:43.639> guess<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:43.939> second<00:02:44.329> time<00:02:44.450> maybe

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
proof and I guess the second time maybe

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.119 
proof and I guess the second time maybe
he<00:02:44.840> thought<00:02:44.989> I<00:02:45.049> would<00:02:45.260> switch<00:02:45.530> out<00:02:45.709> maybe<00:02:45.920> she

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
he thought I would switch out maybe she

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.800 
he thought I would switch out maybe she
like<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.340> dazzling<00:02:46.909> gleam<00:02:47.180> or<00:02:47.329> anything<00:02:47.599> as

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
like a dazzling gleam or anything as

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.690 
like a dazzling gleam or anything as
really<00:02:48.560> close<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:48.919> switching<00:02:49.280> out<00:02:49.430> just

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
really close to switching out just

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.890 
really close to switching out just
because<00:02:49.819> I<00:02:50.030> felt<00:02:50.239> like<00:02:50.299> you<00:02:50.510> know<00:02:50.599> I<00:02:50.629> had

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
because I felt like you know I had

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.659 
because I felt like you know I had
something<00:02:51.139> else<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.560> take<00:02:52.159> this<00:02:52.340> you<00:02:52.400> know<00:02:52.579> a

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:52.669 
something else to take this you know a

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:54.369 
something else to take this you know a
little<00:02:52.849> bit<00:02:53.000> better<00:02:53.239> but<00:02:53.870> I<00:02:54.109> just<00:02:54.260> don't

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
little bit better but I just don't

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:55.809 
little bit better but I just don't
decide<00:02:54.739> to<00:02:54.859> switch<00:02:54.980> out<00:02:55.220> here<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:55.459> don't<00:02:55.639> think

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
decide to switch out here I don't think

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.059 
decide to switch out here I don't think
it's<00:02:55.939> useful<00:02:56.200> but<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:57.290> looks<00:02:57.500> like<00:02:57.590> his<00:02:57.829> only

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
it's useful but it looks like his only

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.800 
it's useful but it looks like his only

that means that honestly you're not

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.209 
that means that honestly you're not
going<00:03:12.319> to<00:03:12.379> be<00:03:12.469> able<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:12.650> hit<00:03:12.739> me<00:03:12.829> with<00:03:12.950> anything

because<00:03:18.769> you<00:03:19.040> know<00:03:19.159> it<00:03:19.340> doesn't<00:03:19.459> have<00:03:19.639> to<00:03:19.729> be

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
because you know it doesn't have to be

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.180 
because you know it doesn't have to be
just<00:03:19.879> you<00:03:20.299> know<00:03:20.419> like<00:03:20.540> say<00:03:21.199> bald<00:03:21.500> in<00:03:21.799> just<00:03:22.040> have

obviously<00:04:41.090> earthquake<00:04:41.780> would<00:04:41.990> have<00:04:42.080> done<00:04:42.260> a

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
obviously earthquake would have done a

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.230 
obviously earthquake would have done a
lot<00:04:42.470> more<00:04:42.710> might<00:04:43.310> have<00:04:43.460> not<00:04:43.610> killed<00:04:43.880> but<00:04:44.060> then

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
lot more might have not killed but then

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.370 
lot more might have not killed but then
again<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.630> next<00:04:44.750> turn<00:04:44.990> he<00:04:45.080> could<00:04:45.230> have<00:04:45.320> gone

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
again the next turn he could have gone

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.810 
again the next turn he could have gone
for<00:04:45.680> that<00:04:45.710> earthquake<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:46.460> I<00:04:46.520> don't<00:04:46.730> know
