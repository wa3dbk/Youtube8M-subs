me<00:00:13.200> super<00:00:13.620> excited<00:00:14.009> about<00:00:14.070> GTA<00:00:14.580> 5<00:00:14.880> started

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
me super excited about GTA 5 started

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.420 
me super excited about GTA 5 started
running<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:15.990> ran<00:00:16.590> into<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.859> few<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.250> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
running it and ran into a few of the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.450 
running it and ran into a few of the
initial<00:00:17.850> issues<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.830> might<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:20.039> some<00:00:20.250> help

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
initial issues I might have some help

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.849 
initial issues I might have some help
view<00:00:20.730> now<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.420> lot<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.109> people<00:00:22.529> have<00:00:22.680> reported

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
view now a lot of people have reported

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.179 
view now a lot of people have reported
really<00:00:23.519> high<00:00:23.670> CPU<00:00:24.119> issues<00:00:24.660> one<00:00:25.529> issue<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:26.130> think

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
really high CPU issues one issue I think

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.460 
really high CPU issues one issue I think
rockstars<00:00:26.910> already<00:00:27.269> resolved<00:00:27.720> which<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
rockstars already resolved which is the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.679 
rockstars already resolved which is the
GTA<00:00:28.800> launcher<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:30.119> runs<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.510> background

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
GTA launcher that runs in the background

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.680 
GTA launcher that runs in the background
and<00:00:31.109> uses<00:00:31.500> CPU<00:00:31.980> because<00:00:32.430> it's<00:00:33.090> rendering<00:00:33.570> like

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
and uses CPU because it's rendering like

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.450 
and uses CPU because it's rendering like
a<00:00:33.719> ton<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.020> frames<00:00:34.380> for<00:00:34.680> no<00:00:34.800> reason

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
a ton of frames for no reason

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.639 
a ton of frames for no reason
I<00:00:35.489> think<00:00:36.390> they've<00:00:36.540> resolved<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.170> that's<00:00:37.380> not

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
I think they've resolved that that's not

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.440 
I think they've resolved that that's not
what<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:37.980> video<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.309> about<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:39.239> might

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
what this video is about this might

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.479 
what this video is about this might
actually<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.930> special<00:00:40.379> case<00:00:40.590> might<00:00:41.219> only

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
actually be a special case might only

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.209 
actually be a special case might only
affect<00:00:41.910> some<00:00:42.360> people<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.680> yesterday<00:00:44.190> i

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
affect some people so yesterday i

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.549 
affect some people so yesterday i
benchmarked<00:00:45.030> grand<00:00:45.360> theft<00:00:45.510> auto<00:00:45.690> 5<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.410> it

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
benchmarked grand theft auto 5 and it

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.310 
benchmarked grand theft auto 5 and it
ran<00:00:46.969> phenomenal<00:00:47.969> now<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.629> have<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> high-end

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
ran phenomenal now I have a high-end

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.420 
ran phenomenal now I have a high-end

resolution<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:01.980> was<00:01:02.250> pumped<00:01:02.670> then<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.210> went

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
resolution so I was pumped then I went

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.140 
resolution so I was pumped then I went
to<00:01:03.600> stream<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.049> game<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.760> things<00:01:05.760> went

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
to stream the game and things went

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.530 
to stream the game and things went
horribly<00:01:06.510> wrong<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:08.250> saw<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.729> my<00:01:08.790> CPU

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
horribly wrong and I saw that my CPU

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.020 
horribly wrong and I saw that my CPU
usage<00:01:09.930> was<00:01:10.110> pinged<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.680> was<00:01:10.799> maxed<00:01:11.159> out<00:01:11.280> 99%

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
usage was pinged it was maxed out 99%

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.870 
usage was pinged it was maxed out 99%
then<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.750> started<00:01:13.020> looking<00:01:13.170> into<00:01:13.619> why<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.250> high

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
then I started looking into why and high

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.570 
then I started looking into why and high
CPU<00:01:15.299> usage<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.020> very<00:01:16.049> common<00:01:16.950> for<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.340> game

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
CPU usage is very common for this game

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.480 
CPU usage is very common for this game
now<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.540> did<00:01:18.990> not<00:01:19.229> want<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.619> scale<00:01:19.860> back<00:01:20.159> my

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
now I did not want to scale back my

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.060 
now I did not want to scale back my
settings<00:01:21.240> but<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.140> testing<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.710> see<00:01:22.830> what

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
settings but just testing it to see what

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.760 
settings but just testing it to see what
happens<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.640> scaled<00:01:24.330> back<00:01:24.540> ridiculously<00:01:25.439> I

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
happens I scaled back ridiculously I

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.609 
happens I scaled back ridiculously I
went<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.369> 800<00:01:27.000> by<00:01:27.119> 600<00:01:27.570> resolution<00:01:28.110> and

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
went to 800 by 600 resolution and

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.539 
went to 800 by 600 resolution and
noticed<00:01:29.430> my<00:01:29.549> CPU<00:01:30.060> usage<00:01:30.450> for<00:01:30.720> GTA<00:01:31.049> 5<00:01:31.320> alone<00:01:31.799> was

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
noticed my CPU usage for GTA 5 alone was

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.109 
noticed my CPU usage for GTA 5 alone was
staying<00:01:32.820> around<00:01:33.150> 60%<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:35.340> went<00:01:35.460> from<00:01:35.579> 60

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
staying around 60% and it went from 60

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.539 
staying around 60% and it went from 60
sometimes<00:01:36.659> upwards<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.290> 70<00:01:37.890> still

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
sometimes upwards to 70 still

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.210 
sometimes upwards to 70 still
unacceptable<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:40.170> joke<00:01:40.590> what's<00:01:40.860> going

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
unacceptable this is a joke what's going

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.550 
unacceptable this is a joke what's going
on<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.030> what's<00:01:42.329> going<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.990> something<00:01:43.290> that

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
on so what's going on is something that

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.719 
on so what's going on is something that
everyone's<00:01:43.950> looking<00:01:44.070> forward<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.610> be

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
everyone's looking forward to be

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.630 
everyone's looking forward to be

or the calls from the GPU to the CPU or
high<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.450> noticed<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.350> only<00:01:52.829> way<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.009> can

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
high and I noticed the only way I can

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.300 
high and I noticed the only way I can
fix<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:54.030> was<00:01:54.869> capping<00:01:55.500> my<00:01:55.649> frames<00:01:55.979> per

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
fix this was capping my frames per

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.760 
fix this was capping my frames per
second<00:01:56.790> now<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> didn't<00:01:57.960> want<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.200> enable<00:01:58.560> vsync

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
second now I didn't want to enable vsync

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.010 
second now I didn't want to enable vsync
because<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.820> g-sync<00:02:00.240> monitor<00:02:00.689> that's

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
because I have a g-sync monitor that's

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.090 
because I have a g-sync monitor that's
stupid

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
stupid

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.910 
stupid
so<00:02:02.880> what<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.240> ended<00:02:03.659> up<00:02:03.780> doing<00:02:04.170> was<00:02:04.560> using

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
so what I ended up doing was using

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.280 
so what I ended up doing was using
Nvidia<00:02:05.729> inspector<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.420> will<00:02:06.689> put<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> link<00:02:07.079> below
