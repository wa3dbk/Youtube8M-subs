the<00:02:05.060> help<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.480> support<00:02:05.630> of<00:02:05.990> a<00:02:06.080> fine<00:02:06.410> video

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
the help and support of a fine video

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.340 
the help and support of a fine video
production<00:02:07.430> team<00:02:07.790> I<00:02:08.060> thought<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.140> project

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
production team I thought the project

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.350 
production team I thought the project
was<00:02:09.710> going<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:09.950> take<00:02:10.130> five<00:02:10.429> years<00:02:10.700> but<00:02:10.970> as<00:02:11.210> it

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
was going to take five years but as it

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.760 
was going to take five years but as it
turned<00:02:11.570> out<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:11.900> took<00:02:12.110> nine<00:02:12.350> years<00:02:12.380> to

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
turned out it took nine years to

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.480 
turned out it took nine years to
complete

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
complete

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.450 
complete
first<00:02:14.000> I'd<00:02:14.270> thoroughly<00:02:14.930> relearned<00:02:15.800> that<00:02:16.130> part

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
first I'd thoroughly relearned that part

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.150 
first I'd thoroughly relearned that part
of<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.640> body<00:02:16.880> by<00:02:17.840> looking<00:02:18.170> at<00:02:18.290> books<00:02:18.560> for<00:02:19.010> what

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
of the body by looking at books for what

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.940 
of the body by looking at books for what
that<00:02:19.310> was<00:02:19.520> worth<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.080> also<00:02:21.080> by<00:02:21.260> dissection

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
that was worth and also by dissection

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.280 
that was worth and also by dissection
and<00:02:22.250> all<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.420> time<00:02:23.660> I<00:02:23.690> was<00:02:23.959> trying<00:02:24.110> to

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
and all the time I was trying to

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.170 
and all the time I was trying to
remember<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.709> points<00:02:25.190> that<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.459> myself<00:02:25.700> had

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
remember the points that I myself had

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.110 
remember the points that I myself had
found<00:02:26.450> hardest<00:02:27.020> almost<00:02:27.500> confusing<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.910> first

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
found hardest almost confusing the first

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.810 
found hardest almost confusing the first
time<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.450> try<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:29.870> learn<00:02:30.140> them<00:02:30.410> after<00:02:31.400> that

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
time I try to learn them after that

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.910 
time I try to learn them after that
and<00:02:32.030> when<00:02:32.180> I'd<00:02:32.300> written<00:02:32.510> out<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.959> words<00:02:33.230> I'd

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
and when I'd written out the words I'd

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.100 
and when I'd written out the words I'd
make<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.220> list<00:02:34.580> of<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.910> exact<00:02:35.360> shots<00:02:35.750> we<00:02:36.080> needed

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
make a list of the exact shots we needed

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.699 
make a list of the exact shots we needed
to<00:02:36.530> make<00:02:36.740> and<00:02:36.980> in<00:02:37.310> what<00:02:37.490> order<00:02:38.320> together<00:02:39.320> my

the<00:02:52.730> video<00:02:53.209> we<00:02:53.420> developed<00:02:53.900> some<00:02:54.140> unique

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
the video we developed some unique

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.550 
the video we developed some unique
devices<00:02:55.130> for<00:02:55.820> creating<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.540> movement<00:02:56.989> that's

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
devices for creating the movement that's

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.400 
devices for creating the movement that's
so<00:02:57.830> essential<00:02:58.340> in<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.580> videos<00:02:59.260> rotation<00:03:00.260> was

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
so essential in the videos rotation was

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.740 
so essential in the videos rotation was
done<00:03:00.650> in<00:03:00.800> one<00:03:01.010> axis<00:03:01.489> by<00:03:01.790> having<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.209> specimen

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
done in one axis by having the specimen

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.500 
done in one axis by having the specimen
on<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:02.989> rotating<00:03:03.500> tabletop<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:04.519> it<00:03:05.150> was<00:03:05.300> done

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
on a rotating tabletop and it was done

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.870 
on a rotating tabletop and it was done
in<00:03:05.540> another<00:03:05.959> axis<00:03:06.530> by<00:03:07.040> having<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.459> camera

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880

horizontal axis there were other

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.410 
horizontal axis there were other
marvelous<00:03:15.860> devices<00:03:16.459> we<00:03:16.640> created<00:03:17.209> like<00:03:17.360> a

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
marvelous devices we created like a

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.020 
marvelous devices we created like a
robotic<00:03:17.900> zoom<00:03:18.320> controller<00:03:18.950> so<00:03:19.580> that<00:03:19.610> we<00:03:19.880> could

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
robotic zoom controller so that we could

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.240 
robotic zoom controller so that we could
control<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.750> zooming<00:03:21.320> of<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.560> camera<00:03:22.010> while

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
control the zooming of the camera while

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.370 
control the zooming of the camera while
it<00:03:22.400> was<00:03:22.550> moving<00:03:23.000> through<00:03:23.150> space<00:03:23.390> and<00:03:24.080> we<00:03:24.200> made

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
it was moving through space and we made

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.740 
it was moving through space and we made
a<00:03:24.410> host<00:03:24.769> of<00:03:24.980> simple<00:03:25.459> wooden<00:03:25.790> contraptions<00:03:26.120> I

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
a host of simple wooden contraptions I

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.140 
a host of simple wooden contraptions I
made<00:03:26.959> most<00:03:27.170> of<00:03:27.320> these<00:03:27.440> at<00:03:27.650> home<00:03:27.730> you<00:03:28.730> don't<00:03:28.910> see

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
made most of these at home you don't see

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.970 
made most of these at home you don't see
those<00:03:29.330> devices<00:03:29.750> in<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.170> video<00:03:30.440> because<00:03:30.860> the

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
those devices in the video because the

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.949 
those devices in the video because the
support<00:03:31.340> device<00:03:31.730> was<00:03:31.970> always<00:03:32.269> clothed<00:03:32.660> in

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
support device was always clothed in

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.220 
support device was always clothed in
black<00:03:33.680> velvet<00:03:33.980> so<00:03:34.670> it<00:03:34.820> was<00:03:34.940> invisible<00:03:35.299> and<00:03:35.690> we

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
black velvet so it was invisible and we

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.780 
black velvet so it was invisible and we
shot<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.620> video<00:03:36.739> against<00:03:37.280> a<00:03:37.340> black<00:03:37.549> velvet

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
shot the video against a black velvet

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.600 
shot the video against a black velvet
background<00:03:38.450> so<00:03:39.110> all<00:03:39.500> you<00:03:39.739> see<00:03:40.040> is<00:03:40.310> the

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
background so all you see is the

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.910 
background so all you see is the
specimen<00:03:41.030> itself<00:03:41.570> there<00:03:42.230> are<00:03:42.260> no<00:03:42.470> visual

as we were completing the video atlas
project<00:03:53.180> DVDs<00:03:54.180> were<00:03:54.450> coming<00:03:54.810> in<00:03:54.989> a<00:03:55.310> faster

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
project DVDs were coming in a faster

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.789 
project DVDs were coming in a faster
internet<00:03:56.340> made<00:03:57.329> streaming<00:03:57.930> video<00:03:58.230> possible

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799

internet made streaming video possible
for<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.040> first<00:03:59.219> time<00:03:59.569> so<00:04:00.569> we<00:04:00.689> made<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:00.900> second

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
for the first time so we made a second

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.949 
for the first time so we made a second
big<00:04:01.709> transition<00:04:02.489> to<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.909> web-based<00:04:03.150> version

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
big transition to the web-based version

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.649 
big transition to the web-based version
that's<00:04:04.230> now<00:04:04.469> most<00:04:04.980> widely<00:04:05.430> used<00:04:05.459> today<00:04:05.939> this

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
that's now most widely used today this
