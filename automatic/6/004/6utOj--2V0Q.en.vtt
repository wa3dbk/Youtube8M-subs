think<00:01:40.470> they<00:01:40.619> did<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.130> developers<00:01:41.880> have

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
think they did the developers have

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.050 
think they did the developers have
listened<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.290> community<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> lot<00:01:43.979> because

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.810 

the<00:01:48.060> high<00:01:48.540> tier<00:01:48.840> tanks<00:01:49.670> especially<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
the high tier tanks especially the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.410 
the high tier tanks especially the
German<00:01:51.330> tier<00:01:51.720> 10<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.380> tn9<00:01:53.130> weren't<00:01:53.610> too

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
German tier 10 and tn9 weren't too

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.510 
German tier 10 and tn9 weren't too
enjoyable<00:01:54.900> to<00:01:55.320> play<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:57.410> I<00:01:58.410> think<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.220> trend

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
enjoyable to play and I think the trend

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.310 
enjoyable to play and I think the trend
that<00:01:59.880> they<00:02:00.210> are<00:02:01.430> patching<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.700> more<00:02:03.330> mobile

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
that they are patching in more mobile

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.510 
that they are patching in more mobile
tanks<00:02:06.650> that<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:08.100> trend<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:08.940> positive<00:02:09.509> one

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
tanks that the trend is a positive one

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.820 
tanks that the trend is a positive one
this<00:02:11.520> tank<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.060> is-8<00:02:12.630> is<00:02:15.320> well<00:02:16.320> how<00:02:16.560> can<00:02:16.620> I

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
a proper medium tanger that's like a

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.630 
a proper medium tanger that's like a
mixture<00:02:28.020> between<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.560> heavy<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.250> medium

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
mixture between a heavy and the medium

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.930 
mixture between a heavy and the medium
and<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.690> same<00:02:30.990> goes<00:02:31.230> for<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.560> is-8<00:02:32.220> but<00:02:32.670> just

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
and that same goes for the is-8 but just

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.150 
and that same goes for the is-8 but just
from<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> heavy<00:02:33.870> tank<00:02:34.230> side<00:02:34.500> not<00:02:34.770> from<00:02:34.950> the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
from the heavy tank side not from the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.270 
from the heavy tank side not from the
medium<00:02:35.490> tanks<00:02:35.880> like<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.330> thing<00:02:37.130> pretty<00:02:38.130> much

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
medium tanks like this thing pretty much

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.050

feels<00:02:38.820> like<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.120> medium<00:02:39.600> tank<00:02:40.130> but<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.610> know<00:02:41.790> it

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060

you know the better gameplay or you know
test<00:03:18.570> server<00:03:18.900> gameplay<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.850> never<00:03:20.850> did<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.299> in

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
test server gameplay I never did that in

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.210 
test server gameplay I never did that in
online<00:03:24.290> RPGs<00:03:25.290> or

the normal so I thought you know I hope
on<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.080> test<00:03:37.410> server<00:03:37.650> just<00:03:38.040> check<00:03:38.610> out<00:03:38.790> the

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
on the test server just check out the

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.670 
on the test server just check out the
new<00:03:39.060> tags<00:03:41.360> and<00:03:42.360> that<00:03:43.140> was<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.320> good<00:03:43.530> decision

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
new tags and that was a good decision

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.270 
new tags and that was a good decision
because<00:03:44.210> yeah<00:03:45.210> I<00:03:45.510> think<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:46.140> heard<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.560> kick<00:03:47.040> I

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
that this is the place to hit it from up

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.800 
that this is the place to hit it from up
front<00:04:34.140> I<00:04:36.080> tried<00:04:37.080> up<00:04:37.230> to<00:04:37.770> three<00:04:38.130> times<00:04:38.370> and<00:04:38.810> the

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
front I tried up to three times and the

front I tried up to three times and the
damage<00:04:40.020> output<00:04:40.350> was<00:04:40.710> pretty<00:04:41.100> nice<00:04:46.910> yeah<00:04:47.910> the

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
damage output was pretty nice yeah the

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.500 
damage output was pretty nice yeah the
Tank<00:04:48.450> come<00:04:48.540> do<00:04:49.470> come<00:04:49.860> with<00:04:50.100> one<00:04:50.310> cost<00:04:50.610> you<00:04:51.210> see

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
Tank come do come with one cost you see

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.580 
Tank come do come with one cost you see
me<00:04:51.870> with<00:04:52.200> the<00:04:52.380> modules<00:04:53.570> in<00:04:54.570> order<00:04:54.900> Rama<00:04:55.140> to

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
me with the modules in order Rama to

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.240 
me with the modules in order Rama to
increase<00:04:56.070> to<00:04:56.760> decrease<00:04:57.470> loading<00:04:58.470> time<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:59.070> I

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
increase to decrease loading time and I

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.719 
increase to decrease loading time and I
have<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.669> vent<00:04:59.880> on<00:05:00.320> which<00:05:01.370> decreases<00:05:02.370> the

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
have the vent on which decreases the

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.000 
have the vent on which decreases the
loading<00:05:03.090> time<00:05:03.300> as<00:05:03.510> well<00:05:03.720> because<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:04.410> creases

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
loading time as well because the creases

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.700 
loading time as well because the creases
it<00:05:05.570> increases<00:05:06.570> crew<00:05:06.930> performance<00:05:07.530> and

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
it increases crew performance and

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.070 
it increases crew performance and
therefore<00:05:08.160> decrease<00:05:08.880> in<00:05:09.060> loading<00:05:09.540> time<00:05:09.750> a

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
therefore decrease in loading time a

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.000 
therefore decrease in loading time a
reload<00:05:10.860> time<00:05:11.190> and<00:05:12.290> the<00:05:13.290> crews<00:05:13.530> one<00:05:13.710> hundred

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
reload time and the crews one hundred

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.719 
reload time and the crews one hundred
one<00:05:14.640> hundred<00:05:14.700> percent<00:05:15.000> and<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:16.740> reload<00:05:17.700> time

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
one hundred percent and the reload time

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:23.180 
one hundred percent and the reload time
is<00:05:18.390> oh<00:05:18.900> boy<00:05:20.030> is<00:05:21.030> really<00:05:21.600> high<00:05:21.780> so<00:05:22.710> you<00:05:22.770> need<00:05:23.070> to

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
is oh boy is really high so you need to

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.430 
is oh boy is really high so you need to
take<00:05:23.370> that<00:05:23.430> into<00:05:23.610> consideration

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
take that into consideration

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.680 
take that into consideration
when<00:05:26.100> you're<00:05:26.340> thinking<00:05:26.670> about<00:05:26.880> how<00:05:27.330> to<00:05:27.390> play

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
when you're thinking about how to play

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.860 
when you're thinking about how to play
that<00:05:27.840> tank<00:05:28.110> properly<00:05:28.650> so<00:05:31.460> um<00:05:32.460> yeah<00:05:33.450> other<00:05:33.720> than

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
that tank properly so um yeah other than

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.910 
that tank properly so um yeah other than
that<00:05:34.200> I<00:05:34.680> think<00:05:34.820> you<00:05:35.820> can<00:05:36.230> pretty<00:05:37.230> much<00:05:37.350> play<00:05:37.770> it

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
that I think you can pretty much play it

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.510 
that I think you can pretty much play it
like<00:05:38.190> you<00:05:38.760> are<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.180> boss<00:05:39.360> that<00:05:39.930> is<00:05:40.280> for<00:05:41.280> sure<00:05:41.310> i

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
like you are the boss that is for sure i

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.090 
like you are the boss that is for sure i
will<00:05:41.670> give<00:05:42.300> it<00:05:42.420> a<00:05:42.510> try<00:05:42.810> for<00:05:42.870> another<00:05:43.380> few

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
will give it a try for another few

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.700 
will give it a try for another few
rounds<00:05:44.340> today<00:05:44.790> before<00:05:45.270> I<00:05:45.510> hope<00:05:45.870> over<00:05:46.320> and<00:05:47.480> it

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
rounds today before I hope over and it

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.370 
rounds today before I hope over and it
died<00:05:49.710> for<00:05:50.040> more<00:05:50.220> into<00:05:50.610> the<00:05:50.760> gameplay<00:05:51.030> of

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
died for more into the gameplay of

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.380 
died for more into the gameplay of
what's<00:05:52.380> the<00:05:52.530> K<00:05:52.710> before<00:05:55.790> yeah<00:05:56.790> that<00:05:57.000> is<00:05:57.180> pretty

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
what's the K before yeah that is pretty

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.230 
what's the K before yeah that is pretty
much<00:05:57.660> all<00:05:57.900> ur<00:05:57.960> to<00:05:58.260> say<00:05:58.470> about<00:05:58.620> this<00:05:58.980> tank<00:05:59.340> well

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
much all ur to say about this tank well

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.030 
much all ur to say about this tank well
then<00:06:00.510> they<00:06:00.810> have<00:06:01.050> two<00:06:01.470> premiums<00:06:02.100> patched<00:06:02.580> in<00:06:03.000> I

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
then they have two premiums patched in I

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.490 
then they have two premiums patched in I
