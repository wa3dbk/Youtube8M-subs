they've tried spraying a sealant to see

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.420 
they've tried spraying a sealant to see
if<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.739> fixed<00:00:47.039> their<00:00:47.129> problem<00:00:47.219> and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
if that fixed their problem and

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.430 
if that fixed their problem and
obviously<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.940> didn't<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.329> they've<00:00:49.200> had<00:00:49.379> a

this foam sealant and tar but it's just

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.840

not what this roof needed and this roof
is<00:01:06.030> still<00:01:06.180> salvageable<00:01:06.750> rather<00:01:07.619> than<00:01:07.950> having

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
is still salvageable rather than having

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.219 
is still salvageable rather than having
to<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.610> rip<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.909> off<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.420> replace<00:01:10.110> it

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229

between and what we're going to do is

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.990 
between and what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:40.229> gonna<00:01:40.320> spray<00:01:40.740> our<00:01:41.040> sealant<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
we're gonna spray our sealant in the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.450 
we're gonna spray our sealant in the
middle<00:01:42.210> here<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.259> flat<00:01:43.470> areas<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:43.950> lay

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
middle here in on the flat areas and lay

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.630 
middle here in on the flat areas and lay
our<00:01:44.930> our<00:01:45.930> membrane<00:01:46.409> down<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.250> sealant

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
our our membrane down so the sealant

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.249 
our our membrane down so the sealant
will<00:01:47.790> help<00:01:47.970> seal<00:01:48.180> up<00:01:48.329> all<00:01:48.420> those<00:01:48.540> pinpricks<00:01:49.079> of

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
will help seal up all those pinpricks of

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.639 
will help seal up all those pinpricks of
of<00:01:50.420> rusted<00:01:51.420> through<00:01:51.600> areas<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:52.500> we're

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
of rusted through areas and then we're

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.109 
of rusted through areas and then we're
gonna<00:01:52.740> put<00:01:52.979> our<00:01:53.009> membrane<00:01:53.579> down<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.000> that

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
gonna put our membrane down and that

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.149 
gonna put our membrane down and that
should<00:01:54.329> hold<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.689> over<00:01:54.899> for<00:01:55.110> another<00:01:55.290> 20-30

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
should hold it over for another 20-30

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.600 
should hold it over for another 20-30
years<00:01:57.110> one<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.259> biggest<00:01:58.619> issues<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:59.280> one

years one of the biggest issues on one

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.760 
years one of the biggest issues on one
of<00:01:59.640> these<00:01:59.759> commercial<00:02:00.210> roofs<00:02:00.420> are<00:02:00.689> having<00:02:01.680> to

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
of these commercial roofs are having to

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.969 
of these commercial roofs are having to
prepare<00:02:02.280> during<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.790> prep<00:02:03.000> work<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.590> here<00:02:04.590> we

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
prepare during the prep work and here we

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.560 
prepare during the prep work and here we
have<00:02:05.100> had<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.399> remove<00:02:05.549> all<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.000> material<00:02:06.390> from

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
have had to remove all the material from

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.449 
have had to remove all the material from
past<00:02:07.439> roofers<00:02:07.860> trying<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.129> fix<00:02:08.310> their

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
past roofers trying to fix their

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.150 
past roofers trying to fix their
problems<00:02:08.489> here<00:02:09.270> they<00:02:09.479> sprayed<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> foam<00:02:10.289> and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
problems here they sprayed a foam and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.190 
problems here they sprayed a foam and
our<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.610> they<00:02:12.270> even<00:02:12.450> sprayed<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.750> sealant<00:02:13.080> over

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
our and they even sprayed a sealant over

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.260 
our and they even sprayed a sealant over
that<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.920> we<00:02:14.250> have<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.490> remove<00:02:14.730> all<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:15.090> and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
that so we have to remove all that and

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.030 
that so we have to remove all that and
this<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:15.540> one<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.870> biggest<00:02:16.260> parts<00:02:16.590> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
this is one of the biggest parts the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.980 
this is one of the biggest parts the
hardest<00:02:17.370> parts<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:18.210> big<00:02:18.420> commercial<00:02:18.690> roof

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
hardest parts of a big commercial roof

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.900 
hardest parts of a big commercial roof
like<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.980> prep<00:02:20.280> work<00:02:20.310> there's<00:02:20.760> just

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
like this is the prep work there's just

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.690 
like this is the prep work there's just
the<00:02:21.060> sheer<00:02:21.300> amount<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.870> roofers<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.700> material

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
the sheer amount of roofers and material

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.190 
the sheer amount of roofers and material
that<00:02:23.820> they<00:02:23.910> put<00:02:24.120> down<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.540> all<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.840> attempts

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
that they put down and all the attempts

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.480 
that they put down and all the attempts
that<00:02:25.260> they've<00:02:25.410> tried<00:02:25.650> fixing<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.130> problem

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
that they've tried fixing this problem

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.400 
that they've tried fixing this problem
before<00:02:26.790> like<00:02:27.210> getting<00:02:27.600> serious<00:02:27.930> with

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
before like getting serious with

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.160 
before like getting serious with
actually<00:02:29.480> salvaging<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.570> roof<00:02:30.720> like<00:02:30.870> we<00:02:31.050> are

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
actually salvaging the roof like we are

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.110 
actually salvaging the roof like we are
so<00:02:31.680> here's<00:02:32.130> here's<00:02:32.490> one<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.850> hardest

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
so here's here's one of the hardest

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.220 
so here's here's one of the hardest
parts<00:02:33.360> right<00:02:33.480> here<00:02:35.840> another<00:02:36.840> part<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.140> the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
parts right here another part of the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.650 
parts right here another part of the
prep<00:02:37.440> work<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.920> cutting<00:02:38.760> all<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.180> membrane<00:02:39.630> to

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
prep work is cutting all the membrane to

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.170 
prep work is cutting all the membrane to
size<00:02:39.960> now<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.890> profile<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.460> every<00:02:41.730> metal<00:02:41.970> roof

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
size now the profile of every metal roof

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.030 
size now the profile of every metal roof
is<00:02:42.390> different<00:02:43.080> there<00:02:43.230> are<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.530> many<00:02:43.740> different

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
is different there are so many different

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.520 
is different there are so many different
kinds<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.490> with<00:02:44.880> this<00:02:45.090> one<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.080> bays<00:02:46.260> are

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
kinds and with this one the the bays are

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.140 
kinds and with this one the the bays are
a<00:02:46.560> certain<00:02:47.010> size<00:02:47.160> there<00:02:47.460> none<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.820> them<00:02:48.060> are

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
a certain size there none of them are

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.270 
a certain size there none of them are
the<00:02:48.240> same<00:02:48.390> they're<00:02:48.660> all<00:02:48.690> different<00:02:48.990> and<00:02:49.280> the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
the same they're all different and the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.000 
the same they're all different and the
shape<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.850> size<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.780> rising<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.650> risers

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
shape the size the the rising the risers

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.430 
shape the size the the rising the risers
are<00:02:53.400> all<00:02:53.640> different<00:02:54.120> sizes<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:55.020> down<00:02:55.200> here

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
are all different sizes so it down here

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.500 
are all different sizes so it down here
as<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.980> can<00:02:56.010> see<00:02:56.130> my<00:02:56.310> crew<00:02:56.970> over<00:02:57.090> here<00:02:57.330> is

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
as you can see my crew over here is

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.330 
as you can see my crew over here is
cutting<00:02:58.110> all<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.290> membrane<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.830> this<00:02:59.070> is<00:02:59.190> our

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
cutting all the membrane and this is our

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.100 
cutting all the membrane and this is our
cutting<00:03:00.060> table<00:03:00.360> that<00:03:00.450> we've<00:03:00.570> designed<00:03:00.870> so

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
cutting table that we've designed so

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.230 
cutting table that we've designed so
that<00:03:01.140> we<00:03:01.710> can<00:03:01.920> cut<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.370> more<00:03:02.520> efficiently<00:03:02.970> and

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
that we can cut it more efficiently and

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.080 
that we can cut it more efficiently and
more<00:03:03.750> quickly<00:03:04.050> so<00:03:04.680> get<00:03:05.370> everything<00:03:05.520> perfectly

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
more quickly so get everything perfectly

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.370 
more quickly so get everything perfectly
the<00:03:06.210> size<00:03:06.390> without<00:03:06.570> having<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.900> measure<00:03:07.050> every

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
the size without having to measure every

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:20.660 
the size without having to measure every
single<00:03:07.650> time<00:03:19.100> alright<00:03:20.100> I'm<00:03:20.280> here<00:03:20.340> on<00:03:20.580> the

UV rays so this will extend the life of
this<00:03:55.530> roof<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:56.010> save<00:03:56.880> it<00:03:57.090> from<00:03:57.360> having<00:03:57.870> to<00:03:57.930> be

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
roof and extended for another twenty

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.240 
roof and extended for another twenty
thirty<00:04:00.660> years<00:04:00.750> for<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.260> fraction<00:04:01.890> of<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.040> price

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250
