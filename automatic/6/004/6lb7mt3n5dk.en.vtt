probably<00:03:21.810> one<00:03:21.959> of<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.110> highest<00:03:22.320> compliments

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
probably one of the highest compliments

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.380 
probably one of the highest compliments
I<00:03:22.830> can<00:03:22.980> pay<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.220> this<00:03:23.520> particular<00:03:24.000> flavor<00:03:24.239> of

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
I can pay to this particular flavor of

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.240 
I can pay to this particular flavor of
seeds<00:03:24.630> is<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:25.110> they<00:03:25.230> are<00:03:25.290> extremely

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
seeds is that they are extremely

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
seeds is that they are extremely
addictive<00:03:28.250> included<00:03:29.250> in<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:29.520> though<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:30.000> one

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
addictive included in that though is one

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.910 
addictive included in that though is one
caveat<00:03:30.540> which<00:03:30.959> is<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.410> they<00:03:31.709> are

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
caveat which is that they are

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.400 
caveat which is that they are
extraordinarily<00:03:32.370> salty<00:03:33.120> as<00:03:33.300> well<00:03:33.690> so<00:03:34.200> if<00:03:34.320> you

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
extraordinarily salty as well so if you

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.110 
extraordinarily salty as well so if you
don't<00:03:34.680> like<00:03:34.890> salty<00:03:35.340> sunflower<00:03:35.700> seeds<00:03:35.940> that

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
don't like salty sunflower seeds that

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.340 
don't like salty sunflower seeds that
tear<00:03:36.330> up<00:03:36.420> your<00:03:36.480> tongue<00:03:36.750> after<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:37.110> day<00:03:37.320> of

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
tear up your tongue after a day of

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.260 
tear up your tongue after a day of

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
cracking them you might want to stay

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.970 
cracking them you might want to stay
away<00:03:39.420> from<00:03:39.450> these<00:03:39.660> because<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.410> flavor<00:03:40.650> is<00:03:40.800> so

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
away from these because the flavor is so

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.530 
away from these because the flavor is so
good<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.520> kind<00:03:41.880> of<00:03:42.000> get<00:03:42.120> caught<00:03:42.300> in<00:03:42.450> this

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
would have been really really good but

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.820 
would have been really really good but
it<00:04:03.150> doesn't<00:04:03.300> take<00:04:03.540> away<00:04:03.570> from<00:04:03.780> them<00:04:04.050> and<00:04:04.230> take

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
it doesn't take away from them and take

it doesn't take away from them and take
away<00:04:04.980> from<00:04:05.190> them<00:04:05.340> enough<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:06.000> I<00:04:06.030> would<00:04:06.239> stop

you<00:04:33.150> know<00:04:33.270> flavoring<00:04:33.900> out<00:04:34.740> of<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:34.980> whole

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
you know flavoring out of the whole

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.430 
you know flavoring out of the whole
first<00:04:35.400> bag<00:04:35.700> that<00:04:35.910> I<00:04:35.940> had<00:04:36.210> I<00:04:36.450> think<00:04:36.540> I<00:04:36.870> maybe<00:04:37.110> had

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
first bag that I had I think I maybe had

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.920 
first bag that I had I think I maybe had
two<00:04:37.770> bad<00:04:38.040> seeds<00:04:38.430> even<00:04:39.210> that<00:04:39.390> so<00:04:39.600> I<00:04:39.660> would<00:04:39.810> say

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
two bad seeds even that so I would say

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.960 
two bad seeds even that so I would say
quality<00:04:40.320> is<00:04:40.380> pretty<00:04:40.560> high<00:04:40.740> about<00:04:41.370> halfway<00:04:41.610> in

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
quality is pretty high about halfway in

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.880 
quality is pretty high about halfway in
maybe<00:04:42.240> a<00:04:42.300> third<00:04:42.570> into<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.020> second<00:04:43.470> bag<00:04:43.650> and

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
maybe a third into the second bag and

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.160 
maybe a third into the second bag and
again<00:04:44.880> consistencies<00:04:45.570> been<00:04:45.750> great<00:04:45.900> I<00:04:45.930> haven't

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
again consistencies been great I haven't

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.200 
again consistencies been great I haven't
had<00:04:46.380> any<00:04:46.590> bad<00:04:46.830> seeds<00:04:47.190> yet<00:04:47.370> in<00:04:47.550> this<00:04:47.700> bag<00:04:47.940> if

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
had any bad seeds yet in this bag if

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.760 
had any bad seeds yet in this bag if
you're<00:04:48.390> a<00:04:48.420> big<00:04:48.630> seed<00:04:48.930> tour<00:04:49.200> then<00:04:49.470> you<00:04:49.620> know

you're a big seed tour then you know

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.200 
you're a big seed tour then you know

that's just horrendous tasting and
almost<00:04:53.070> makes<00:04:53.220> you<00:04:53.280> want<00:04:53.460> to<00:04:53.520> stop<00:04:53.670> eating

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
almost makes you want to stop eating

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.450 
almost makes you want to stop eating
them<00:04:54.090> I<00:04:54.540> have<00:04:54.900> not<00:04:55.080> had<00:04:55.230> that<00:04:55.260> issue<00:04:55.590> so<00:04:55.950> far<00:04:55.980> so

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
them I have not had that issue so far so

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.100 
them I have not had that issue so far so
along<00:04:56.940> with<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.240> spits<00:04:57.480> brand<00:04:57.720> I'll<00:04:57.840> say<00:04:57.990> that

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
along with the spits brand I'll say that

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.420 
along with the spits brand I'll say that
these<00:04:58.230> I'll<00:04:58.470> give<00:04:58.620> them<00:04:58.710> high<00:04:58.860> marks<00:04:58.890> for<00:04:59.370> a

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
these I'll give them high marks for a

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.570 
these I'll give them high marks for a
good<00:05:00.060> quality<00:05:00.570> consistent<00:05:01.290> seed<00:05:01.560> they<00:05:02.310> crack

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
good quality consistent seed they crack

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.550 
good quality consistent seed they crack
easily<00:05:02.850> they're<00:05:03.600> not<00:05:03.750> too<00:05:03.960> tough<00:05:04.140> to<00:05:04.350> get<00:05:04.440> out

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
easily they're not too tough to get out

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.900 
easily they're not too tough to get out
of<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:04.740> shell<00:05:04.950> which<00:05:05.190> is<00:05:05.340> something<00:05:05.550> I<00:05:05.730> don't

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
of the shell which is something I don't

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.970 
of the shell which is something I don't
like<00:05:05.970> and<00:05:06.330> because<00:05:06.900> of<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.320> size<00:05:07.560> and<00:05:07.860> the

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
like and because of the size and the

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.440 
like and because of the size and the
shape<00:05:08.010> of<00:05:08.310> the<00:05:08.460> seeds<00:05:08.700> they're<00:05:08.940> very<00:05:09.120> easy<00:05:09.300> to

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
shape of the seeds they're very easy to

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.270 
shape of the seeds they're very easy to
crack<00:05:09.630> open<00:05:09.840> without<00:05:10.260> damaging<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:10.920> kernel

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
crack open without damaging the kernel

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.190 
crack open without damaging the kernel
inside<00:05:11.460> there's<00:05:12.090> nothing<00:05:12.420> more<00:05:13.020> annoying

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
inside there's nothing more annoying

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.810 
inside there's nothing more annoying
than<00:05:13.440> cracking<00:05:13.860> seeds<00:05:14.130> and<00:05:14.370> getting<00:05:14.550> that<00:05:14.640> one
