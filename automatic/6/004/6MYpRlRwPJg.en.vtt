00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello youtube so today actually 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.220
 I will show you what we realized 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.840
 with a friend in his workshop he was 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:18.900
 actually made to a beautiful workbench 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:20.310
 for the equivalent of 2 15 euros then I 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.600
 I'll explain a little in two words 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:30.210
 we got three pallets and we got 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:34.860
 attached expressed in dice by stainless davies 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:38.129
 floor that can be found at 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.629
 casto this is it's life stop 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.219
 visits to exactly what we used 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.230
 vices of boards and so any beast one 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.070
 at a price of the brackets we have 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.070
 soil stupidly and we have too much 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.420
 old board here which is still 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:01.199
 thick enough to be solidarized with 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.510
 screws and two of beams in fact also 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.939
 to come true and after all 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.010
 all these parts if in fact it's 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.560
 inner parts of pallets 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.689
 we have dismantled and we have all those 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:19.049
 realized together and we realized 1 1 and 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.790
 hd of work extremely convenient for 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.380
 a really small shot 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.540
 and yes and that's me the 15 euros do not we 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.670
 do not take into account actually there the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.460
 work surface who who knows a 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.950
 large plant that we recovered we have 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.060
 recovered for free but that's it if he 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.720
 should buy I think it's up to 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.340
 around 20 euros 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.220
 so we'll say that for a quarantine 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:52.770
 euros including screws you will be able 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:58.549
 you do a workbench that's solid and 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.509
 extremely resistant and that is 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.640
 extremely convenient for full 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.630
 of use so here is so if you 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.020
 want me to give you more details 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.780

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.270
 where measures 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.610
