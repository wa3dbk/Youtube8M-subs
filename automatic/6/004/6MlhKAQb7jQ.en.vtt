00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 hello very good I want subscribers here 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.890
 we are with this new video for the 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.210
 channel new video of gta 5 and in this 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.700
 video I'm going to show you how we can 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.920
 throw us from helicopters on rope 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.719
 slide on a rope as well as 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.639
 make the bodies these specials of the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.830
 police like the marshall or the geos 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.869
 these special bodies that do that 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.390
 kind of powers do not do pirouettes and 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.279
 things are good so I'm going to teach how 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.230
 do it in a very easy way and 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.640
 simple because the game allows us 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.710
 doing it is already worth with this last 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.689
 fine update we just have to 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.480
 call meriweather and request a 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.860
 collected by helicopter as you can see 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.930
 well you know what will happen is that we 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.300
 going to pick up a helicopter worth 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.920
 is a house of logic, not well 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.750
 when the helicopter sometimes comes in 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.059
 helicopter the driver has a 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.520
 small delay is already worth the best as no 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.200
 park well or it costs to go down or what 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.329
 be good in my case I have played the 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.219
 ready of meriweather then low 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.199
 perfectly and park beside me without 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.420
 any kind of problem well then when 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.680
 apart what we are going to do is not 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.120
 kill him what we are 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.100
 used to killing him and 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.379
 to stay by helicopter is that we are 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.090
 that's how we are like this we love to steal 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.810
 helicopter, well, not what we are going to 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.909
 to do is to ride 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.369
 in plan well as it should be done 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.600
 we ride and when you tell us to request 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.310
 destination what we are going to do is 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.930
 request a destination you see here below to the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.570
 right puts destination fix as we press 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.939
 when we are going to the map and we set a 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.979
 destination well the destination that we have to 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.990
 fix must be on top of some 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.850
 building is worth over some building 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.860
 it is not worth the helicopter to take 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.119
 for ass in the sky and that down only 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.829
 if the floor is valid and there is a height 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.630
 of the snowflake no no no 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.630
 we have to try to fix the destiny 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.490
 on top of a building worth looks easy 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.470
 but it 's a bit complicated, you're worth it 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.569
 well we can direct the helicopter 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.069
 where we want, we can direct you 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:45.569
 when we want and where we want well 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.220
 here as you can see , it stops me 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.149
 half of the street worth seems to be that 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.009
 after all yes I had a little 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.450
 delay so good stay here 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.189
 standing in the middle of the street, I'm lame 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.470
 I give again to the map to set new 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.299
 destination and set a little more there to 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.700
 the right of the map to see if it is 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.880
 able to fall well on top of a 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.380
 building well as you see now it goes going 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.390
 to see if I can press it myself 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.950
 there is also very good very well then nothing 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.959
 you see that the helicopter moves and we 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.760
 leads to the new destination point 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.030
 well when the new point of 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.980
 destination, you are going to see 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.360
 it does not correct either and it does not stay either 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.980
 about a building do not worry no 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.080
 nothing happens we will try again 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.520
 if you stay here there is a lot 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.350
 distance as I say from the helicopter to 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.970
 So , it will allow us to do it 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.230
 As you can see, I've seen that there is a 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.430
 building on my left I move it a 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.990
 little to the left and serious 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.180
 know that down to the right where you put 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.190
 jump you are going to see that it puts a new 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.290
 option that puts down the value 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.660
 pick me up a thing like that puts worth here 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.610
 you see pick me up ok it's keep 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.260
 pressed square so when we maintain 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.420
 pressed the square when we get out 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.920
 this interaction we will keep 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.670
 pressed the square and as you see loose 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.440
 a cord 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.180
 the helicopter pulls a rope and 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.220
 we hooked in there in plan 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.500
 the coolest of all gta 5 I'm worth the 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.720
 host in vinegar and nothing because we can 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.519
 go down sliding down the rope yes 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.019
 if you are banks like me what 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.610
 will happen is that if you do not have good 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.130
 you lose the chunk ostia of the centuries you kill 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.810
 and well then comes the tears 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.370
 and cry them so nothing if it has 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.810

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.610
