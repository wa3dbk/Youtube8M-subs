00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.980
 He was always there early man 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.670
 He also looked up at her and 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.670
 he was curious 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.140
 then fear came 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.140
 and the moon was worshiped 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.309
 later on humans the 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.110
 they turned into a dream sometimes beautiful to 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.080
 sometimes terrifying 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.020
 and the natural satellite of the earth is 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.410
 became an emblem of the utopian of what 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.410
 unattainable 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.180
 until the 20th century the moon was owned 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.580
 of poets and dreamers 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.240
 Pythagoras believed equally in a moon 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.060
 alive and inhabited and his disciple filo side 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.270
 would go further ensuring that our 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.640
 natural satellite was inhabited by 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.930
 being 15 times larger than 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.240
 humans 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.430
 and it was right to say that the lunar day 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.430
 is equivalent to 15 Earth days 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.960
 then the books arrived 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.479
 plutarch in the first century of our 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.170
 was he describes the moon as a second 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.509
 land 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.509
 and with the books the trips 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.439
 It was around the year 160 AD 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.409
 when the Greek luciano of samósata 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.900
 write the first trip to the moon that in 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.940
 his work true history a waterspout 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.070
 water drags a boat to the 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.680
 lunar surface 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.810
 ariosto in the furious orlando insures 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.820
 that the moon is a great valley in which 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.810
 is everything we have lost 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.490
 on earth riches crowns honor and 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:20.110
 hope 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:22.690
 in 1638 the man appears in england 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.840
 on the moon another book that causes 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.750
 feeling its author the bishop francisco 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.450
 wing sends the adventurer to the moon 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.570
 Spanish Sunday Gonzalez with the help of 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.050
 a couple of trained geese was with 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.750
 galileo in the 17th century when the old 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.300
 ideas of the Greeks on the moon 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.180
 they begin to take Galilean consistency 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.970
 Invents the telescope and is amazed 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.850
 when contemplating the craters and the large 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.690
 dark surfaces that are 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.510
 identified with seas in 1647 jon 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.750
 evelis draws the first lunar map and what 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.430
 published in your book are read or written 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.860
 stating that the moon was full of 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.510
 cities excited about these 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.950
 discoveries cyrano de bergerac 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:14.890
 publishes in 1648 his famous trip to the 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.010
 moon an amazing book in which by 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.160
 first time they talk about tyrant rockets 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.000
 describes two starships one driven 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.870
 by the eba 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.750
 from the dew the other by a rocket of three 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.610
 phases would be this work just the 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.400
 that would serve as an inspiration to July 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.360
 verne and the parents of astronautics 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.480
 modern in 1671 cherub of orleans 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.020
 publishes a second map place the interest 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.970
 of the public is such that in 1865 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.209
 they publish six books on subjects 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.690
 spatial the best known was definitely 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:56.230
 from the earth to the moon of the great green 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.510
 and in 1903 the faithful Russian covs that 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:03.720
 provides the guidelines that would serve as 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.720
 Rocket model of the 20th century 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.850
 before entering fully into the keys 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.980
 from this story let me take a note 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.070
 which is closely related to what 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:38.300
 I want to tell you follow me again and 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.300
 keep it in your memory 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.510
 besides those old and romantic ideas 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.940
 about the moon and literature more or 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.669
 less fantastic about travel to 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.560
 our enigmatic natural satellite the 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.780
 history of humanity appears 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.480
 equally replete with others no less 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.050
 mysterious phenomena recorded in the 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:05.020
 lunar surface in the summer of 1178 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.690
 shortly after sundown a group of 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.000
 monks of canterbury cathedral 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.610
 observed on the edge of the moon a 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.720
 formidable glow accompanied by 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:19.840
 gigantic flares in 1789 the 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.610
 Astronomer Schröder stared stunned a 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.600
 huge illuminated area in the call 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:28.000
 region of the lunar alps throughout 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.979
 of that year other observers gave faith 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.560
 of the presence on the surface of the 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.960
 Incredible and bewildering moon 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.580
 lights that moved between seas and 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.419
 craters 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.879
 in 1820 the also astronomer françois 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.090
 Aragón published in the annals of chemistry and 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:46.889
 physical the story of another amazing 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.830
 observation 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.860
 during an eclipse a whole formation of 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.939
 lights evolved on the moon 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:58.620
 keeping the flight order during 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:06:01.409
 the trips in 1843 the mentioned 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.719
 German astronomer johannes ryder attended 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:06.040
 to another phenomenon for which neither 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:08.800
 has found an explanation 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.120
 when observing the crater line in the sea of 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.680
 the tranquility 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.740
 the scientist checked something 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.350
 puzzling the cited crater of some 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.380
 7 kilometers in diameter changed 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.690
 regularly shortly after 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.610
 amazement of the scientific community the 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:28.190
 crater in question disappeared by 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:32.630
 complete that had happened 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:35.990
 in 1971 apollo 15 flew over the area and 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:39.770
 photographed line the bewilderment of the 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:43.550
 astronomers was total the crater line only 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:47.990
 It was 2700 meters in diameter and was 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:51.050
 here in 1877 the English astronomer Klein 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.940
 he witnessed other intense and rapid 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.940
 lights that went to the center of the 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.040
 platter crater 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:00.080
 Once in the boiler, the lights 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:04.220
 they gathered forming a triangle 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:07.849
 in 1950 Dr. Wilkins witnessed 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:10.280
 another seemingly impossible event in 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:11.900
 the center of the Aristarian crater 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.889
 suddenly turned on a great light 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.360
 illuminating a wide lunar region 

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:18.200
 large flares on the surface of 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.700
 the moon 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.700
 lights in formation 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.150
 what was happening on the moon 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:45.180
 and in July of 1969 at last the human being 

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:47.040
 he fulfilled his old and longed for dream the 

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:49.070
 apollo 11 sat on the sea of ​​the 

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.070
 tranquility 

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:05.260
 and the world vibrated with those first and 

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:05.260
 he has two steps of neil armstrong 

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:16.400
 but the world was once again deceived
