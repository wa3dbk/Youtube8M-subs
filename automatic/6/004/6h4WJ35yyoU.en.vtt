but<00:03:10.980> as<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:11.880> quick<00:03:12.150> note<00:03:12.270> I<00:03:13.170> most<00:03:13.920> likely<00:03:14.100> will

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
but as a quick note I most likely will

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.430 
but as a quick note I most likely will
not<00:03:14.550> be<00:03:14.610> keeping<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:15.300> vehicle<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:15.870> mean<00:03:16.410> I

my car just as I bet all of you guys do

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.460 
my car just as I bet all of you guys do
but<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.960> problem<00:03:25.170> is<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:27.540> haven't<00:03:28.080> had<00:03:28.320> it

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
but the problem is that I haven't had it

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.350 
but the problem is that I haven't had it
that<00:03:28.590> long<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:29.070> didn't<00:03:29.490> do<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.670> lot<00:03:30.060> of<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.240> work

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
that long I didn't do a lot of the work

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.900 
that long I didn't do a lot of the work
myself<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.620> just<00:03:31.650> can't<00:03:32.130> justify<00:03:32.730> it

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
myself and I just can't justify it

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.000 
myself and I just can't justify it
financially<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:34.350> can<00:03:34.410> see<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.680> kept

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
financially you can see I kept

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.810 
financially you can see I kept
everything<00:03:35.250> pretty<00:03:35.730> clean<00:03:36.950> I<00:03:37.950> just<00:03:38.610> can't

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
everything pretty clean I just can't

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.870 
everything pretty clean I just can't
justify<00:03:38.880> it<00:03:39.330> financially<00:03:40.080> to<00:03:40.400> keep<00:03:41.400> the

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
justify it financially to keep the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.580 
justify it financially to keep the
vehicle<00:03:42.330> so<00:03:43.970> if<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.420> was<00:03:45.570> like<00:03:45.780> Ryan<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.410> had

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
vehicle so if I was like Ryan and I had

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.340 
vehicle so if I was like Ryan and I had
this<00:03:46.710> vehicle<00:03:46.950> for<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.670> long<00:03:48.090> time<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.840> I

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
this vehicle for a long time and I

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.700 
this vehicle for a long time and I
already<00:03:49.620> put<00:03:49.860> in<00:03:49.980> so<00:03:50.190> much<00:03:50.340> work<00:03:50.400> where<00:03:51.710> total

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
already put in so much work where total

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.190 
already put in so much work where total
it<00:03:52.980> wouldn't<00:03:53.310> even<00:03:53.700> give<00:03:54.360> me<00:03:54.480> back<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.690> fraction

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
it wouldn't even give me back a fraction

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.530 
it wouldn't even give me back a fraction
of<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.470> investment<00:03:56.040> then<00:03:56.490> under<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.150> case

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
of the investment then under that case

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.450 
of the investment then under that case
yes<00:03:57.960> I<00:03:58.140> would<00:03:58.260> definitely<00:03:58.680> keep<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:59.040> vehicle

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
yes I would definitely keep the vehicle

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.150 
yes I would definitely keep the vehicle
I<00:03:59.640> mean<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.150> is<00:04:00.330> fixable<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:01.350> just<00:04:01.740> will<00:04:01.950> cost

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
I mean it is fixable it just will cost

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.550 
I mean it is fixable it just will cost
more<00:04:02.940> than<00:04:03.240> basically<00:04:03.990> what<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.320> car<00:04:04.530> is

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
more than basically what the car is

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.490 
more than basically what the car is
worth<00:04:04.710> right<00:04:05.100> now<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:06.720> main<00:04:06.930> part<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.380> the

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
worth right now the main part of the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.540 
worth right now the main part of the
damage<00:04:07.860> again<00:04:08.250> is<00:04:08.570> undercarriage<00:04:09.570> which<00:04:10.550> you

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
damage again is undercarriage which you

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.420 
damage again is undercarriage which you
probably<00:04:11.760> won't<00:04:12.150> be<00:04:12.360> able<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.600> see<00:04:13.340> but<00:04:15.230> yeah

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
probably won't be able to see but yeah

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:24.680 
probably won't be able to see but yeah
