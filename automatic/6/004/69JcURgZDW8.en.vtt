what<00:02:53.099> I<00:02:53.160> had<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.459> do<00:02:53.610> was<00:02:53.819> salvage<00:02:54.630> as<00:02:54.750> much<00:02:54.840> as

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
what I had to do was salvage as much as

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.410 
what I had to do was salvage as much as
I<00:02:55.110> could<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.739> replaced<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.880> plastic

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
I could of it I replaced the plastic

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.949 
I could of it I replaced the plastic
keys<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:59.069> role<00:02:59.370> play<00:02:59.549> mechanism<00:03:00.150> with<00:03:00.930> a

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
keys and the role play mechanism with a

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.920 
keys and the role play mechanism with a
bunch<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.440> really<00:03:01.709> simple<00:03:02.010> little

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
bunch of really simple little

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.599 
bunch of really simple little
electromagnetic<00:03:03.930> solenoids<00:03:04.350> it's<00:03:05.190> basically

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
electromagnetic solenoids it's basically

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.099 
electromagnetic solenoids it's basically
a<00:03:05.730> little<00:03:06.030> coil<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.329> wire<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:08.329> a<00:03:09.329> steel<00:03:09.690> a

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
great antique smell to it the two parts

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.150 
great antique smell to it the two parts
to<00:03:44.990> what<00:03:45.140> I<00:03:45.170> have<00:03:45.350> to<00:03:45.440> do<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.710> the<00:03:45.800> accordion

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
to what I have to do to the accordion

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.710 
to what I have to do to the accordion
the<00:03:46.460> first<00:03:46.850> part<00:03:47.060> is<00:03:47.150> figure<00:03:47.360> out<00:03:47.420> how<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:47.600> make

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
the first part is figure out how to make

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.860 
the first part is figure out how to make
the<00:03:47.840> keys<00:03:48.050> move<00:03:48.320> and<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:49.250> second<00:03:49.610> part<00:03:49.850> is<00:03:50.090> to

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
the keys move and the second part is to

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.510 
the keys move and the second part is to
figure<00:03:51.320> out<00:03:51.440> how<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:51.680> make<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.040> bellows<00:03:52.310> move

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
figure out how to make the bellows move

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.000 
figure out how to make the bellows move
so<00:03:53.120> what<00:03:53.300> I'm<00:03:53.390> hoping<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:53.750> do<00:03:53.900> is<00:03:54.370> I'm<00:03:55.370> going<00:03:55.580> to

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
hanging from an electric winch that will

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:20.140 
hanging from an electric winch that will
lift<00:04:07.880> it<00:04:08.180> up<00:04:08.600> and<00:04:08.959> down<00:04:09.080> as<00:04:09.440> it<00:04:09.950> plays<00:04:18.790> so<00:04:19.790> I'm

looking through these little slots here
and<00:04:23.090> I<00:04:23.150> can<00:04:23.390> see<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.780> keys<00:04:23.990> but<00:04:24.380> they're

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
and I can see the keys but they're

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.070 
and I can see the keys but they're
behind<00:04:24.830> this<00:04:25.700> complicated<00:04:26.240> aluminum<00:04:26.810> grid

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
behind this complicated aluminum grid

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.320 
attach the motors to the backs of these
keys<00:04:32.000> so<00:04:32.180> I<00:04:32.240> can<00:04:32.420> pull<00:04:32.600> on<00:04:32.690> them<00:04:34.330> I'm

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
keys so I can pull on them I'm

keys so I can pull on them I'm
definitely<00:04:35.780> interested<00:04:35.960> in<00:04:36.320> making<00:04:36.919> sound

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
definitely interested in making sound

and piano lessons when it was a kid I

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.400 
and piano lessons when it was a kid I
mean<00:04:47.150> just<00:04:47.360> like<00:04:47.480> a<00:04:47.510> year<00:04:47.840> of<00:04:47.930> each<00:04:48.050> never

mean just like a year of each never
became<00:04:48.680> terribly<00:04:49.250> good<00:04:49.460> at<00:04:49.520> either<00:04:49.700> one<00:04:49.940> I

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
became terribly good at either one I

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.670 
became terribly good at either one I
wasn't<00:04:50.780> sure<00:04:50.960> that<00:04:50.990> I<00:04:51.169> would<00:04:51.230> develop<00:04:51.560> any

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
wasn't sure that I would develop any

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.560 
wasn't sure that I would develop any
kind<00:04:51.740> of<00:04:51.950> musical<00:04:52.250> talent<00:04:52.430> in<00:04:53.150> messing<00:04:53.510> around

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
kind of musical talent in messing around

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.880 
kind of musical talent in messing around
with<00:04:53.720> these<00:04:53.810> things<00:04:53.870> but<00:04:54.290> I'm<00:04:54.410> glad<00:04:54.530> that<00:04:54.650> I'm

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
with these things but I'm glad that I'm

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.110 
with these things but I'm glad that I'm
actually<00:04:55.040> getting<00:04:55.280> a<00:04:55.520> little<00:04:55.669> bit<00:04:55.910> of

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
actually getting a little bit of

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.689 
actually getting a little bit of
progress<00:04:56.330> there

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
progress there

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.369 
progress there
the<00:04:59.330> next<00:04:59.569> step<00:04:59.719> is<00:04:59.840> to<00:04:59.930> figure<00:05:00.080> out<00:05:00.199> how<00:05:00.349> to

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:00.379 
the next step is to figure out how to

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:02.170 
the next step is to figure out how to
attach<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.740> motors<00:05:01.159> to<00:05:01.729> the<00:05:01.819> back<00:05:01.939> of<00:05:02.060> the

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
attach the motors to the back of the

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.830 
attach the motors to the back of the
accordion<00:05:02.599> and<00:05:02.749> have<00:05:03.590> them<00:05:03.770> pull<00:05:03.979> the<00:05:04.840> pull

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
accordion and have them pull the pull

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.260 
accordion and have them pull the pull
the<00:05:05.930> keys<00:05:06.400> so<00:05:07.400> it's<00:05:07.520> gonna<00:05:07.669> be<00:05:07.789> something<00:05:08.240> like

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
the keys so it's gonna be something like

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.300 
the keys so it's gonna be something like
this<00:05:11.379> this<00:05:12.379> is<00:05:12.439> a<00:05:12.590> part<00:05:12.860> where<00:05:12.949> I'm<00:05:13.069> going<00:05:13.249> to

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
this this is a part where I'm going to

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.439 
this this is a part where I'm going to
start<00:05:13.490> using<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:13.789> computer<00:05:14.090> to<00:05:14.150> help<00:05:14.240> me

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
start using the computer to help me

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.559 
start using the computer to help me
think<00:05:14.689> I<00:05:14.930> can<00:05:15.590> try<00:05:16.520> to<00:05:16.550> put<00:05:16.789> a<00:05:16.819> diagram<00:05:17.240> of<00:05:17.300> the

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 
think I can try to put a diagram of the

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:19.390 
think I can try to put a diagram of the
back<00:05:17.749> of<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:17.990> accordion<00:05:18.379> into<00:05:19.189> illustrator

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
back of the accordion into illustrator

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.550 
back of the accordion into illustrator
and<00:05:20.029> try<00:05:20.180> to<00:05:20.240> figure<00:05:20.419> out<00:05:20.659> how<00:05:21.229> I'm<00:05:21.349> going<00:05:21.499> to

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
and try to figure out how I'm going to

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.800 
and try to figure out how I'm going to
build<00:05:21.740> these<00:05:21.889> brackets<00:05:22.400> to<00:05:23.360> hold<00:05:23.389> the<00:05:23.569> motors

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
build these brackets to hold the motors

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.260 
build these brackets to hold the motors
up<00:05:23.990> I<00:05:25.930> just<00:05:26.930> made<00:05:27.139> my<00:05:27.349> first<00:05:28.279> test<00:05:28.669> print<00:05:29.029> of

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
up I just made my first test print of

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.990 
up I just made my first test print of
the<00:05:29.509> motor<00:05:30.020> brackets<00:05:30.499> and<00:05:30.740> the<00:05:31.520> motors<00:05:31.789> seem

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
the motor brackets and the motors seem

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.719 
the motor brackets and the motors seem
to<00:05:32.120> fit<00:05:32.300> in<00:05:32.330> pretty<00:05:32.599> good<00:05:32.889> so<00:05:33.889> I<00:05:34.250> think<00:05:34.610> I'm

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
to fit in pretty good so I think I'm

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.029 
to fit in pretty good so I think I'm
good<00:05:34.939> to<00:05:35.029> go<00:05:35.180> to<00:05:35.240> do<00:05:35.479> this<00:05:35.659> in<00:05:35.810> plastic<00:05:36.039> which

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
good to go to do this in plastic which

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.689 
good to go to do this in plastic which
is<00:05:37.279> a<00:05:37.310> lot<00:05:37.520> slower<00:05:37.729> to<00:05:37.909> cut<00:05:39.460> it's<00:05:40.460> interesting

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
is a lot slower to cut it's interesting

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:42.610 
is a lot slower to cut it's interesting
to<00:05:41.000> me<00:05:41.029> to<00:05:41.120> make<00:05:41.330> things<00:05:41.629> that<00:05:41.900> are<00:05:42.110> in<00:05:42.349> a<00:05:42.379> sense

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
to me to make things that are in a sense

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.409 
to me to make things that are in a sense
musical<00:05:43.039> instruments<00:05:43.520> but<00:05:43.580> they<00:05:44.210> aren't
