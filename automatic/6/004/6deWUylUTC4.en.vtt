00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
see how versatile this bitch really is

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.270 
see how versatile this bitch really is
so<00:03:16.780> if<00:03:16.960> you're<00:03:17.110> still<00:03:17.350> thinking<00:03:17.530> about<00:03:17.740> what

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
so if you're still thinking about what

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.060 
so if you're still thinking about what
workbench<00:03:18.940> do<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.180> want<00:03:19.540> this<00:03:20.110> may<00:03:20.380> be<00:03:20.440> a<00:03:20.590> reason

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
workbench do I want this may be a reason

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:31.220 
workbench do I want this may be a reason
to<00:03:21.280> go<00:03:21.880> with<00:03:22.060> this<00:03:22.240> bench

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.729 

so<00:03:32.230> there<00:03:32.409> you<00:03:32.439> go<00:03:32.590> there's<00:03:32.980> one<00:03:33.250> cut<00:03:33.579> finished

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
so there you go there's one cut finished

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.399 
so there you go there's one cut finished
so<00:03:35.739> then<00:03:35.920> basically<00:03:36.189> I<00:03:36.519> just<00:03:36.819> undo<00:03:37.629> it<00:03:37.659> and<00:03:37.810> do

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
so then basically I just undo it and do

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.190 
so then basically I just undo it and do
another<00:03:38.680> one

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.699 

and<00:03:43.290> so<00:03:43.610> that's<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.819> first<00:03:45.060> cut<00:03:45.360> did<00:03:46.319> you<00:03:46.470> saw

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
and so that's the first cut did you saw

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.620 
and so that's the first cut did you saw
and<00:03:47.130> now<00:03:47.370> I'm<00:03:47.610> going<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.849> do<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.120> second<00:03:48.510> I'm

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
and now I'm going to do the second I'm

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.089 
and now I'm going to do the second I'm
going<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.840> show<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.290> quick<00:03:49.470> setup<00:03:49.800> that<00:03:50.010> I

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
going to show you the quick setup that I

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.460 
going to show you the quick setup that I
use<00:03:50.340> this<00:03:50.849> these<00:03:51.209> little<00:03:51.480> spacer<00:03:51.930> blocks<00:03:52.170> or

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
use this these little spacer blocks or

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.350 
use this these little spacer blocks or
what<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.620> use<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:53.190> clip<00:03:53.370> between<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.880> tail<00:03:54.090> vise

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
what I use to clip between the tail vise

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.630 
what I use to clip between the tail vise
there<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.590> plywood<00:03:55.830> so<00:03:56.190> I<00:03:56.220> had<00:03:56.400> room<00:03:56.610> for

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
there and the plywood so I had room for

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.540 
there and the plywood so I had room for
my<00:03:57.060> Sol<00:03:57.360> to<00:03:57.599> drop<00:03:57.840> in<00:03:58.080> and<00:03:58.260> make<00:03:58.860> a<00:03:58.890> safe<00:03:59.220> cut

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
my Sol to drop in and make a safe cut

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.510 
my Sol to drop in and make a safe cut
remember<00:04:00.540> both<00:04:01.050> sides<00:04:01.350> are<00:04:01.560> fully<00:04:01.860> supported

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
remember both sides are fully supported

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.500 
remember both sides are fully supported
which<00:04:02.850> is<00:04:03.030> excellent<00:04:04.190> all<00:04:05.190> I<00:04:05.250> do<00:04:05.430> is<00:04:05.819> drop<00:04:06.300> this

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
which is excellent all I do is drop this

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.900 
which is excellent all I do is drop this
block<00:04:06.840> in<00:04:07.110> here<00:04:09.650> tighten<00:04:10.650> this<00:04:10.890> up<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.610> now

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910

block in here tighten this up and now
I've<00:04:12.090> got<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:12.750> trough<00:04:13.560> right<00:04:13.950> down<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.370> center

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
I've got a trough right down the center

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.629 
I've got a trough right down the center
here<00:04:14.760> clear<00:04:15.600> my<00:04:15.810> blade<00:04:16.079> and<00:04:18.919> basically<00:04:19.919> that's

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
here clear my blade and basically that's

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.310 
here clear my blade and basically that's
it<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:20.940> mean<00:04:21.060> it's<00:04:21.329> a<00:04:21.389> solid<00:04:21.810> it's<00:04:21.900> ready<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.229> go

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
it I mean it's a solid it's ready to go

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.580 
it I mean it's a solid it's ready to go
so<00:04:22.470> let's<00:04:22.740> finish<00:04:23.130> our<00:04:23.430> our<00:04:24.000> long<00:04:24.270> cut<00:04:24.630> here

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.350 

you<00:04:28.590> can<00:04:28.740> see<00:04:28.919> this<00:04:29.070> all<00:04:29.340> fits<00:04:29.669> down<00:04:29.880> in<00:04:30.120> here

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
you can see this all fits down in here

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.700 
you can see this all fits down in here
nicely

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.210 

okay<00:04:36.310> so<00:04:36.370> we've<00:04:36.789> ripped<00:04:37.090> all<00:04:37.300> of<00:04:37.479> our<00:04:38.220> plywood

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
okay so we've ripped all of our plywood

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.719 
okay so we've ripped all of our plywood
down<00:04:39.820> into<00:04:40.240> long<00:04:40.449> strips<00:04:41.070> so<00:04:42.070> we've<00:04:42.310> got<00:04:42.490> two

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
down into long strips so we've got two

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.820 
down into long strips so we've got two
long<00:04:42.970> pieces<00:04:43.360> for<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:43.840> sides<00:04:44.110> and<00:04:44.530> now<00:04:44.620> we're

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
long pieces for the sides and now we're

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.939 
long pieces for the sides and now we're
going<00:04:45.009> to<00:04:45.070> need<00:04:45.250> to<00:04:45.490> make<00:04:46.080> all<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.410> shelves

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
going to need to make all the shelves

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.460 
going to need to make all the shelves
and<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:48.160> top<00:04:48.400> and<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.669> bottom<00:04:48.850> so<00:04:49.840> everything

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
and the top and the bottom so everything

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.909 
and the top and the bottom so everything
I<00:04:50.620> added<00:04:51.190> like<00:04:51.400> a<00:04:51.729> half<00:04:52.060> an<00:04:52.270> inch<00:04:52.449> to<00:04:53.110> all<00:04:53.650> the

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
I added like a half an inch to all the

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.310 
I added like a half an inch to all the
widths<00:04:54.400> and<00:04:54.580> then<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.419> length<00:04:55.600> I<00:04:55.870> added<00:04:56.229> an

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
widths and then the length I added an

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.140 
widths and then the length I added an
inch<00:04:56.530> so<00:04:56.860> that<00:04:56.889> later<00:04:57.250> on<00:04:57.340> I<00:04:57.490> can<00:04:57.789> come<00:04:57.970> back

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
inch so that later on I can come back

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.240 
inch so that later on I can come back
because<00:04:58.509> some<00:04:58.780> of<00:04:58.810> these<00:04:58.930> edges<00:04:59.169> are<00:04:59.710> a<00:04:59.949> little

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
because some of these edges are a little

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.850 
because some of these edges are a little
rough<00:05:00.729> just<00:05:01.030> from<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.270> circular<00:05:01.750> saw<00:05:02.020> so

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
rough just from the circular saw so

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.960 
rough just from the circular saw so
that's<00:05:03.070> a<00:05:03.190> very<00:05:03.400> fine<00:05:03.699> tooth<00:05:04.090> blade<00:05:04.419> here<00:05:05.970> you

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
that's a very fine tooth blade here you

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.719 
that's a very fine tooth blade here you
know<00:05:07.120> it's<00:05:07.300> a<00:05:07.470> it's<00:05:08.470> a<00:05:08.590> miter<00:05:08.860> saw<00:05:08.979> a<00:05:09.550> lot<00:05:09.699> of

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
know it's a it's a miter saw a lot of

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.400 
know it's a it's a miter saw a lot of
people<00:05:09.880> have<00:05:10.090> misconceptions<00:05:10.300> about<00:05:10.930> it<00:05:11.259> this

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
people have misconceptions about it this

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.010 
people have misconceptions about it this
one<00:05:11.650> here<00:05:11.919> is<00:05:12.099> a<00:05:12.130> you<00:05:12.610> know<00:05:12.729> really<00:05:13.330> high-end

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
one here is a you know really high-end

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.640 
one here is a you know really high-end
saw

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
saw

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.089 
saw
I've<00:05:14.740> got<00:05:15.310> a<00:05:15.340> quality<00:05:15.639> blade<00:05:16.090> on<00:05:16.330> it<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.840> key

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
I've got a quality blade on it the key

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.279 
I've got a quality blade on it the key
to<00:05:18.099> all<00:05:18.400> cutting<00:05:19.030> I<00:05:19.150> tell<00:05:19.449> you<00:05:19.539> is<00:05:19.690> a<00:05:19.720> quality

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
to all cutting I tell you is a quality

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:35.629 
to all cutting I tell you is a quality
blade

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.249 

I<00:05:38.240> always<00:05:39.240> thought<00:05:39.419> the<00:05:39.569> blade<00:05:39.780> come<00:05:40.050> to<00:05:40.229> a

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 
I always thought the blade come to a

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.339 
I always thought the blade come to a
stop<00:05:40.530> before<00:05:40.800> you<00:05:41.039> lift<00:05:41.310> it<00:05:41.490> out<00:05:41.990> it's<00:05:42.990> just<00:05:43.080> a

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
stop before you lift it out it's just a

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:47.600 
stop before you lift it out it's just a
good<00:05:43.560> good<00:05:43.949> practice<00:05:45.439> and<00:05:46.439> I<00:05:46.949> hate<00:05:47.249> to<00:05:47.279> say<00:05:47.580> it

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
good good practice and I hate to say it

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.290 
good good practice and I hate to say it
but<00:05:47.999> that<00:05:48.629> is<00:05:48.840> a<00:05:48.870> perfectly<00:05:49.439> clean<00:05:49.710> edge

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
but that is a perfectly clean edge

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.309 
but that is a perfectly clean edge
quality<00:05:51.300> blade<00:05:51.509> really<00:05:51.900> does<00:05:52.080> make<00:05:52.259> a

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 
quality blade really does make a

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:55.909 
quality blade really does make a
difference<00:05:52.439> so<00:05:54.199> we're<00:05:55.199> just<00:05:55.229> going<00:05:55.499> to<00:05:55.620> repeat

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
difference so we're just going to repeat

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:05.410 
difference so we're just going to repeat
that<00:05:56.189> twice<00:05:56.999> more

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.480
