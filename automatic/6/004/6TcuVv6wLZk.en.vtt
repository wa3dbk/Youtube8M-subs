currently kneeling next to my bookshelf
like<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> weirdo<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.359> tag<00:00:30.570> was<00:00:30.840> created<00:00:30.960> by

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
like a weirdo this tag was created by

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.400 
like a weirdo this tag was created by
book<00:00:31.980> reviewer<00:00:32.340> 21<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.690> believe<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
book reviewer 21 I believe is the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.080 
book reviewer 21 I believe is the
username<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.890> there's<00:00:35.309> only<00:00:35.460> five<00:00:35.670> questions

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
username and there's only five questions

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.330 
username and there's only five questions
so<00:00:36.480> let's<00:00:36.899> start<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.410> number<00:00:37.770> one<00:00:37.950> how<00:00:38.280> many

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
so let's start it number one how many

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.369 
so let's start it number one how many
unread<00:00:38.850> books<00:00:39.090> do<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.300> own<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.260> keep

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
unread books do you own I like to keep

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.170

my unread books separate from myredbook

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.869

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
so this is pretty easy to answer these

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.479 
so this is pretty easy to answer these
three<00:00:44.940> are<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.329> red<00:00:45.719> then<00:00:46.289> all<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.129> rest<00:00:47.280> of

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
three are in red then all the rest of

the shelf then all of this shelf then

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.790 
the shelf then all of this shelf then
there's<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.670> overflow<00:00:51.239> pile<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.989> generally

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
there's the overflow pile that generally

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.069 
there's the overflow pile that generally
is<00:00:53.129> where<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.579> am<00:00:53.730> sitting<00:00:54.030> right<00:00:54.360> now<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.809> then

is where I am sitting right now and then

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.420 
is where I am sitting right now and then
there's<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> stuff<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.800> pulled<00:00:56.100> for<00:00:56.309> this

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
there's the stuff that I pulled for this

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.790 
there's the stuff that I pulled for this

like<00:01:34.560> reading<00:01:34.740> them<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.340> accumulate<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:36.060> lot

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
like reading them so I accumulate a lot

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.090 
like reading them so I accumulate a lot
of<00:01:36.390> books<00:01:36.540> question<00:01:37.079> number<00:01:37.320> four<00:01:37.590> why<00:01:37.890> do<00:01:37.950> you

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
of books question number four why do you

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.710 
of books question number four why do you
think<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.460> haven't<00:01:38.670> read<00:01:39.000> your<00:01:39.210> unread<00:01:39.479> books

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
think you haven't read your unread books

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.870 
think you haven't read your unread books
yet<00:01:39.960> mostly<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.130> obtain<00:01:41.549> books

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
yet mostly it's just that I obtain books

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.359 
yet mostly it's just that I obtain books
at<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.329> higher<00:01:42.840> rate<00:01:43.140> than<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.799> read<00:01:43.979> them<00:01:44.189> i

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
at a higher rate than I can read them i

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.910 
at a higher rate than I can read them i
would<00:01:44.640> say<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.880> depends<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.780> book<00:01:46.350> like

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
would say it depends on the book like

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.520 
would say it depends on the book like
these<00:01:47.159> three<00:01:47.460> right<00:01:47.640> here<00:01:47.700> are<00:01:48.530> mansfield
