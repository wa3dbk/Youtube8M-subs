00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
it's another thing when you lie about it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.610 
it's another thing when you lie about it
say<00:00:51.090> they<00:00:51.329> had<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> team<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.840> people<00:00:52.020> working

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620

all night long looking for those
annotations<00:00:54.449> when<00:00:54.930> really<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.500> was<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.620> him

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
annotations when really it was just him

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.410 
annotations when really it was just him
running<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.250> script<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.789> background<00:00:57.210> and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
running a script in the background and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.420 
running a script in the background and
finding<00:00:58.050> all<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> stuff<00:00:58.440> he<00:00:58.590> needed<00:00:58.890> he<00:00:59.219> won

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
finding all the stuff he needed he won

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.010 
finding all the stuff he needed he won
within<00:00:59.730> two<00:00:59.910> minutes<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.300> me<00:01:00.420> putting<00:01:00.629> up<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
within two minutes of me putting up the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.979 
within two minutes of me putting up the
last<00:01:01.140> annotation<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.250> well<00:01:03.000> like<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.510> said<00:01:03.570> I

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
last annotation so well like I said I

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.350 
last annotation so well like I said I
didn't<00:01:04.290> say<00:01:04.409> no<00:01:04.589> cheating<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.909> guess<00:01:06.210> that

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
didn't say no cheating so I guess that

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.000 
didn't say no cheating so I guess that
means<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.750> okay<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.080> cheat<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.830> other

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
means it's okay to cheat and do other

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.920 
means it's okay to cheat and do other
people<00:01:08.280> wrong<00:01:08.490> all<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> people<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.240> did<00:01:09.450> put

in the time and effort to win the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.800 
in the time and effort to win the

those<00:05:04.389> are<00:05:04.540> the<00:05:04.600> numbers<00:05:04.960> just<00:05:05.229> a<00:05:05.770> couple

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
those are the numbers just a couple

while<00:05:06.280> short<00:05:06.669> no<00:05:07.210> big<00:05:07.419> deal<00:05:07.630> basically<00:05:08.050> it's

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259 
while short no big deal basically it's

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:10.320 
while short no big deal basically it's
still<00:05:08.470> a<00:05:08.500> 500<00:05:08.979> watt<00:05:09.100> amp<00:05:09.310> I<00:05:09.520> mean<00:05:09.940> if<00:05:10.090> it<00:05:10.210> was

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
still a 500 watt amp I mean if it was

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.360 
still a 500 watt amp I mean if it was
like<00:05:10.479> 50<00:05:10.870> or<00:05:11.110> hundred<00:05:11.410> Watts<00:05:11.560> short<00:05:11.889> it<00:05:12.250> would

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
like 50 or hundred Watts short it would

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.260 
like 50 or hundred Watts short it would
be<00:05:12.460> a<00:05:12.490> big<00:05:12.699> problem

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
be a big problem

be a big problem
couple<00:05:13.570> watts<00:05:13.949> basically<00:05:14.949> that's<00:05:15.220> the

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
couple watts basically that's the

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.650 
couple watts basically that's the
difference<00:05:15.550> between<00:05:15.610> the<00:05:15.910> way<00:05:16.000> I<00:05:16.030> test<00:05:16.389> it<00:05:16.570> and

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
difference between the way I test it and

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.180 
difference between the way I test it and
the<00:05:16.750> way<00:05:16.840> they<00:05:17.020> test<00:05:17.320> it<00:05:17.500> and<00:05:17.680> not<00:05:18.039> only<00:05:18.070> that

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
the way they test it and not only that

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.740 
the way they test it and not only that
but<00:05:18.430> I'm<00:05:18.550> on<00:05:18.699> batteries<00:05:19.150> that<00:05:19.300> can<00:05:19.449> be<00:05:19.509> pulled

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
but I'm on batteries that can be pulled

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.450 
but I'm on batteries that can be pulled
down<00:05:19.840> if<00:05:20.350> you're<00:05:20.590> sitting<00:05:20.770> on<00:05:20.949> an<00:05:21.039> alternator

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
down if you're sitting on an alternator

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.670 
down if you're sitting on an alternator
and<00:05:21.759> it's<00:05:22.090> constantly<00:05:22.539> charging<00:05:22.750> I<00:05:23.169> would<00:05:23.530> say

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
and it's constantly charging I would say

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.650 
and it's constantly charging I would say
it<00:05:23.830> probably<00:05:24.250> made<00:05:24.729> make<00:05:24.940> up<00:05:25.090> that<00:05:25.210> 400<00:05:25.509> watt

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
it probably made make up that 400 watt

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.210 
it probably made make up that 400 watt
it's<00:05:25.780> no<00:05:25.900> problem<00:05:26.169> or<00:05:26.350> a<00:05:26.410> couple<00:05:26.590> of<00:05:26.740> watts<00:05:26.919> I

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
it's no problem or a couple of watts I

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.439 
it's no problem or a couple of watts I
would<00:05:27.639> say<00:05:27.789> that<00:05:27.940> you're<00:05:28.090> getting<00:05:28.330> right

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
would say that you're getting right

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.770 
would say that you're getting right
around<00:05:28.750> exactly<00:05:29.080> 500<00:05:29.740> watts<00:05:29.889> if<00:05:30.520> you<00:05:31.479> buy<00:05:31.600> this

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
around exactly 500 watts if you buy this
