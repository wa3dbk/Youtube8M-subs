00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.630
 today in three the most expeditions 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.630
 catastrophic 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.330
 in the 1920s the explorer 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.820
 English Percy Fawcett undertook his most 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.430
 ambitious expedition the search for the 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.650
 zeta city a thousand-year-old population of 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.189
 immense wealth of whose existence the 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.230
 explorer was convinced in April of 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.599
 1925 persie went ahead in the jungle 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.000
 together with his son an assistant two 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.699
 you work the Brazilians two horses and 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.390
 eight mules and a couple of dogs in May 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.699
 of the same year 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.320
 the man wrote his wife a letter 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.570
 that became the last news 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.250
 that was never taken from the convoy 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.199
 reopened on fossett and his 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.449
 companions in the following years 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.280
 they left 13 expeditions in their search 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.979
 in which more than 100 died 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.909
 rescuers the explorers never 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:56.909
 They were found 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.300
 three dogs were trained for 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.970
 space expedition on board the sputnik 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.500
 2 an ambitious Soviet project that 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.960
 I was trying to bring life to orbit 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.720
 terrestrial the dogs were forced to 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.130
 spend days inside tiny cages 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.320
 placed in centrifuges that simulated 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.940
 the acceleration of a rocket bound to 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.920
 support machines that generate noise 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.080
 similar to that of a spacecraft already 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.509
 shown to consume their food in 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.410
 health laica was the dog chosen for 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.690
 be for November 3, 1957 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.550
 unfortunately lay died seven hours 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.649
 after having split and winning in the 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.960
 who was traveling disintegrated five months 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.880
 after although this bitch did not survive 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.830
 Her story inspired the debate on the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.690
 animal abuse and thanks to it 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.740
 they banned experiments of this kind 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.740
 A few years later 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.650
 on May 10, 1996, Mount Everest 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.800
 was covered by a storm there 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.050
 one not one but 17 expeditions the 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.060
 storm that decreased visibility 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.280
 of the climbers caused a 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.360
 reduction in oxygen level 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.160
 causing delusions confusion and 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.770
 hypothermia even among climbers 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.170
 most experienced eight people 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.820
 they died making this the most 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.190
 catastrophic in the history of 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.010
 mountaineering that was all for today in top 3 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.550
 discover more useless data in our
