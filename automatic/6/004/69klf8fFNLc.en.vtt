00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 but if you play together we have 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.000
 played together there is actually a 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.000
 internal that we do not want to interest 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.150
 but I love thank you very much but they are 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.439
 from different associations if not 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.539
 we are the province buenos aires 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.130
 if we accelerate ourselves 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.130
 federation with the pse of teco and 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.880
 Argentines we are all two federations 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.500
 and that is different from the others in the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.149
 province of buenos aires that most 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.649
 of the players of the Argentina is in 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.329
 I like the province of Buenos Aires 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.480
 the old ones this 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.850
 to these 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.960
 but I mean, it seems to me that these are a 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.780
 little better than what we put 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:55.320
 we in the program look for 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:57.180
 start I tell you something of this have 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.220
 a song on one side an edge that 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.980
 allows you to wash the text that is not 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.930
 move 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.930
 rounded slide 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.830
 by not having to play many times 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.700
 strategic are good 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.650
 our best to these are 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.790
 our best of the 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.790
 federation with the celestial 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.740
 but for me 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.680
 I keep you approximately is very close 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.810
 a game of yew for you that is very 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.960
 very close that any time but 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.830
 I'm going to deliver that you're going to fall 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.830
 how nice it is 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.440
 can not be delivered today because it's your 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.780
 dreams after I did not want that 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.520
 we take it but it is what we have 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.100
 we are from film is a reality 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.780
 same for there is not much reality in 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.910
 the sense that there is this child or if there 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.310
 an association things the championship of 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.990
 world the world's partners the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.880
 Argentina team and there is an association 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.770
 Argentine yew for the whole country 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.780
 Of course it's the national one and then there's 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.130
 different auto organizations some 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.830
 of course all governed by the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.730
 situation except one that does not want to be 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.730
 governed by the situation 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.040
 about that I do not want to discuss and guided by 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.040
 What's up 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.840
 that's not the sport or the activity is 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.840
 a later is considered a report 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.170
 the yew of course ok but for but 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.230
 for beachgoers for us as 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.360
 it's like an activity is a very 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.160
 pretty that also always joins good all 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:54.720
 what sport has that important 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.720
 sports the family 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.410
 this parents everything goes wrong yew for me 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:08.290
 the yew I'm in love and you I what 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:10.569
 I say because all the people the situation 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.209
 I do not like that because everyone 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.340
 says good that the federations know that 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.019
 they call this one here on the channel and everything 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.670
 out for these issues but we 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.510
 as what we wanted to do is to bring 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.250
 to the tissue 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.030
 let's say all the yew trees and the one that 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:32.170
 close wins just this is a pledge 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:33.970
 it is a game our sport offend of 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.129
 no way those that are stricter 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.340
 this is the same for example 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.599
 if someone films on a birthday that I 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.680
 tell those of us who make television 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:48.010
 are we the people are filming 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.370
 something mar and here is a little more 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.549
 professional and always be aware of 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.129
 what happens to us without reality 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.620
 this gift was a thank you to the 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.599
 dissemination of this program some of the 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.069
 tec or buttons and someone has 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.920
 sent because I brought it that came 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.170
 from across the country people from all over the country 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.090
 luck and so forth because there are 100,000 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.790
 players across the country while not 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.150
 be with in his game he's actually 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.030
 as identifying the activity 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.030
 in that sense the activity that integrates 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.920
 the older adult with young people with children 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.080
 how it was so good 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.570
 we are always looking for 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.790
 entertainment and that it's the best 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.890
 possible way 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.710
 and that it impacts in the best possible way 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.320
 sometimes we have not mistaken we have 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.000
 gone worse with some things we did better 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.100
 with other things but we are always in 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.750
 the search and many times projects 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.060
 just as it was flowing with them we were bad 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.460
 not with that we were fine with those but 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.430
 in doing daily is that sometimes doing 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.900
 you are and sometimes less anyway 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.090
 that we should not lose in what we have 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.250
 here and in that I thank everyone 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.470
 the whole team always because we elaborate 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.900
 a lot every day to always look 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.060
 new things and that's the production all 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.140
 time trying things and that came up not 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.140
 let's finish 3
