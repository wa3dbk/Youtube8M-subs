 very easy and very portable suitable 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.540
 even for those who work 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.610
 I was asked for a video of one 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.619

 a little daughter pointing a small brush 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.399

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.649
 stretching a base layer is later 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.680
 dry two layers of sliced ​​ceramics 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.140

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:07.170

 brake and cut off pieces of it 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.280
 about an inch and a half each 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.470
 I apply the first strip to a 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.070
 millimeter away from the beginning 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.070
 UGL 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.479
 I apply the second strip to one 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.759
 half a centimeter from the first 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.890
 this depends on when you want big 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.420
 I recommend the effect of nail art 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.420
 make it adhere well 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.910
 the third strip I say to a 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.800
 millimeter from the second 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.470
 I know you can't see perfectly well 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.670
 the effect but I didn't have a sticker that 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.670
 make contrast 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.270
 in the space created between the first and the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.700
 second strip I apply other 34 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.790
 ribbons according to the width of the 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.310
 I put your nail bed on it 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.800
 transversal even if this is yours 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.140
 pleasure because you can put them both 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.780
 perpendicular to July or not 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.210
 put them all one single attention 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.210
 do not pass the second strip 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.030
 apply a layer of seramik enamel 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.670
 effect number 82 between the first and the 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.010
 third strip covering everything right and 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.870
 leaving out the first mm of length 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.870
 which they will cover later 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.370
 in this way 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.760
 without drying lowes martino with 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.400
 tweezers start to lift and therefore 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.739
 remove the cross strips with 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.790
 of decided movements that can also 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.790
 don't be fast 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:20.459
 then I remove the second strip and finally 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.459
 the head 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.460
 now since there are no more 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.340
 I apply overlapping stickers and c 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.010
 82 also on the first strip e 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.760
 subsequently with the tweezers I remove 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.760
 the latter 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:05.249
 and this is the result counts and 66 and the 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.469
 Dr. little I create micro dots 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:09.830
 on his cartoons that I made in 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:09.830
 priority 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.740
 finally I apply two top coat layers 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.020
 my advice is always to 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.600
 seal all the nail well for one 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.180
 good durability of girls nail art not 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.919
 you frighten and don't worry that it is 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.680
 more difficult to explain than to 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.240
 make it anyway in the other long ones 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.290
 I made a simple french di 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.210
 contrast with the effect 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.130
 the lengthening of the bed and a reality 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.449
 if you want I put the link above here 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.449
 for those who have not seen the video 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.479
 this is the finished nail art 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.970
 I hope you enjoyed it and if you have 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:02.760
 some questions do not create problems 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.380
 comment two will live a big kiss 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.530
 to the next video 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.530
