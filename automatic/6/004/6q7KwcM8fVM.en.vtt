00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.920
 here with fim to professionals it's 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.330
 that she does not stick and she does not 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.070
 odor 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.410
 another thing 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.220
 but man is its strength and flexibility 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.640
 after cooking 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.040
 once baked bake acquires 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.020
 an elasticity while keeping its 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.329
 firmness that means you can 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.340
 the cut with a scissors so 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.710
 you want or you can 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.559
 shoot and get her in shape after 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.050
 cooking for example his loops are 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.210
 made from so that were 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.730
 cut into a cooked filo leaf 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:49.289
 selanne yesterday were then fired 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:51.360
 and loop shaping is the dough 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.000
 the state that is very pleasant to work 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.510
 once sculpted, it keeps its shape 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.039
 it is firm but very malleable 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.449
 work that I do is very very 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.629
 demanding at the level of the dough 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.369
 I find the trituration I stretch and I 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.520
 works mostly on very slices 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.759
 fine and I must say that fimo performs 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.310
 all finesse and especially without 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.310
 tear up this lace work and 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.350
 realized by stretching there too much to the dough for 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.790
 create cells that are strong 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.530
 close to each other 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.259
 it requires a high leg 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.040
 performance at the level of flexibility and 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.259
 solidity 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.400
 it's not easy to combine these two 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.439
 qualities that it is very difficult 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.670
 to get in a single product 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.830
 I have very specific ideas at 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.590
 colors I decided a long time ago 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.570
 to make my own mixes from 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.049
 a limited range of colors 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.479
 primary 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.820
 instead of using colors that we 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.890
 are provided commercially that me 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.180
 gives the chromatic control that I 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.380
 research 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.020
 the Turkish colossus of bonuses to 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.119
 professional or true color me 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.590
 gives exactly the range of primaries 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.920
 I need to make my mixes 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.960
 the cligman concentration is very high 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.990
 which gives me results that 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.330
 shine who vibrates who sings that 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.940
 the dough is mixed or they come out 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.830
 directly from the package this piece shows 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.150
 the slaps I get by mixing the 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.880
 choco their mouth 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.130
 imagine you have a utility of the cimo 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.980
 professional is the resistance of 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.799
 colors to the heat if we respect the 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.890
 instructions the white stays white and the 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.720
 translucent does not brown the mixture of 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.880
 polymer colors can be a real 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.830
 minefield what works in 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.220
 theory no longer works in the 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.170
 studio reality is this because the 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.810
 polymer does not behave like 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.540
 pigment the system do not mix sumo 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.130
 professionals avoid the near by 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.109
 trial and error that can be so much 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.690
 frustrating that can make you lose 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:52.640
 so much time this system you 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.829
 proposes harmony or 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.470
 color assemblies and she offers 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:00.560
 also very clear instructions for 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.260
 get there the new packaging the 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.750
 new image that have a lot of class 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.370
 that 's it's no frills like his 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.490
 name indicated it is a product 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.070
 professional 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.500
 for the professional artist I like 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.360
 big packages like I buy very little 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.730
 of color I buy them in big 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.610
 quantity packages of 350 grams 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.920
 it makes sense not at the artistic level 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.580
 professional fimo opened me to 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.380
 new ways 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.360
 she gave me new ways 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.890
 to approach the paw to conceive my 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.780
 job 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.300
 film to the professionals also allowed me 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.930
 to create a collection of pieces 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.930
 I am proud
