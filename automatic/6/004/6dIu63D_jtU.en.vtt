00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
in bezel and the blue for me softens the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.150 
in bezel and the blue for me softens the
contrast<00:00:53.670> whereas<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.899> black<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.559> looks<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
contrast whereas the black just looks a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.479 
contrast whereas the black just looks a
little<00:00:56.340> bit<00:00:56.579> too<00:00:57.000> busy<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.539> me<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:58.489> it

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.090 
wasn't after seeing is in person the
blue<00:01:02.250> appeal<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.730> more<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:04.100> ironically

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
blue appeal to be more and ironically

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.800

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.560 
up of the mountain and I came back and
ever<00:02:22.130> since<00:02:22.370> it's<00:02:22.700> been<00:02:22.850> running<00:02:23.120> three

ever since it's been running three
seconds<00:02:23.930> behind<00:02:24.080> consistently<00:02:24.860> what's

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
seconds behind consistently what's

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.030 
seconds behind consistently what's
interesting<00:02:25.550> with<00:02:25.820> this<00:02:25.940> watch<00:02:26.180> is<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:27.040> have

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
interesting with this watch is I have

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.500 
interesting with this watch is I have
not<00:02:28.220> had<00:02:28.400> any<00:02:28.580> variance<00:02:29.000> depending<00:02:29.150> on

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
whether it's on or off wrist every other

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.590 
whether it's on or off wrist every other
watch<00:02:32.960> I've<00:02:33.170> ever<00:02:33.320> owned<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:33.970> would<00:02:34.970> my<00:02:35.420> watch

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
watch I've ever owned I would my watch

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.090 
watch I've ever owned I would my watch

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.950 
around quite a bit slower when it was on
wrist<00:02:37.370> then<00:02:37.700> when<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.090> was<00:02:38.150> off<00:02:38.330> restoring<00:02:38.870> the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960

wrist then when it was off restoring the
winder<00:02:39.860> this<00:02:40.340> watch<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.910> doesn't<00:02:41.300> seem<00:02:41.480> to

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
winder this watch it doesn't seem to

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.530 
winder this watch it doesn't seem to
matter<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.920> that's<00:02:43.100> interesting

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
matter so that's interesting

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.500

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
faded blue look to it which I really

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.810 
faded blue look to it which I really
like<00:03:24.560> it's<00:03:24.800> that<00:03:25.130> kind<00:03:25.310> of<00:03:25.340> reminds<00:03:25.550> me<00:03:25.640> of<00:03:25.730> the

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
Tudor what I don't like about the bezel

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.240 
Tudor what I don't like about the bezel
is<00:03:28.430> that<00:03:29.390> there<00:03:29.600> are<00:03:29.690> some<00:03:29.830> smooth<00:03:30.830> pieces

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
is that there are some smooth pieces

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.960 
is that there are some smooth pieces
here<00:03:31.460> that<00:03:31.640> are<00:03:31.990> completely<00:03:32.990> aesthetic<00:03:33.500> and
