00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:12.499
 Hello friends the day after and teach how to do 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:14.339
 It is typical of rings 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.589
 using the minimum 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:19.619
 in the mine 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.619
 circular to which we are accustomed 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.279
 we are also with this other child 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.220
 the advantage it has is that it covers much less 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.780
 we are in different were extinguished 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.490
 China uses from 5 millimeters thick 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.950
 but find our childhood of 3 millimeters thick 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.180
 the amount the video that needs it most 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.520
 to make a ring in the form of rose like this 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.980
 It is 50 centimeters 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.330
 because it happens to have the child already started to be the ring 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.270
 for the realization of this year and I will also help them 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.370
 meneses inhabitants of punta de coa attention these alicante east tip 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.620
 flat 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.470
 we will also visit the measured ball 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.470
 of rings for 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.810
 support us when making the announcement 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.670
 The first thing we need to know is that as we already have it in it 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.910
 to place the aluminum in that number 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.180
 I for example need the measure 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.840
 fact numbers 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.100
 I'll take the aluminum more or less in half 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.120
 and do not put in that number 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.570
 the next thing we have to do this 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.330
 one turn with each end of the aluminum around 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
 of the measure that we need 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.220
 and now here 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.480
 We will start to make larrosa ring 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.980
 this already depends 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.410
 tasted the grace of each 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.410
 but as knowledge is very simple 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.029
 place the two ends well together 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.169
 and we perform as gillo 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.749
 now just 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:31.629
 we will have to keep turning the ends of the aluminum 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:35.519
 until you are in the ring with the shape you want more 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:48.919
 he told us before he spends less some child 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.919
 and that is an advantage 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.539
 we can also combine different colors 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:01.059
 we do not take out anymore 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:03.669
 percent to the stick child 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.669
 let's say the work forms 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:12.029
 what is a bit more difficult when it comes to hiding the extremes 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.569
 as it is an aluminum plus furnace 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.219
 I for example I'm going to leave like this 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:20.549
 said hazare 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.549
 the systems to hide them 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:32.369
 acz 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:50.509
 these moments 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.509
 this would be the result 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.599
 it has cost me almost no time 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.599
 Ikea a ring that sure draws attention 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.079
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.059
 that you encourage to do it 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:12.059
