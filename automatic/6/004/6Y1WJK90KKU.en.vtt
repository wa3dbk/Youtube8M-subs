00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.140
 welcome to ray reach to the point 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.809
 as I will introduce you the jacket 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.020
 millet torun it's a jacket three in 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.539
 a 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.629
 that is, it is associated with a 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:18.090
 liner that is removable 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:21.480
 so we can use the leash with 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.519
 this more by pushing his lining so 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.080
 simply the drop of raincoat and 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.150
 we can also use the lining 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.580
 only that means it's a letter to 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.679
 able to use both in winter and 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.570
 then also in the spring and 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.740
 autumn 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.590
 the other interest is that this decline 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.900
 is at a finish that allows you to use 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.610
 both in town and in the mountains 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.110
 we are really on something 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.930
 very versatile so it's a drop 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.060
 who will use a driedger membrane 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.740
 rock that is immoral especially 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.660
 developed by thousands this membrane 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.610
 it is totally waterproof but 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.540
 also breathable and on our 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.990
 interest it is that she has a 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:01.440
 excellent resistance to movement 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.030
 therefore will not be altered by violence 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.810
 good resistance movements 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.710
 also abrasion at the level of 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.540
 protection we also have havas often 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.650
 Velcro on the loose in zip 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.470
 size level no who we 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.040
 allow to adjust the size avoid 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:28.530
 the cold air inlets justly 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:31.080
 also at the wrist the body 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.630
 in relatively good for a good 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.420
 protection with here we have a under cover 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.009
 protection that will avoid 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.290
 the slide are in contact with the 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:43.280
 skin at the level of the calculus so we have 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.930
 a log life also they 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.049
 had a mode of protection with a 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.270
 visor preformed to protect well 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.060
 open your eyes and then a double 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.520
 setting at that level but also a 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.130
 depth adjustment at the back that goes 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.700
 allow to adjust the hood to the 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.700
 size of the debt 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.399
 and then we also have a pocket 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.130
 Side with the child hill 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.489
 hood is totally removable with a 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.860
 system of zips and then also of 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.890
 snaps 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.489
 the man wanted to see the jacket without his 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.280
 lining 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.640
 so we have an education system of 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.209
 the humidity at the back with a 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.690
 ruffier bubble regarding the 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.489
 lining 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.290
 so it's a bonus lining 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.690
 then you madoff price it's a 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.880
 synthetic material that mimic 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.950
 facts him and must that is to say a 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.859
 excellent swelling and excellent 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.840
 compressibility but also with a 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:47.690
 hydrophobic effect so this pain has 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.810
 retained its thermal power even in 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.220
 humid conditions and can also 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.990
 not forgetting who is a relative 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.510
 so we will be able to use it without 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.070
 the rain jacket then on the lining 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.500
 as on the beast you will find 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.500
 also pockets problem
