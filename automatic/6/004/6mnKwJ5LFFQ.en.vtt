Stewart's home page I think I search for
Halloween<00:00:16.670> coffin<00:00:18.230> templates<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:20.220> came<00:00:20.580> up

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
Halloween coffin templates and I came up

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.750 
Halloween coffin templates and I came up
with<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:21.119> one<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.890> I<00:00:22.890> printed<00:00:23.310> out<00:00:23.490> these

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
with this one and I printed out these

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.490 
with this one and I printed out these
both<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:25.039> just<00:00:26.039> paste<00:00:26.310> them<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:27.180> some<00:00:28.170> thicker

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
both and just paste them on some thicker

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.189 
both and just paste them on some thicker
paper<00:00:28.830> just<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.970> order<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.330> make<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
paper just in order to make the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.860 
paper just in order to make the
measurement<00:00:31.560> monster<00:00:31.980> do<00:00:32.250> when<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.719> cut<00:00:33.719> them

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
measurement monster do when I cut them

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.110 
measurement monster do when I cut them
out<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.050> I've<00:00:34.380> been<00:00:34.559> cutting<00:00:35.219> out<00:00:35.489> quite<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> few

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
out so I've been cutting out quite a few

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.770 
out so I've been cutting out quite a few
of<00:00:36.390> these<00:00:36.540> templates<00:00:37.280> this<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.520> another<00:00:39.390> one

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
of these templates this is another one

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.310 
of these templates this is another one
that<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.260> actually<00:00:40.620> found<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> net<00:00:41.730> as<00:00:41.879> well

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
that I actually found in the net as well

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.889 
that I actually found in the net as well
and<00:00:44.390> I<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:46.050> drew<00:00:46.320> from<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.840> put<00:00:48.840> these

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
and I just drew from it and put these

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.100 
and I just drew from it and put these
closing<00:00:51.899> mechanisms<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.899> when<00:00:54.899> you

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
closing mechanisms here and when you

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.619 
closing mechanisms here and when you
fold<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:56.039> up<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.699> going<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.480> like

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
fold this up it's going to be just like

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.240 
fold this up it's going to be just like
this<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.710> be<00:00:58.829> sort<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.160> a

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
this and it's going to be sort of a

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.090 
this and it's going to be sort of a
treat<00:00:59.579> box<00:00:59.910> or<00:01:00.090> something<00:01:00.410> quite<00:01:01.410> huge<00:01:01.829> I

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
treat box or something quite huge I

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.299 
treat box or something quite huge I
suppose<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:03.229> wanted<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.619> go<00:01:04.799> for<00:01:05.070> something

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
suppose I wanted to go for something

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.640 
suppose I wanted to go for something
bigger<00:01:05.760> than<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.780> one<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.430> I<00:01:08.430> decided<00:01:09.000> on

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
bigger than this one so I decided on

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:18.230 
bigger than this one so I decided on
enlarging<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:11.130> one<00:01:11.390> so<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:16.580> did<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.850> this

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
enlarging this one so I did it like this

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.609 
enlarging this one so I did it like this
I<00:01:19.250> put<00:01:20.250> two<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.820> half<00:01:21.000> centimeters<00:01:21.930> all

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
I put two and a half centimeters all

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.429 
I put two and a half centimeters all
over<00:01:23.900> the<00:01:24.900> top

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
over the top

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.090 
over the top
besides<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.659> five<00:01:27.659> centimeters<00:01:28.229> down<00:01:28.799> here

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
besides and five centimeters down here

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.710 
besides and five centimeters down here
just<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.640> order<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.000> make<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> little<00:01:30.509> bit

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
just in order to make it a little bit

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.830 
just in order to make it a little bit
longer<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:32.570> having<00:01:33.570> run<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.979> decided<00:01:35.610> on

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
longer and having run so I decided on

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.950 
longer and having run so I decided on
making<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.409> side<00:01:37.650> panels<00:01:38.220> five<00:01:39.060> centimeters

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
making this side panels five centimeters

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.530 
making this side panels five centimeters
high<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.189> started<00:01:41.700> cutting<00:01:41.909> strips<00:01:42.329> from

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
high so I started cutting strips from

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.580 
high so I started cutting strips from
paper<00:01:42.899> with<00:01:43.110> right<00:01:43.740> yeah<00:01:44.040> strips<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.759> paper

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
paper with right yeah strips of paper

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.139 
paper with right yeah strips of paper
measuring<00:01:46.590> five<00:01:46.860> centimeters<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.880> then<00:01:48.000> I

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
measuring five centimeters and then I

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.190 
measuring five centimeters and then I
just<00:01:48.390> measured<00:01:48.810> them<00:01:49.439> up<00:01:49.590> as<00:01:50.250> how<00:01:51.000> long<00:01:51.390> they

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
just measured them up as how long they

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.020 
just measured them up as how long they
were<00:01:52.409> supposed<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.979> be<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.430> order<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.790> actually

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
were supposed to be in order to actually

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.690 
were supposed to be in order to actually
fit<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.540> coffin<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.560> then<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.430> taped

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
fit this coffin and then I just taped

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.359 
fit this coffin and then I just taped
them<00:01:56.939> down<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:58.259> order<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.189> know

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
them down like this in order to know

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.719 
them down like this in order to know
where<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> was<00:02:00.450> supposed<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.960> do<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.860> another

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
where I was supposed to do the another

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.780 
where I was supposed to do the another
template<00:02:03.270> for<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:04.100> when<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.130> did<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
template for it and when I did the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.499 
template for it and when I did the
cutting

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
cutting

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.440 
cutting
I<00:02:06.540> actually

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.270 

put<00:02:10.450> some<00:02:10.750> flaps<00:02:11.140> here<00:02:11.470> as<00:02:11.590> well<00:02:11.800> so<00:02:12.160> I'm

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
put some flaps here as well so I'm

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.940 
put some flaps here as well so I'm
actually<00:02:12.520> able<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.300> lower<00:02:14.140> this<00:02:14.350> thing<00:02:14.440> down

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
actually able to lower this thing down

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.880 
actually able to lower this thing down
later<00:02:15.730> on<00:02:16.060> otherwise<00:02:16.840> it's<00:02:17.170> going<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.470> be<00:02:17.680> a

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
later on otherwise it's going to be a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
later on otherwise it's going to be a
little<00:02:18.160> bit<00:02:19.260> unsteady<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.440> think<00:02:20.740> so<00:02:21.520> that's<00:02:21.820> an

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
little bit unsteady I think so that's an

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.090 
little bit unsteady I think so that's an
important<00:02:22.390> thing<00:02:22.600> for<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.170> think<00:02:23.230> about

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
important thing for you to think about

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.180 
important thing for you to think about
just<00:02:24.730> remember<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.300> do<00:02:25.450> one<00:02:26.020> flap<00:02:26.350> on<00:02:26.530> each<00:02:26.860> of

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
just remember to do one flap on each of

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.980 
just remember to do one flap on each of
these<00:02:27.520> so<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.030> just<00:02:28.300> think<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.570> made<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.720> clock

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
these so I just think it made a clock

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.500 
these so I just think it made a clock
there<00:02:29.290> made<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:29.950> flap<00:02:30.310> there<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.820> so<00:02:31.000> forth

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
there made a flap there and so forth

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.720 
there made a flap there and so forth
and<00:02:31.690> then<00:02:31.990> I<00:02:32.110> drew<00:02:32.350> it<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.860> cut<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:33.160> out<00:02:33.340> and

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
and then I drew it and cut it out and

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.340 
and then I drew it and cut it out and
just<00:02:34.410> ended<00:02:35.410> up<00:02:35.530> with<00:02:35.680> this<00:02:35.830> template<00:02:36.700> here

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
just ended up with this template here

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.480 
just ended up with this template here
and<00:02:38.970> I'm<00:02:39.970> trying<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.810> go<00:02:41.020> for<00:02:41.350> this<00:02:41.590> wooden

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
and I'm trying to go for this wooden

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.730 
and I'm trying to go for this wooden
casket<00:02:43.120> look<00:02:43.420> so<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:44.200> just<00:02:45.070> used<00:02:45.610> some<00:02:46.060> regular

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
casket look so I just used some regular

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.870 
casket look so I just used some regular
carton<00:02:47.760> from<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.880> box<00:02:50.340> started<00:02:51.340> cutting<00:02:51.580> the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
carton from a box started cutting the

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.870 
carton from a box started cutting the
pieces<00:02:52.060> out<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.780> then<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:53.650> run<00:02:53.980> through<00:02:54.400> the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
pieces out and then I run through the

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.990 
pieces out and then I run through the
cuttlebug<00:02:55.270> with<00:02:55.600> one<00:02:55.810> of<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.020> Tim<00:02:56.200> Holtz's

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
cuttlebug with one of the Tim Holtz's

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.100 
cuttlebug with one of the Tim Holtz's
texture<00:02:58.000> fades<00:02:58.270> embossing<00:02:59.260> folders<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:01.110> then

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
texture fades embossing folders and then

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.890 
texture fades embossing folders and then
I<00:03:02.140> inked<00:03:02.680> them<00:03:02.800> up<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.160> bit<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.520> started<00:03:04.120> off<00:03:04.570> just

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
I inked them up a bit I started off just

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.730 
I inked them up a bit I started off just
dragging<00:03:05.860> this<00:03:06.070> frayed<00:03:06.760> burlap<00:03:07.000> on<00:03:07.630> top<00:03:08.560> of

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
dragging this frayed burlap on top of

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.240 
dragging this frayed burlap on top of
this<00:03:09.210> texture<00:03:10.210> here<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:10.720> then<00:03:11.440> I<00:03:11.560> continued

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
this texture here and then I continued

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.390 
this texture here and then I continued
inking<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:13.330> edges<00:03:13.780> with<00:03:14.050> warm<00:03:14.400> vintage

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
inking the edges with warm vintage

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.570 
inking the edges with warm vintage
photos<00:03:16.120> I<00:03:16.480> finished<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.650> off<00:03:17.800> with<00:03:17.830> walnut

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
photos I finished it off with walnut

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.060 
photos I finished it off with walnut
stain<00:03:18.910> and<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:19.750> also<00:03:19.959> track<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.590> one<00:03:20.920> that

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
stain and I also track the one that

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.520 
stain and I also track the one that
stain<00:03:21.400> pad<00:03:21.760> just<00:03:22.090> there<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.600> it<00:03:22.690> over<00:03:23.140> here<00:03:23.380> and

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
stain pad just there to it over here and

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.040 
stain pad just there to it over here and
there<00:03:23.680> so<00:03:23.890> it<00:03:23.980> would<00:03:24.100> create<00:03:24.760> a<00:03:24.820> depth<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.480> this

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
there so it would create a depth to this

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.030 
there so it would create a depth to this
wooden<00:03:26.709> look<00:03:26.920> I<00:03:27.660> have<00:03:28.660> cut<00:03:28.930> out<00:03:28.959> two<00:03:29.470> pieces<00:03:29.800> of

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
wooden look I have cut out two pieces of

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.000 
wooden look I have cut out two pieces of
carton<00:03:30.670> one<00:03:30.850> for<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.209> bottom<00:03:31.420> and<00:03:32.050> one<00:03:32.650> for

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
carton one for the bottom and one for

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.540 
carton one for the bottom and one for
the<00:03:33.370> top<00:03:33.910> and<00:03:34.540> that<00:03:35.170> is<00:03:35.290> also<00:03:35.530> one<00:03:36.160> thing<00:03:36.430> you

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
the top and that is also one thing you

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.970 
the top and that is also one thing you
should<00:03:36.730> actually<00:03:37.330> think<00:03:37.780> about<00:03:37.900> putting<00:03:38.680> a

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
should actually think about putting a

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.770 
should actually think about putting a
flip<00:03:40.080> flap<00:03:41.080> on<00:03:41.410> these<00:03:41.650> properties<00:03:42.519> as<00:03:42.670> well<00:03:42.910> so

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
flip flap on these properties as well so

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.920 
flip flap on these properties as well so
it<00:03:43.959> actually<00:03:44.470> stays<00:03:45.190> there<00:03:45.580> when<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.330> open<00:03:46.780> it

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
it actually stays there when you open it

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.830 
it actually stays there when you open it
up<00:03:47.110> so<00:03:48.100> I<00:03:48.130> haven't<00:03:48.370> really<00:03:48.790> figured<00:03:49.150> out<00:03:49.480> how

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
up so I haven't really figured out how

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.500 
up so I haven't really figured out how
I'm<00:03:50.620> going<00:03:50.860> to<00:03:51.040> what<00:03:51.670> I'm<00:03:51.790> going<00:03:52.000> to<00:03:52.030> do<00:03:52.209> here

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
I'm going to what I'm going to do here

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.009 
I'm going to what I'm going to do here
for<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.750> closing<00:03:53.320> mechanism<00:03:53.550> but<00:03:54.550> I'm<00:03:54.730> just

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
for the closing mechanism but I'm just

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.670 
for the closing mechanism but I'm just
starting<00:03:56.019> to<00:03:56.290> let<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:56.920> thing<00:03:57.130> prove<00:03:58.500> what<00:03:59.500> I'm

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
starting to let the thing prove what I'm

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.620 
starting to let the thing prove what I'm
thinking<00:04:00.280> about<00:04:00.430> actually<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:01.090> finish<00:04:01.390> this

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
thinking about actually to finish this

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.979 
thinking about actually to finish this
off<00:04:01.930> is<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:02.260> put<00:04:02.530> those<00:04:02.739> lovely<00:04:03.510> Tim<00:04:04.510> Holtz's

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
off is to put those lovely Tim Holtz's

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.610 
off is to put those lovely Tim Holtz's
feet<00:04:05.320> here<00:04:05.890> at<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.100> corners<00:04:06.640> if<00:04:07.269> I<00:04:07.690> can<00:04:08.380> make

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
feet here at the corners if I can make

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.360 
feet here at the corners if I can make
it<00:04:08.860> happen<00:04:09.040> that<00:04:09.970> is<00:04:10.180> I'm<00:04:10.450> not<00:04:10.480> really<00:04:10.870> sure

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
it happen that is I'm not really sure

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.920 
it happen that is I'm not really sure
otherwise<00:04:12.370> I<00:04:12.430> think<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:13.090> just<00:04:13.120> have<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.690> satisfy

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
otherwise I think I just have to satisfy

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.000 
otherwise I think I just have to satisfy
with<00:04:14.440> those

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
with those

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.159 
with those
I<00:04:15.040> think<00:04:15.670> it's<00:04:15.820> hitch<00:04:16.000> fast<00:04:16.359> those<00:04:16.900> are<00:04:17.049> the

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
I think it's hitch fast those are the

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.860 
I think it's hitch fast those are the
knobs<00:04:17.440> as<00:04:17.950> you<00:04:18.039> can<00:04:18.190> actually<00:04:18.520> put<00:04:18.729> on<00:04:18.910> at<00:04:19.690> the

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
knobs as you can actually put on at the

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.060 
knobs as you can actually put on at the
bottom<00:04:20.169> so<00:04:20.380> it<00:04:20.470> will<00:04:20.500> it'll<00:04:20.979> stand<00:04:21.250> up

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
bottom so it will it'll stand up

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.020 
bottom so it will it'll stand up
little<00:04:23.060> bit<00:04:23.270> more<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.420> bit<00:04:23.600> pretty<00:04:23.870> and<00:04:25.030> I'm

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
little bit more a bit pretty and I'm

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.800 
little bit more a bit pretty and I'm
going<00:04:26.420> to<00:04:26.600> end<00:04:26.870> up<00:04:27.170> with<00:04:27.920> this<00:04:28.160> at<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.240> lid<00:04:29.450> and

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
going to end up with this at the lid and

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.280 
going to end up with this at the lid and
I<00:04:30.350> have<00:04:30.530> been<00:04:30.740> putting<00:04:30.980> these<00:04:31.540> metal<00:04:32.540> brats<00:04:32.900> in

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
I have been putting these metal brats in

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.890 
I have been putting these metal brats in
different<00:04:33.830> colors<00:04:34.250> on<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.760> top<00:04:34.970> just<00:04:35.300> a

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
different colors on the top just a

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.710 
different colors on the top just a
resemble<00:04:36.470> of<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:36.800> nails<00:04:37.040> and<00:04:37.490> then<00:04:38.300> I'm<00:04:38.420> going

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
resemble of the nails and then I'm going

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.460 
resemble of the nails and then I'm going
to<00:04:39.580> decorate<00:04:40.580> it<00:04:40.850> with<00:04:40.880> some<00:04:41.270> beautiful

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.350 

thinking<00:04:45.470> of<00:04:45.620> using<00:04:46.040> these<00:04:46.490> I<00:04:46.880> mean<00:04:47.000> these<00:04:47.150> are

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
thinking of using these I mean these are

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:56.470 
thinking of using these I mean these are
lovely<00:04:47.630> orange<00:04:48.050> flowers<00:04:54.910> I'm<00:04:55.910> not<00:04:56.090> sure<00:04:56.240> if<00:04:56.360> I

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
lovely orange flowers I'm not sure if I

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.720 
lovely orange flowers I'm not sure if I
can<00:04:56.540> find<00:04:56.930> them<00:04:57.110> but<00:04:57.290> I<00:04:57.530> suppose<00:04:58.310> I'll<00:04:58.550> have<00:04:58.580> to

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
can find them but I suppose I'll have to

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.180 
can find them but I suppose I'll have to
make<00:04:59.000> another<00:04:59.330> video<00:04:59.570> showing<00:05:00.200> those<00:05:00.590> flowers

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
make another video showing those flowers

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.870 
make another video showing those flowers
off<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:02.560> hopefully<00:05:03.560> I'll<00:05:03.830> be<00:05:03.890> able<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.430> find<00:05:04.760> a

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
off and hopefully I'll be able to find a

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.420 
off and hopefully I'll be able to find a
skeleton<00:05:05.240> or<00:05:05.810> something<00:05:06.440> to<00:05:06.590> put<00:05:06.740> in<00:05:06.920> here

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
skeleton or something to put in here

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.720 
skeleton or something to put in here
perhaps<00:05:08.210> I'll<00:05:08.480> even<00:05:08.780> put<00:05:09.110> a<00:05:09.380> complete<00:05:10.220> through

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
perhaps I'll even put a complete through

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.450 
perhaps I'll even put a complete through
of<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:11.570> region<00:05:11.870> farm<00:05:12.140> stem<00:05:12.530> so<00:05:12.830> whatever<00:05:13.250> in

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
of the region farm stem so whatever in

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.580 
of the region farm stem so whatever in
here<00:05:13.730> because<00:05:14.360> this<00:05:14.810> is<00:05:14.930> going<00:05:15.170> to<00:05:15.290> be<00:05:15.380> quite

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
here because this is going to be quite

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.650 
here because this is going to be quite
big<00:05:15.830> a<00:05:15.860> coffin<00:05:16.280> and<00:05:16.430> that's<00:05:16.670> the<00:05:17.180> way<00:05:17.330> I<00:05:17.360> like

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
big a coffin and that's the way I like

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.320 
big a coffin and that's the way I like
it<00:05:17.690> I<00:05:17.900> want<00:05:18.470> to<00:05:18.650> make<00:05:18.800> a<00:05:18.830> statement<00:05:19.190> I<00:05:19.730> want

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
it I want to make a statement I want

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.730 
it I want to make a statement I want
things<00:05:20.600> to<00:05:20.750> be<00:05:20.780> just<00:05:21.140> a<00:05:21.200> little<00:05:21.260> bit<00:05:21.530> more

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
things to be just a little bit more

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.220 
things to be just a little bit more
bigger<00:05:22.490> so<00:05:23.120> we<00:05:23.180> actually<00:05:23.330> have<00:05:23.570> something<00:05:24.080> to

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
bigger so we actually have something to

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.220 
bigger so we actually have something to
hold<00:05:24.380> on<00:05:24.620> it's<00:05:25.310> pretty<00:05:25.580> fun<00:05:25.940> to<00:05:25.970> play<00:05:26.960> around

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
hold on it's pretty fun to play around

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.320 
hold on it's pretty fun to play around
with<00:05:27.380> this<00:05:27.590> wouldn't<00:05:28.160> look<00:05:28.340> here<00:05:28.670> so<00:05:29.270> I'm

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
with this wouldn't look here so I'm

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.970 
with this wouldn't look here so I'm
thinking<00:05:29.720> it's<00:05:30.110> going<00:05:30.260> to<00:05:30.350> be<00:05:30.470> pretty<00:05:30.650> sturdy

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
thinking it's going to be pretty sturdy

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.230 
thinking it's going to be pretty sturdy
