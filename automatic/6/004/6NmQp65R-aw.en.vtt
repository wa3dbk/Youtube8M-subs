you<00:00:17.630> a<00:00:17.690> little<00:00:17.810> bit<00:00:17.960> about<00:00:18.230> the<00:00:18.380> center

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
you a little bit about the center

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.769 
you a little bit about the center

pinning outfit the center pin outfit

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.019 
pinning outfit the center pin outfit
consists<00:00:21.290> mainly<00:00:21.470> of<00:00:21.710> three<00:00:22.190> primary<00:00:22.490> things

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
consists mainly of three primary things

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.600 
consists mainly of three primary things
that<00:00:23.360> being<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:23.810> center<00:00:24.080> pin<00:00:24.230> rob<00:00:24.470> the<00:00:25.279> float

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
that being the center pin rob the float

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.330 
that being the center pin rob the float
reel<00:00:25.849> or<00:00:26.060> center<00:00:26.360> pin<00:00:26.570> reel<00:00:26.810> and<00:00:27.050> last<00:00:27.680> the<00:00:28.099> use

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
reel or center pin reel and last the use

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.780 
reel or center pin reel and last the use
of<00:00:28.550> a<00:00:28.640> float<00:00:28.910> let<00:00:29.750> me<00:00:29.840> start<00:00:30.080> with<00:00:30.110> them<00:00:30.320> real

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
of a float let me start with them real

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.250 
of a float let me start with them real
it's<00:00:31.790> called<00:00:32.060> a<00:00:32.150> center<00:00:32.419> pin<00:00:32.570> reel<00:00:32.780> because<00:00:32.960> it

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
it's called a center pin reel because it

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.350 
it's called a center pin reel because it
revolves<00:00:33.860> on<00:00:33.950> a<00:00:33.980> center<00:00:34.310> pin<00:00:34.579> and<00:00:34.790> while

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
revolves on a center pin and while

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.960 
revolves on a center pin and while
fishing<00:00:35.660> it<00:00:35.930> it<00:00:36.110> offers<00:00:36.500> no<00:00:36.739> drag<00:00:37.130> and<00:00:37.430> spin

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
fishing it it offers no drag and spin

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.940 
fishing it it offers no drag and spin
smoothly<00:00:38.420> which<00:00:38.960> allows<00:00:39.260> your<00:00:39.470> float<00:00:39.739> and

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
smoothly which allows your float and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
smoothly which allows your float and
your<00:00:40.489> offering<00:00:40.910> to<00:00:41.120> glide<00:00:41.899> effortlessly

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
your offering to glide effortlessly

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.690 
your offering to glide effortlessly
downstream<00:00:44.829> as<00:00:45.829> you<00:00:46.070> can<00:00:46.190> see<00:00:46.370> here<00:00:46.550> the

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
downstream as you can see here the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.580 
downstream as you can see here the
center<00:00:47.570> pin<00:00:47.719> reel<00:00:47.929> is<00:00:48.109> spooled<00:00:48.410> with

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
center pin reel is spooled with

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.299 
center pin reel is spooled with
monofilament<00:00:49.039> and<00:00:49.899> also<00:00:50.899> has<00:00:51.649> a<00:00:51.679> clicker<00:00:52.070> and

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
monofilament and also has a clicker and

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.490 
monofilament and also has a clicker and
the<00:00:52.910> clicker<00:00:53.120> is<00:00:53.300> basically<00:00:53.660> only<00:00:53.929> used<00:00:54.289> to

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
the clicker is basically only used to

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.410 
the clicker is basically only used to
keep<00:00:54.679> the<00:00:54.829> reel<00:00:54.980> from<00:00:55.100> over<00:00:55.489> running<00:00:55.699> while

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
keep the reel from over running while

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.869 
keep the reel from over running while
you're<00:00:56.570> not<00:00:56.750> using<00:00:57.019> it<00:00:57.370> when<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.460> clicker<00:00:58.699> is

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
you're not using it when the clicker is

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.189 
you're not using it when the clicker is
disengaged<00:00:59.449> the<00:01:00.339> real<00:01:01.339> smoothly<00:01:01.760> turns<00:01:02.300> once

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
disengaged the real smoothly turns once

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.020 
disengaged the real smoothly turns once
again<00:01:03.499> allowing<00:01:03.800> your<00:01:04.040> offering<00:01:04.550> to<00:01:04.790> float

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
again allowing your offering to float

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.450 
again allowing your offering to float
down<00:01:05.210> straight<00:01:05.600> with<00:01:05.810> zero<00:01:06.110> effort<00:01:06.380> as<00:01:06.710> far<00:01:07.310> as

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
down straight with zero effort as far as

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.640 
down straight with zero effort as far as
you<00:01:07.580> can<00:01:07.730> see<00:01:07.880> your<00:01:08.030> float<00:01:08.300> the<00:01:09.020> next<00:01:09.290> item<00:01:09.560> is

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
you can see your float the next item is

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.550 
you can see your float the next item is
the<00:01:09.680> rock<00:01:10.090> set<00:01:11.090> up<00:01:11.210> in<00:01:11.330> rods<00:01:11.570> basically

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
the rock set up in rods basically

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.180 
the rock set up in rods basically
average<00:01:13.010> from<00:01:13.280> 9<00:01:13.580> feet<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:14.120> 15<00:01:14.600> feet<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.620> long

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
average from 9 feet to 15 feet the long

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.070 
average from 9 feet to 15 feet the long
rod<00:01:16.460> there's<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.760> couple<00:01:16.970> things<00:01:17.300> for<00:01:17.510> you<00:01:17.690> the

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
rod there's a couple things for you the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.359 
rod there's a couple things for you the
first<00:01:18.350> thing<00:01:18.530> it<00:01:18.650> does<00:01:18.680> is<00:01:18.830> it<00:01:19.009> keeps<00:01:19.130> your

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
first thing it does is it keeps your

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.249 
first thing it does is it keeps your
line<00:01:19.549> off<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.090> water<00:01:20.360> all<00:01:20.689> the<00:01:20.750> way<00:01:20.930> from<00:01:21.110> the

line off the water all the way from the

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.260 
line off the water all the way from the
from<00:01:21.710> your<00:01:21.829> rod<00:01:22.040> tip<00:01:22.070> all<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:22.820> way<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.149> the

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
from your rod tip all the way to the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.319 
from your rod tip all the way to the
float<00:01:23.540> which<00:01:24.189> minimizes<00:01:25.189> drag<00:01:25.369> your<00:01:26.000> line<00:01:26.180> is

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
float which minimizes drag your line is

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.149 
float which minimizes drag your line is
not<00:01:26.479> in<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.689> water<00:01:26.869> it's<00:01:27.170> not<00:01:27.229> dragging<00:01:27.590> and

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
not in the water it's not dragging and

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:28.740 
not in the water it's not dragging and
then

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
then

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.200
