00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.220 

I<00:00:12.980> think<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.099> because<00:00:14.910> when<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:16.109> know

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
I think it is because when you know

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.150

tournaments a year and we're all just
playing<00:00:23.369> for<00:00:23.519> ourselves<00:00:23.640> but<00:00:24.570> when<00:00:24.750> we're

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
playing for ourselves but when we're

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.089 
playing for ourselves but when we're
playing<00:00:24.930> Davis<00:00:25.350> Cup<00:00:25.500> obviously<00:00:25.800> we're<00:00:25.920> paying

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
playing Davis Cup obviously we're paying

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.439 
playing Davis Cup obviously we're paying
for<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.310> team<00:00:26.519> we're<00:00:26.789> playing<00:00:26.820> for<00:00:27.119> our<00:00:27.240> country

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
for a team we're playing for our country

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.990 
for a team we're playing for our country
which<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.960> great<00:00:28.199> honor<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:29.000> really

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
which is a great honor and really

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.849 
which is a great honor and really
there's<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.810> little<00:00:31.109> bit<00:00:31.199> more<00:00:31.320> pressure<00:00:31.529> that

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
there's a little bit more pressure that

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.380 
there's a little bit more pressure that
way<00:00:32.009> because<00:00:32.219> it's<00:00:32.550> not<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:33.270> yourself

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
way because it's not just for yourself

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.479 
way because it's not just for yourself
but<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:33.930> for<00:00:34.079> other<00:00:34.200> people<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.430> that

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
but it's for other people and in that

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.270 
but it's for other people and in that
regard<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.450> would<00:00:36.899> say<00:00:37.110> there's<00:00:37.770> more<00:00:37.980> sort

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
regard you would say there's more sort

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.900 
regard you would say there's more sort

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
6-4 when the fifth played a really good

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.930 
6-4 when the fifth played a really good
match<00:01:31.050> and<00:01:31.260> then<00:01:31.410> that<00:01:32.100> put<00:01:32.250> us<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.550> one<00:01:32.700> down
