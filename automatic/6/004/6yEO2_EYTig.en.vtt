 I 'll tell you how to ride the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.080
 Flemish I think that's what this is is 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.539

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.129

 uac that this first piece here, what 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.370
 it looks like a little flag something 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:58.199
 so a piece can be here in this 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:02.940
 here or here, then the other piece is 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.519
 this will show you the second piece is this 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.280
 here you can see that he had an accordion 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:13.229
 something like that is this part 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.979

 Show as soon as I have built it. 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.619

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.280
 It's not a mistake, gentlemen. 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:48.690
 and that's it, that's it, these are all 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.000
 The parts that we need to get out 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.190

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.960
 you what he does 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.180

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.760
 will jump to that other part there 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.610
 how can I also use them against 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.750
 zombies and I'll tell you the following against 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.420

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.080
 the previous ones all the weapons that they 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.180
 They placed here in this new and is theirs 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.750
 It was really cool to pretend it happened and the 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.750
 zombie ended up dying 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:39.290
