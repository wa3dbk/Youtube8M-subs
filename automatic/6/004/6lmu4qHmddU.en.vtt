00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.790
 further benchmark tests by 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.540
 tariftipp.de today we have two 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.639
 HTC smartphones we use on their 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.969
 want to test performance and 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.640
 Although once left the android phone that 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.769
 new flagship of htc monik plus 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.949
 and on the right the windows 8 in front of and from htc 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:27.090
 the windows phone 8s both brand new 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.810
 I 'll get it now 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.630
 turn on 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.040
 We also have extensive tests 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.860
 have undergone 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.750
 of course you also here at youtube 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.820
 See can today it is in this 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.960
 Short video just go to check 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.950
 what these two funds bayer tutu for 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.320
 reach values 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:54.230
 I'll start that on both 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:01:00.570
 this app will do this check like this 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:03.030
 left the onyx plus is already running and 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.449
 here on the right, if only a little 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.449
 help out 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.650
 The test lasts about two 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:21.180
 minutes that is so fast 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:23.340
 and the antut benchmark on windows 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.290
 phone is even more significant 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.710
 faster he 'll see right here 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.500
 right now he is already doing this 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.229
 check under windows phone 8 is coming too 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.939
 without graphic applications that is 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.710
 You do not really see anything there 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.900
 it is just tested that way 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.909
 this test goes through relatively quickly 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.100
 and at the end of the test, a 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.619
 the benchmark value is called more 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.420
 we really do not even want to 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.049
 see what comes out there for a gonna come out 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.189
 the windows phone 8 first here but 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.189
 but actually a little bit tested 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:06.460
 in graphic terms, that's it 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.250
 also see what will fall there 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:14.590
 rauskam so here would be synonymous 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:18.580
 already the value namely exactly 7065 that 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:22.990
 is the result for the windows phone 8 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.870
 s and here right here at the left 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.280
 android antut check you see that there 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.690
 much more complicated just what the 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.340
 graphical performance 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.840
 therefore, this test will be tested 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.030
 also a little longer 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.700
 I leave you alone with the ones now 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.750
 take pictures and I'll be right back when 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.750
 the test went through 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.700
 so that's it then already 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.720
 Let's get to the evaluation here 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.370
 In the upper left you can see the value 15,000 885 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.570
 be reached points of this handy 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.400
 excellent value 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.670
 I want to go back here again 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.710
 Here you can see it will be a big one again 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.770
 There is also the possibility here 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.320
 does not compare with these tests 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.940
 other devices where you have to say 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.430
 that of course now here only one 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.290
 small part of the devices is displayed 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.930
 that have been tested 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.500
 here is the normal value of the vaneks 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.690
 plus as I said 15,000 885 points 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.280
 really worth a damn good 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.890
 this device is struck at the moment 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.800
 only from the onyx plus and hear 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:39.260
 samsung galaxy note 2 and the lg nexus 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:44.680
 four the optimus does it a really 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:48.620
 good value and with the windows phone 8 s 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.600
 with the over 7000 points you have to enter 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.340
 be careful 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.190
 At the moment we are not really sure 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.410
 the scores here at the thuraus 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.610
 come with android devices is one too 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.650
 one comparable probably 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.910
 rather not 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.240
 so it is worth a look at 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.090
 google like other windows phone 8 devices 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.110
 there is a cutoff of bavaria tutu 7065 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.010
 after our experience but then too 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.560
 a very good value 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.090
 that's it already and yes if you 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.470
 detailed tests on these two 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.690
 smartphones want to read looks up 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.300
 tariftipp DE both devices have there 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.410
 cut relatively well and there you can 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.010
 you also strengthen and weaken 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.490
 subsided 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.490
 bye for now
