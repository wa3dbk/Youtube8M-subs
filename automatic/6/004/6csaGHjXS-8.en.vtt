00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:04.999 
tax forms but unfortunately that's an

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:06.489 
tax forms but unfortunately that's an
option<00:02:05.359> that's<00:02:05.509> not<00:02:05.689> available<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:06.350> me

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:06.499 
option that's not available to me

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:11.760 
option that's not available to me
because<00:02:07.219> my<00:02:07.609> wife<00:02:08.300> won't<00:02:08.840> let<00:02:09.050> me<00:02:09.229> write<00:02:10.039> honey
