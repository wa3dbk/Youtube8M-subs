00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.890
 4400 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.730
 one of the options 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.730
 besides impute him 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.410
 d 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.280
 the fire to the penalty of 19 years 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:34.809
 this is a very dense cause and 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:39.670
 partly justice was done partly 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:42.820
 it was short I did not ask for the aggravation of 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:47.199
 the treachery for asking was convinced 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:50.410
 I think the fact was even more serious 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.270
 of what was qualified but 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.480
 I know that the court has to have 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:59.980
 worked a lot on this ruling and that should 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:03.580
 have weighed a lot the things of all 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:07.810
 ways is a strong condemnation and over 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:11.560
 all a condemnation that brings a little light 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:15.280
 to this misfortune because it is a condemnation to 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.770
 both in a hypothesis that worked 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.110
 with a lot of effort from the defense in 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.600
 opposite direction trying to save 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.240
 initially one of them 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.330
 I think that it is unfair that 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.759
 well I recognize it but good is a 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.759
 failure that you have to meditate but 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:38.560
 perfect for me was perfect for me in 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:41.520
 the crime with treachery including 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.600
 friend of Juan Pedro 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.240
 who is here 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.240
 He saved his life miraculously because he 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.939
 recipient was not just good pedro was 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.119
 indeterminate a hypothesis not credible 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.420
 but good the hypothesis of the sentence 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.329
 which is now a proven thesis for 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.049
 We are important to sell to a 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:12.410
 reflection time will be appealed after 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:15.239
 I'm sure I do not know what we'll do but 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.470
 what I do tell you that we are moved 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:22.739
 and it's very difficult for the family is very 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.799
 difficult is very difficult the case is very 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.190
 unfair very crazy and they committed it not 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.230
 we have no doubt these two boys 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.650
 after the sentence because no 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.660
 they want to talk I do not have anything that 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.660
 tell him ask him 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.780
 we are surprised in some way 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.910
 because one failure wait wait wait 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.530
 the result but do not wait 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.600
 concretely a penalty now there is that 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.800
 adapt to that penalty and see what is done 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.800
 I think it's pretty
