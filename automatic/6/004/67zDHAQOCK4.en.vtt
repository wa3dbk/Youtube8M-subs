00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.989
 It's hard to record because you fucking headset 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.559
 It's my race time, I do not have much. 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.809

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.730
 Victory for you if it all works out right? 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.200
 I'm doing tutorials there until two 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.070
 videos per week 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.469
 I hope so, we'll go there well . 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.449
 today as I told you how there the system 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.730
 android on your computer 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.469
 basically what would android this 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.559
 operating system used on mobile phones 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.240
 tablets and the like 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.939
 so I'm going to teach you guys how to celebrate 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.520
 and it on your computer ie you 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.490
 You'll be able to do a lot of things, but you will. 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.960
 can play some games to be able to 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.830
 install applications you can use 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.290
 the instagram facebook so the games in 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.150
 general and is very easy to do 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.040
 you just need a program that is 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.770
 This one I'm leaving the link to 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.170
 video description is one of the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.420
 10 point with once enter the site and 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.730
 will have two options for you you can 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.910
 end up closing in 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.130
 this side here the download for windows and 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.640
 on the other side of parliament I came back for 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.120
 Windows 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:49.110
 I installed and is once pulled by Quinho 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.510
 and boy and listen to cu 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.910
 however he delayed the test a bit 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.130
 top is there so it's normal 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.750
 ok then it will do the installation all 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.830
 right 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.860
 took days about 15 to 20 minutes 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.230
 He was fine with this one. 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.390
 he and savior it pieces that more or 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.940
 least new mega bytes 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.800
 so when it goes down when he 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.310
 start talking he will download other 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.060
 things to be able to change android 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.220
 on your computer 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.230
 so it takes a little bit earlier 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.420
 - another thing also that you have to 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.040
 keep in mind is that your video card 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.950
 have to be with the updated drivers 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.810
 do not open the football to open mine here 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.400
 the first time right away when 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.750
 shipyard gave a smile that the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.750
 it was out of date 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.000
 I posted here on the river he gave and he 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.200
 led to having an nvidia page there 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.780
 I put the dragons I did not have 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.520
 authorized and I found it updated and 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.470
 all right then this is what you have 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.970
 to keep in mind so that you can 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.980
 program well 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.890
 once installed it will investigate 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.760
 here I am 22 tex I'll tell you one 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.760
 little about it 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.340
 Clicking here and going to open the book is 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.260
 I need caution from loudi well since 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.340
 entered and this land will appear that 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.890
 you 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.840
 Okay, so he's going to be more or less. 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.040
 pre- configured for you 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.280
 This is Ron Dennis. 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.900
 and what time is it when you're going to call 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.939
 so you will get into the prehistory 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.799
 He'll ask your google accounts for 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.239
 You're accessing it for yourself. 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.700
 download applications 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.310
 here is the purpose here 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.680
 transported looking like social network 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.659
 the show bus nor the more closed tones 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.739
 etc 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:37.959
 to kyodo in this corner we will put you 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.970
 for you to come back is the effort we went 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.760
 where you enter here settings you 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.310
 you can use this button again, or if 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.129
 does not have the right button, right? Because you click 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.379
 cast will return in that initial part is 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.000
 regardless of where you are 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.069
 and has that ok button that there are others 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.549
 tasks you clicking on it you can be 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.700
 to tasks by clicking with the mouse we do not 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:03.280
 proven here and white and most 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.760
 Things You Do You Do With 11 30 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.150
 time here're like a button to classes 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.739
 and share, but this is the role of 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.870
 option if you have a 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.030
 twitter facebook and google plus 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.590
 talents that are the social networks 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.169
 this one for you to leave he went 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.609
 screen and clicking here or you can see that 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.380
 he enters full screen 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.380
 This is the risk of a button that you 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.639
 everything will be closed 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.470
 so popular that it should make you can 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.130
 also in the application here 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.530
 door by applying it to the top or 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.139
 in case if you want to search for the 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.880
 application was the following here will have 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.400
 that button that I'm china that 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.389
 would be nothing more or less nothing less 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.729
 that the search 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:52.349
 Clicking here you joked in case I go 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.349
 put instagram for example 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.580
 when you do it the first time 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.290
 He'll ask for you. 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.200
 the egg in the car on google account like 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.390
 lost you put a quick easy you 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.580
 do not have you make up is very fast too 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.560
 and you're just clicking install 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.780
 same cell phone with that one that 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.320
 it is accepted and it will start to 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.720
 download for yourself or close it 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.410
 will be a boy and with that one had to 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.120
 low 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.360
 in case the notification is not clicking 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.670
 once on it appearing status the 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.430
 download installation and everything else 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:30.010
 well with things to touch is also that 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.750
 not all applications are compatible 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.850
 for example 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.700
 At least that's what I discovered. 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.250
 only application that does not have it was not 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.410
 compatible with mine here so far has been 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.300
 angry birds goal nÃ© 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.100
 You can see that you see that I 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.740
 Then I need to beat your 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.410
 device is compatible with this version 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.260
 but I believe that all problems are 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:56.920
 90% of applications or compatible 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:59.170
 when testing seek to create a 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.290
 virtual machine to play the clash of 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:04.990
 Cano is a great game and another one too. 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.510
 because it has an operating system 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.170
 google android while 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:13.090
 so I lived like that was everything else 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.140
 So the people invite me and I hope 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.530
 that you have enjoyed 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:20.260
