hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another episode with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com.

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.000
I hope you had a chance to see the
numerous video recipes that are put on

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.199
vahrehvah.com

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.359
Today we're going to learn how to make Cauliflower Milagu Peratu which is again from

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.949
south India and is a style of cauliflower pepper fry that is unique

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.140
and taste out of this world

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.300
Cauliflower is really a unique vegetable even I was surprised to learn that about

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.910
half of the cauliflower is raised in
China and one fourth in India. Spain and California

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.760
also raised significant amounts. This vegetable can be raised anywhere but the way it

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.620
taste after it is cooked

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.309
this south Indian Milagu peratu beats anything else

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.789
Cauliflower is low in fat, high in dietary fiber, folate and vitamin C with

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.680
a very high nutritional density; in
addition cauliflower has the compound

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.979
indole-3-carbinol which appears to slow or prevent certain cancers we eaten

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.650
in high quantities but if you decide to
eat too much be aware that it produces

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.670
lot of gas

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.790
so you have too many guests at home

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.880
limit the amount of cauliflower and save
the environment

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.509
this is not just cauliflower my friend it also includes foods such as beans, cabbage, brussels

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.430
sprouts and even broccoli;

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.720
ok enough of gassy stories so let's get to
this cauliflower milagu peratu

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.159
So to prepare this dish our tempering ingredients that is red chilli, mustard

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.530
and channa dal, some curry leaves and chopped coriander, chopped green chilli

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.939
and the spices for our ding chika ding chika masala

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.869
So for the ding chika ding chika masala, we need garlic, cumin seeds and pepper

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.890
what was this ding chika ding chika masala; I was reading that nowadays

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.149
everybody is patenting everything so i thought why not i patent something so i

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.500
decided i will patent this garlic, cumin seeds and peppers.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.050
So from now on whenever we use garlic, cumin seeds and peppers crushed and we

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.270
use it; like we used in lamb fry or mushroom fry in many of the dishes we're

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.580
going to use this whenever we're going
to use it

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.700
we're going to call it ding chik ding chik masala Ok

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.030
and lastly I steamed some cauliflower

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.870
I just half boiled them, if you're going to
cut even more smaller you don't even

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.120
need to boil them so I just steamed it little bit so I can cook this really

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.400
fast to prepare this dish

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.400
Add little oil

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:55.440
we're going to add red chilli  and then add mustard seeds, once your mustard seeds

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:09.030
crackle, add channa dal. After your channa dal is slightly colored little bit cooked

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:19.680
add urad dal, so these are our tempering ingredients, so add our ding chik ding chik ingredients

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.150
our tempering is ready

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.250
so what we're going to do now we're going to add a little bit of hing and

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.030
then take a little bit up of ding chik ding chik masala

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.329
ok

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.769
ah what a flavor, the ding chik ding chik flavor

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:47.940
this is beautiful ok and as soon as you
add don't cook it too much ok just

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.140
very little bit

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.900
add your chopped onions, add your curry
leaves

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.710
add your chopped chilies and then toss it

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.090
you know the best thing is use butter to
make this dish instead of oil

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.190
or desi ghee even more better;

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.190
so now add little bit of the salt

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.000
ok remember one day see in this dish you
don't want your onions to cook too

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.940
much you just want them to remain little bit crunchy

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.890
mix up with your spices and then you're ready to go so lastly

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:40.430
add cauliflower and then toss it off what
flavor

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:49.220
