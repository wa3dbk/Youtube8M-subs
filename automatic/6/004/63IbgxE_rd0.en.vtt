in at number 10 is the model referee to

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.670 
in at number 10 is the model referee to
map<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:15.850> state<00:01:16.240> now<00:01:16.869> what<00:01:17.020> state<00:01:17.200> wasn't<00:01:17.500> really

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
map a state now what state wasn't really

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.320 
map a state now what state wasn't really
one<00:01:17.830> of<00:01:17.920> my<00:01:18.009> least<00:01:18.310> favorite<00:01:18.460> maps<00:01:18.910> but<00:01:19.180> it's

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
one of my least favorite maps but it's

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.390 
one of my least favorite maps but it's
not<00:01:19.479> really<00:01:19.750> a<00:01:19.780> map<00:01:19.990> that<00:01:20.170> I<00:01:20.200> liked<00:01:20.470> either<00:01:20.710> the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
not really a map that I liked either the

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.070 
not really a map that I liked either the
reason<00:01:21.729> this<00:01:21.850> map<00:01:22.060> is<00:01:22.210> hated<00:01:22.509> so<00:01:22.690> much<00:01:22.720> is

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
reason this map is hated so much is

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.350 
reason this map is hated so much is
because<00:01:23.229> of<00:01:23.470> how<00:01:23.590> unbalanced<00:01:24.369> it<00:01:24.490> was<00:01:24.640> what<00:01:25.300> do

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
because of how unbalanced it was what do

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.940 
because of how unbalanced it was what do
you<00:01:25.420> mean<00:01:25.570> what<00:01:25.840> every<00:01:26.170> team<00:01:26.410> controlled<00:01:26.860> the

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
you mean what every team controlled the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.440 
you mean what every team controlled the
giantess<00:01:27.369> state<00:01:27.610> controlled<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:28.270> game

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
giantess state controlled the game

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.240 
giantess state controlled the game
pretty<00:01:28.630> much<00:01:28.900> so<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.560> map<00:01:29.710> was<00:01:29.860> just<00:01:30.009> a<00:01:30.100> big

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
pretty much so the map was just a big

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.280 
pretty much so the map was just a big
camp<00:01:30.550> fest<00:01:30.820> most<00:01:31.090> of<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.270> time<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.840> team<00:01:32.110> that

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
camp fest most of the time the team that

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.690 
camp fest most of the time the team that
spawned<00:01:32.590> at<00:01:32.740> this<00:01:32.890> day<00:01:33.070> in<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.280> beginning<00:01:33.400> the

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
spawned at this day in the beginning the

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.749 
spawned at this day in the beginning the
game<00:01:33.850> automatically<00:01:34.540> had<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.930> operand<00:01:35.759> there

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
game automatically had the operand there

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.550 
game automatically had the operand there
are<00:01:36.880> so<00:01:37.090> many<00:01:37.300> places<00:01:37.720> of<00:01:37.929> the<00:01:38.080> map<00:01:38.259> that<00:01:38.500> were

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
are so many places of the map that were

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.980 
are so many places of the map that were
never<00:01:38.830> used<00:01:39.220> and<00:01:39.700> serve<00:01:39.910> no<00:01:40.179> purpose<00:01:40.450> except

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
never used and serve no purpose except

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.389 
never used and serve no purpose except
for<00:01:41.140> maybe<00:01:41.259> boosters<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:42.100> hide<00:01:42.220> and

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
for maybe boosters to hide and

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.760 
for maybe boosters to hide and
free-for-all<00:01:42.910> also<00:01:43.810> another<00:01:44.140> unbalanced

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
free-for-all also another unbalanced

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.440 
free-for-all also another unbalanced
inexcusable<00:01:45.429> problem<00:01:45.789> with<00:01:45.910> this<00:01:46.000> map<00:01:46.240> is

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
inexcusable problem with this map is

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.630 
inexcusable problem with this map is
that<00:01:46.899> every<00:01:47.229> game<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:47.740> team<00:01:47.950> spawning<00:01:48.310> at<00:01:48.520> the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
that every game the team spawning at the

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.550 
that every game the team spawning at the
bottom<00:01:48.970> will<00:01:49.420> get<00:01:49.539> sniped<00:01:49.869> trying<00:01:50.319> to<00:01:50.410> run<00:01:50.530> out

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
bottom will get sniped trying to run out

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.620 
bottom will get sniped trying to run out
of<00:01:50.679> their<00:01:50.890> spawn<00:01:51.190> to<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.460> right<00:01:51.640> although<00:01:52.600> I

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
of their spawn to the right although I

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.059 
of their spawn to the right although I
did<00:01:52.869> find<00:01:53.080> a<00:01:53.140> way<00:01:53.229> that<00:01:53.289> you<00:01:53.410> can<00:01:53.530> avoid<00:01:53.800> this

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
did find a way that you can avoid this

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:55.980 
did find a way that you can avoid this
most<00:01:54.310> of<00:01:54.429> the<00:01:54.490> time<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:55.179> map<00:01:55.360> should<00:01:55.569> not<00:01:55.810> be

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
most of the time the map should not be

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.840 
most of the time the map should not be
set<00:01:56.200> up<00:01:56.319> where<00:01:56.470> one<00:01:56.710> team<00:01:56.979> can<00:01:57.190> easily<00:01:57.640> snipe

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
set up where one team can easily snipe

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.219 
set up where one team can easily snipe
the<00:01:58.060> other<00:01:58.179> team<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:58.780> have<00:01:58.899> a<00:01:58.929> clear

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
the other team and have a clear

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.350 
the other team and have a clear
advantage<00:01:59.380> right<00:01:59.860> out<00:02:00.039> of<00:02:00.069> the<00:02:00.190> gate<00:02:00.399> overall

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
advantage right out of the gate overall
