okay<00:00:02.159> this<00:00:02.490> is<00:00:03.799> basically<00:00:04.799> what<00:00:05.040> I'm<00:00:05.160> going

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
okay this is basically what I'm going

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.360 
okay this is basically what I'm going
through<00:00:05.759> for<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:06.660> last<00:00:06.960> video<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.379> did<00:00:07.830> called

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
through for that last video I did called

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.890 
through for that last video I did called
Auto<00:00:08.550> vol<00:00:10.099> starting<00:00:11.099> with<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.820> digitech<00:00:12.360> RP

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
Auto vol starting with the digitech RP

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.779 
Auto vol starting with the digitech RP
200<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:15.890> think<00:00:16.890> it's<00:00:17.010> even<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.310> factory<00:00:17.910> set

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
200 I think it's even a factory set

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:26.540 
200 I think it's even a factory set
effect<00:00:20.789> called<00:00:21.029> match<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:23.400> warm<00:00:25.550> distortion

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
effect called match the warm distortion

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.830 
effect called match the warm distortion
I<00:00:26.760> might<00:00:27.210> evolve<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.810> no<00:00:28.550> I've<00:00:29.550> got<00:00:29.699> my<00:00:29.910> wall

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
I might evolve it no I've got my wall

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.200 
I might evolve it no I've got my wall
which<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.289> off<00:00:31.619> as<00:00:32.009> well<00:00:32.250> as<00:00:32.340> my<00:00:32.579> distortion

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
which is off as well as my distortion

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.410 
which is off as well as my distortion
pedal<00:00:33.510> which<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.780> off<00:00:34.760> vented<00:00:35.760> time<00:00:36.000> machine

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
pedal which is off vented time machine

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.650 
pedal which is off vented time machine
I'm<00:00:36.660> not<00:00:36.840> using<00:00:38.239> tremolo<00:00:39.239> not<00:00:39.960> using<00:00:41.090> line<00:00:42.090> six

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
I'm not using tremolo not using line six

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.970 
I'm not using tremolo not using line six
so<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:44.690> see<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.930> can<00:00:46.140> get<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> macro

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
so here is see if I can get a macro

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:56.580 
so here is see if I can get a macro
setting<00:00:47.460> here

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.500 

this<00:00:57.070> is<00:00:57.720> the<00:00:58.720> setting<00:00:59.490> are<00:01:00.490> pretty<00:01:00.790> close<00:01:01.120> to

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
this is the setting are pretty close to

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.150 
this is the setting are pretty close to
it

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160

delay<00:01:06.160> time<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.520> little<00:01:06.910> bit<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.210> passed<00:01:07.450> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
delay time a little bit and passed the

you piece hit one tweak almost all the

you piece hit one tweak almost all the
way<00:01:16.320> down<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:16.830> not<00:01:17.010> all<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.280> way<00:01:17.370> down<00:01:18.350> tweeze

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
way down if not all the way down tweeze

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.060 
way down if not all the way down tweeze
about<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.450> three<00:01:21.810> almost<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.530> three<00:01:22.800> same

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
about the three almost the three same

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.820 
about the three almost the three same
with<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> mix

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.149 

on<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.700> Amato<00:01:29.000> all<00:01:29.870> you<00:01:30.110> may<00:01:30.350> go

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.880 

Loup

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.920 

baseline<00:01:39.890> with<00:01:40.190> my<00:01:40.630> digitech<00:01:41.630> jam<00:01:41.960> man

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:58.930 

going<00:01:45.620> through<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:47.140> crate<00:01:50.140> 212<00:01:51.340> gfx

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:06.899 

now<00:01:59.940> I<00:01:59.970> was<00:02:00.300> with<00:02:00.450> my<00:02:00.770> SG<00:02:01.770> Epiphone<00:02:02.400> SG

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.199 

and<00:02:07.360> there<00:02:07.570> you<00:02:07.659> have<00:02:07.750> it<00:02:08.940> hopefully<00:02:09.940> that

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
and there you have it hopefully that

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.450 
and there you have it hopefully that
helps
