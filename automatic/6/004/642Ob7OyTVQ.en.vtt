00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
jewel review review on it but that's it

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.460 
jewel review review on it but that's it
it<00:05:55.960> looks<00:05:56.140> like<00:05:56.320> an<00:05:56.470> MSF<00:05:57.510> and<00:05:58.510> I<00:05:58.570> haven't<00:05:59.260> seen

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
it looks like an MSF and I haven't seen

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.320 
it looks like an MSF and I haven't seen
these<00:05:59.740> before<00:06:00.070> I<00:06:00.370> haven't<00:06:00.790> had<00:06:00.910> one<00:06:00.940> of<00:06:01.180> these

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
these before I haven't had one of these

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.140 
these before I haven't had one of these
from<00:06:02.200> Laura<00:06:02.410> Geller<00:06:02.710> before<00:06:03.220> so<00:06:03.790> I<00:06:03.820> think<00:06:03.910> it's

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
from Laura Geller before so I think it's

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.660 
from Laura Geller before so I think it's
still<00:06:04.240> really<00:06:04.540> interesting<00:06:05.400> but<00:06:06.400> it<00:06:06.490> does

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 
still really interesting but it does

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.380 
still really interesting but it does
look<00:06:06.820> like<00:06:06.910> an<00:06:07.150> image<00:06:07.420> that<00:06:07.630> MSF<00:06:09.240> there<00:06:10.240> I<00:06:10.270> just
