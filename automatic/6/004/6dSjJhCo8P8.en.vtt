00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
I see this rubbish actually yeah it

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.820 
I see this rubbish actually yeah it
might<00:01:05.430> take<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> little<00:01:05.909> while<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.560> work

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
might take a little while to to work

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.380 
might take a little while to to work
into<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:08.580> when<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> first<00:01:09.869> started<00:01:09.990> playing<00:01:10.320> I

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
into but when I first started playing I

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.760 
into but when I first started playing I
played<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.170> harmonica<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:15.409> all<00:01:16.409> my

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
played with the harmonica just all my

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.999 
played with the harmonica just all my
lips<00:01:17.780> like<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:20.060> that's<00:01:21.439> just<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
lips like that and that's just just a

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.410 
lips like that and that's just just a
bit<00:01:23.130> wrong<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.549> get<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.700> kind<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.090> tinny

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
bit wrong you get this kind of tinny

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:34.490 
bit wrong you get this kind of tinny
tight<00:01:25.170> sound<00:01:25.860> right<00:01:30.259> and<00:01:32.360> that<00:01:33.360> yeah<00:01:33.720> don't

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
tight sound right and that yeah don't

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.039 
tight sound right and that yeah don't
don't<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.280> think<00:01:35.460> for<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:36.990> a

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
don't do that I think for it's a it's a

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.120 
don't do that I think for it's a it's a
golden<00:01:37.350> rule<00:01:37.640> I<00:01:39.470> didn't<00:01:40.470> really<00:01:40.560> understand

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
golden rule I didn't really understand

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.969 
golden rule I didn't really understand
what<00:01:41.759> time<00:01:42.329> was<00:01:42.960> i<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.409> really<00:01:43.590> tell<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
what time was i can really tell the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.969 
what time was i can really tell the
difference<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.700> knew<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.290> that<00:01:46.290> when<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.710> was

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
difference I knew that that when I was

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.450 
difference I knew that that when I was
playing<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.670> sounded<00:01:48.210> higher<00:01:48.930> or<00:01:50.869> more<00:01:51.869> tinny

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
playing it sounded higher or more tinny

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.429 
playing it sounded higher or more tinny
than<00:01:53.460> when<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.700> was<00:01:53.820> watching<00:01:54.360> people<00:01:54.930> play<00:01:55.049> and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
than when I was watching people play and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.230 
than when I was watching people play and
I<00:01:55.590> thought<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.950> was<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.610> know<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.909> through

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
I thought it was you know so through

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.999 
I thought it was you know so through
microphones<00:01:57.840> or<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> different<00:01:58.439> kind<00:01:58.710> of

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
microphones or a different kind of

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.980 
microphones or a different kind of
harmonic<00:01:59.670> or<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.939> different<00:02:00.270> key<00:02:00.479> or<00:02:00.750> something

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
harmonic or a different key or something

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.569 
harmonic or a different key or something
like<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.369> but<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.490> wasn't<00:02:02.990> it's<00:02:04.520> all<00:02:05.520> about

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
like that but it wasn't it's all about

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.790 
like that but it wasn't it's all about
time<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.780> basically<00:02:07.429> 33<00:02:08.429> little<00:02:08.879> tips

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
time and so basically 33 little tips

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.340 
time and so basically 33 little tips
firstly<00:02:11.940> jam<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:13.120> right<00:02:13.420> in<00:02:13.630> I<00:02:15.900> don't<00:02:16.900> put<00:02:17.260> it

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
firstly jam it right in I don't put it

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.949 
firstly jam it right in I don't put it
in<00:02:17.440> as<00:02:17.560> far<00:02:17.590> as<00:02:17.920> I<00:02:18.040> probably<00:02:18.580> should<00:02:18.910> do<00:02:20.610> bet<00:02:21.610> I

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
in as far as I probably should do bet I

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.559 
in as far as I probably should do bet I
noticed<00:02:22.959> that<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:23.440> makes<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.160> big<00:02:24.310> difference

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
noticed that it makes a big difference

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.070 
noticed that it makes a big difference
putting<00:02:25.569> it<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:26.620> much<00:02:26.800> further<00:02:27.040> into<00:02:27.459> mouth

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
putting it that much further into mouth

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.500 
putting it that much further into mouth
you<00:02:29.080> get<00:02:29.230> better<00:02:29.500> no<00:02:30.310> definition<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.360> get

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
you get better no definition you get

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.730 
you get better no definition you get
more<00:02:31.690> power<00:02:31.959> through<00:02:32.560> it<00:02:34.440> then<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.560> just

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
more power through it then it just

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.699 
more power through it then it just
starts<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.489> whole<00:02:36.670> tone<00:02:36.940> building<00:02:37.780> process

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
starts a whole tone building process

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.190 
starts a whole tone building process
better<00:02:39.400> so<00:02:40.300> just<00:02:42.360> put<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.450> as<00:02:43.570> far<00:02:43.750> into<00:02:43.810> your

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
better so just put it as far into your

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.020 
better so just put it as far into your
mouth<00:02:44.260> as<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.830> feel<00:02:45.250> comfortable<00:02:45.280> with<00:02:45.790> all

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
mouth as you feel comfortable with all

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.300 
mouth as you feel comfortable with all
you<00:02:46.239> that<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:46.989> can<00:02:47.290> when<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.130> feel

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
you that you can when you feel

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.240 
you that you can when you feel
comfortable<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.230> still<00:02:50.950> going<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.160> be

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
comfortable and you still going to be

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.860 
comfortable and you still going to be
able<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.519> play<00:02:51.610> single<00:02:52.060> notes<00:02:52.090> that's<00:02:52.780> a
