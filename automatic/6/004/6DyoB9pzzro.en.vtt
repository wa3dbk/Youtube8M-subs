 is in this hexagonal and how does it affect 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.259
 obviously, he envisaged that they go to 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.259
 confederations with this one 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.250
 It is undeniable 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.790
 the results at home have not been 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.460
 good on everyone's list of course 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.620
 which is a great annoyance of all all 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.560
 we people have behaved 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.040
 'extraordinarily 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.780
 has supported us and well I have looked for 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.640
 brno in terms of the result also if 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.890
 We have not done a good football Nor 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.530
 has reflected in a good result and that 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.650
 they always complicate us in the table of 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.650
 positions 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.019
 although we are there but anyway 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.790
 good night I would have that love to channel 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.189
 13 costa rica surprised the way 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.750
 in that because instinct raised the 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.430
 party and how it came to 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.220
 play the Costa Rica national team because 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.569
 even at noon the technician painted 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.280
 of some statements that until being 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.200
 sure the alignment that you will draw 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.840
 because he was going to give his alignment, not the 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.390
 well she played the last match also 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.459
 here at home that in the end we took the 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.890
 triumph but it was not the same way 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.900
 it also complicated us a lot, it closed a lot 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.430
 the spaces backwards and not just that 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.560
 he also squeezed us to the front and in that 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.330
 squeeze them also got 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.739
 spaces where they could have made us 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.950
 a lot of damage they also had 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.720
 arrival then we were not surprised but 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.640
 they executed it well we did not go 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.190
 accurate and that also caused them 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.660
 they had opportunity above all they are 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.430
 good players and they are well worked 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.080
 how tired at night joseph 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.030
 Manuel is this person but he is conceived 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.830
 for the last word ask yourself 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.300
 they turn on the red lights after this 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.190
 result is given in the stadium song 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.170
 Aztec because long ago in the 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.040
 qualifying has not lost so many 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.900
 points at home 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.580
 you feel that the 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.610
 eyes look for the points that have been 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.740
 let escape always 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.960
 It is important to win games at home 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.850
 are the ones that give you that support for 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.050
 qualify to always be within 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.660
 we have not done it and that has 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.440
 complicated we had good matches 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.760
 away from home we have been compensated 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.370
 then we have had a strong deficit 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.260
 at home and of course he was 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.790
 squeeze in the standings not 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.070
 there are still matches that we can 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.480
 rectify we can correct for 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.160
 can put them in the first places 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.420
 but we're still not there or the 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.940

 you deserve that a certain part of the hobby 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.320
 ask what is out of the selection 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.200
 national look I think the fans have 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.320
 all the right to say things not in 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.850
 that the audience was extraordinary support 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.980
 at all times to the selection until the 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.200
 last moment if yes at the beginning 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.290
 signs have done a little bit fell and 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.810

 We will always be very respectful of 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.200
 the people were always each we have a 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.480
 coach inside 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.090

 he is this that has ceased to be that 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.440
 that strength of the Mexican team and we 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.660
 has not even scored a goal in 270 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.440
 minutes three elimination matches there are 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.720
 a lot of social annoyance that's normal 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.400
 and that's in the whole group 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.270
 so 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.270
 it is normal not
