a much sharper lens the 25 millimeter
one<00:03:21.590> for<00:03:21.919> Panasonic<00:03:22.519> might<00:03:22.790> be<00:03:23.000> better<00:03:23.180> if

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
one for Panasonic might be better if

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.470 
one for Panasonic might be better if
measured<00:03:23.690> but<00:03:23.810> not<00:03:24.019> to<00:03:24.139> the<00:03:24.230> eye<00:03:25.359> focusing<00:03:26.359> is

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
measured but not to the eye focusing is

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.390 
measured but not to the eye focusing is
fast<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.079> focus<00:03:27.440> motor<00:03:27.650> is<00:03:27.859> just<00:03:27.889> about

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
fast and the focus motor is just about

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.159 
fast and the focus motor is just about
silent<00:03:28.910> in<00:03:28.970> action<00:03:29.269> which<00:03:29.389> is<00:03:29.510> good<00:03:29.720> for<00:03:29.840> video
