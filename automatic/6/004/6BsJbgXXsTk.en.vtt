00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:26.550
 new something Oh I will distinctive smell 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:30.990
 It can not be said even turned down a more To mold smell something like rotten of such building materials 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:37.290
 It's just because I'm gone, I can't keep flowing 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:42.640
 That's right Nemaa about excitement I also want to become slipped and Chonkurakura' Being 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:45.860
 The mask that I put on entering has a strong odor that makes me feel at ease 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:50.210
 This is the source of the odor 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:57.040
 Mold that covered the remaining household goods tightly 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:57.040
 Mold was spreading under the bed even once in many bedrooms 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.949
 j 10 for the sauna state 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.159
 I such a state 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.159
 It is a mate 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.790
 The cause was installed in the central part of the first floor 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:18.850
 It is a boiler of the type that keeps hot water 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:24.400
 It is said that this boiler has exploded 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:29.340
 About 90 degrees 470 l monotonous head spouted by explosion 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.340
 It is believed that the entire house was wrapped above 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.270
 we 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.720
 Bomb ska kiloliter 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.350
 Formerly Garden 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.650
 A state like saying "Sumi" 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.090
 eh 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:53.700
 If you put it along, along 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:58.110
 I was supposed to like was it in or are you together that guarantee collapse 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:03.300
 9 ed in hot water of bitter entered this kind of mon is Kane Well 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:06.330
 Since it is close from then on, isn't it all in hot water? 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:11.030
 I will be in my chest for another 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.030
 First of all how do you express it 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.879
 Muscle condition in the head 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.879
 was 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.189
 I asked an expert in Tokyo for a survey 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.160
 There was a state similar to putting on a scolding nighttime ridge fire 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.110
 After all there is no place to escape, which is the cause of the explosion 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:48.450
 Boilers need to be in order to release steam, etc. 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:50.650
 But this boiler wasn't attached to these flights, but the industry has forgotten 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.550
 It is supposed to be 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.690
 I think this is close to crime 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.200
 What happens if I sell the good will and the car without basically large brake and 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:06.830
 It is the same as this 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:08.900
 It is exactly the same as this, for example , if a small child was in front of him at the time of the accident 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.000
 did it become 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.000
 I'm probably dead 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:25.110
 That's a serious accident I think this is a human error rather than an accident 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.950
 Such a trader does not work 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.980
 You don't know the obvious thing 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:36.760
 It is a crime 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:38.080
 A compensation of approximately 70 million yen, such as compensation of household goods such as houses, for the construction agent who constructed it 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.390
 What to ask for 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:46.100
 We wake to the Akita District Court 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:50.060
 The construction shop of the defendant side in the past trial is a construction mistake 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:56.450
 I admit that the boiler has burst but 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:04:01.290
 Even though it was possible to move in with proper repair work, it was not accepted as it is now 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:05.040
 I am asking for the rejection of the charge because it became a state 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:10.610
 Mr. Iwayama's housing survey conducted during the trial 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:15.560
 Mr. Iwayama says that the building violation originally to this house 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:20.180
 Only this it is normal to think I would have other because to do with construction equipment 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:27.460
 So we have seen so many things with that kind of eye though 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.460
 Still large There were some fairly large problem in that structure 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:35.830
 Mr. Iwayama thoroughly investigated the invisible part 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:41.510
 When digging the ground and checking the condition of the foundation 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:47.840
 The thickness of the bottom of the foundation said to be footing was insufficient 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:53.330
 The required footing of 15 cm or more was only 12 cm or so 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:58.150
 In addition , except the attic , it must be on the entire inside of the outer wall 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.150
 Board for the fire was not stretched 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:09.670
 From the Tteyuu Japanese house the old days it because it is the fight against housework 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:13.030
 So for the very the housework I also law I'm I'm thinking carefully 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:15.310
 That's what is prescribed, but still 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.740
 That it is deviating 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.740
 I do not understand after all 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.639
 Hey about architecture 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:31.630
 I live by renting a house in another place now 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:36.819
 I have seen say after all I Do not live only not a 2-week foot et al to the newly built this house 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:40.830
 Because many still was doing it thinking what you say from now on Aborigines results 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:40.830
 It is a feeling that it was betrayed
