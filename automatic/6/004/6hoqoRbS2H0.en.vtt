00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.180
 Some people here and I'm going. 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.740
 teach you how to take the old 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.530
 lord gta 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.830
 many players suffer from this problem 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.810
 How I suffer is because my pc is not good. 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.880
 I've put together three video files here 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.400
 that I saw on the internet and really 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.869
 they worked had 80% of the eg 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.400
 sometimes it feels light because I thought 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.009
 very very bad even 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.249
 and here is the pec I made available for 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:34.400
 download and has video description 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:38.140
 first the file stream you copy it 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.140
 go there in the peace of lord gta 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.750
 paste here you can paste it without pity and that you 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.360
 get another file 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.510
 you actually draw sgt the room spec 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.280
 a generic bk hacken nÃ© 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:03.350
 You will want generic models going 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.740
 generic and that can paste well 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:12.420
 is here 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.420
 the brazil this file jack glass and glue 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:21.080
 and that these ffx here particle this 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.430
 decreases particles and effects and gta 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.520
 But it will not change a thing, you will not either. 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.220
 to realize is that it has some effects on the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.500
 Truth you do not use in your gt the improvement 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.350
 very very very light even takes too much 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:38.380
 very light 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.380
 you can paste that in the same ways 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.490
 this is it and there is more this file that is 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.549
 o fps 15 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.909
 saints is the party even when you 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.619
 open your gta only work with it open 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.950
 gt to your blood 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.420
 you open you open it will turn green 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.130
 itself is not working 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.720
 You can leave zero because if you 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.909
 They think he's going to stay a lot. 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.310
 even legacy of so much that will take the lec 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.470
 It was very bad and that's it. 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.480
 This is going to decrease very light and I was 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.319
 stopped saying that I came back because I 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.470
 I found this and liked the ones in good led and 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.730
 also has this game bolster program 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.920
 which I will also make available to 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.920
 download and it's great too 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.390
 on here 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.910
 I'll show you how you use it and not me. 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.170
 I think you already know or do not know if you click 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.340
 here in booster 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.340
 I showed you I showed you here 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.460
 the 18 stacked services stack was the 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.590
 process stopped performing after the 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.170
 boss earned 42 percent 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.500
 This greatly improves having a pc besides 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:53.270
 the game also has a pc 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.740
 This is it, some of the daee 's people are just lonely 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.930
 put the description of the video that I 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.150
 I want you to help me make a video lesson. 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.220
 or something like this 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.040

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.040
