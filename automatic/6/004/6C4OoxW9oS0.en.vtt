under the trains where it's very

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.410 
under the trains where it's very

while on the trains take out the three

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.920

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.740 

huh

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.860 

if<00:01:31.040> you<00:01:32.040> have<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.490> rifle<00:01:32.880> with<00:01:33.000> ammo<00:01:33.360> still<00:01:33.660> on

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
if you have the rifle with ammo still on

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.870 
if you have the rifle with ammo still on
the<00:01:34.470> far<00:01:34.800> pole<00:01:35.130> here<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.840> bsaa<00:01:36.840> emblems<00:01:37.020> 9<00:01:38.010> you

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the far pole here is bsaa emblems 9 you

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.730 
the far pole here is bsaa emblems 9 you
can<00:01:38.910> probably<00:01:39.270> shoot<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.780> handgun<00:01:40.229> but

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
can probably shoot it with a handgun but

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.480 
can probably shoot it with a handgun but
the<00:01:40.860> rifle<00:01:41.160> makes<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.490> much<00:01:41.640> easier<00:01:45.560> now<00:01:46.560> you

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the rifle makes it much easier now you

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.330 
the rifle makes it much easier now you
can<00:01:47.610> throw<00:01:47.880> grenades<00:01:48.300> off<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.750> edge<00:01:48.979> or<00:01:49.979> just

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
can throw grenades off the edge or just

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.160 
can throw grenades off the edge or just
shoot<00:01:50.400> and<00:01:50.729> kill<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.090> dogs<00:01:51.300> before<00:01:51.750> jumping

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
shoot and kill the dogs before jumping

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:24.170 
shoot and kill the dogs before jumping
down

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.730 

here<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.450> left<00:02:25.600> before<00:02:25.840> jumping<00:02:26.260> down<00:02:26.560> as

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
here to the left before jumping down as

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:41.020 
here to the left before jumping down as
a<00:02:26.770> treasure

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.460 

take<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.210> okay<00:02:44.690> right<00:02:45.690> here<00:02:45.750> aim<00:02:46.200> down<00:02:46.410> the

tunnel<00:02:46.860> here<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.430> can<00:02:47.550> see<00:02:47.730> an<00:02:47.820> explosive

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
tunnel here and you can see an explosive

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.690 
tunnel here and you can see an explosive
trap<00:02:48.540> shoot<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.260> get<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.160> treasure<00:02:50.310> on<00:02:50.580> the

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
trap shoot it get the treasure on the

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.940 
trap shoot it get the treasure on the
wall<00:02:50.850> behind<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.810> we're<00:02:52.590> going<00:02:52.740> to<00:02:52.770> head

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
wall behind you and we're going to head

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:15.710 
wall behind you and we're going to head
back<00:02:52.980> up<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.460> cargo<00:02:53.730> crates

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.780 

from<00:03:16.720> this<00:03:16.870> point<00:03:17.110> here<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:18.310> should<00:03:18.550> be<00:03:18.670> able

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
from this point here you should be able

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.970 
from this point here you should be able
to<00:03:19.000> see<00:03:19.150> one<00:03:19.420> more<00:03:19.450> explosive<00:03:20.230> trap<00:03:22.800> shoot<00:03:23.800> it

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
to see one more explosive trap shoot it

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.550 
to see one more explosive trap shoot it
and<00:03:24.160> also<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:25.060> one<00:03:25.210> to<00:03:25.330> your<00:03:25.450> right<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.900> jump

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
and also the one to your right and jump

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.420 
and also the one to your right and jump
down<00:03:26.740> into<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.100> mine<00:03:27.280> cart<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.950> ride<00:03:33.220> is

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
down into the mine cart the ride is

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.010 
down into the mine cart the ride is
rather<00:03:33.670> boring<00:03:34.000> without<00:03:34.240> the<00:03:34.510> explosive

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
rather boring without the explosive

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.140 
rather boring without the explosive
traps<00:03:35.320> but<00:03:35.710> this<00:03:35.980> way<00:03:36.220> is<00:03:36.460> easier<00:03:36.760> than

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
traps but this way is easier than

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.690 
traps but this way is easier than
shooting<00:03:37.360> them<00:03:37.600> while<00:03:37.840> on<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.170> cart<00:03:41.610> there<00:03:42.610> is

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
shooting them while on the cart there is

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.940 
shooting them while on the cart there is
also<00:03:42.880> some<00:03:43.120> gold<00:03:43.390> way<00:03:44.110> back<00:03:44.320> at<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.530> other<00:03:44.710> end

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
also some gold way back at the other end

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:56.140 
also some gold way back at the other end
if<00:03:45.310> you<00:03:45.370> want<00:03:45.670> to<00:03:45.760> walk<00:03:45.910> back<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.330> get<00:03:46.450> it

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.209
