when<00:00:13.349> I've<00:00:13.469> looked<00:00:13.710> at<00:00:13.950> punching<00:00:14.460> over<00:00:14.730> the

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
when I've looked at punching over the

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.000 
when I've looked at punching over the
years<00:00:15.089> I've<00:00:15.509> always<00:00:15.929> looked<00:00:16.170> at<00:00:16.320> what<00:00:16.560> people

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
years I've always looked at what people

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.130 
years I've always looked at what people
can<00:00:17.250> do<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:18.029> was<00:00:18.150> simple<00:00:18.570> how<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.750> saw<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:21.140> if

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
can do and it was simple how I saw it if

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.370 
can do and it was simple how I saw it if
we<00:00:22.289> look<00:00:22.470> at<00:00:22.650> body<00:00:23.250> position<00:00:24.230> okay

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
we look at body position okay

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.439 
we look at body position okay
this<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.740> sort<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.070> natural<00:00:26.220> fighting<00:00:26.939> body

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
this is sort of a natural fighting body

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.259 
this is sort of a natural fighting body
position<00:00:27.990> if<00:00:28.470> I'm<00:00:28.769> talking<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.519> somebody<00:00:29.550> like

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
position if I'm talking to somebody like

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.970 
position if I'm talking to somebody like
that<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.570> I'm<00:00:30.810> going<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.349> I've<00:00:31.470> got<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> power

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
that and I'm going and I've got a power

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.979 
that and I'm going and I've got a power
of<00:00:32.160> strength<00:00:32.369> I'll<00:00:32.759> move<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.210> left<00:00:33.780> leg

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
of strength I'll move in left leg

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.229 
of strength I'll move in left leg
forward<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.620> see<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.489> that's<00:00:35.940> step

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
forward can you see so that's step

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.479 
forward can you see so that's step
forward<00:00:36.690> if<00:00:37.170> I'm<00:00:37.410> talking<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.860> somebody<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.430> I

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
forward if I'm talking to somebody and I

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.549 
forward if I'm talking to somebody and I
take<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> step<00:00:39.090> back<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.660> more<00:00:39.930> defensive

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
take a step back it's more defensive

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.040 
take a step back it's more defensive
isn't<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:41.969> go<00:00:42.090> forward<00:00:42.570> or<00:00:42.719> back

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
isn't it so we can go forward or back

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.380 
isn't it so we can go forward or back
now<00:00:43.230> if<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.410> look<00:00:43.620> at<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.950> wire<00:00:44.309> punching<00:00:44.969> if

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
now if you look at a wire punching if

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.500 
now if you look at a wire punching if
you<00:00:45.480> look<00:00:45.629> at<00:00:45.750> my<00:00:45.899> hand<00:00:46.489> okay<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.700> bad<00:00:48.120> what<00:00:48.480> I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
you look at my hand okay a bad what I

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.680 
you look at my hand okay a bad what I
call<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> bad<00:00:49.140> wire<00:00:49.440> punching<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:51.000> if<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.449> then

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
call a bad wire punching is if I then

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.569 
call a bad wire punching is if I then
push<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> bad<00:00:52.739> bench-pressed

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
push like a bad bench-pressed

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.299 
push like a bad bench-pressed
out<00:00:53.750> if<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.899> actually<00:00:55.140> push<00:00:55.710> using<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
out if I actually push using the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.880 
out if I actually push using the
strength<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.820> my<00:00:56.969> arm<00:00:57.180> out<00:00:57.390> that's<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.410> bad<00:00:58.649> way

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
strength of my arm out that's a bad way

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.099 
strength of my arm out that's a bad way
of<00:00:58.920> punching<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.149> only<00:01:00.329> time<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.719> ever<00:01:00.750> do

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
of punching and the only time I ever do

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.569 
of punching and the only time I ever do
that<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.469> if<00:01:01.590> I'm<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> hit<00:01:02.039> an<00:01:02.160> idiot<00:01:02.489> and

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
that is if I'm going to hit an idiot and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.950 
that is if I'm going to hit an idiot and
I<00:01:02.640> don't<00:01:02.670> really<00:01:02.910> want<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.270> get<00:01:03.359> arrested

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
I don't really want to get arrested

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.100 
I don't really want to get arrested
right<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.680> blokes<00:01:04.979> gone<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.880> think

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
right the blokes gone for it and I think

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.260 
right the blokes gone for it and I think
bang<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.100> Japanese<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.700> think<00:01:08.970> they<00:01:09.060> call

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
bang and in Japanese I think they call

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.270 
bang and in Japanese I think they call
that<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.659> at<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.020> like<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.380> bang<00:01:11.010> like

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
that a go at you like that bang like

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.520 
that a go at you like that bang like
that<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> bad<00:01:12.479> way<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.869> punching<00:01:13.140> a

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
that so that is a bad way of punching a

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.420 
that so that is a bad way of punching a
good<00:01:14.159> way<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.340> punching<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:16.340> twisting<00:01:17.340> your

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
good way of punching is twisting your

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.149 
good way of punching is twisting your
hips<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.939> straight<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:19.020> good<00:01:19.710> way<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:19.890> you

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
hips in straight in a good way so you

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.700 
hips in straight in a good way so you
can<00:01:20.369> now<00:01:20.520> rotate<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.180> way<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:22.290> good<00:01:22.560> way

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
can now rotate that way as a good way

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.190 
can now rotate that way as a good way
and<00:01:22.890> interestingly<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:24.150> can<00:01:24.330> rotate<00:01:24.750> that

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
and interestingly you can rotate that

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.999 
and interestingly you can rotate that
way<00:01:25.259> now<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.670> street<00:01:27.000> fight<00:01:27.290> we<00:01:28.290> always<00:01:28.650> hit

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
way now in a street fight we always hit

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.179 
way now in a street fight we always hit
with<00:01:29.610> our<00:01:29.700> best<00:01:30.000> shot<00:01:30.329> first<00:01:30.619> you<00:01:31.619> don't<00:01:31.799> do<00:01:32.159> a

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
with our best shot first you don't do a

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.460 
with our best shot first you don't do a
setup<00:01:32.579> punch<00:01:32.909> if<00:01:33.630> you're<00:01:33.840> going<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.079> pull<00:01:34.290> like

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
can curve that way or that way straight

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.410 
can curve that way or that way straight
down

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
down

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.190 
down
so<00:02:11.960> it's<00:02:12.080> very<00:02:12.140> very<00:02:12.620> important<00:02:13.130> so<00:02:14.080> get<00:02:15.080> your

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
so it's very very important so get your

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.740 
so it's very very important so get your
hips<00:02:15.410> right<00:02:15.620> lead<00:02:15.980> step<00:02:16.370> here<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.480> it's<00:02:17.600> quite

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
hips right lead step here so it's quite

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.199 
hips right lead step here so it's quite
mechanical<00:02:18.440> step<00:02:19.100> here<00:02:19.640> that's<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:19.970> street

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
mechanical step here that's a street

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.059 
mechanical step here that's a street
fighting<00:02:20.480> punch<00:02:20.870> it's<00:02:21.530> as<00:02:21.680> simple<00:02:21.830> as<00:02:22.040> that

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
fighting punch it's as simple as that

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.430 
fighting punch it's as simple as that
your<00:02:22.640> arm<00:02:22.850> then<00:02:23.240> follows<00:02:23.720> everything<00:02:24.140> else

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
your arm then follows everything else

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.230 
your arm then follows everything else
now<00:02:24.590> if<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.740> get<00:02:24.860> this<00:02:25.040> connection<00:02:25.490> right<00:02:25.730> one

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
now if you get this connection right one

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.720 
now if you get this connection right one
two<00:02:26.630> bang<00:02:27.170> it'll<00:02:28.130> work

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
two bang it'll work

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.130 
two bang it'll work
I'll<00:02:28.970> show<00:02:29.180> what<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.390> mean<00:02:29.600> just<00:02:30.080> get<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.230> patio

like a Dave Jones pad we just start if

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.630 
like a Dave Jones pad we just start if
you<00:02:39.590> just<00:02:39.770> play<00:02:39.890> plays<00:02:40.100> you<00:02:40.250> just<00:02:40.430> start

putting it put it on your chest first
just<00:02:42.950> that<00:02:43.069> one<00:02:43.190> near<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.400> eyes<00:02:43.520> step<00:02:43.790> forward

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
just that one near the eyes step forward

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.850 
just that one near the eyes step forward
right<00:02:44.150> leg<00:02:44.330> forward<00:02:44.570> so<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.200> won't<00:02:45.410> hit<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.590> hard

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
right leg forward so I won't hit it hard

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
right leg forward so I won't hit it hard
okay

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
okay

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
okay
now<00:02:47.209> if<00:02:47.780> you<00:02:48.020> look<00:02:48.280> right<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:49.660> it's<00:02:50.660> from

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
now if you look right that it's from

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.479 
now if you look right that it's from
that<00:02:51.050> position<00:02:51.230> look<00:02:51.890> at<00:02:52.010> his<00:02:52.100> body<00:02:52.250> position

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
that position look at his body position

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.750 
that position look at his body position
I<00:02:52.940> know<00:02:53.000> intuitively<00:02:53.870> I<00:02:54.290> won't<00:02:55.280> hit<00:02:55.400> your<00:02:55.519> on

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
I know intuitively I won't hit your on

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.830 
I know intuitively I won't hit your on
I<00:02:55.790> know<00:02:56.030> intuitively<00:02:57.550> right<00:02:58.550> that<00:02:58.820> because<00:02:59.690> of

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
I know intuitively right that because of

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.740 
I know intuitively right that because of
its<00:02:59.959> body<00:03:00.170> position<00:03:00.680> position<00:03:01.480> just<00:03:02.480> from

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
its body position position just from

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.880 
its body position position just from
there<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.170> occur<00:03:04.840> that<00:03:05.840> will<00:03:06.230> take<00:03:06.500> him<00:03:06.680> out

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
there and occur that will take him out

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.479 
there and occur that will take him out
can<00:03:07.610> you<00:03:07.640> see<00:03:07.880> I'm<00:03:07.970> using<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.360> curve<00:03:08.600> now<00:03:09.489> feel

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
can you see I'm using the curve now feel

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:17.289 
can you see I'm using the curve now feel
that<00:03:10.720> if<00:03:11.720> we<00:03:11.900> slip<00:03:12.170> that<00:03:12.350> on<00:03:15.970> fine<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.120> leave

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
that if we slip that on fine you leave

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.800 
that if we slip that on fine you leave
it<00:03:17.450> there<00:03:18.519> look<00:03:19.519> at<00:03:19.670> your<00:03:19.820> target<00:03:20.090> position

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
it there look at your target position

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.500 
it there look at your target position
now<00:03:21.170> look<00:03:21.350> how<00:03:21.470> I'm<00:03:21.590> holding<00:03:21.739> that<00:03:22.010> pad<00:03:22.510> I'm

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
now look how I'm holding that pad I'm

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.120 
now look how I'm holding that pad I'm
not<00:03:23.750> getting<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.110> bloat<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.709> hold<00:03:24.829> that<00:03:24.950> pad

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
not getting the bloat to hold that pad

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.229 
not getting the bloat to hold that pad
because<00:03:25.280> if<00:03:25.370> I'm<00:03:25.489> getting<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.790> bloke<00:03:25.940> to<00:03:26.060> hold

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
because if I'm getting the bloke to hold

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.539 
because if I'm getting the bloke to hold
that<00:03:26.360> pad<00:03:26.630> there<00:03:26.900> it's<00:03:27.530> gonna<00:03:27.739> encourage<00:03:28.130> me

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
that pad there it's gonna encourage me

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.400 
that pad there it's gonna encourage me
to<00:03:30.459> do<00:03:31.459> that<00:03:31.670> type<00:03:31.910> of<00:03:31.940> thing

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
to do that type of thing

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.199 
to do that type of thing
okay<00:03:33.410> which<00:03:33.799> is<00:03:33.950> fair<00:03:34.160> enough<00:03:34.430> but<00:03:35.030> he's

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
okay which is fair enough but he's

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.830 
okay which is fair enough but he's
encouraging<00:03:35.870> me<00:03:36.110> to<00:03:36.350> use<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.489> muscle<00:03:37.970> in<00:03:38.780> the

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
encouraging me to use the muscle in the

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.900 
encouraging me to use the muscle in the
arm<00:03:39.019> that's<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:39.890> ever<00:03:40.190> much<00:03:40.489> our<00:03:40.700> white

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
arm that's it ever much our white

arm that's it ever much our white
training<00:03:41.239> whatever<00:03:41.360> -<00:03:41.600> and<00:03:41.630> that's<00:03:41.840> always

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
training whatever - and that's always

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.780 
training whatever - and that's always
going<00:03:42.140> to<00:03:42.200> be<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.350> shit<00:03:42.590> muscle<00:03:42.920> if<00:03:43.130> I'm<00:03:43.459> to<00:03:43.640> hit

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
going to be a shit muscle if I'm to hit

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.280 
going to be a shit muscle if I'm to hit
that<00:03:44.000> way<00:03:44.560> it's<00:03:45.560> got<00:03:45.739> to<00:03:45.769> come<00:03:46.010> down<00:03:46.040> with<00:03:47.290> with

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
that way it's got to come down with with

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.789 
that way it's got to come down with with
my<00:03:48.470> body<00:03:48.709> white<00:03:48.950> coz<00:03:49.610> theta<00:03:49.790> V<00:03:50.060> stands<00:03:50.420> there

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
my body white coz theta V stands there

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.030 
my body white coz theta V stands there
comes<00:03:51.799> in<00:03:52.690> comes<00:03:53.690> down<00:03:53.989> with<00:03:54.470> my<00:03:54.620> body<00:03:54.829> weight

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
comes in comes down with my body weight

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.850 
comes in comes down with my body weight
so<00:03:55.190> it's<00:03:55.340> curving<00:03:55.910> now<00:03:56.660> that's<00:03:57.440> a<00:03:57.590> strike

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
so it's curving now that's a strike

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.009 
so it's curving now that's a strike
front<00:03:58.280> punch<00:03:58.790> there's<00:03:59.510> only<00:03:59.630> a<00:03:59.720> cut<00:03:59.900> the
