and I explained that in this video here
how<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.340> tell<00:01:02.670> if<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.539> have<00:01:03.570> whether<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.170> ends

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
about my hair when it's in this state is

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.960 
about my hair when it's in this state is
that<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.290> allows<00:01:10.560> me<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.860> easily<00:01:12.080> search<00:01:13.080> for

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
that it allows me to easily search for

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.580 
that it allows me to easily search for
knots<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.630> usually<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.320> front<00:01:16.409> of

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
knots and I usually do that in front of

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.780 
knots and I usually do that in front of
television<00:01:17.900> or<00:01:18.900> here<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.130> bathroom<00:01:20.340> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
television or here in the bathroom and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.359 
television or here in the bathroom and
it's<00:01:21.360> not<00:01:21.540> something<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.960> do<00:01:22.020> all<00:01:22.470> at<00:01:22.890> once

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
it's not something I do all at once

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.700 
it's not something I do all at once
I<00:01:23.460> may<00:01:23.670> spend<00:01:24.500> like<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.770> few<00:01:26.270> hours<00:01:27.320> it<00:01:28.320> depends

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
I may spend like a few hours it depends

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.910 
I may spend like a few hours it depends
on<00:01:28.860> how<00:01:28.950> long<00:01:29.130> I've<00:01:29.869> look<00:01:30.869> through<00:01:31.259> them<00:01:31.500> okay

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
on how long I've look through them okay

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.870 
on how long I've look through them okay
because<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.549> slide<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.659> check<00:01:33.990> my<00:01:34.409> ends<00:01:34.950> all<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
because I slide to check my ends all the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.859 
because I slide to check my ends all the
time<00:01:36.150> but<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.200> probably<00:01:37.650> spend<00:01:38.509> every<00:01:39.509> three

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
time but I probably spend every three

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.510 
time but I probably spend every three
months<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.409> probably<00:01:40.650> spend<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> good<00:01:41.280> two<00:01:41.490> hours

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
months I probably spend a good two hours

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.289 
months I probably spend a good two hours
just<00:01:42.119> really<00:01:42.659> going<00:01:43.049> through<00:01:43.290> my<00:01:43.560> hair<00:01:43.920> and

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
just really going through my hair and

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.050 
just really going through my hair and
trimming<00:01:45.299> off<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.479> novice<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.939> you<00:01:47.939> know

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
trimming off the novice and you know

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.620 
trimming off the novice and you know
looking<00:01:48.390> for

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
looking for

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.480 
looking for
whether<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.930> ends<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.100> reason<00:01:50.369> why

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
whether it ends and the reason why

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.709 
whether it ends and the reason why
that's<00:01:50.640> important<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.810> because<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.680> can<00:01:53.039> help

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
that's important is because it can help

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:56.779 
that's important is because it can help
you<00:01:54.719> to<00:01:55.110> prevent<00:01:55.350> tangles<00:01:56.130> because<00:01:56.490> when<00:01:56.640> your

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
you to prevent tangles because when your

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
hair has lots of knots on the ends or if

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.359 
hair has lots of knots on the ends or if
the<00:01:59.789> edges<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.659> ends<00:02:00.960> are<00:02:01.140> whether<00:02:01.500> your<00:02:02.250> hair

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the edges the ends are whether your hair

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.310 
the edges the ends are whether your hair
is<00:02:02.429> more<00:02:02.729> likely<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.149> tangle<00:02:03.659> which<00:02:03.960> costs

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
is more likely to tangle which costs

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.039 
is more likely to tangle which costs
more<00:02:04.649> nuts<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.399> try<00:02:05.670> not<00:02:05.700> select<00:02:06.210> more<00:02:06.869> than

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
more nuts so try not select more than

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.139 
more nuts so try not select more than
three<00:02:07.289> months<00:02:07.439> go<00:02:07.740> by<00:02:07.770> without<00:02:08.580> doing<00:02:08.729> like<00:02:09.119> a

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
three months go by without doing like a

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.630 
three months go by without doing like a
thorough<00:02:09.630> check<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.380> then<00:02:10.560> what<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.739> do<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.190> it

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
thorough check and then what I do it it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.960 
thorough check and then what I do it it
really<00:02:12.000> feels<00:02:12.239> nice<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:14.190> know<00:02:14.310> but<00:02:14.880> again

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
really feels nice and you know but again

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.380 
really feels nice and you know but again
I've<00:02:15.720> trim<00:02:16.290> knots<00:02:16.590> as<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.250> see<00:02:17.640> them<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.360> know

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
I've trim knots as I see them you know

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.839 
I've trim knots as I see them you know
so<00:02:19.260> it's<00:02:19.410> kind<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.650> like<00:02:19.800> an<00:02:20.099> ongoing<00:02:20.370> thing

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
so it's kind of like an ongoing thing

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.509 
so it's kind of like an ongoing thing
but<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.330> one<00:02:21.510> thing<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.780> never<00:02:21.840> do<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:23.099> just

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
but the one thing I never do is just

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.059 
but the one thing I never do is just
trim<00:02:24.120> my<00:02:24.330> hair<00:02:24.540> haphazardly<00:02:25.470> now<00:02:25.860> that's

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
trim my hair haphazardly now that's

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.059 
trim my hair haphazardly now that's
totally<00:02:26.400> okay<00:02:27.060> if<00:02:27.450> you're<00:02:28.410> someone<00:02:28.860> who's

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
totally okay if you're someone who's

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.890 
totally okay if you're someone who's
looking<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.370> save<00:02:29.670> time<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.269> use<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.750> word

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
looking to save time I use the word

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.440 
looking to save time I use the word
haphazardly<00:02:31.680> because<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.549> means<00:02:32.760> kind<00:02:33.330> of

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
haphazardly because it means kind of

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.780 
haphazardly because it means kind of
like<00:02:33.569> just<00:02:33.810> trimming<00:02:34.230> anything<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.920> don't<00:02:35.670> mean

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
like just trimming anything I don't mean

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.479 
like just trimming anything I don't mean
to<00:02:35.819> put<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.060> negative<00:02:36.630> connotation<00:02:36.989> on<00:02:37.769> it<00:02:37.950> it's

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
to put a negative connotation on it it's

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.640 
to put a negative connotation on it it's
only<00:02:38.640> because<00:02:38.880> length<00:02:39.599> you're<00:02:40.140> retaining

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
only because length you're retaining

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.650 
only because length you're retaining
length<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.190> important<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.730> me<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.299> I<00:02:42.360> say

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
length is important to me that I say

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.350 
length is important to me that I say
tentatively<00:02:43.560> but<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.519> can<00:02:44.760> understand<00:02:45.269> people

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
tentatively but I can understand people

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.530 
tentatively but I can understand people
who<00:02:45.780> want<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.799> more<00:02:47.010> neater<00:02:47.370> appearance<00:02:47.640> like

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
who want a more neater appearance like

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.000 
who want a more neater appearance like
for<00:02:48.780> people<00:02:49.049> who<00:02:49.170> like<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.440> wear<00:02:49.650> their<00:02:49.829> hair

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
straight sometimes I can totally

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.349 
straight sometimes I can totally
understand<00:02:52.140> why<00:02:52.799> you<00:02:52.859> will<00:02:53.489> trim<00:02:53.940> your<00:02:54.090> hair

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
understand why you will trim your hair

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.509 
understand why you will trim your hair
evenly<00:02:54.780> but<00:02:55.260> for<00:02:55.440> me<00:02:55.590> since<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.010> wear<00:02:56.190> my<00:02:56.310> hair

evenly but for me since I wear my hair

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:57.470 
evenly but for me since I wear my hair
in<00:02:56.609> a<00:02:56.700> natural<00:02:56.730> state

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
in a natural state

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.240 
in a natural state
and<00:02:57.750> natural<00:02:58.049> kinky<00:02:58.319> state<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.980> doesn't

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
and natural kinky state it doesn't

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.009 
and natural kinky state it doesn't
really<00:02:59.400> matter<00:02:59.670> so<00:02:59.819> much<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.540> can<00:03:00.750> deal<00:03:00.780> with
