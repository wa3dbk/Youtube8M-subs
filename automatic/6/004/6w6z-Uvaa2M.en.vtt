00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.830
 hello everyone is the territories and I'm here 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.240
 to present our top model 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.150
 of the 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.170
 as regards 29 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.740
 this bicycle is the ribot 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.690
 horse or celebrity 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.359
 the bicycle they are using 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.180
 andrea piperis vena calvetti e della 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.450
 Verona 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.280
 and now welcome 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.620
 first the frame is a monocoque 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.620
 in carbon with international 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.530
 weighing 1,200 grams 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.020
 the opaque color 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.590
 as geometry we have 70 degrees 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.790
 in the front 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.790
 33 to the rear are 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.500
 and then we reported in the whole 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.170
 our line 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.430
 300 mm of travel 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.430
 we are in charge 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.220
 me and the integrated actors and in the tube 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.220
 oblique 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.159
 we have the port mount on the fort 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.370
 horizontal from 160 here 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.070
 and we have 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.850
 the conical fork a few months a 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.850
 inch to eighth 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.960
 added 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.730
 practically not a lot of content 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.550
 technological but we tried to 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.110
 look a lot at the substance 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.910
 in particular the 29 ha model 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.910
 need to still have lightness 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.030
 so we kept qr 9 al 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.130
 rear that gives lightness 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.289
 all 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.780
 the frame to the bicycle in his 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.759
 together but we put the heart 15 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.360
 at the front then the passing axis which 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.420
 gives a lot of precision 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.770
 and stability 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.560
 I would say these on the features 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.989
 main features of this bike 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.280
 also given the excellent results because 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.280
 the guys who used it
