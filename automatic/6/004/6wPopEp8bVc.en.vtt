00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.270
 I spent a lot of time cantil 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.999
 comfort looking for suitable music 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.390
 For each cycle, the 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:10.390
 music 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.119
 Well Kanaeva manages to show how 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.529
 veteranÃ­a to know to be in every moment 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.540
 what would it be like with the environment 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.510
 smile already smiles but now you have to 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.280
 be at what is 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.280
 great you imagined 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.790
 it's good that the music was over 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.740
 fabulously 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.960
 and this function totally on the way to 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.790
 enjoy a lot the tape too 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.590
 you remove the first exercise has been the 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.770
 that has been a little bit more outside but 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.040
 the truth is that both the terminations 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.750
 of turns is not doing them with much 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.220
 more precision than the latest 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.490
 competitions that I could see from 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.490
 flat 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.060
 what claw has if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.530
 music also very difficult is the 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.370
 consecration of the spring 'de georges 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.370
 it's also that if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.690
 if it is difficult to adapt because we have 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.030
 a minute and a half really still has 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.360
 a descent and a climb after music 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:48.910
 and look for the remaining fragments 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.910
 well they were not very funny subjects
