00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.400
 who of you has always been upset 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.230
 with a labor day to heat we already 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.120
 and rockstar games brings you this 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.120
 dream a whole lot closer 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.510
 at slow speed through the city 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.519
 you will discover many small details in the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.350
 first moment we thought this looks 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.420
 yes, like in gta 4 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.470
 the similarity to rockstar's pearl comes 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.269
 not without reason 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.880
 since both games from the same publisher 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.920
 it is close to the in-house engine 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.840
 rage uses accordingly revised 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.000
 the perfect engine for a racing game 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.000
 midnight club los angeles suitable 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.340
 since the beginning of the series course in midnight 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.110
 play club traditionally with yours 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.970
 Cars through replicas of large 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.340
 cities and denies illegal ones 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:01:00.220
 road racing the stripe car always in 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:04.920
 Eye was one thing it was always the same 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.920
 midnight and thus always pitch black 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.620
 with the latest game of the series brings 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.270
 rockstar but not in the dark because with 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.640
 Los angeles there is a dynamic 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.320
 day night and weather change 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.330
 For example, he found one at night 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.710
 race on and later in the 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.700
 race then still sees the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.510
 sunrise really cool 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.970
 Of course, that's not the only one 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.710
 The replica of Los Angeles 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.930
 is bigger and more realistic than ever 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.700
 two rockstar games not the complete one 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.530
 rebuilt city but which are important 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.560
 start and sights like 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.190
 Example of Santa Monica Boulevard 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.410
 of course available 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.270
 through numerous passers-by and others 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.340
 the traffic becomes the virtual 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.340
 Los Angeles is very lively 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.280
 for a better orientation , the cow calls 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.600
 made overview card on the camera 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.340
 zooms in for the card view without 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.650
 problems out of the city and shows 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.060
 you the whole metropolis in 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.640
 satellite view on request can be 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.410
 also street names show cars you 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.000
 to punish or challenge racing series 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.380
 could be with a special one 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.210
 symbol marked 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.160
 if you have marked one of the objects 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.120
 directs you to a directional arrow 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.100
 desired goal 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.840
 if you are at the desired goal since 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.540
 the opponent with a colored symbol 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.340
 marked to start a race 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.080
 if you give the opponent only one 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.830
 hellhupe and can the race already 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.660
 start 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.360
 the question for the middle block going on 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.680
 angeles is simply good at what 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.720
 can suspend the control 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.510
 be calm because the control is 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.520
 completely new assignable partially 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.930
 it turns out to be difficult first 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.670
 driving through the goal that often 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.710
 Occurs that one just before the goal 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.600
 accidentally an autograph and so on 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.910
 guidance on the last meters there yet 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.390
 out of hand 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.350
 we come to the special skills 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.090
 especially handsome is the 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.890
 cockpit view e-cars that 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.989
 true to the original has been adjusted 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.390
 and that's exactly what the actual thing did 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.390
 harsh game gives a predator realism 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.409
 with the action view you are again 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.280
 good advice if also with lies 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:15.629
 spectacular camera settings are available 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.040
 we come to the car shop in midnight 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:21.049
 club los angeles 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.049
 we would have a great sports car 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:32.870
 motorcycles oldtimer convertibles 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.719
 and of course many more 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.420
 priceless vehicles in real life 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:42.420
 and thus the garage is full 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.090
 but in the game are the bodies too 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.830
 not really affordable but up 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.840
 in any case, the money in the game 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.850
 easier to obtain than in reality 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.220
 so that could then rush into the garage 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.640
 euro auctions or buy a new one 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.830
 now something to the topic of tuning each 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.630
 namely, vehicle can be up to a 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.210
 certain maximum level in many 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.430
 do categories but that 's it then 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.440
 continue even from the management team but 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.260
 the optics tuning it all the more 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.580
 Extensive extra time 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.650
 her in the paint or sled 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.960
 Partially there are real ones 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.660
 artworks out there you can countless 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.590
 use forms and whole 16 layers 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.590
 Spray paint 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.949
 although the game is already a few years old 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.740
 we're awarded nine out of ten gaming 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:46.199
 stars an and midnight club los angeles 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.210
 our conclusion rockstar games has with 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.919
 a flap los angeles a very good one 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.990

 variety and above all love for 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:58.770
