what's up guys today I have a video on
how<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:03.350> actually<00:00:04.350> fix<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:06.500> speed<00:00:07.500> studio

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
how to actually fix the speed studio

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.850 
how to actually fix the speed studio
beats<00:00:08.490> by<00:00:08.730> dre<00:00:08.790> studios<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:10.290> original<00:00:10.710> ones

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
beats by dre studios the original ones

beats by dre studios the original ones
and<00:00:11.389> this<00:00:12.389> right<00:00:12.690> speaker<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.230> working<00:00:13.410> but

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
and this right speaker is working but

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.609 
and this right speaker is working but
the<00:00:14.340> left<00:00:14.610> one<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.330> took<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.540> apart<00:00:15.809> look

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
the left one is so I took it apart look

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.470 
the left one is so I took it apart look
at<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:16.949> looks<00:00:17.160> pretty<00:00:17.430> fine<00:00:17.670> looks<00:00:18.210> fine<00:00:18.449> and

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
at it looks pretty fine looks fine and

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.269 
at it looks pretty fine looks fine and
stuff<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.650> wanted<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.890> see<00:00:20.039> if<00:00:20.130> there's

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
stuff and so I wanted to see if there's

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.019 
stuff and so I wanted to see if there's
any<00:00:20.400> voltage<00:00:20.580> coming<00:00:21.119> out<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.330> these<00:00:21.420> AB<00:00:23.029> wires

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
any voltage coming out of these AB wires

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.450 
any voltage coming out of these AB wires
here<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:25.260> make<00:00:25.410> sure<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:26.180> this<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.570> not<00:00:28.460> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
here to make sure that this is not the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.540 
here to make sure that this is not the
solder<00:00:29.730> hasn't<00:00:30.150> gone<00:00:30.210> bad<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:31.019> um<00:00:31.340> what<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.369> did

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
solder hasn't gone bad so um what I did

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.290 
solder hasn't gone bad so um what I did
was<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.820> took<00:00:32.850> my<00:00:33.030> bowl<00:00:33.270> cleaner<00:00:33.719> let's<00:00:34.410> regular

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
was I took my bowl cleaner let's regular

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.729 
was I took my bowl cleaner let's regular
voltage<00:00:36.300> meter<00:00:36.710> and<00:00:39.290> well<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.320> was<00:00:40.530> trying<00:00:40.710> to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
voltage meter and well I was trying to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.560 
voltage meter and well I was trying to
test<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:42.410> see<00:00:43.640> if<00:00:44.640> anything<00:00:45.030> was<00:00:45.149> coming<00:00:45.450> out

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
test and see if anything was coming out

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.889 
test and see if anything was coming out
just<00:00:45.750> by<00:00:45.930> putting<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.379> right<00:00:46.620> here<00:00:47.899> because

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
just by putting this right here because

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.709 
just by putting this right here because
this<00:00:49.050> speaker<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.559> not<00:00:49.590> working<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.360> it

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
this speaker is not working but it it

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.439 
this speaker is not working but it it
fixed<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.350> speaker<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.129> touch<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.640> metal

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
fixed the speaker and I touch the metal

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.500 
fixed the speaker and I touch the metal
to<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> back<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:56.210> mess<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.390> these

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
to the back of it like mess with these

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.410 
to the back of it like mess with these
wires<00:00:58.640> it's<00:00:59.640> not<00:00:59.789> working<00:01:00.059> right<00:01:00.180> now<00:01:00.390> and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
wires it's not working right now and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:10.899 
wires it's not working right now and
then<00:01:05.630> now<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:06.780> working<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:08.510> have<00:01:09.510> no<00:01:09.840> idea<00:01:10.200> why

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
then now it's working I have no idea why

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.070 
then now it's working I have no idea why
but<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:11.939> some<00:01:12.150> reason<00:01:12.540> when<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.689> touch<00:01:12.930> this

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
but for some reason when I touch this

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.370 
but for some reason when I touch this
metal<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> there<00:01:14.330> it<00:01:15.330> turned<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:18.229> if<00:01:19.229> you

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
metal to there it turned on so if you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.160 
metal to there it turned on so if you
guys<00:01:19.530> are<00:01:19.590> complaining<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:21.020> cleaning<00:01:22.020> out

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
guys are complaining that cleaning out

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.020 
guys are complaining that cleaning out
your<00:01:22.310> ears<00:01:23.310> inside<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.119> your<00:01:24.240> um<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:25.229> plug<00:01:26.030> the

that<00:01:31.860> worked<00:01:32.100> for<00:01:32.310> me<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.820> took<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.900> apart<00:01:34.170> was

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that worked for me so took it apart was

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.710 
that worked for me so took it apart was
gonna<00:01:34.590> buy<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> new<00:01:34.920> speaker<00:01:35.340> save<00:01:36.030> 30<00:01:36.270> bucks<00:01:36.479> by

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
gonna buy a new speaker save 30 bucks by

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.810 
gonna buy a new speaker save 30 bucks by
just<00:01:36.930> seeing<00:01:37.860> if<00:01:37.979> any<00:01:38.100> voltage<00:01:38.310> came<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.729> of

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
just seeing if any voltage came out of

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.749 
just seeing if any voltage came out of
here<00:01:38.909> touched<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.420> metal<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.759> I

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
here touched it metal to this and I

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.120 
here touched it metal to this and I
think<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.390> might<00:01:42.630> need<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.020> voltage<00:01:43.380> meter<00:01:43.590> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
think you might need a voltage meter and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.780 
think you might need a voltage meter and
it<00:01:44.850> has<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.240> be<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.960> don't<00:01:46.320> know<00:01:46.409> what<00:01:46.790> what

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
it has to be on I don't know what what

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.370 
it has to be on I don't know what what
goes<00:01:48.149> through<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> metal<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.200> voltage

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
goes through the metal in the voltage

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.990 
goes through the metal in the voltage
meter<00:01:49.680> but<00:01:49.920> here's<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.520> regular<00:01:51.829> kind<00:01:52.829> of

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
meter but here's just a regular kind of

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.899 
meter but here's just a regular kind of
screwdriver<00:01:54.000> plane<00:01:54.869> screwdriver

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:04.140 

I<00:01:57.939> tried<00:01:58.810> touching<00:01:59.260> it<00:02:01.799> except<00:02:02.970> it<00:02:03.970> does

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
I tried touching it except it does

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:12.900 
I tried touching it except it does
nothing<00:02:10.350> yeah<00:02:11.350> nothing<00:02:11.709> happens<00:02:12.130> it's<00:02:12.790> only

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
nothing yeah nothing happens it's only

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.100 
nothing yeah nothing happens it's only
with<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.150> voltage<00:02:13.480> meter

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
with the voltage meter

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:23.910 
with the voltage meter
I<00:02:14.430> took<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.670> patas<00:02:16.000> positive<00:02:16.600> side<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:22.920> turn

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
I took the patas positive side and turn

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:35.400 
I took the patas positive side and turn
off<00:02:26.940> by<00:02:27.940> just<00:02:27.970> tapping<00:02:28.300> on<00:02:28.630> some<00:02:34.290> then<00:02:35.290> I

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
off by just tapping on some then I

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.620 
off by just tapping on some then I
touched<00:02:36.100> it<00:02:36.310> again<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:36.850> just<00:02:37.030> turns<00:02:37.390> back

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
touched it again and it just turns back

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.600 
touched it again and it just turns back
on<00:02:37.660> so<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:39.569> have<00:02:40.569> no<00:02:40.810> idea<00:02:40.840> how<00:02:41.200> this<00:02:41.319> works<00:02:41.620> but

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
on so I have no idea how this works but

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.940 
on so I have no idea how this works but
that<00:02:43.030> probably<00:02:43.300> helps<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.569> lot<00:02:43.720> of<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:43.989> because

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
that probably helps a lot of you because

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.350 
that probably helps a lot of you because
I<00:02:45.040> know<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.190> lot<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.519> have<00:02:45.760> problems<00:02:46.180> with

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
I know a lot of you have problems with

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.240 
I know a lot of you have problems with
the<00:02:46.540> studios<00:02:47.350> how<00:02:47.530> you're<00:02:47.709> left<00:02:47.860> here<00:02:48.010> isn't

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
the studios how you're left here isn't
