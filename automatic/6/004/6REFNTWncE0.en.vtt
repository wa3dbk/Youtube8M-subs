happen<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.840> gnomes<00:02:17.780> okay<00:02:18.780> underneath

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
happen to the gnomes okay underneath

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.120 
happen to the gnomes okay underneath
that<00:02:19.440> we<00:02:20.160> have<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.989> counters<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.650> think<00:02:23.069> these

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
that we have the counters I think these

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.180 
that we have the counters I think these
are<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.340> counters<00:02:23.700> for<00:02:23.970> for<00:02:24.930> moving<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.290> the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
are the counters for for moving the the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.800 
are the counters for for moving the the
time<00:02:26.400> clock<00:02:26.610> which<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.120> believe<00:02:27.360> goes<00:02:27.599> around

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
time clock which I believe goes around

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.979 
time clock which I believe goes around
the<00:02:27.930> outside<00:02:27.989> of<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.590> board<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.810> last<00:02:30.810> but

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
the outside of the board and last but

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.030 
the outside of the board and last but
not<00:02:31.230> least<00:02:31.970> we<00:02:32.970> have<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.150> actual<00:02:34.040> player

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
not least we have the actual player

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.670 
not least we have the actual player
tokens<00:02:35.549> which<00:02:36.269> are<00:02:36.569> moans<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:38.790> red<00:02:39.180> dye<00:02:39.680> ten

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
tokens which are moans and a red dye ten

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.330 
tokens which are moans and a red dye ten
sided<00:02:41.040> die<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.280> move<00:02:41.640> as<00:02:41.819> well<00:02:42.470> okay<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:44.069> that's

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
sided die to move as well okay so that's

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.199 
sided die to move as well okay so that's
my<00:02:44.549> unboxing<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.420> red<00:02:46.079> November<00:02:47.090> thanks<00:02:48.090> for
