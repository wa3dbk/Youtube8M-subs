00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
because there's a headset pair then we

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.780 
because there's a headset pair then we
put<00:02:43.090> everything<00:02:43.270> back<00:02:43.510> together<00:02:44.730> just<00:02:45.730> a

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
put everything back together just a
