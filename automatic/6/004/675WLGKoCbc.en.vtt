00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
lot easier to do but whether it'll be in

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
lot easier to do but whether it'll be in
game<00:01:53.549> or<00:01:53.729> not<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.060> still<00:01:54.360> up<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.659> air<00:01:54.750> which

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
game or not is still up in the air which

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.410 
game or not is still up in the air which
i'm<00:01:55.409> i'm<00:01:55.860> hoping<00:01:56.460> they<00:01:56.579> do<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:56.939> game<00:01:57.119> really

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
i'm i'm hoping they do it in game really

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.840 
i'm i'm hoping they do it in game really
because<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.110> know<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:59.100> game<00:01:59.340> would<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.579> just

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
because you know in game would be just

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.730 
because you know in game would be just
ten<00:02:00.030> times<00:02:00.270> easier<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.750> website<00:02:01.140> below<00:02:01.469> who

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
ten times easier the website below who

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.190 
ten times easier the website below who
gives<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.070> crap<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.939> having<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.600> in-game

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
gives a crap but having the in-game

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.870 
gives a crap but having the in-game
skin-changer<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.100> having<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.460> know<00:02:05.549> skin

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
skin-changer and having you know skin

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.920 
skin-changer and having you know skin

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
packs and that kind of stuff would

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.420 
packs and that kind of stuff would
