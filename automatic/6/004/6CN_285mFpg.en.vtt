so effective both internally and
externally<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:30.480> sisal<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.810> reason<00:02:32.170> is<00:02:32.319> that

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
externally a sisal the reason is that

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.440 
externally a sisal the reason is that
solicit<00:02:33.040> acid<00:02:33.400> gel<00:02:33.609> has<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.879> capacity<00:02:34.030> to

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
solicit acid gel has the capacity to

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
hold a lot of water and it could absorb

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.849 
hold a lot of water and it could absorb
not<00:02:36.879> only<00:02:37.150> water<00:02:37.329> but<00:02:37.510> also<00:02:38.079> wound<00:02:38.290> secretions

not only water but also wound secretions

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.099 
not only water but also wound secretions
so<00:02:39.310> it's<00:02:39.459> very<00:02:39.609> suitable<00:02:39.909> for<00:02:40.180> internal<00:02:40.900> and

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109
