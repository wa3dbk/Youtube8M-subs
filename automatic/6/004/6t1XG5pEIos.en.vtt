00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
star fast to emulate tablet PC and

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.540 
star fast to emulate tablet PC and
tablet<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:32.119> portable<00:01:33.119> devices<00:01:34.100> like<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.340> so

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
tablet and portable devices like that so

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.340 
tablet and portable devices like that so
basically<00:01:35.910> I<00:01:36.030> way<00:01:36.300> it<00:01:36.360> says<00:01:36.600> here<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.140> just

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
basically I way it says here it's just

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.499 
basically I way it says here it's just
that<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.800> saves<00:01:38.280> some<00:01:38.460> kind<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.790> system<00:01:39.210> file

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
that it saves some kind of system file

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.590 
that it saves some kind of system file
and<00:01:40.020> when<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.290> shut<00:01:40.500> down<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:42.210> what<00:01:42.330> I<00:01:42.360> mean

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
and when you shut down and what I mean

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.330 
and when you shut down and what I mean
is<00:01:42.720> I'm<00:01:42.840> assuming<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.380> means<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.920> doesn't

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
is I'm assuming it means that it doesn't

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.279 
is I'm assuming it means that it doesn't
really<00:01:44.430> fully<00:01:44.729> shut<00:01:45.090> down<00:01:45.330> like<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.930> sort<00:01:46.200> of

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
really fully shut down like it sort of

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.340 
really fully shut down like it sort of
shut<00:01:46.470> down<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:46.979> like<00:01:47.340> when<00:01:47.580> you<00:01:47.670> hibernate<00:01:48.350> so

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
shut down but like when you hibernate so

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.160 
shut down but like when you hibernate so
anyway<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:49.920> uncheck<00:01:50.910> that<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.479> you

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
anyway so just uncheck that and you

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.600 
anyway so just uncheck that and you
could<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.470> able<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.649> start<00:01:52.800> a<00:01:52.860> bit<00:01:53.039> slower<00:01:53.280> but

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
could be able to start a bit slower but

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.660 
could be able to start a bit slower but
you'll<00:01:53.759> get<00:01:53.910> your<00:01:54.060> start<00:01:54.330> pounds<00:01:55.020> again

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
you'll get your start pounds again

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.290 
you'll get your start pounds again
that's<00:01:56.670> about<00:01:56.820> it

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
that's about it

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.999 
that's about it
