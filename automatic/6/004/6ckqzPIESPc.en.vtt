00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
black but that's a good neutral that I

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.970 
black but that's a good neutral that I
used<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.850> many<00:00:45.000> times<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.530> floral

landscapes<00:00:51.590> you'll<00:00:52.590> see<00:00:52.829> me<00:00:52.980> using<00:00:53.190> some

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
landscapes you'll see me using some

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.760 
landscapes you'll see me using some
variant<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.660> looked<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.410> leaned<00:00:55.649> it

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
variant of that it looked if I leaned it

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.380 
variant of that it looked if I leaned it
a<00:00:55.800> little<00:00:55.949> bit<00:00:56.129> towards<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> brown<00:00:56.760> by<00:00:57.059> adding

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
a little bit towards the brown by adding

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
the green in the red and if i wanted to

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.549 
the green in the red and if i wanted to
lean<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> little<00:01:00.780> more<00:01:01.109> towards<00:01:01.410> blue<00:01:03.350> that's<00:01:04.350> a

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
lean a little more towards blue that's a

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.580 
lean a little more towards blue that's a
tremendous<00:01:04.830> shadow<00:01:05.460> color<00:01:09.260> but<00:01:10.260> all<00:01:10.409> these

under<00:01:13.439> themselves<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.100> use<00:01:14.400> every<00:01:14.610> now

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
under themselves that I use every now

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.070 
under themselves that I use every now
and<00:01:15.090> then<00:01:15.210> I'll<00:01:15.390> make<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> shadow<00:01:16.619> mixture

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
and then I'll make a shadow mixture

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.469 
and then I'll make a shadow mixture

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
yellow and usually in this in those

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.809 
yellow and usually in this in those
background<00:02:12.200> areas<00:02:12.500> i'll<00:02:12.650> use<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.190> the

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
background areas i'll use the the

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.869 
background areas i'll use the the
mixture<00:02:14.239> of<00:02:14.390> these<00:02:14.540> three<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.730> can

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
mixture of these three so you can

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.400 
mixture of these three so you can
remember<00:02:17.150> them<00:02:17.390> because<00:02:17.720> it's<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.019> optical

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
remember them because it's the optical
