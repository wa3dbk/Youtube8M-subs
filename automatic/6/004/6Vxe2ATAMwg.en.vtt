00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:35.219 
and this rectangle is a little bit vague
these<00:06:32.440> rectangles<00:06:33.100> I<00:06:33.479> say<00:06:34.479> rectangles<00:06:35.050> funny

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:35.229 
these rectangles I say rectangles funny

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
you can just cut those off and do exact

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.590 
you can just cut those off and do exact
measurement<00:06:41.500> if<00:06:41.650> you<00:06:41.800> want<00:06:42.010> and<00:06:42.330> so<00:06:43.330> this<00:06:43.450> is

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
measurement if you want and so this is

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.270 
measurement if you want and so this is
basically<00:06:43.720> the<00:06:44.110> base<00:06:44.500> of<00:06:44.710> there<00:06:44.950> you<00:06:45.039> can<00:06:45.190> you

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
basically the base of there you can you

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.170 
basically the base of there you can you
read<00:06:45.400> house<00:06:45.550> and<00:06:45.729> you're<00:06:45.820> going<00:06:45.910> to<00:06:45.970> cover
