00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
this is a very tough but our strategy

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.550 
this is a very tough but our strategy
was<00:05:05.480> trying<00:05:05.690> to<00:05:05.750> get<00:05:05.840> around<00:05:06.080> behind<00:05:06.230> him

was trying to get around behind him
around<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.830> side<00:05:07.040> I<00:05:07.310> think<00:05:07.580> if<00:05:07.700> we<00:05:07.790> had<00:05:07.910> done

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
around the side I think if we had done

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.490 
around the side I think if we had done
that<00:05:08.090> even<00:05:08.540> once<00:05:08.720> we<00:05:08.960> could<00:05:09.050> have<00:05:09.170> had<00:05:09.260> our<00:05:09.380> way

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
that even once we could have had our way

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.050 
that even once we could have had our way
and<00:05:09.710> push<00:05:09.830> them<00:05:09.980> all<00:05:10.070> around<00:05:10.190> the<00:05:10.370> ring<00:05:10.580> they

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
and push them all around the ring they

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.280 
and push them all around the ring they
made<00:05:11.270> sure<00:05:11.390> that<00:05:11.570> never<00:05:11.750> happened<00:05:12.200> they<00:05:12.260> just

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
made sure that never happened they just

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.200 
made sure that never happened they just
kept<00:05:12.590> coming<00:05:12.770> at<00:05:13.010> us<00:05:13.040> with<00:05:13.310> that<00:05:13.430> claw<00:05:13.700> and

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.660 
they even though they didn't do a lot of
damage<00:05:15.680> to<00:05:15.980> us<00:05:16.100> we<00:05:16.250> never<00:05:16.370> had<00:05:16.580> the

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
damage to us we never had the

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.100 
damage to us we never had the
opportunity<00:05:17.180> to<00:05:17.240> inflict<00:05:17.420> any<00:05:17.600> on<00:05:17.810> them<00:05:17.960> you

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
opportunity to inflict any on them you

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.150 
opportunity to inflict any on them you
think<00:05:18.260> you<00:05:18.320> could<00:05:18.470> have<00:05:18.560> made<00:05:18.710> more<00:05:18.920> of<00:05:19.070> your

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
think you could have made more of your

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.320 
think you could have made more of your
weight<00:05:19.340> advantage<00:05:19.520> there<00:05:20.030> because<00:05:20.180> you're<00:05:20.300> a

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
weight advantage there because you're a

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.630 
weight advantage there because you're a
lot<00:05:20.510> heavier<00:05:21.050> than<00:05:21.380> the<00:05:21.530> razor<00:05:21.710> robot<00:05:22.160> but<00:05:22.580> it

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
lot heavier than the razor robot but it

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.220 
lot heavier than the razor robot but it
didn't<00:05:22.880> seem<00:05:22.970> to<00:05:23.120> match<00:05:23.300> it<00:05:23.480> in<00:05:23.570> the<00:05:23.660> end<00:05:23.780> no

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
didn't seem to match it in the end no

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.900 
didn't seem to match it in the end no
