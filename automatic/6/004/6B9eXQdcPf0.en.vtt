I<00:03:01.620> see<00:03:01.860> this<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.250> kind<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.489> think<00:03:02.610> oh<00:03:02.670> my

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
I see this and I kind of think oh my

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.400

gosh<00:03:02.880> I'm<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:03.150> petite<00:03:03.420> but<00:03:03.569> easy<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.870> use<00:03:04.080> well

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
gosh I'm so petite but easy to use well

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.750 
gosh I'm so petite but easy to use well
it's<00:03:04.650> very<00:03:04.799> easy<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.160> that's<00:03:05.310> another<00:03:05.519> big

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
it's very easy and that's another big

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.640 
it's very easy and that's another big
advantage<00:03:05.880> of<00:03:06.299> it<00:03:06.420> because<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.989> large<00:03:07.230> unit

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
advantage of it because the large unit

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.380 
advantage of it because the large unit
sits<00:03:07.860> out<00:03:08.040> in<00:03:08.069> your<00:03:08.459> garage<00:03:08.640> or<00:03:09.090> out<00:03:09.209> in<00:03:09.330> your

well<00:03:39.870> absolutely<00:03:40.079> and<00:03:40.500> it's<00:03:40.799> not<00:03:40.950> only

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
well absolutely and it's not only

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.500 
well absolutely and it's not only
moisture<00:03:41.310> that's<00:03:41.700> very<00:03:41.880> important<00:03:42.359> but<00:03:42.420> you

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
moisture that's very important but you

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
and so forth so I mean the ultimate way

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.330 
and so forth so I mean the ultimate way
to<00:03:46.079> go<00:03:46.290> is<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.560> whole<00:03:46.950> house<00:03:47.190> ventilation

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
to go is a whole house ventilation

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.059 
to go is a whole house ventilation
system<00:03:48.329> and<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:49.079> systems<00:03:49.440> are<00:03:49.590> very<00:03:49.769> small

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
system and the systems are very small

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.069 
system and the systems are very small
they're<00:03:50.280> very<00:03:50.459> easy<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:51.090> have<00:03:51.480> installed<00:03:51.870> by<00:03:52.049> a

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
they're very easy to have installed by a

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.110 
they're very easy to have installed by a
professional<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.920> essentially<00:03:53.609> not<00:03:53.760> only<00:03:54.030> is

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
professional and essentially not only is

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.849 
professional and essentially not only is
it<00:03:54.269> exhausting<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.170> air<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.410> needs<00:03:55.650> to

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
it exhausting the air it needs to

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.430 
it exhausting the air it needs to
exhaust<00:03:56.250> it's<00:03:56.609> also<00:03:56.850> bringing<00:03:57.389> fresh<00:03:57.870> air<00:03:58.139> in

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
exhaust it's also bringing fresh air in

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.770 
exhaust it's also bringing fresh air in
and<00:03:58.739> balancing<00:03:59.609> that<00:03:59.760> so<00:03:59.970> that<00:04:00.120> it's<00:04:00.329> not<00:04:00.480> just

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
and balancing that so that it's not just

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.559 
and balancing that so that it's not just
all<00:04:01.319> air<00:04:01.680> going<00:04:02.040> out<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.519> it'll<00:04:03.060> even<00:04:03.209> during

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
all air going out and it'll even during

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.990 
all air going out and it'll even during
cold<00:04:03.810> weather<00:04:03.989> it'll<00:04:04.470> even<00:04:04.620> heat<00:04:05.489> that<00:04:05.790> air

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
cold weather it'll even heat that air

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.690 
cold weather it'll even heat that air
coming<00:04:06.420> back<00:04:06.690> in<00:04:07.019> recovery<00:04:07.920> unit<00:04:08.340> so<00:04:08.670> that

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
coming back in recovery unit so that

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.490 
coming back in recovery unit so that
you're<00:04:09.030> not<00:04:09.329> wasting<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.959> lot<00:04:10.079> of<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.290> energy

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
you're not wasting a lot of the energy

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.340 
you're not wasting a lot of the energy
so<00:04:11.069> ultimately<00:04:11.609> that's<00:04:12.329> the<00:04:12.569> way<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.780> go<00:04:12.989> these

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
so ultimately that's the way to go these

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.050 
so ultimately that's the way to go these
other<00:04:13.590> areas<00:04:13.769> of<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.220> home<00:04:14.430> if<00:04:14.700> you<00:04:14.910> don't

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
other areas of the home if you don't

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.300 
other areas of the home if you don't
have<00:04:15.359> a<00:04:15.630> good<00:04:15.989> bath<00:04:16.200> fin<00:04:16.560> if<00:04:16.919> you<00:04:17.010> don't<00:04:17.160> have<00:04:17.280> a

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
have a good bath fin if you don't have a

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.099 
have a good bath fin if you don't have a
good<00:04:17.489> range<00:04:17.669> hood<00:04:18.000> vented<00:04:18.479> all<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.959> way<00:04:19.049> to

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
good range hood vented all the way to

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.870 
good range hood vented all the way to
the<00:04:19.229> outside<00:04:19.350> not<00:04:19.889> just<00:04:20.100> in<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.340> Attic<00:04:20.700> good

the outside not just in the Attic good

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.850 
the outside not just in the Attic good
point<00:04:21.060> then<00:04:21.359> these<00:04:21.510> are<00:04:21.570> good<00:04:22.229> steps<00:04:22.440> that<00:04:22.740> you

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
point then these are good steps that you

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.409 
point then these are good steps that you
can<00:04:22.950> take<00:04:23.010> those<00:04:23.220> baby<00:04:23.460> steps<00:04:23.550> before<00:04:24.030> you

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
can take those baby steps before you
