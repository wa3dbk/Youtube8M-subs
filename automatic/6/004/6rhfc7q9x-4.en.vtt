for 10 years so but what it's doing now

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.320 
for 10 years so but what it's doing now
is<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.770> it<00:01:04.949> pulling<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.550> power<00:01:05.910> from<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
is that it pulling in power from the

ready<00:01:09.300> to<00:01:09.479> go<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:10.380> know<00:01:10.500> push<00:01:11.340> power<00:01:11.580> out<00:01:11.880> on

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
ready to go you know push power out on

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.270 
ready to go you know push power out on
the<00:01:12.240> ground<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.840> has<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> two<00:01:13.740> way<00:01:14.430> to

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
the ground so it has a two way to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.790 
the ground so it has a two way to
capability<00:01:17.280> minute<00:01:17.880> three<00:01:18.240> has<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.930> same<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
capability minute three has the same and

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.290 
capability minute three has the same and
you<00:01:20.190> can<00:01:20.369> kind<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.670> see<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:21.030> looks<00:01:21.210> very

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
you can kind of see it looks very

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.870 
you can kind of see it looks very
similar<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.160> you<00:01:23.160> know<00:01:23.250> three<00:01:23.369> has<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.759> as

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
similar so you know three has that as

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.210 
similar so you know three has that as
well<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:25.140> box<00:01:25.350> it's<00:01:25.619> over<00:01:25.860> here<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.190> a

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
well the box it's over here is a

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.219 
well the box it's over here is a
generator<00:01:26.640> breaker<00:01:26.910> that's<00:01:27.570> when<00:01:27.899> they<00:01:28.050> close

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
generator breaker that's when they close

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.310 
generator breaker that's when they close
it<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.820> that's<00:01:29.820> natural<00:01:30.450> breaker<00:01:30.690> it<00:01:31.140> actually

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
it in that's natural breaker it actually

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.770 
it in that's natural breaker it actually
uses<00:01:31.740> its<00:01:32.039> own<00:01:32.310> power<00:01:32.580> and<00:01:32.880> live<00:01:33.330> up<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.660> this

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780

more<00:02:25.220> efficient<00:02:25.610> yet<00:02:25.760> but<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.120> is<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.390> must

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
more efficient yet but it is it must

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
answer for their Lord unseen we're left

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.500 
answer for their Lord unseen we're left
down<00:02:30.500> yeah<00:02:30.980> well<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:31.970> that's<00:02:32.060> that's<00:02:32.390> the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
down yeah well and that's that's the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.720 
down yeah well and that's that's the
point<00:02:32.660> I'm<00:02:32.810> making<00:02:32.840> what<00:02:33.620> we<00:02:33.770> do<00:02:33.950> what<00:02:34.400> we<00:02:34.580> do

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
point I'm making what we do what we do

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.540 
point I'm making what we do what we do
in<00:02:34.880> unit<00:02:35.150> one<00:02:35.420> is<00:02:35.720> that<00:02:36.110> we<00:02:36.380> manage<00:02:36.680> water<00:02:37.070> we

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
in unit one is that we manage water we

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.300 
in unit one is that we manage water we
take<00:02:37.790> water<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.390> we<00:02:39.020> purified<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.830> then<00:02:40.160> we

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
take water and we purified and then we

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.420 
take water and we purified and then we
heat<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.240> and<00:02:41.540> pump<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.680> push<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.070> into<00:02:43.310> the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
heat it and pump it and push it into the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.790 
heat it and pump it and push it into the
boiler<00:02:43.790> heat<00:02:44.090> some<00:02:44.360> more<00:02:44.540> turn<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.260> steam<00:02:45.530> and

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
boiler heat some more turn the steam and

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.250 
boiler heat some more turn the steam and
then<00:02:46.130> what<00:02:46.310> 16<00:02:46.670> we<00:02:46.910> exhaust<00:02:47.240> it<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.660> then<00:02:48.050> take

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
then what 16 we exhaust it and then take

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.490 
then what 16 we exhaust it and then take
it<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:48.590> eat<00:02:48.860> it<00:02:48.920> push<00:02:49.460> it<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:50.270> you<00:02:51.200> know<00:02:51.290> one

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
it and eat it push it this you know one

manages water unit tunes and trees they

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.130 
manages water unit tunes and trees they
manage<00:02:55.040> air<00:02:55.310> which<00:02:56.090> is<00:02:56.240> very<00:02:56.450> nice<00:02:56.630> because

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
manage air which is very nice because

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.140 
manage air which is very nice because
that<00:02:57.500> means<00:02:57.710> you<00:02:58.280> can<00:02:58.430> plant<00:02:58.640> them<00:02:58.790> anywhere

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
that means you can plant them anywhere

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.880 
that means you can plant them anywhere
you<00:02:59.270> can<00:02:59.420> throw<00:02:59.570> those<00:02:59.690> in<00:02:59.840> a<00:02:59.900> jungle<00:03:00.170> if<00:03:00.650> you

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
you can throw those in a jungle if you

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.370 
you can throw those in a jungle if you
have<00:03:01.100> enough<00:03:01.370> water<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:02.720> mineralize<00:03:03.110> water

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
have enough water to mineralize water

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.740 
have enough water to mineralize water
and<00:03:03.590> that's<00:03:03.709> not<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.920> lot<00:03:04.130> I<00:03:04.250> mean<00:03:04.310> it's<00:03:04.520> a<00:03:04.550> lot

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
and that's not a lot I mean it's a lot

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.990 
and that's not a lot I mean it's a lot
you<00:03:05.750> know<00:03:05.980> that's<00:03:06.980> 48<00:03:07.400> million<00:03:07.610> watts<00:03:07.790> of

you know that's 48 million watts of
power<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.660> know<00:03:08.780> that's<00:03:09.080> that's<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.320> lot<00:03:09.470> of

power you know that's that's a lot of

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.310 
power you know that's that's a lot of

louder<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.580> is<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:09.030> wouldn't<00:04:09.750> be<00:04:09.870> shouting<00:04:10.260> at

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
louder it is I wouldn't be shouting at

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.190 
louder it is I wouldn't be shouting at
all<00:04:10.490> so<00:04:11.490> let's<00:04:12.060> go<00:04:12.150> take<00:04:12.270> a<00:04:12.330> look<00:04:12.480> at<00:04:12.660> remember

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
didn't get it shut down the problem with

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.800 
didn't get it shut down the problem with
these<00:04:21.930> things<00:04:22.230> and<00:04:22.470> is<00:04:23.010> that<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:24.300> know<00:04:24.450> if<00:04:24.690> you

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
these things and is that you know if you

period of time if you cannot address
that<00:04:32.970> problem<00:04:33.120> correct<00:04:33.870> that<00:04:34.050> problem<00:04:34.080> it

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
that problem correct that problem it

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.650 
that problem correct that problem it
will<00:04:34.980> shut<00:04:35.190> itself<00:04:35.370> down<00:04:35.640> and<00:04:36.120> then<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.480> locks

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
will shut itself down and then it locks

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.950 
will shut itself down and then it locks
itself<00:04:36.930> out<00:04:37.350> it's<00:04:38.130> a<00:04:38.250> protection<00:04:38.400> system<00:04:38.970> on

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
itself out it's a protection system on

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.650 
itself out it's a protection system on
this<00:04:40.590> unit<00:04:41.010> we<00:04:41.250> can<00:04:41.430> jump<00:04:41.669> around<00:04:41.850> and<00:04:42.300> we<00:04:42.480> can

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
this unit we can jump around and we can

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.810 
this unit we can jump around and we can
figure<00:04:42.960> out<00:04:43.110> how<00:04:43.500> to<00:04:43.560> get<00:04:43.770> around<00:04:43.890> it<00:04:44.280> but<00:04:44.640> this

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
figure out how to get around it but this

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.330 
figure out how to get around it but this
is<00:04:44.880> it's<00:04:45.450> hardwired<00:04:46.050> in<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.350> computer<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:47.070> so

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
is it's hardwired in the computer and so

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.060 
is it's hardwired in the computer and so
you<00:04:47.580> don't<00:04:47.630> address<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.900> problem<00:04:49.380> you<00:04:49.919> can

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
you don't address the problem you can

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.890 
you don't address the problem you can
lock<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:50.460> out<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:50.910> then<00:04:50.940> you<00:04:51.270> have<00:04:51.480> to<00:04:51.630> explain

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
lock it out and then you have to explain

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.780 
lock it out and then you have to explain
to<00:04:51.960> dad<00:04:52.140> wilkerson<00:04:52.650> why<00:04:52.830> his<00:04:53.070> pot<00:04:53.460> while<00:04:53.610> he

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
to dad wilkerson why his pot while he

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.970 
to dad wilkerson why his pot while he
lost<00:04:54.000> but<00:04:54.990> he's<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.169> ten<00:04:55.320> thousand<00:04:55.620> dollars<00:04:55.860> is

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
lost but he's a ten thousand dollars is

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.659 
lost but he's a ten thousand dollars is
that<00:04:56.100> what<00:04:56.220> here<00:04:56.400> last<00:04:56.880> two<00:04:57.450> hours<00:04:57.600> you<00:04:57.840> know

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
that what here last two hours you know

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.390 
that what here last two hours you know
so<00:04:59.900> we<00:05:00.900> have<00:05:01.020> a<00:05:01.050> problem<00:05:01.320> thats<00:05:01.860> kid<00:05:02.220> thats

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
so we have a problem thats kid thats

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.400 
so we have a problem thats kid thats
there<00:05:02.640> it<00:05:02.760> has<00:05:02.880> a<00:05:02.910> little<00:05:03.240> that's<00:05:03.990> actually<00:05:04.200> a

there it has a little that's actually a

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.260 
there it has a little that's actually a
bent<00:05:04.650> on<00:05:04.830> top<00:05:05.100> and<00:05:05.340> motorized<00:05:05.700> driven<00:05:06.090> bed

google nice little mineral that was

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.110 
google nice little mineral that was
having<00:05:13.530> a<00:05:13.560> problem<00:05:13.740> over<00:05:14.160> the<00:05:14.280> when<00:05:14.850> we<00:05:14.940> first

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
having a problem over the when we first

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.850 
having a problem over the when we first
installed<00:05:15.510> it<00:05:15.690> it<00:05:16.020> was<00:05:16.140> heating<00:05:16.470> up<00:05:16.530> too<00:05:16.710> much

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
installed it it was heating up too much

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.310 
installed it it was heating up too much
and<00:05:17.040> every<00:05:17.250> trip<00:05:17.430> it<00:05:17.520> off<00:05:17.690> and<00:05:18.690> then<00:05:18.930> you<00:05:19.169> got

and every trip it off and then you got

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.450 
and every trip it off and then you got
to<00:05:19.350> cool<00:05:19.530> it<00:05:19.620> down<00:05:19.650> well<00:05:20.040> how<00:05:20.130> do<00:05:20.190> you<00:05:20.280> cool

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
what they tried first you know

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.840 
what they tried first you know
high<00:05:28.170> school<00:05:28.380> graduate<00:05:28.740> 31<00:05:29.100> so<00:05:29.340> anyway<00:05:29.640> just

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
high school graduate 31 so anyway just

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.000 
high school graduate 31 so anyway just
did<00:05:30.180> that<00:05:30.360> finally<00:05:30.990> we<00:05:31.110> decided<00:05:31.140> to<00:05:31.620> open<00:05:31.920> up

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
did that finally we decided to open up

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.950 
did that finally we decided to open up
both<00:05:32.160> coolers<00:05:32.610> and<00:05:32.820> put<00:05:32.970> a<00:05:33.000> larger<00:05:33.390> oil<00:05:33.660> cooler

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
both coolers and put a larger oil cooler

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.840 
both coolers and put a larger oil cooler
system<00:05:34.350> in<00:05:34.470> which<00:05:34.680> is<00:05:34.860> tied<00:05:35.100> into<00:05:35.340> our<00:05:35.580> cooling

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
system in which is tied into our cooling

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.700 
system in which is tied into our cooling
tower<00:05:36.000> over<00:05:36.300> here<00:05:36.480> and<00:05:36.690> then<00:05:37.350> they<00:05:37.470> build<00:05:37.680> a

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
tower over here and then they build a

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.520 
tower over here and then they build a
shed<00:05:37.920> over<00:05:38.130> top<00:05:38.600> which<00:05:39.600> keeps<00:05:39.840> the<00:05:39.960> son<00:05:40.170> of<00:05:40.200> it

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
shed over top which keeps the son of it

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.820 
shed over top which keeps the son of it
which<00:05:40.680> keeps<00:05:40.980> us<00:05:41.130> so<00:05:41.760> we<00:05:42.630> kind<00:05:42.960> of<00:05:43.110> figured<00:05:43.530> out

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
which keeps us so we kind of figured out

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.620 
which keeps us so we kind of figured out
a<00:05:43.860> way<00:05:44.100> to<00:05:44.160> get<00:05:44.490> around<00:05:44.610> the<00:05:45.000> problem<00:05:45.150> that<00:05:45.510> we

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
a way to get around the problem that we

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.160 
a way to get around the problem that we
had<00:05:46.640> the<00:05:47.640> new<00:05:47.820> unit<00:05:48.210> does<00:05:48.360> not<00:05:48.510> have<00:05:48.690> that<00:05:48.720> the

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.170 
had the new unit does not have that the
