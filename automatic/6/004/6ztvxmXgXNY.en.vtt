along<00:02:08.710> when<00:02:09.710> we<00:02:09.830> were<00:02:09.890> out<00:02:10.009> doing<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.850> back

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
along when we were out doing the back

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.480 
along when we were out doing the back
panel<00:02:11.570> for<00:02:11.810> example<00:02:12.260> we<00:02:12.860> came<00:02:13.070> up<00:02:13.190> with<00:02:13.370> the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
panel for example we came up with the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.150 
panel for example we came up with the
idea<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.940> climbing<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.570> hopes<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:15.830> we<00:02:16.010> were

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
idea of climbing the hopes so we were

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.130 
idea of climbing the hopes so we were
trying<00:02:16.460> always<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.910> use<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.570> future<00:02:17.900> of<00:02:17.990> the

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
trying always to use the future of the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.640 
trying always to use the future of the
Vita<00:02:19.120> in<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.360> sense<00:02:20.660> that<00:02:20.900> don't<00:02:21.350> we<00:02:21.440> bring

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
Vita in a sense that don't we bring

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.470 
Vita in a sense that don't we bring
something<00:02:22.070> to<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.310> game<00:02:22.490> you<00:02:23.090> can<00:02:23.210> do<00:02:23.300> that

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
something to the game you can do that

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.690 
something to the game you can do that
traditional<00:02:24.320> controls<00:02:24.740> you<00:02:25.040> know<00:02:25.160> aiming<00:02:25.520> and

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
traditional controls you know aiming and

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.699 
traditional controls you know aiming and
firing<00:02:25.840> but<00:02:26.840> what<00:02:26.959> we<00:02:27.050> wanted<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.320> do<00:02:27.470> for<00:02:27.650> the

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
firing but what we wanted to do for the

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.030 
firing but what we wanted to do for the
Vita<00:02:27.890> is<00:02:28.040> add<00:02:28.370> something<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.940> little<00:02:29.270> bit<00:02:29.390> more

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
Vita is add something a little bit more

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.640 
Vita is add something a little bit more
dynamic<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.850> system<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:33.200> main<00:02:33.380> thing

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
dynamic to the system so the main thing

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.140 
dynamic to the system so the main thing
that<00:02:33.800> we<00:02:33.890> did<00:02:34.040> is<00:02:34.220> when<00:02:34.370> you're<00:02:34.520> aiming<00:02:34.700> around

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
that we did is when you're aiming around

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.000 
that we did is when you're aiming around
you<00:02:35.390> can<00:02:35.540> aim<00:02:35.690> with<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.959> right<00:02:36.140> stick<00:02:36.440> and

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
you can aim with the right stick and

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.410 
you can aim with the right stick and
then<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.220> can<00:02:37.400> just<00:02:37.550> tilt<00:02:37.820> through<00:02:38.090> adjust

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
then you can just tilt through adjust

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.540 
then you can just tilt through adjust
your<00:02:38.570> aim<00:02:38.600> we've<00:02:39.590> got<00:02:39.739> a<00:02:39.770> touchscreen<00:02:40.130> front

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
your aim we've got a touchscreen front

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.820 
your aim we've got a touchscreen front
and<00:02:40.700> rear<00:02:40.880> so<00:02:41.630> for<00:02:41.840> example<00:02:42.260> what<00:02:42.410> we<00:02:42.530> decided

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
and rear so for example what we decided

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.800 
and rear so for example what we decided
to<00:02:42.920> do<00:02:43.070> for<00:02:43.100> grades<00:02:43.580> is<00:02:43.910> when<00:02:44.570> you're<00:02:44.690> holding

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
to do for grades is when you're holding

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.360 
to do for grades is when you're holding
the<00:02:45.050> system<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:45.530> could<00:02:45.680> touch<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.100> grenade

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
the system you could touch the grenade

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.130 
the system you could touch the grenade
and<00:02:46.489> just<00:02:46.640> drag<00:02:46.940> it<00:02:47.120> into<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.450> scene<00:02:47.630> wherever

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
and just drag it into the scene wherever

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.620 
and just drag it into the scene wherever
you<00:02:48.290> want<00:02:48.500> it's<00:02:49.310> really<00:02:49.640> easier<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.150> aim<00:02:50.300> on

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
you want it's really easier to aim on

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.440 
you want it's really easier to aim on
our<00:02:50.930> on<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.410> Vita<00:02:51.620> funny<00:02:52.010> enough<00:02:52.220> than<00:02:53.150> any

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
our on the Vita funny enough than any

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.330 
our on the Vita funny enough than any
other<00:02:53.660> system<00:02:53.930> any<00:02:54.500> other<00:02:54.709> game<00:02:54.950> we've<00:02:55.250> ever

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
worked with that technology before but

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.520 
worked with that technology before but
the<00:03:05.390> first<00:03:05.630> impression<00:03:06.049> you<00:03:06.080> get<00:03:06.260> at<00:03:06.410> this

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
the first impression you get at this

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.039 
the first impression you get at this
device<00:03:06.830> is<00:03:07.160> that<00:03:07.400> screen<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:08.330> blacks<00:03:08.600> are<00:03:08.840> so
