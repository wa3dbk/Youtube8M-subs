going to create a nice area of balls it
looks<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.860> bit<00:00:49.890> scruffy<00:00:50.160> at<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.460> moment<00:00:50.760> but

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
looks a bit scruffy at the moment but

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.060 
looks a bit scruffy at the moment but
that's<00:00:51.030> what<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> tentacles<00:00:51.809> fall<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
that's what the tentacles fall and the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.500 
that's what the tentacles fall and the
tinsel<00:00:53.309> was<00:00:53.489> gonna<00:00:53.670> pan<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.149> out<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> little

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
tinsel was gonna pan this out a little

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.900 
tinsel was gonna pan this out a little
bit<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:54.899> I'm<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.500> gonna<00:00:55.680> go<00:00:55.920> ahead<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.160> do<00:00:56.430> do

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
bit so I'm just gonna go ahead and do do

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.720 
bit so I'm just gonna go ahead and do do
that<00:00:57.289> create<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.379> nice<00:00:58.680> foots<00:00:58.980> at<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.219> top<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.670> I

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
that create a nice foots at the top so I

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.970 
that create a nice foots at the top so I
can<00:00:59.910> hang<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.210> up<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.620> then<00:01:01.620> I'll<00:01:01.770> continue

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
can hang it up and then I'll continue

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:16.440 
can hang it up and then I'll continue
this<00:01:02.430> tutorial

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.670 

once<00:01:17.450> you've<00:01:17.600> read<00:01:17.810> it<00:01:17.960> all<00:01:18.140> your<00:01:18.500> bubbles

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
once you've read it all your bubbles

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.029 
once you've read it all your bubbles
onto<00:01:19.399> your<00:01:19.549> piece<00:01:20.000> of<00:01:20.030> wire<00:01:20.649> where<00:01:21.649> ephemeral

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
onto your piece of wire where ephemeral

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:23.969 
onto your piece of wire where ephemeral
your<00:01:22.189> tinsel<00:01:22.579> you're<00:01:22.729> now<00:01:22.880> gonna<00:01:23.090> need<00:01:23.360> to

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
your tinsel you're now gonna need to

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.350 
your tinsel you're now gonna need to
thread<00:01:24.979> it<00:01:25.100> in<00:01:25.219> between<00:01:25.399> all<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.000> baubles

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360

like here you do this just by going
around<00:01:28.969> and<00:01:29.590> then<00:01:30.590> shoving<00:01:31.039> it<00:01:31.130> in<00:01:31.250> between

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
around and then shoving it in between

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.910 
around and then shoving it in between
bubbles<00:01:31.909> and<00:01:32.509> it's<00:01:32.750> all<00:01:32.869> been<00:01:32.990> pad<00:01:33.619> it<00:01:33.770> out<00:01:33.860> a
