00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
find the one that you need so if you're

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.520 
find the one that you need so if you're
looking<00:01:02.790> for<00:01:02.970> faces<00:01:03.450> just<00:01:03.630> go<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.140> faces

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
looking for faces just go to the faces

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.880 
looking for faces just go to the faces
ones<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.009> then<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:06.030> choose<00:01:06.390> them<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.200> as

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
ones and then just choose them and as

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.889 
ones and then just choose them and as
you<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.189> see<00:01:08.340> here<00:01:08.610> they're<00:01:08.850> yellow<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.869> I

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
you can see here they're yellow so I

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.139 
you can see here they're yellow so I
guess<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:10.710> change<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.219> race<00:01:11.430> color<00:01:11.790> like

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
guess you can change the race color like

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:14.270 
guess you can change the race color like
if<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.420> choose<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.500> little<00:01:13.829> girl<00:01:14.009> just

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
if you choose in this little girl just

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.230 
if you choose in this little girl just
hold<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.870> then<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.500> can<00:01:16.650> choose<00:01:17.240> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
hold this and then you can choose the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.649 
hold this and then you can choose the
color<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.900> are<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.000> think<00:01:21.299> that's<00:01:21.450> really

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
color you are so I think that's really

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.380 
color you are so I think that's really
cool<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.830> they<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.190> now<00:01:23.370> you<00:01:23.760> can<00:01:23.940> now<00:01:24.060> choose

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
cool so they can now you can now choose

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.260 
cool so they can now you can now choose
the<00:01:24.450> Rays<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.229> want<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.590> choose<00:01:26.270> that's

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the Rays you want to choose that's

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.430 
the Rays you want to choose that's
pretty<00:01:27.720> cool<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.320> then<00:01:30.020> you'll<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
pretty cool and then you'll have the

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.740
