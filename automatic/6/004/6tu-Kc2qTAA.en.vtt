00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
coffee chaff and it's beautiful metal

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.600 
coffee chaff and it's beautiful metal
grate<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.330> so<00:03:25.170> first<00:03:25.440> thing<00:03:26.130> we<00:03:26.280> need<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.459> do

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
grate and so first thing we need to do

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.430 
grate and so first thing we need to do
is<00:03:26.790> get<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.120> bunny<00:03:27.299> out<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.570> that<00:03:27.660> corner<00:03:27.870> okay

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
is get the bunny out of that corner okay

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.400 
is get the bunny out of that corner okay
so<00:03:29.600> it's<00:03:30.600> very<00:03:30.750> simple<00:03:31.019> wouldn't<00:03:31.320> do<00:03:31.380> that

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
so it's very simple wouldn't do that

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.599 
so it's very simple wouldn't do that
just<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.830> pick<00:03:31.980> them<00:03:32.070> up<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.310> put<00:03:32.400> them<00:03:32.519> in

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
just to pick them up and put them in

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.759 
just to pick them up and put them in
another<00:03:32.639> corner<00:03:33.030> but<00:03:33.600> if<00:03:34.049> you<00:03:34.109> want<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.590> really

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
another corner but if you want to really

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.470 
another corner but if you want to really
train<00:03:35.040> them<00:03:35.280> then<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:35.970> go<00:03:36.120> wait

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
train them then you go wait

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.430 
train them then you go wait
here<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:39.040> she<00:03:39.340> goes<00:03:39.489> over<00:03:39.670> there<00:03:39.790> I<00:03:39.989> know<00:03:40.989> I

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
here and she goes over there I know I

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.440 
here and she goes over there I know I
know<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:41.620> taught<00:03:42.220> her<00:03:42.340> to<00:03:42.459> do<00:03:42.580> that<00:03:42.700> but<00:03:42.970> you<00:03:43.299> can

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450
