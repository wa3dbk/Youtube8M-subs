00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
instead of gold I mean I think they're

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.569 
instead of gold I mean I think they're
kind<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.710> gold<00:02:03.049> down<00:02:04.049> here<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.619> which<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.399> call

kind of gold down here the which is call

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.969 
kind of gold down here the which is call
these<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.350> o-rings<00:02:07.350> or<00:02:07.619> what<00:02:07.740> you're<00:02:07.860> going

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
these the o-rings or what you're going

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.160 
these the o-rings or what you're going
to<00:02:08.039> call<00:02:08.190> them<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:09.119> instead<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.899> kind

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
to call them and so instead of this kind

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.400 
to call them and so instead of this kind
of<00:02:10.229> like<00:02:10.440> blue

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
of like blue

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.920 
of like blue
whitish<00:02:12.410> grayish<00:02:13.400> color<00:02:13.510> there<00:02:14.510> now<00:02:14.630> black

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
whitish grayish color there now black

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.490 
whitish grayish color there now black
and<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:16.660> think<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:17.810> is<00:02:17.930> pretty<00:02:18.140> much<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.470> for

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
and I think that is pretty much it for

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.340 
and I think that is pretty much it for
the<00:02:18.800> aesthetic<00:02:19.250> differences<00:02:19.490> because<00:02:20.420> it's

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
the aesthetic differences because it's

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.760 
the aesthetic differences because it's
very<00:02:21.470> much<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.850> translucent<00:02:22.930> or<00:02:23.930> transparent<00:02:24.260> a

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
very much a translucent or transparent a

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.120 
very much a translucent or transparent a
plastic<00:02:25.840> casing<00:02:26.840> which<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.410> pretty<00:02:27.980> much<00:02:28.040> the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
plastic casing which is pretty much the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.860 
plastic casing which is pretty much the
same<00:02:28.370> design<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.790> everything<00:02:29.120> actually<00:02:29.570> the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
same design and everything actually the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.510 
same design and everything actually the
exact<00:02:30.170> same<00:02:30.350> design<00:02:30.530> everything<00:02:31.010> except<00:02:31.400> with

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
exact same design everything except with

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.120 
exact same design everything except with
a<00:02:31.550> more<00:02:31.910> black<00:02:32.300> theme<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:33.350> yeah<00:02:33.590> everything<00:02:34.010> is

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
a more black theme so yeah everything is

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.300 
a more black theme so yeah everything is
pretty<00:02:34.430> much<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:35.180> same<00:02:35.540> sound<00:02:36.500> corny<00:02:36.740> it's<00:02:37.070> a

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
pretty much the same sound corny it's a

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.980 
pretty much the same sound corny it's a
pretty<00:02:37.610> much<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.910> exact<00:02:38.180> same<00:02:38.210> thing<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:38.810> read

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
pretty much the exact same thing I read

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.720 
pretty much the exact same thing I read
an<00:02:39.080> article<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.710> someone<00:02:40.070> reviewing<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:40.550> and

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
an article of someone reviewing it and

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.480 
an article of someone reviewing it and
they<00:02:41.240> said<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.690> company<00:02:42.050> said<00:02:42.290> um<00:02:43.040> they're

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
they said the company said um they're

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.030 
they said the company said um they're
the<00:02:43.520> exact<00:02:44.420> same<00:02:44.510> sound<00:02:44.990> quality<00:02:45.320> you<00:02:45.350> still

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
the exact same sound quality you still

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.670 
the exact same sound quality you still
get<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.340> 8<00:02:47.050> crap<00:02:48.050> what<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.290> Harman<00:02:48.650> Kardon

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
get the 8 crap what the Harman Kardon

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.780 
get the 8 crap what the Harman Kardon
colleagues<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.280> think<00:02:49.370> they<00:02:49.490> call<00:02:49.670> them

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
colleagues I think they call them

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.610 
colleagues I think they call them
transducers<00:02:50.660> transducers<00:02:53.320> yeah<00:02:54.320> 8

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
transducers transducers yeah 8

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.790 
transducers transducers yeah 8
full-range<00:02:55.340> transducers<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:56.630> speaker<00:02:57.470> system

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
full-range transducers so speaker system

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.470 
full-range transducers so speaker system
it's<00:02:58.040> pretty<00:02:58.250> much<00:02:58.400> exactly<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.940> same<00:02:59.030> thing

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
it's pretty much exactly the same thing

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.360 
it's pretty much exactly the same thing
I<00:02:59.660> would<00:03:00.020> assume<00:03:00.320> that's<00:03:00.530> probably<00:03:00.830> slightly

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
I would assume that's probably slightly

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.070 
I would assume that's probably slightly
better<00:03:01.550> just<00:03:01.880> because<00:03:02.060> it<00:03:02.210> is<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.330> version<00:03:02.600> 3

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
better just because it is a version 3

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.950 
better just because it is a version 3
but<00:03:03.620> then<00:03:03.860> again<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.490> version<00:03:04.880> 2<00:03:05.060> upgraded

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
but then again the version 2 upgraded

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.510 
but then again the version 2 upgraded
from<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.200> version<00:03:06.470> 1<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:06.860> was<00:03:07.010> practically

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
from the version 1 it was practically

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.930 
from the version 1 it was practically
the<00:03:07.610> same<00:03:07.760> thing<00:03:08.060> but<00:03:09.550> the<00:03:10.550> only<00:03:10.700> other

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
the same thing but the only other

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.210 
the same thing but the only other
difference<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.780> 3.5<00:03:12.740> millimeter

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
difference is the 3.5 millimeter

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.310 
difference is the 3.5 millimeter
headphone<00:03:13.280> jack<00:03:13.580> cable<00:03:14.000> instead<00:03:14.810> of<00:03:14.870> having<00:03:15.110> a

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
headphone jack cable instead of having a

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.960 
headphone jack cable instead of having a
attached<00:03:15.980> cable<00:03:16.459> it's<00:03:16.610> actually<00:03:16.910> a

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
attached cable it's actually a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.680 
attached cable it's actually a
detachable<00:03:17.540> one<00:03:18.020> so<00:03:19.150> it's<00:03:20.150> still<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.510> same

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
detachable one so it's still the same

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.570 
detachable one so it's still the same
3.5<00:03:21.500> millimeter<00:03:21.920> headphone<00:03:21.980> jack<00:03:22.280> which<00:03:22.550> is

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
3.5 millimeter headphone jack which is

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.610 
3.5 millimeter headphone jack which is
really<00:03:22.970> great<00:03:23.120> makes<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.540> really<00:03:23.900> Universal

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
really great makes it really Universal

button<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.070> also<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.970> power<00:03:41.150> button<00:03:41.450> does

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
button and also the power button does

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.530 
button and also the power button does
also<00:03:41.870> act<00:03:42.230> as<00:03:42.410> in<00:03:42.650> a<00:03:42.680> bass<00:03:43.040> tuner<00:03:43.459> you<00:03:44.120> know<00:03:44.420> if

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
also act as in a bass tuner you know if

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.580 
also act as in a bass tuner you know if
you<00:03:44.630> want<00:03:44.780> to<00:03:44.840> increase<00:03:45.050> the<00:03:45.230> amount<00:03:45.380> of<00:03:45.410> bass

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
you want to increase the amount of bass

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.449 
you want to increase the amount of bass
cranked<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.160> up

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
cranked it up

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.040 
cranked it up
so<00:03:46.610> that's<00:03:47.120> pretty<00:03:47.270> much<00:03:47.360> all<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.630> same<00:03:47.810> but

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
so that's pretty much all the same but

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.650 
so that's pretty much all the same but
anyway<00:03:48.770> these<00:03:48.950> guys<00:03:49.190> that's<00:03:49.520> pretty<00:03:50.270> much<00:03:50.390> it

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
anyway these guys that's pretty much it

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.570 
anyway these guys that's pretty much it
for<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:50.930> differences<00:03:51.470> on<00:03:51.740> least<00:03:52.190> that's<00:03:52.370> what

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
for the differences on least that's what

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.100 
for the differences on least that's what
I<00:03:52.640> know<00:03:52.700> so<00:03:52.850> if<00:03:53.300> you<00:03:53.360> guys<00:03:53.510> know<00:03:53.690> anything<00:03:53.900> else

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
I know so if you guys know anything else

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.330 
I know so if you guys know anything else
that's<00:03:54.230> different<00:03:54.650> you<00:03:54.800> know<00:03:54.890> post<00:03:55.100> in<00:03:55.280> the

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
that's different you know post in the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.340 
that's different you know post in the
comments<00:03:55.730> but<00:03:55.880> oh<00:03:56.120> yeah<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:56.959> still<00:03:57.170> get

comments but oh yeah you still get
premature<00:03:57.770> everything's<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.130> same<00:03:58.160> great

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
premature everything's the same great

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.670 
premature everything's the same great
sound<00:03:59.030> quality<00:03:59.150> design<00:03:59.930> is<00:04:00.260> pretty<00:04:00.470> much<00:04:00.530> all

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
sound quality design is pretty much all

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.080 
sound quality design is pretty much all
the<00:04:00.800> same<00:04:00.920> other<00:04:01.160> than<00:04:01.250> those<00:04:01.520> you<00:04:01.730> know<00:04:01.820> color

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
the same other than those you know color

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.850 
the same other than those you know color
differences<00:04:02.630> that<00:04:02.720> I<00:04:02.780> mentioned<00:04:03.230> but<00:04:03.709> of

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
differences that I mentioned but of

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.320 
differences that I mentioned but of
course<00:04:04.100> you<00:04:04.250> know<00:04:04.340> why<00:04:04.550> changes<00:04:05.000> design<00:04:05.209> of

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
course you know why changes design of

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.580 
course you know why changes design of
something<00:04:05.570> that<00:04:05.660> looks<00:04:05.870> very<00:04:06.110> nice<00:04:06.530> and

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
something that looks very nice and

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.530 
something that looks very nice and
pretty<00:04:07.100> much<00:04:07.190> a<00:04:07.280> classical<00:04:07.730> design<00:04:07.790> however

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
pretty much a classical design however

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.090 
pretty much a classical design however
not<00:04:08.810> Harman<00:04:09.200> Kardon<00:04:09.350> also<00:04:09.739> mention<00:04:10.070> that

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
not Harman Kardon also mention that

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.740 
not Harman Kardon also mention that
their<00:04:10.459> sound<00:04:11.000> system<00:04:11.300> here<00:04:11.390> is<00:04:11.540> also

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
their sound system here is also

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.810 
their sound system here is also
displayed<00:04:12.140> at<00:04:12.320> the<00:04:12.500> New<00:04:12.739> York<00:04:12.950> art<00:04:13.220> museum<00:04:13.730> or

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
displayed at the New York art museum or

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.970 
displayed at the New York art museum or
some<00:04:14.000> so<00:04:14.660> yeah<00:04:14.989> it's<00:04:15.170> definitely<00:04:15.320> a<00:04:15.530> classical

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
some so yeah it's definitely a classical

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.220 
some so yeah it's definitely a classical
design<00:04:16.070> so<00:04:16.520> I<00:04:16.790> guess<00:04:17.330> you<00:04:17.480> know<00:04:17.600> no<00:04:17.810> point<00:04:18.049> no

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
design so I guess you know no point no

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.360 
design so I guess you know no point no
point<00:04:18.470> of<00:04:18.560> changing<00:04:18.859> something<00:04:19.130> that's<00:04:19.250> very

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
point of changing something that's very

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.780 
point of changing something that's very
different<00:04:19.880> on<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.720> subwoofer<00:04:21.260> I<00:04:21.669> just<00:04:22.669> found

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
different on the subwoofer I just found

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.310 
different on the subwoofer I just found
those<00:04:23.000> at<00:04:23.180> this<00:04:23.330> out<00:04:23.570> today<00:04:23.750> that<00:04:24.020> how<00:04:24.169> it

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
those at this out today that how it

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.220 
those at this out today that how it
works<00:04:24.470> is

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
works is

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.980 
works is
a<00:04:25.260> it<00:04:26.070> directs<00:04:26.700> the<00:04:26.910> base<00:04:27.090> downwards<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.960> the

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
a it directs the base downwards to the

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.780 
a it directs the base downwards to the
ground<00:04:28.290> which<00:04:28.470> is<00:04:28.500> supposedly<00:04:29.040> better

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
ground which is supposedly better

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.100 
ground which is supposedly better
well<00:04:30.000> actually<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.270> knew<00:04:30.390> how<00:04:30.540> kind<00:04:30.840> of<00:04:30.870> work<00:04:31.020> if

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
well actually I knew how kind of work if

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.200 
well actually I knew how kind of work if
I'm<00:04:31.230> just<00:04:31.440> saying<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:31.830> that's<00:04:32.010> how<00:04:32.370> it<00:04:32.580> works

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
I'm just saying it that's how it works

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.740 
I'm just saying it that's how it works
reading<00:04:33.600> it<00:04:33.720> for<00:04:33.990> sure<00:04:34.170> but<00:04:34.970> yeah<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.150> base<00:04:36.510> is

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
reading it for sure but yeah the base is

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.930 
reading it for sure but yeah the base is
directed<00:04:37.350> downward<00:04:37.890> I<00:04:38.130> don't<00:04:38.550> know<00:04:38.640> if<00:04:38.760> I<00:04:38.880> you

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
directed downward I don't know if I you

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.500 
directed downward I don't know if I you
guys<00:04:39.180> one<00:04:39.780> second<00:04:41.000> so<00:04:42.000> I<00:04:42.030> don't<00:04:42.330> know<00:04:42.390> if<00:04:42.450> you

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
guys see it so what for down there but

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.280 
guys see it so what for down there but
is<00:04:44.130> that<00:04:44.400> there<00:04:44.640> and<00:04:44.880> it's<00:04:45.420> directed<00:04:45.900> downward

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
is that there and it's directed downward

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.720 
is that there and it's directed downward
and<00:04:46.590> gets<00:04:46.800> supposedly<00:04:47.280> gives<00:04:47.490> you<00:04:47.580> better

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
and gets supposedly gives you better

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.760 
and gets supposedly gives you better
base<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:48.210> having<00:04:48.450> some<00:04:48.630> pushing<00:04:49.320> off<00:04:49.560> to<00:04:49.710> the

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
base and having some pushing off to the

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.880 
base and having some pushing off to the
side<00:04:50.070> but<00:04:50.790> like<00:04:51.540> many<00:04:51.870> other<00:04:52.020> subwoofers<00:04:52.470> do

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
side but like many other subwoofers do

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.400 
side but like many other subwoofers do
but<00:04:53.160> yeah<00:04:53.640> like<00:04:54.180> I'm<00:04:54.360> not<00:04:54.390> a<00:04:54.540> audiophile<00:04:55.290> or

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
but yeah like I'm not a audiophile or

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.620 
but yeah like I'm not a audiophile or
anything<00:04:55.590> guys<00:04:55.860> I<00:04:56.070> just<00:04:56.100> you<00:04:56.670> know<00:04:56.790> explaining

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
anything guys I just you know explaining

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.110 
anything guys I just you know explaining
what<00:04:57.930> I<00:04:57.960> read<00:04:58.170> and<00:04:58.350> want<00:04:58.890> to<00:04:58.980> know<00:04:59.070> and<00:04:59.430> but

what I read and want to know and but
yeah<00:05:00.240> that's<00:05:00.360> pretty<00:05:00.510> much<00:05:00.690> it<00:05:00.900> for<00:05:00.930> the

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
yeah that's pretty much it for the

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.130 
yeah that's pretty much it for the
differences<00:05:01.710> between<00:05:01.920> the<00:05:02.430> science<00:05:03.420> x3<00:05:03.900> and

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
differences between the science x3 and

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.920 
differences between the science x3 and
sounds<00:05:04.590> x2<00:05:05.010> is<00:05:05.270> pretty<00:05:06.270> much<00:05:06.360> aesthetic

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
sounds x2 is pretty much aesthetic

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.950

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
are pretty much the same thing because

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.150 
are pretty much the same thing because
last<00:05:21.900> I<00:05:22.050> checked<00:05:22.110> on<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:22.500> Apple<00:05:22.770> website<00:05:22.890> the

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
last I checked on the Apple website the

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.580 
last I checked on the Apple website the
two<00:05:23.310> were<00:05:23.460> pretty<00:05:23.580> much<00:05:23.730> 169<00:05:24.600> or<00:05:25.230> might<00:05:25.470> have

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
two were pretty much 169 or might have

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.900 
two were pretty much 169 or might have
159<00:05:26.340> but<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.790> threes<00:05:27.060> are<00:05:27.320> 169<00:05:28.320> now<00:05:28.650> but<00:05:28.920> yeah

159 but the threes are 169 now but yeah

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.340 
159 but the threes are 169 now but yeah
that<00:05:30.060> might<00:05:30.210> be<00:05:30.330> because<00:05:30.450> it's<00:05:31.020> Black<00:05:31.320> Friday

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350

one<00:05:48.540> they're<00:05:48.750> practically<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.230> same<00:05:49.350> thing

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
one they're practically the same thing

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.890 
one they're practically the same thing
if<00:05:50.220> I<00:05:50.340> had<00:05:50.490> to<00:05:50.610> choose<00:05:50.790> because<00:05:51.330> of<00:05:51.510> the<00:05:51.720> same

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
if I had to choose because of the same

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.480 
if I had to choose because of the same
price<00:05:52.110> I'd<00:05:52.320> probably<00:05:52.530> choose<00:05:52.740> the<00:05:52.920> sound<00:05:53.130> x3

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
price I'd probably choose the sound x3

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.310 
price I'd probably choose the sound x3
mainly<00:05:54.240> because<00:05:54.570> they<00:05:54.960> would<00:05:55.140> match<00:05:55.290> my

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
mainly because they would match my

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.290 
mainly because they would match my
MacBook<00:05:56.070> here<00:05:56.250> better<00:05:56.430> because<00:05:56.880> of<00:05:56.910> the<00:05:57.090> black

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
MacBook here better because of the black

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.520 
MacBook here better because of the black
