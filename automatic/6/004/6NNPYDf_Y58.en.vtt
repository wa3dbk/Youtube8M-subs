00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
you can stamp it just above the scallop

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.210 
you can stamp it just above the scallop
border<00:04:19.560> if<00:04:19.889> you<00:04:20.040> decide<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:21.949> do<00:04:22.949> it<00:04:23.100> the

border if you decide to do it the
opposite<00:04:23.729> way<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:25.770> you<00:04:25.830> would<00:04:26.010> turn<00:04:26.220> it<00:04:26.370> upside

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
opposite way so you would turn it upside

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:35.960 
opposite way so you would turn it upside
down<00:04:26.820> and<00:04:28.880> stamp<00:04:29.880> it<00:04:30.090> this<00:04:30.419> way<00:04:34.790> just<00:04:35.790> like

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
down and stamp it this way just like

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.230 
down and stamp it this way just like
that<00:04:36.710> now<00:04:37.710> as<00:04:37.919> you<00:04:37.950> can<00:04:38.190> see<00:04:38.250> that<00:04:38.580> gives<00:04:38.820> you<00:04:38.970> a

that now as you can see that gives you a

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.070 
that now as you can see that gives you a
ton<00:04:40.139> of<00:04:40.169> different<00:04:40.380> border<00:04:40.860> options<00:04:41.930> we<00:04:42.930> also

in<00:05:41.310> a<00:05:41.370> black<00:05:41.580> ink<00:05:42.560> so<00:05:43.560> you<00:05:43.650> could<00:05:43.889> stamp<00:05:44.190> this

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
in a black ink so you could stamp this

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.300 
in a black ink so you could stamp this
along<00:05:45.539> the<00:05:45.690> side<00:05:45.930> you<00:05:46.500> can<00:05:46.650> stamp<00:05:46.860> it<00:05:46.950> this<00:05:47.130> way

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
along the side you can stamp it this way

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.300 
along the side you can stamp it this way
all<00:05:47.639> the<00:05:48.330> way<00:05:48.360> across<00:05:48.539> I<00:05:49.639> think<00:05:50.639> I'll<00:05:50.849> do<00:05:51.090> it

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
all the way across I think I'll do it

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.330 
all the way across I think I'll do it
that<00:05:53.310> way<00:05:53.490> so<00:05:54.300> you<00:05:54.360> have<00:05:54.599> a<00:05:54.840> nice<00:05:55.340> floral

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
that way so you have a nice floral

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.950 
that way so you have a nice floral
teacup<00:05:57.740> that<00:05:58.740> pattern<00:05:59.310> also<00:05:59.849> has<00:06:00.090> some

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
teacup that pattern also has some

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.350 
teacup that pattern also has some
coordinating<00:06:01.620> flowers<00:06:02.099> that<00:06:03.090> layer

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
coordinating flowers that layer

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.760 
coordinating flowers that layer
perfectly<00:06:04.669> inside<00:06:05.669> or<00:06:06.060> you<00:06:06.360> could<00:06:06.599> simply<00:06:06.900> you

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
perfectly inside or you could simply you

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.040 
perfectly inside or you could simply you
know<00:06:07.919> color<00:06:08.460> them<00:06:08.760> with<00:06:08.970> your<00:06:09.180> markers<00:06:09.630> or

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
know color them with your markers or

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.380 
know color them with your markers or
whatever<00:06:10.860> other<00:06:11.039> color<00:06:11.370> medium<00:06:11.640> you<00:06:12.030> decide

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
whatever other color medium you decide

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:21.090 
whatever other color medium you decide
but<00:06:13.690> i<00:06:13.900> think<00:06:13.960> i<00:06:14.350> will<00:06:17.550> use<00:06:18.550> my<00:06:18.790> markers<00:06:20.100> color

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
but i think i will use my markers color

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:28.470 
but i think i will use my markers color
the<00:06:21.190> leaves<00:06:25.350> and<00:06:26.520> you<00:06:27.520> can<00:06:27.730> use<00:06:27.880> that<00:06:28.090> on<00:06:28.300> its
