 we feel with great satisfaction to be 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.400
 here in the southern state of california 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.279
 good to inaugurate the president of 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.529
 enrique peÃ±a grandson of the aura plant 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.980
 solar is the first power plant 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.480
 with sunlight that we have in the state and 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.269
 apart it is the largest in Latin 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.640
 latina up to this moment this is a 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.960
 power generation project 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.810
 electric 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.020
 but also 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.810
 fulfills an important purpose 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.850
 generate clean energy and mexico is 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.990
 entering into this innovative process and 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.900
 Transformer of how we generate energy 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.510
 electric and especially cheap energy 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.580
 and clean that's why the importance of 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.410
 mexico do not stay behind in this that 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.780
 had for the state more than him 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.060
 training is a big help because the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.130
 only form of energy that we had was 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.920
 using fossil fuels we hope 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.590
 continue to support this type of energy 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.510
 you can see that they give importance to what 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.360
 what are the problems in the state and with 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.250
 this type of plants is the impact 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.090
 environmental is minimal 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.119
 Mexico wants to generate more energy 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.360
 cleaner and cheaper energy for 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.670
 users for Mexican families 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.920
 for small and medium businesses to 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.700
 who are detonators of employment in 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.700
 our country 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.259
 better energy and on the other hand energy 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.680
 someone and with this we have the 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.539
 opportunity to have new jobs for 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.869
 the new students who leave the 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:59.020
 universities to be a model of success that 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.950
 can be replicated in other parts of 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.319
 our country be part of a society 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.689
 committed to the development of mexico 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:11.130
 that will generate better conditions 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.130
 for all its inhabitants
