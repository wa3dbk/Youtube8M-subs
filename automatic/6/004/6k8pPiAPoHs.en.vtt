have is when customers order and they
want<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.800> return<00:00:26.009> wheel<00:00:26.249> adapters<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.970> because

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
want to return wheel adapters is because

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.999 
want to return wheel adapters is because
they<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:27.810> don't<00:00:28.050> fit<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.649> purpose<00:00:28.859> that

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
they just don't fit the purpose that

drawing is going to show you that we're
gonna<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.570> measuring<00:01:10.080> across<00:01:11.120> opposite<00:01:12.120> studs

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
gonna be measuring across opposite studs

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.410 
gonna be measuring across opposite studs
and<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.440> true<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:13.920> 8<00:01:14.130> lug<00:01:14.370> 6<00:01:14.760> lug<00:01:14.940> and<00:01:15.150> 4

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and this is true for 8 lug 6 lug and 4

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.600 
and this is true for 8 lug 6 lug and 4
look<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:16.770> we're<00:01:16.890> gonna<00:01:17.040> go<00:01:17.190> ahead<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.400> we're

look so we're gonna go ahead and we're

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.100 
look so we're gonna go ahead and we're
gonna<00:01:17.670> measure<00:01:17.970> from<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.540> side<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.960> this

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
gonna measure from this side to this

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.850 
gonna measure from this side to this
side<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:20.160> all<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.430> would<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:20.960> is<00:01:21.960> set<00:01:22.710> your

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
side and all you would do is set your

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.070 
side and all you would do is set your
ruler<00:01:23.310> across<00:01:23.460> there<00:01:24.000> measure<00:01:24.540> from<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
ruler across there measure from the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.350 
ruler across there measure from the
center<00:01:25.260> of<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.560> one<00:01:25.620> to<00:01:26.010> here<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.460> that

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
center of this one to here and that

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.550 
center of this one to here and that
would<00:01:27.510> be<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> measurement<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.410> would

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
would be the measurement that you would

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.800 
would be the measurement that you would
use<00:01:28.740> now<00:01:29.550> some<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.850> these<00:01:30.030> measurements<00:01:30.450> keep

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
use now some of these measurements keep

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.870 
use now some of these measurements keep
in<00:01:30.960> mind<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.590> they<00:01:31.740> are<00:01:31.770> not<00:01:32.070> always<00:01:32.370> in

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
in mind that they are not always in

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.090 
in mind that they are not always in
inches<00:01:33.450> sometimes<00:01:34.260> they<00:01:34.530> are<00:01:34.710> gonna<00:01:34.920> be

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
inches sometimes they are gonna be

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.800 
inches sometimes they are gonna be
measured<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.580> millimeters<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.360> if<00:01:36.480> you<00:01:36.600> look

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
measured in millimeters so if you look

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990 
measured in millimeters so if you look
on<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.020> website<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.680> don't<00:01:37.920> see<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
on the website and you don't see the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.300 
on the website and you don't see the
particular<00:01:39.540> size<00:01:39.810> measures<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.620> in<00:01:40.860> inches

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
particular size measures out in inches

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.610 
particular size measures out in inches
convert<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.420> millimeters<00:01:43.080> and<00:01:43.260> how<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.410> do

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
convert it to millimeters and how you do

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.850 
convert it to millimeters and how you do
that<00:01:43.800> as<00:01:44.730> you<00:01:44.970> simply<00:01:45.330> take<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.410> Mark<00:01:46.680> out

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
that as you simply take and Mark out

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.650 
that as you simply take and Mark out
let's<00:01:47.130> say<00:01:47.280> for<00:01:47.460> example<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:47.910> your<00:01:48.210> adapter

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
let's say for example that your adapter

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.900 
let's say for example that your adapter
was<00:01:48.870> 6<00:01:49.140> inches<00:01:49.320> across

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
was 6 inches across

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.940 
was 6 inches across
you<00:01:50.910> would<00:01:51.090> make<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.330> mark<00:01:51.690> at<00:01:51.840> 0<00:01:52.140> make<00:01:52.620> a<00:01:52.650> mark

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
you would make a mark at 0 make a mark

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.240 
you would make a mark at 0 make a mark
at<00:01:53.070> 6<00:01:53.370> and<00:01:53.670> then<00:01:54.540> turn<00:01:54.750> around<00:01:54.900> and<00:01:55.260> measure

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
at 6 and then turn around and measure

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.980 
at 6 and then turn around and measure
the<00:01:56.520> same<00:01:56.760> line<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.150> you<00:01:57.300> would<00:01:57.420> draw<00:01:57.630> out<00:01:57.660> in

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
the same line that you would draw out in

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.300 
the same line that you would draw out in
millimeters<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.830> will<00:01:59.010> tell<00:01:59.160> you<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
millimeters and this will tell you the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.960 
millimeters and this will tell you the
conversion<00:01:59.910> on<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:01.890> six<00:02:02.190> lug<00:02:02.370> wheel<00:02:02.550> adapter

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
conversion on a six lug wheel adapter

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.050 
conversion on a six lug wheel adapter
again<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:04.620> very<00:02:04.890> simple<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.610> take<00:02:05.820> from

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
again it's very simple just take from

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.499 
again it's very simple just take from
the<00:02:06.210> outside<00:02:06.980> stud<00:02:07.980> to<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.700> outside<00:02:09.179> stud

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
the outside stud to the outside stud

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.660 
the outside stud to the outside stud
straight<00:02:10.050> across<00:02:10.259> measure<00:02:11.070> from<00:02:11.340> Center<00:02:11.610> to

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
straight across measure from Center to

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.050 
straight across measure from Center to
Center

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
Center

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.190 
Center
that<00:02:12.570> will<00:02:12.750> give<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.020> measurement

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
that will give you the measurement

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.850 
that will give you the measurement
you're<00:02:13.560> after

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
you're after

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.150 
you're after
on<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.360> five<00:02:15.360> look<00:02:15.630> wheel<00:02:15.840> adapters<00:02:16.320> are<00:02:17.100> a

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
on that five look wheel adapters are a

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.730 
on that five look wheel adapters are a
little<00:02:17.430> different<00:02:18.200> when<00:02:19.200> you're<00:02:19.350> measuring

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
little different when you're measuring

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.190 
little different when you're measuring
you<00:02:19.950> don't<00:02:20.160> have<00:02:20.400> exact<00:02:20.850> opposite<00:02:21.330> studs<00:02:21.630> so

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
you don't have exact opposite studs so

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.120 
you don't have exact opposite studs so
what<00:02:22.350> we're<00:02:22.500> gonna<00:02:22.590> do<00:02:22.800> is<00:02:22.920> we're<00:02:23.070> gonna

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.180 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
measure<00:02:23.460> from<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.390> outside<00:02:24.960> of<00:02:25.260> one<00:02:25.860> stud

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
measure from the outside of one stud

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.660 
measure from the outside of one stud
skip<00:02:27.000> one<00:02:27.240> move<00:02:28.080> across<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.770> next<00:02:28.950> and

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
skip one move across to the next and

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.640 
skip one move across to the next and
measure<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.360> center<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.870> stud<00:02:31.110> that's

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
measure to the center of the stud that's

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.230 
measure to the center of the stud that's
gonna<00:02:31.890> be<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.190> measurement<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.060> need

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
gonna be the measurement that you need

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.140 
gonna be the measurement that you need
on<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.450> again<00:02:33.930> from<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> outside<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:36.120> the

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
on that again from the outside to the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.140 
on that again from the outside to the
center<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:38.160> stud<00:02:38.400> would<00:02:38.610> be<00:02:38.790> what<00:02:39.030> you

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
center of the stud would be what you

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.170 
center of the stud would be what you
would<00:02:39.180> use<00:02:39.420> on<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.690> five<00:02:39.960> lug<00:02:40.970> four<00:02:41.970> lug

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
would use on a five lug four lug

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.720 
would use on a five lug four lug
adapters<00:02:42.630> real<00:02:43.110> easy<00:02:43.320> again<00:02:43.710> just<00:02:44.460> measure

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
adapters real easy again just measure

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.860 
adapters real easy again just measure
straight<00:02:45.510> across<00:02:45.720> from<00:02:46.710> Center<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.340> Center

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
straight across from Center to Center

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.390 
straight across from Center to Center
opposite<00:02:48.870> studs<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.860> will<00:02:50.040> be<00:02:50.190> the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
opposite studs that will be the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.510 
opposite studs that will be the
measurement<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.210> you<00:02:51.360> need
