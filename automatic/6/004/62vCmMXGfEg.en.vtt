now

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:20.780 
now

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.410 
now
the<00:00:21.780> difference<00:00:22.140> with<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.530> stuff<00:00:23.390> there<00:00:24.390> is

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
the difference with this stuff there is

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.030 
the difference with this stuff there is
no<00:00:24.570> inner<00:00:25.290> core<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:27.570> actual<00:00:28.460> braid<00:00:29.460> itself<00:00:30.000> is

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
no inner core the actual braid itself is

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.460 
no inner core the actual braid itself is
the<00:00:32.040> weighty<00:00:32.250> part<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> material<00:00:33.470> which

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
the weighty part of the material which

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.540 
the weighty part of the material which
gives<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.420> lot<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.450> extra<00:00:37.110> benefits<00:00:37.590> as<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.370> can

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
gives a lot of extra benefits as you can

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.270 
gives a lot of extra benefits as you can

see superb lis supple it will conform to

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.490 
see superb lis supple it will conform to
just<00:00:44.700> about<00:00:45.000> anything<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> bottom<00:00:46.200> as

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
just about anything on the bottom as

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.600 
just about anything on the bottom as
long<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.830> give<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.129> little<00:00:47.309> bit<00:00:47.489> of

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
long as you give it a little bit of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.410 
long as you give it a little bit of
slack<00:00:47.820> line<00:00:48.090> as<00:00:48.330> it's<00:00:48.540> sinking<00:00:50.270> the<00:00:51.270> other

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
slack line as it's sinking the other

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
slack line as it's sinking the other
advantage<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.830> when<00:00:53.040> you're<00:00:53.190> splicing

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
advantage is that when you're splicing

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
advantage is that when you're splicing
with<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.620> material

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
with this material

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.240 
with this material
you're<00:00:57.210> not<00:00:57.330> losing<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.199> weight<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:59.129> you

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
you're not losing the weight that you

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.920 
you're not losing the weight that you
would<00:00:59.370> otherwise<00:00:59.610> lose<00:01:00.089> with<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> leg<00:01:00.659> core

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
would otherwise lose with the leg core

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.600 
would otherwise lose with the leg core
so<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.519> ends<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.629> your<00:01:04.379> leader<00:01:04.589> are<00:01:05.339> going<00:01:05.550> to

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
so the ends of your leader are going to

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.290 
so the ends of your leader are going to
be<00:01:05.700> heavier

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
be heavier

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.070 
be heavier
therefore<00:01:07.110> pinning<00:01:07.380> them<00:01:07.530> down<00:01:07.560> even<00:01:07.980> better

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
therefore pinning them down even better

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.390 
therefore pinning them down even better
the<00:01:10.080> other<00:01:12.380> side<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.250> make

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
the other side of that is you can make

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.390 
the other side of that is you can make
the<00:01:14.640> ends<00:01:14.940> even<00:01:15.060> heavier<00:01:15.690> by<00:01:16.530> giving<00:01:16.920> yourself

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
the ends even heavier by giving yourself

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.120 
the ends even heavier by giving yourself
a<00:01:17.580> little<00:01:17.610> much<00:01:18.120> longer<00:01:18.930> splice<00:01:19.909> now<00:01:22.130> throwing

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
a little much longer splice now throwing

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.340 
a little much longer splice now throwing
it<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> water<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:24.630> having<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.079> quick

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
it in the water just having a quick

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.260 
it in the water just having a quick
glance<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:27.590> as<00:01:28.590> soon<00:01:28.829> as<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.130> wet<00:01:29.399> it

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
glance of it as soon as it's wet it

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.980 
glance of it as soon as it's wet it
sinks<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.170> brick<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.490> very<00:01:32.909> very<00:01:33.659> fast

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
sinks like a brick and very very fast

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.880 
sinks like a brick and very very fast
sinking<00:01:37.219> this<00:01:38.219> is<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.909> silk<00:01:39.810> version<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.560> as

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
sinking this is the silk version and as

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.800 
sinking this is the silk version and as
you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.159> see<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:43.350> color<00:01:44.159> changes<00:01:44.789> along<00:01:45.630> its

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
you can see the color changes along its

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.510 
you can see the color changes along its
length<00:01:48.350> so<00:01:49.350> that's<00:01:49.590> going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.859> break<00:01:50.070> up<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
length so that's going to break up the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.300 
length so that's going to break up the
actual<00:01:50.759> line<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.630> your<00:01:52.140> leader<00:01:52.380> lying<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.219> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
actual line of your leader lying on the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.429 
actual line of your leader lying on the
bottom<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:54.210> then<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.539> old<00:01:54.689> famous<00:01:55.170> these

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
bottom and then the old famous these

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.060 
bottom and then the old famous these
Gray's<00:01:55.890> blacks<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.969> paler<00:01:57.930> Gray's<00:01:58.200> just

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
Gray's blacks and paler Gray's just

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.910 
Gray's blacks and paler Gray's just
disappear<00:01:59.810> it<00:02:00.810> also<00:02:00.960> comes<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:03.920> gravel

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
disappear it also comes in gravel

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.020 
disappear it also comes in gravel
version<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.960> also<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.439> weed<00:02:07.920> version<00:02:08.490> they're

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
version and also a weed version they're

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.150 
version and also a weed version they're
all<00:02:09.179> identical<00:02:09.300> insofar<00:02:10.259> as<00:02:10.470> they<00:02:10.830> have<00:02:10.979> no

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
all identical insofar as they have no

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.140 
all identical insofar as they have no
inner<00:02:11.640> core<00:02:11.910> it's<00:02:12.600> all<00:02:13.070> weighted<00:02:14.150> braid

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
inner core it's all weighted braid

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.100 
inner core it's all weighted braid
itself<00:02:16.220> so

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.830 

I<00:02:20.940> defy<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.180> find<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:23.010> lead<00:02:24.010> core<00:02:24.480> as<00:02:25.480> supple

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
I defy you to find a lead core as supple

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.060 
I defy you to find a lead core as supple
as<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.580> go<00:02:27.580> out<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:27.730> try<00:02:28.000> it
