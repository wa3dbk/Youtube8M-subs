00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.960
 Hello everyone It is cheering. 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.860
 I have more news 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:15.210
 When I entered the Court Scott Games site, there was a new picture. 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.139
 At first I did not know what the picture was, 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.060
 I checked 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:24.539
 There was a purple ear structure and a bow tie from the last photo . 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.490
 So the posts of shadow and Freddie saw three money to help Annie What ildeut 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.140
 I used to think it was. 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.950
 And why look too put one away when some hidden in this 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.980
 There's a word on the top that's called AO May. Maybe on my trauma 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.030
 The idea that the ice that was in the dictionary of the plural could be the same word 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.420
 I am 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.410
 2 again, under which it is the word which means circle Worship Preview 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.740
 If you look like you have a word but you see it again , 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.330
 There is a word. Maybe it means that it is also this year. 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.660
 Going to find 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:01:01.260
 I hate bees, and then I have the word 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:06.390
 I'm not telling you about this land incident in 1987. 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:09.689
 Now, let's see from the third one. There are two mouths . 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.439
 Anyway, I see here, but there is another mouth in the mouth, 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.189
 Teeth also do not know whether Tome Bye In addition to needlessly sharp 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:21.600
 And there is something to be emphasized to emphasize. 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:25.710
 Definitely 3 in the tie does not mean the Sonic Yard ride 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.909
 If you look at the part where you can live with the appearance and the various things , 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.600
 I think it's work. 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.049
 Sweaty under the tie is a cute black-and-white speculation, so the farmhouse is cute 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.990
 I saw the removal of the sand in the middle . 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.979
 What else open up a bunch of courses that are specifically 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.670
 This means if the length will be seen together so dirty if she tremendous anger 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.880
 The same language 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.770
 October 30 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:52.490
 7 cd is written once but I was thinking this is all a singular release d 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:56.570
 Not even in the game to play the sounds ahningeot itneungeo meaning apart 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.030
 The word "itv" is more commonly referred to as " first base" or something like that . 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.990
 That song sulk from stone 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:08.079
 The agesc course is really great . It's like having fun with such things in 4 Easter 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.079
 The people who try to tell you more than the people who play
