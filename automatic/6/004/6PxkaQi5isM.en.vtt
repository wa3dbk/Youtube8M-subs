00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
want to better take the weight of the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.689 
want to better take the weight of the
hook<00:00:54.660> out<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.469> make<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.680> very<00:00:56.160> easy<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.920 
hook out and make it very easy for the
fish<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.879> suck<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.300> up<00:00:57.329> off<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> bed<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
fish to suck it up off the bed of the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.020 
fish to suck it up off the bed of the
local<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.410> how<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> hook<00:00:59.370> sitting<00:00:59.760> then<00:00:59.879> is

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
local so how is the hook sitting then is

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.520 
local so how is the hook sitting then is
it<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.480> flat<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> bottom<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.410> it

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
it is it flat on the bottom is it

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.709 
it is it flat on the bottom is it
sitting<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.550> somewhere<00:01:03.000> between<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.539> two

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
sitting up so somewhere between the two

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.469 
sitting up so somewhere between the two
my<00:01:04.199> Viking<00:01:04.710> bit<00:01:04.920> perfect<00:01:05.220> sometimes<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.299> will

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
my Viking bit perfect sometimes I will

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.580 
my Viking bit perfect sometimes I will
fish<00:01:06.659> them<00:01:06.780> sell<00:01:06.960> out<00:01:07.049> right<00:01:07.229> but<00:01:07.439> it's

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
fish them sell out right but it's

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.679 
fish them sell out right but it's
normally<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:07.950> kicked<00:01:08.280> over<00:01:08.460> right<00:01:09.330> okay<00:01:09.630> so

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
normally just kicked over right okay so

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.270 
normally just kicked over right okay so
you've<00:01:09.930> basically<00:01:10.140> taken<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.770> weight<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
you've basically taken the weight of the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.910 
you've basically taken the weight of the
hook<00:01:11.400> away<00:01:11.580> yeah<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.689> not<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.350> buoyant

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
hook away yeah but it's not so buoyant

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.010 
hook away yeah but it's not so buoyant
that<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.310> going<00:01:15.119> all<00:01:15.240> over<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.540> place<00:01:15.750> when

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
that it's going all over the place when

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.660 
that it's going all over the place when
the<00:01:16.110> fish<00:01:16.290> approach<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.860> swim<00:01:17.100> yes<00:01:17.430> but

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
the fish approach the swim yes but

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.490 
the fish approach the swim yes but
definitely<00:01:18.270> not<00:01:18.390> critically<00:01:18.900> balanced<00:01:19.290> right

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
definitely not critically balanced right

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.410 
definitely not critically balanced right
okay<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:19.860> when<00:01:20.220> would<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.400> use<00:01:20.549> when<00:01:21.270> would

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
okay so when would you use when would

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.420 
okay so when would you use when would
you<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.960> as<00:01:22.229> opposed<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.220> what

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
you do that as opposed to just what

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.219 
you do that as opposed to just what
using<00:01:23.880> one<00:01:24.000> straight<00:01:24.299> out<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.720> pages<00:01:24.900> to

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
using one straight out of the pages to

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.050

it's actually you can you can keep
molding<00:02:36.440> in<00:02:36.680> dropping<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.640> whole<00:02:37.820> lump<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.450> it

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
molding in dropping the whole lump in it

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.180 
molding in dropping the whole lump in it
in<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.840> thing<00:02:39.050> of<00:02:39.080> water<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.560> you<00:02:39.620> can<00:02:39.800> see<00:02:39.830> how

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
in a thing of water and you can see how

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.310 
in a thing of water and you can see how
easily<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.120> floats<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.600> surface<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:42.260> you

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
easily it floats to the surface and you

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.380 
easily it floats to the surface and you
want<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:42.770> it's<00:02:42.950> just<00:02:43.250> coming<00:02:43.970> up<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.270> the

want it so it's just coming up to the
surface<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:44.959> then<00:02:45.110> then<00:02:45.410> you<00:02:45.500> know<00:02:45.650> it's

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
surface and then then you know it's

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.080 
surface and then then you know it's
gonna<00:02:45.980> bring<00:02:46.190> by<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.520> time<00:02:46.730> you've<00:02:46.850> added<00:02:46.970> the

gonna bring by the time you've added the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.670 
gonna bring by the time you've added the
hook<00:02:47.240> to<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.780> got<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:47.959> nice<00:02:48.110> steady<00:02:48.380> sink

hook to that you got a nice steady sink

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.380 
hook to that you got a nice steady sink
on<00:02:48.860> it<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.160> it<00:02:49.220> but<00:02:49.370> it's<00:02:49.490> it's<00:02:49.880> not<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.150> way
