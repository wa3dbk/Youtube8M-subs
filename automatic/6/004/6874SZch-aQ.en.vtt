continually maxing out your ranges will

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.040 
continually maxing out your ranges will
never<00:00:23.730> go<00:00:23.880> away<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.359> only<00:00:24.510> drop<00:00:24.810> if<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:24.990> go

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
never go away it only drop if you go

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.450 
never go away it only drop if you go
below<00:00:25.170> 30<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.740> then<00:00:25.980> once<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.189> get<00:00:26.310> back<00:00:26.430> up

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
below 30 and then once you get back up

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.980 
below 30 and then once you get back up
to<00:00:26.640> 100<00:00:26.939> it'll<00:00:27.119> drop<00:00:27.300> right<00:00:27.570> it'll<00:00:27.750> it'll

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
to 100 it'll drop right it'll it'll

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.019 
to 100 it'll drop right it'll it'll
appear<00:00:28.320> again<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.429> can<00:00:29.519> also<00:00:29.670> refresh

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
appear again and you can also refresh

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.470 
appear again and you can also refresh
itself<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.890> it<00:00:31.890> has<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.399> 15-percent<00:00:33.090> duration

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
itself to it has a 15-percent duration

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.819 
itself to it has a 15-percent duration
by<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.719> way<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.960> doesn't<00:00:34.079> say<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.440> tooltip

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
by the way it doesn't say on the tooltip

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.709 
by the way it doesn't say on the tooltip
so<00:00:35.399> if<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.670> don't<00:00:35.910> use<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.090> rage<00:00:36.360> up<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:36.660> 15

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
so if you don't use that rage up for 15

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.180 
so if you don't use that rage up for 15
seconds<00:00:37.230> somehow<00:00:37.500> then<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.890> will<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.010> go

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
seconds somehow then it will just go

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.080 
seconds somehow then it will just go
wait<00:00:38.309> its<00:00:38.460> own<00:00:38.610> ok<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:41.430> next<00:00:41.460> ability<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.000> when

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
wait its own ok the next ability of when

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.660 
wait its own ok the next ability of when
a<00:00:42.120> show<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.379> heroic<00:00:43.379> leap<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> cool

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
a show is heroic leap this is a cool

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.619 
a show is heroic leap this is a cool
when<00:00:44.820> I'm<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.090> go<00:00:45.149> ahead<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.390> show<00:00:45.480> this

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.450 
when I'm going to go ahead and show this
off<00:00:45.780> now<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.260> leaves<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.890> air<00:00:47.129> toward<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
off now it leaves the air toward the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.190 
off now it leaves the air toward the
target<00:00:47.610> location<00:00:47.820> what<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.870> do<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.170> just

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
target location what you do is you just

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.080 
target location what you do is you just
target<00:00:49.620> here<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.890> any<00:00:50.039> AoE<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.940> has<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
target here like any AoE it has a

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.450 
target here like any AoE it has a
minimum<00:00:51.420> range<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:51.960> see<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.469> also<00:00:52.980> has<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
minimum range you can see and also has a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.369 
minimum range you can see and also has a
nice<00:00:53.730> long<00:00:54.180> maximum<00:00:54.629> range<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.899> show<00:00:55.050> how<00:00:55.170> long

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
nice long maximum range to show how long

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.639 
nice long maximum range to show how long
this<00:00:55.530> range<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:58.340> all<00:00:59.340> the<00:01:00.149> way<00:01:00.300> out<00:01:00.329> there<00:01:00.649> so

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
this range is all the way out there so

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.290 
this range is all the way out there so
it's<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.829> very<00:01:02.039> long<00:01:02.219> range<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.120> you'd

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
it's a very long range and you'd

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.640 
it's a very long range and you'd
actually<00:01:03.420> leap<00:01:03.690> through<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.840> air<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.229> wave

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
devs promise that this will stay

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.610

balanced<00:02:58.090> so<00:02:58.390> this<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.570> purely<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:59.049> stylistic

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
balanced so this is purely a stylistic

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.259 
balanced so this is purely a stylistic
choice<00:02:59.829> do<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.489> like<00:03:00.670> one<00:03:00.850> handers<00:03:01.120> do<00:03:01.209> you

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
choice do you like one handers do you

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.460 
choice do you like one handers do you
like<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.570> handers<00:03:01.870> that's<00:03:02.049> pretty<00:03:02.230> much<00:03:02.320> what

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
like to handers that's pretty much what

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.809 
like to handers that's pretty much what
comes<00:03:02.650> down<00:03:02.859> to<00:03:03.040> okay

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
comes down to okay

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.149 
comes down to okay
hopefully<00:03:05.719> they<00:03:05.870> do<00:03:05.930> keep<00:03:06.170> it<00:03:06.349> balanced<00:03:06.980> as

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
hopefully they do keep it balanced as

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.410 
hopefully they do keep it balanced as

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.149 
promised I have no way to test that
though<00:03:08.569> because<00:03:08.749> my<00:03:09.019> gear<00:03:09.230> is<00:03:09.349> so<00:03:09.590> bad<00:03:09.799> that

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
though because my gear is so bad that

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.520 
though because my gear is so bad that
i'm<00:03:10.310> sure<00:03:10.549> it<00:03:10.730> is<00:03:10.879> not<00:03:11.269> related<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.170> balance<00:03:12.439> at

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
i'm sure it is not related to balance at

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.569 
i'm sure it is not related to balance at
all<00:03:12.650> okay<00:03:13.189> so<00:03:13.909> that's<00:03:14.389> it<00:03:14.659> for<00:03:14.689> fury<00:03:15.579> okay

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579
