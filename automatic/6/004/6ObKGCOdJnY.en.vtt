00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:14.490
 such a question as we wear a collar 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.529
 as a motive there is no peace sat in the chair with us 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.990
 this side of the chair pedal can be 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.990
 once the country will come here will have 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.019
 pedal by the chair and many do not know 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.029
 resurrected need to raise if you are us 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.039
 stepped on the pedal chair with us 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.289
 descend 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.469
 if we donâ€™t click on 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.610
 foot pedal is not until the end nothing will 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.379
 do not fully begin to press the chair 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.600
 Us begins to rise as a rule 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.649
 hairdressing chairs 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 hydraulic tape for this get up 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.969
 no need if i'm angry at the chair that understand 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.489
 you just have to pull the handle, I do not 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.989
 move up barber chair 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.840
 hydraulic then collar 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.270
 we are here on the collar of blue stripes 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.359
 on the one hand flirting strip on the other 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.830
 method we take glue with a side in itself 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:06.659
 stretch then dress collar here 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.479
 so we can glue 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.299
 We can do this side we can 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.800
 make them near pepper is big 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.820
 does not matter 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.380
 then we take a peignoir and by no means 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:26.140
 I do not recommend doing this movement 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.690
 that neighbors may be hair up to these 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.000
 hair can rise 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.140
 Here we take peignoir face 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.800
 suits the client 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.230
 peignoir and then go already behind and straight 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.140
 on the collar 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.570
 for 100 button this take evil 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.660
 clamps between each other and everything turns out 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.400
 hanging out here doing wrong with us 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.310
 here is a special clamp chip which 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.500
 gets dressed here is missing and the other side 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:01.660
 the same we lower the collar 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.810
 that's not in the world so probably without 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.630
 pumping 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.060
 it means a collar why do we need a side cut 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.180
 First of all, it is primarily hygiene 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.730
 because we have a peignoir here at the client 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.489
 clothes what then are the five with the body not 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.940
 contact here clothes may not 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.940
 be 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.430
 if she let a turtleneck somehow we 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.560
 take it dies because if 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.480
 there will be a turtleneck she will not fall 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.910
 fine hair then everything will be well a 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.690
 collar it serves as a hygienic 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.390
 Such a thing only through 3 n and if 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.590
 we dress detects the menu and then 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.590
 collar on not of courses
