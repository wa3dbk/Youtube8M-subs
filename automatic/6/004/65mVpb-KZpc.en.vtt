I'm<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.990> great<00:00:25.470> tree<00:00:25.830> lover<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.430> I'm<00:00:26.580> often

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
I'm a great tree lover so I'm often

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.120 
I'm a great tree lover so I'm often
observing<00:00:27.810> what's<00:00:28.230> going<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.650> around<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
observing what's going on around the

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.279 
observing what's going on around the
trees<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.609> everything<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.779> year<00:00:31.050> for<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
trees and everything this year for the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.430 
trees and everything this year for the
first<00:00:31.380> year<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.920> noticed<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.610> trees<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.440> when

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
first year I noticed the trees and when

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.280 
first year I noticed the trees and when
they<00:00:34.530> were<00:00:34.620> coming<00:00:34.890> into<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.219> spring<00:00:35.579> growth

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
they were coming into this spring growth

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.260 
they were coming into this spring growth
earlier<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.410> year<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.829> thought<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.579> 2011

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
earlier in the year and thought in 2011

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.799 
earlier in the year and thought in 2011
they<00:00:39.690> were<00:00:39.750> very<00:00:39.960> late<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.620> come<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.809> then

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
they were very late to come in and then

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.470 
they were very late to come in and then
I<00:00:42.989> noticed<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.590> December<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.910> formation<00:00:45.420> of

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
I noticed in December the formation of

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.319 
I noticed in December the formation of
paper<00:00:45.750> forms<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> tree<00:00:46.789> which<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.000> thought

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
paper forms on the tree which I thought

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.090 
paper forms on the tree which I thought
was<00:00:48.450> rather<00:00:48.690> unusual<00:00:49.579> we've<00:00:50.579> now<00:00:50.789> got<00:00:52.100> mature

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
was rather unusual we've now got mature

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.720 
was rather unusual we've now got mature
acorns<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.270> actual<00:00:54.570> trees<00:00:55.579> but<00:00:56.579> we've

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
acorns on the actual trees but we've

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.180 
acorns on the actual trees but we've
also<00:00:56.910> fought<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.570> called<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.829> we've<00:00:58.980> got

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
also fought a called for so we've got

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.970 
also fought a called for so we've got
right<00:00:59.489> acorns<00:01:00.210> falling<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.050> figuring<00:01:01.620> I'll

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
right acorns falling and figuring I'll

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.470 
right acorns falling and figuring I'll
take<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.370> down<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.640> show<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.910> some<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.210> them

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
take you down and show you some of them

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.609 
take you down and show you some of them
on<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.989> ground<00:01:04.430> along<00:01:05.430> with<00:01:05.640> many<00:01:05.850> other

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
on the ground along with many other

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.380 
on the ground along with many other
leaves<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.040> falling<00:01:08.460> we've<00:01:08.580> got<00:01:08.790> lots

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
leaves that are falling we've got lots

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.120 
leaves that are falling we've got lots
of<00:01:09.659> autumn<00:01:10.080> leaves<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.590> we're<00:01:10.740> still<00:01:10.979> and

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
of autumn leaves and we're still and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.810 
of autumn leaves and we're still and
summer<00:01:11.430> guys<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.930> pretty<00:01:13.110> hard<00:01:13.470> to

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
summer guys so this is pretty hard to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.399 
summer guys so this is pretty hard to
dismiss<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.030> type<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.360> evidence<00:01:15.630> now<00:01:16.140> I

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
dismiss this type of evidence now I

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.830 
dismiss this type of evidence now I
think<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:18.409> is<00:01:19.409> an<00:01:19.590> example<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:20.659> it's<00:01:21.659> not

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
think it's is an example of one it's not

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.330 
think it's is an example of one it's not
just<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> oak<00:01:22.320> trees<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.830> are<00:01:22.860> doing<00:01:23.220> this

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
just the oak trees that are doing this

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.070 
just the oak trees that are doing this
there<00:01:23.580> are<00:01:23.610> many<00:01:23.939> deciduous<00:01:24.570> trees<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.049> are

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
there are many deciduous trees that are

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.100 
there are many deciduous trees that are
showing<00:01:25.350> extremely<00:01:26.130> early<00:01:26.369> signs<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.210> season

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
showing extremely early signs of season

been<00:02:07.140> down<00:02:07.320> here<00:02:07.560> for<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.770> little<00:02:07.920> while<00:02:08.160> now

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
been down here for a little while now

been down here for a little while now
mature<00:02:09.420> acorns<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.290> tree<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.649> February

mature acorns of the tree in February
i'm<00:02:13.860> calculating<00:02:14.430> it's<00:02:15.000> around<00:02:15.330> two<00:02:15.720> months

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
i'm calculating it's around two months

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.300 
i'm calculating it's around two months
out<00:02:16.550> so<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.820> this<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.590> beginning<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.100> pole

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
out so is this the beginning of the pole

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.070 
out so is this the beginning of the pole
sure<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.030> just<00:02:21.180> going<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.420> be<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.540> gradual

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
sure of it just going to be a gradual

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.070 
sure of it just going to be a gradual
thing<00:02:22.200> that's<00:02:22.740> going<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.070> occur<00:02:23.910> perhaps<00:02:24.480> over

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
thing that's going to occur perhaps over

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.370 
thing that's going to occur perhaps over
it<00:02:25.980> started<00:02:26.520> last<00:02:26.550> year<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:27.510> can<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.050> still

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
it started last year so can it still

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.290 
it started last year so can it still
going<00:02:28.590> now<00:02:28.800> they're<00:02:29.040> just<00:02:29.070> going<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.370> take<00:02:30.000> you

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
going now they're just going to take you

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
know a few months to occur and be

know a few months to occur and be
gradual<00:02:34.370> who<00:02:35.370> knows<00:02:35.550> but<00:02:35.820> it's<00:02:35.880> worth<00:02:36.300> keeping

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
gradual who knows but it's worth keeping

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.270 
gradual who knows but it's worth keeping
your<00:02:36.780> eye<00:02:36.810> on<00:02:36.959> because<00:02:37.410> typically<00:02:37.860> been<00:02:38.100> a
