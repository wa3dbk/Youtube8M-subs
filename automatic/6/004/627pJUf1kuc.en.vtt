00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
I'm gonna be dying this hair burgundy

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.340 
I'm gonna be dying this hair burgundy
what<00:00:35.430> I've<00:00:35.550> done<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:36.059> I've<00:00:36.719> wet<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.140> hair

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
what I've done is I've wet the hair

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.490 
what I've done is I've wet the hair
because<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.890> found<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.879> me<00:00:39.090> personally

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
because I found that for me personally

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.830 
because I found that for me personally
it's<00:00:40.500> easier<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.670> put<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.600> bleach<00:00:43.260> powder<00:00:43.860> mix

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
it's easier to put the bleach powder mix

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.029 
it's easier to put the bleach powder mix
onto<00:00:45.840> wet<00:00:46.079> here<00:00:46.350> rather<00:00:47.010> than<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:48.260> dry<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.800> it

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
onto wet here rather than it's dry so it

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.119 
onto wet here rather than it's dry so it
just<00:00:50.340> goes<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.700> lot<00:00:50.940> easier<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:51.750> me<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.649> this

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
just goes on a lot easier for me so this

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.160 
just goes on a lot easier for me so this
is<00:00:53.309> what<00:00:53.460> I'll<00:00:53.550> be<00:00:53.670> using<00:00:53.699> today<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.600> bleach
