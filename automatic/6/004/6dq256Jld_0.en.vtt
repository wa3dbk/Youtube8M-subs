 access to who I tell this video I 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.330
 I want to show you here a lot 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.119
 this limited edition of 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.550
 Alpha pokémon your daughter I bought from 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.949
 europe at the end of last year 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.580
 as soon as the the game launched in Europe I 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.990
 I ordered this physical version and 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.880
 unfortunately it only came now in the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.279
 end of January almost February this 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.440
 crap was coming then I can 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.170
 show you only now this edition is not 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.120
 Special it comes the game and a style one 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.280
 book, then it's nothing from another world 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.600
 But it's cool for those who like 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.570
 franchise for those who like to collect 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.640
 these things I think it's cool that in 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.450
 front are a box of 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.670
 cardboard 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.100
 it comes in this cardboard box more or 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.050
 less like deer that tips the belt games 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.760
 of nintendo that comes this way is the combo of 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.800
 bayonetta 1 but noisy two that I 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.809
 I do not know you here in the channel either. 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.149
 it comes in a cardboard box like that 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.840
 It's the European version, I'm not sure. 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.970
 which in the United States is like that too 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.549
 here in front has a very 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.860
 similar to normal game né pokémon 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.310
 his daughter here side 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.610
 We only have the name of the game here. 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.509
 on the spine né show and here from ufop to 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.450
 you 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.530
 beauty and eye focus on Pokemon 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.970
 underneath there is nothing 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.119
 on the other side has only the name of the game 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.070
 also here in the upper part we have 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.299
 is that the motion that comes a game over this 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.759
 a book on the back shows here not 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.720
 it is a tradition here ancestral powers 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:49.110
 were reminded that the team 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.329
 aqua shows that the pikachu cosplay shows 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.820
 here's a mega sound near here too 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.820
 appears the kayl gaga and the pokémons 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.399
 initials and sic bases not too much 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.909
 had come cool down here then 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.850
 This is the box from the outside, right? 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.119
 opening up here we have access 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:13.800
 So the main one that we bought 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:17.090
 that is the logical game and notice that 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.280
 the game it comes with a blue box 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.510
 different from the American version 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.830
 I'll show you the version 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.400
 American remembering that this pokémon 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.770
 half robe he'll be drawn, okay I'll go 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.820
 to draw on my 9th birthday 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.460
 of February 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.620
 so pay attention to the channel that goes 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.060
 will have the draw so you will not 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.020
 He participated in a look at the description 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.780
 that I'll leave a link to the video 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.350
 where I talk this draw is more 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.080
 on here 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.250
 the pokémon handle son that is what comes in 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.760
 box is 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.350
 also here comes a timbu cnec 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.630
 That 's what I told you before we go. 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.370
 to enter unpacking myself 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.740
 I'll show you a little more detail 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.630
 Things go there beauty, I'll start. 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.630
 showing you here 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.170
 the same game in the European version of 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.970
 blue box and as always we have 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.830
 one opens easily here on the side that 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.990
 help remove this protective plastic 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.610
 with a little more ease 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.600
 thing that always ask me how much 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.310
 I paid're here it was more or less 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.830
 50 pounds a little less 50 pounds 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.760
 with freight equaling more or less 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.209
 200 reais 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.260
 I was not taxed by the federal revenue 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.209
 right here on the back of the box 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.350
 shows exactly what's in the box there 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.570
 of cardboard 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.120
 here on the spine also has only the name of the 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.739
 game has the colorful stamp here on 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.430
 corner but all games are part 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.920
 has this in front is equal to the 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:45.120
 American version so to speak a lot 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.690
 similar and inside we have the logical game of 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.420
 keefe had as always here on the side has 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.160
 club code understand and let's club 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.690
 nintendo will end now at the end of 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.580
 year right 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:01.680
 in one of the games advertisements like 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.420
 always a handbook on cool things and 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.610
 everything else does not have more 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.590
 colorful beautiful as we had 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.860
 formerly in this black and white manual 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.950
 bland with a security warning but 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.320
 here is the tape in the version 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.690
 European attack is very much like 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.600
 with the American version to say 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.950
 equal beauty remembering that 3ds has 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.190
 region lock 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.600
 then this version of the game here is 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.970
 compatible with only one 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.880
 sollys da europa is then who is from 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.370
 portugal of the united kingdom can use eu 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.150
 I can use it just because the European 3ds are 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:42.930
 I did not register or bought a first 3ds 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:45.240
 there in Holland then why the 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.910
 My father in this European game is c'mon. 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.410
 leave the game box behind and 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.320
 Now I'll show you the part. 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.140
 really interesting aside who is the 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.210
 brazil she did not know the style 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.070
 book exists a book has not been released in 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.720
 in the United States as far as I know a lot 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.580
 less in Brazil, right? 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.950
 so it's very interesting what's cool 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.710
 Of him this book is that shine is that 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.870
 super bright I have a light here in 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.490
 which increases a little brightness but 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.820
 I can really assure you that he 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.530
 it's very dangerous even here where it opens is 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.480
 simple here 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.230
 on the other side the timbu that would be front 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.030
 of the style that has the entire 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.860
 There is nothing written on my back that I 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.100
 I think it's a really bad tap that should have 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.400
 written here on the spine pokémon barely makes 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.230
 the son so I found it a little lazy 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.950
 who has not written anything but okay 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.510
 here is your book inside it poor 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.080
 to show you 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:47.820
 we have here kyle gallner doing that 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:51.810
 normal fight right there're quiet the 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.400
 two fighting fiercely beauty then it is 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.440
 What we have here in this book is 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:59.490
 what does this look to save a 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:02.610
 game is here, login, get out of here 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.170
 the blue box is not just in europe 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.060
 far as I know that the china was blue 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.890
 maybe in Japan too we 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:12.330
 United States white box 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:15.210
 And then you can pick it up and put it in here. 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.790
 so why this serves only one 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.970
 Packing the beast for your game 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.890
 so for those who like it a lot is a way 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.520
 more special to save a game that 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.500
 You 're a beauty fan, that's not to say. 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.220
 that you spent 200 reais only on that because 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.290
 is 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.630
 I'm still wondering why I did it. 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.400
 This I bought a little on impulse I will 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.770
 Tell you I bought believing that 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.770
 perhaps not so far from the 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:43.139
 launch but it took a lot then 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.789
 That's why I ended up showing you the 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:46.710
 game I bought in the digital version is that 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:48.539
 was the omega ruby ​​just like daughter 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.699
 It took me a long time, maybe I'll end up doing 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:52.259
 series ae assaf to show you 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:54.900
 It's also not because I have both 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:56.729
 versions but for now not by 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.650
 While I do not intend to do let's focus 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:01.110
 some things in the game that have not yet 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.940
 I'll show you until I do again. 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.780
 Frequent videos of Pokemon 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:09.210
 competitive that I miss you 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.639
 but this was then the steel book of 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.740
 pokémon to the fafe that I think it was 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:15.810
 exclusive of japan and europe 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.449
 If I'm wrong, please tell me. 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:20.970
 there in the comments good beauty 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:22.680
 Thank you so much for watching, do not forget. 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:25.319
 let the extra little ladybird of 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.789
 always come back to mister clothes place one 

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:29.659
 strong hug luca until the next video 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:29.659
 went
