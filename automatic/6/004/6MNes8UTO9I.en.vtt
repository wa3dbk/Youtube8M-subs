not<00:00:20.310> too<00:00:20.580> weird<00:00:22.580> this<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.789> best<00:00:23.970> my<00:00:24.090> little

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
not too weird this is the best my little

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.910 
not too weird this is the best my little
camera<00:00:24.539> can<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:28.050> rubber<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.470> actually<00:00:28.619> in

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
pretty good shape so I don't think the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.840

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
stock rims I've got two other ones and I

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.109 
stock rims I've got two other ones and I
just<00:01:46.049> kept<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.259> tire<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.770> back<00:01:46.850> not<00:01:47.850> sure

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
just kept the tire on the back not sure

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.399 
just kept the tire on the back not sure
if<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.360> lights<00:01:48.570> work<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.990> don't<00:01:49.170> have<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
if the lights work I don't have the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.950 
if the lights work I don't have the
proper<00:01:49.619> plug<00:01:50.060> but<00:01:51.060> my<00:01:51.180> guess<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.810> put

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
proper plug but my guess is if you put

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.080 
proper plug but my guess is if you put
the<00:01:52.049> right<00:01:52.200> plug<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.619> there<00:01:52.920> or<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:53.970> good

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the right plug on there or be in good

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.550 
the right plug on there or be in good
