00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.020
 there are many around us 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:16.240
 curved things the saltcell is bent in 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:21.130
 rivers but did you know that light too 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:24.390
 bent but not the light itself but the way 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.390
 which is distributed in space 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.900
 it may seem strange but many of 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.039
 we see it every day putting on glasses 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.039
 or contact lenses 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.410
 this object is specially committed to such 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.000
 shape so that the light is correctly focused 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.710
 on the retina of our eyes 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.730
 allowing us to see more clearly 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.440
 can you give an example of how 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.449
 warp the path of light in the evening if you 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.579
 looked at the horizon at sunset maybe 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.030
 did you notice the sun look bigger 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.229
 oval than round that is you see 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.229
 distortion of the image of the sun 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.640
 case of glasses or contact lenses a piece 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.039
 glass or plastic bends the way 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.630
 spread of light but the case of sunset 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.630
 Earth's atmosphere becomes a lens 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:17.069
 the thicker the layer of the atmosphere the stronger 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.600
 the sun bends 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:21.340
 so the sun looks flatter 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.440
 when it approaches the horizon and 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.289
 better light goes through more and more 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.000
 and more layer of the atmosphere 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.560
 even though the sun is visible to us 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.479
 as an oval, we know that it is always 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.950
 the spheres remain since 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.590
 a distance of about 150 million 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.049
 kilometers away from us speaking of space 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.640
 generally the way that spreads 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.920
 light can be bent in much 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.330
 large scale near the largest 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.459
 objects in the universe of the early 20th century 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.200
 albert einstein predicted that very 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:53.019
 massive objects can bend themselves 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.310
 space and if it is so light flying 

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:58.569
 through this space will 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.739
 spread along a curve and as in 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.910
 many other cases 

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:06.129
 Einstein was right today we see 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.780
 many examples of what scientists 

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:10.330
 called gravitational lenses 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.590
 when light from distant galaxies passes 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.580
 let's say through a massive cluster 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.500
 galaxies 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.849
 this cluster act on him like 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.800
 the lens as a result we see elongated 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.280
 distorted and enlarged images 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.230
 arc galaxies scientists used 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.450
 gravitational lenses to study 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.870
 the effects of the mysterious substance of the dark 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.870
 matter 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.629
 so remember next time when you 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.900
 driving along a winding road that also 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.670
 can bend and a ray of light is 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.590
 curvature gives us even more than 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.920
 correction of visual defects or 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.780
 optical illusions here on earth with his 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.190
 help you can get information about 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.710
 objects which are located on 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.540
 distances in a billion holy 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.740
 their years from us help better understand 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.740
 the nature of the universe itself 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.950
