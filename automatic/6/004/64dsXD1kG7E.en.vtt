00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.130
 infobox and later at the end of the video 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.790
 yes again somewhere you will 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.790
 then find 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.120
 I have the theme story of 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.649
 lipstickes very exciting we are 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.159
 us today in school and 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:10.290
 board members rainer makes a presentation yes 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.759
 I would like to do that for a very short time 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.829
 I have now where the 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.009
 funniest or interesting things 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.149
 Picked and yes I try that 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.909
 now so a little free to tell 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.499
 and I hope I can manage that well 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.229
 together over the stage and that really 

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:27.569
 too boring so the lipstick has 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.869
 last year's birthday i know 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.329
 not if she is only 125 years old 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.579
 become 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:40.709
 since his official birthday the 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:43.139
 then 1883 was and that became the 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:45.119
 Lipstick there in Amsterdam on the 

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:47.099
 world exhibition if not everything 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.520
 deceive let me take my notes again 

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:54.359
 look in the on the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.979
 world exhibition presented and indeed 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:02:00.349
 That's just what I think three 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.310
 components - oil here and sidewalk 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:04.409
 Beeswax and there was wrapped 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.899
 just recovered a paper I found 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.520
 it's so funny everywhere I am 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.869
 was read somehow the saw 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.970
 like a weenie 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.459
 we would have a kiss on the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.099
 Lubricate lips in any case that was 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.099
 so the first official lipstick and 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.540
 before that there were probably also of course in 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.190
 3000 before Christ probably have the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.600
 Egyptian already dyed 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.210
 lip balm applied to the lips 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.930
 in the Middle Ages it should hardly be 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.150
 have given cosmetics 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.890
 but a pity in the baroque then again in the 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.810
 then you will probably have baroque time again 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.130
 started to make up while I was 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.270
 believe women have always been 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.450
 make-up that maybe theaten that 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.490
 secretly made in any case as 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.410
 the first lipstick was born 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.880
 Of course, everyone was super excited 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.060
 At first it was probably just red 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.140
 sounded 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.290
 and of course they have that 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.670
 assortment sort of a bit like that 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.150
 expanded or think I 'm here now 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.640
 now pink and pink or son 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.540
 black and green 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.240
 think twice about the ones you have earlier 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.480
 worn black lipstick or green 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:21.150
 and greens must probably the racer in paris 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:24.670
 been with the artists and 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.959
 this layer is definitely green 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.880
 I can not do lipstick 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:32.410
 imagine black then sooner 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.120
 when I make my rounds as a vampire 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.500
 want and somehow the red with black 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.880
 the whole thing wants to darken than me 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.620
 then, of course, over time 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.150
 developed as you can imagine 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.110
 otherwise we would not be with him anymore 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.820
 lipstick of today 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.920
 it probably has just about 50 years 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.380
 Took it to somehow times of 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.820
 the red black is when one of them 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.069
 bit away and then sometimes 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.670
 different colors 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.989
 the pink and pink it was about 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.689
 in the 1930s 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:07.290
 then there was a bright pink and a 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:09.200
 gaudy fuchsia tone so that's what 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.189
 is self-evident today 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.889
 and there they are again 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:18.090
 got away from the red what earlier yes 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.410
 Every day I had red lips 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.220
 say it again today if I am now 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.419
 so on the street which looks again here 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:30.840
 and of course that used to be normal 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:32.070
 it definitely has somehow yes 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.759
 took a long time until the 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.560
 lipstick to germany came for 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.620
 Keep boring three more now 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.470
 things that I find very interesting 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.800
 In 1910 , the lipstick was first introduced in 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.380
 a metal sleeve plugged what was before 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:54.620
 I can not afford the lipstick 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:57.240
 imagine outside my packaging 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:01.409
 1948 was the first time in 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.720
 turning mechanism so before it has to 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:06.570
 I should have no idea 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:12.110
 and then what I still found funny 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:15.150
 the first time in london 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.419
 the nail polish colors to the lipstick 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.919
 colors has adjusted and vice versa find 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.580
 I'm super, I'm so one 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:26.220
 a bit of a guy who likes everything 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.320
 has to fit together so i think that was 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.940
 Of course, there is still such a thing 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.070
 much more to tell about the 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.009
 lipstick grad which colors were 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.389
 were getting popular 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:38.789
 when is it first time in germany? 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:43.139
 really turned up and was born 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:47.670
 that has to be around the first world war 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:50.580
 have been as I read this now 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.900
 and yes, but I wanted to be brief 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.510
 so you do not get bored 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:59.190

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:01.350
