one active in the current call I can see

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.920 
one active in the current call I can see
that<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.279> Alexei<00:00:33.920> to<00:00:34.920> add<00:00:35.160> pause<00:00:35.690> non<00:00:36.690> at

group<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.219> useful<00:00:41.700> for<00:00:42.000> example<00:00:42.420> let's<00:00:42.600> say

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
group is useful for example let's say

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.540 
group is useful for example let's say
I'm<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.960> shift<00:00:43.290> manager<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.129> support

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
I'm the shift manager of the support

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.819 
I'm the shift manager of the support
group<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.000> don't<00:00:45.480> need<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.899> see<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:46.320> these

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
group I don't need to see all these

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.729 
group I don't need to see all these
agents<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.850> only<00:00:48.000> see<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.690> only<00:00:49.020> need<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.410> see<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
agents I only see I only need to see the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.170 
agents I only see I only need to see the
agent<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.070> belong<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.520> my<00:00:50.789> group<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
agent that belong to my group the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.229 
agent that belong to my group the
support<00:00:51.629> group<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.050> could<00:00:52.410> select<00:00:52.649> support

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.779 

now<00:01:00.239> you'll<00:01:00.449> see<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.590> list<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.280> much

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
now you'll see that this list is much

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.270 
now you'll see that this list is much
older<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.600> only<00:01:03.899> see<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.199> sub<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.830> support

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
older I can only see the sub the support

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.810 
older I can only see the sub the support
agent<00:01:05.909> members<00:01:06.979> down<00:01:07.979> below<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
agent members down below I can see the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.140 
agent members down below I can see the
agent<00:01:09.180> exception<00:01:09.689> stub<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.200> open<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:11.150> this

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
agent exception stub I open it up this

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.899 
agent exception stub I open it up this
is<00:01:12.390> very<00:01:12.630> useful<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:13.409> example<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.729> see

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
is very useful for example to see

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.999 
is very useful for example to see
exceptions<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:16.080> could<00:01:16.409> set<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.619> up<00:01:16.770> for

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
exceptions so I could set it up for

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.140 
exceptions so I could set it up for
different<00:01:17.220> Department

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
different Department

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.390 
different Department
each<00:01:18.509> department<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.500> its<00:01:19.680> its<00:01:20.189> own

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
each department can have its its own

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.609 
each department can have its its own
values<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:21.570> example<00:01:21.990> for<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.259> support

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
values so for example for the support

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.980 
values so for example for the support
department<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.340> specify<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.540> want<00:01:24.689> this

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
department I specify that I want this

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.350 
department I specify that I want this
list<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.409> show<00:01:25.619> all<00:01:25.890> agents<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:27.210> are

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
list to show all agents that that are

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.960 
list to show all agents that that are
currently<00:01:27.780> over<00:01:28.020> ten<00:01:28.380> minutes<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.829> pause<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.490> I

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
currently over ten minutes a pause so I

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.880 
currently over ten minutes a pause so I
can<00:01:30.240> see<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.540> alone<00:01:30.869> has<00:01:31.079> been<00:01:31.259> at<00:01:31.380> pause<00:01:31.590> for

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
can see that alone has been at pause for

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.450 
can see that alone has been at pause for
17<00:01:32.400> minutes<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:33.530> also<00:01:34.530> set<00:01:34.860> up<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.189> want<00:01:35.340> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
17 minutes I also set up that I want to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.670 
17 minutes I also set up that I want to
see<00:01:35.610> all<00:01:35.850> active<00:01:36.360> calls<00:01:36.630> attacker<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.470> are

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
see all active calls attacker that are

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.890 
see all active calls attacker that are
over<00:01:38.159> five<00:01:38.460> minutes<00:01:38.820> long<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.689> see<00:01:39.810> that

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
over five minutes long so I can see that

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.440 
over five minutes long so I can see that
Alexei<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.770> call<00:01:41.009> that's<00:01:41.579> already<00:01:42.150> nine

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
Alexei is in a call that's already nine

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.289 
Alexei is in a call that's already nine
minutes<00:01:42.979> this<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.040> useful<00:01:44.399> for<00:01:44.790> example<00:01:44.850> if

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
minutes this is useful for example if

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.569 
minutes this is useful for example if
you<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> sales<00:01:45.990> call<00:01:46.380> center<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.040> you

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
you have a sales call center and you

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.249 
you have a sales call center and you
want<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.880> see<00:01:48.030> calls<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.509> are<00:01:48.659> over<00:01:49.049> five

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
want to see calls that are over five

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.080 
want to see calls that are over five
minutes<00:01:49.500> because<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.130> think<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.579> over<00:01:50.759> five

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
minutes because you think that over five

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.219 
minutes because you think that over five
minutes<00:01:51.299> are<00:01:51.689> actual<00:01:52.470> sales<00:01:52.799> calls<00:01:54.229> done

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
minutes are actual sales calls done

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.020

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.750 
apply different actions to each agent
for<00:03:02.319> example<00:03:02.769> let's<00:03:02.980> say<00:03:03.129> I<00:03:03.159> have<00:03:03.189> an<00:03:03.400> agent

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
for example let's say I have an agent

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.670 
for example let's say I have an agent
that<00:03:03.819> went<00:03:04.450> home<00:03:04.659> without<00:03:04.989> logging<00:03:05.379> out

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
that went home without logging out

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.500 
that went home without logging out
because<00:03:06.010> he's<00:03:06.189> simply<00:03:06.459> forgot<00:03:06.879> I<00:03:07.090> could<00:03:07.209> log

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
because he's simply forgot I could log

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.000 
because he's simply forgot I could log
him<00:03:07.659> out<00:03:07.810> from<00:03:08.139> here<00:03:08.319> manually<00:03:08.709> by<00:03:08.980> clicking

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
him out from here manually by clicking

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.479 
him out from here manually by clicking
this<00:03:09.549> icon<00:03:10.469> let's<00:03:11.469> say<00:03:11.650> I<00:03:11.680> have<00:03:11.859> an<00:03:11.980> agent<00:03:12.129> that

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
this icon let's say I have an agent that

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.580 
this icon let's say I have an agent that
went<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:12.940> smoke<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.269> cigarette<00:03:13.569> but<00:03:14.079> forgot<00:03:14.440> to

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
went to smoke a cigarette but forgot to

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.369 
went to smoke a cigarette but forgot to
put<00:03:14.829> him<00:03:14.979> on<00:03:15.250> pause<00:03:15.849> so<00:03:16.209> I<00:03:16.239> could<00:03:16.690> also<00:03:16.870> do<00:03:17.169> that

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
put him on pause so I could also do that

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.229 
put him on pause so I could also do that
manually<00:03:17.799> this<00:03:18.099> way<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.489> system<00:03:18.879> will<00:03:19.030> know

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
manually this way the system will know

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.119 
manually this way the system will know
not<00:03:19.599> to<00:03:19.780> deliver<00:03:20.019> calls<00:03:20.379> to<00:03:20.560> this<00:03:20.709> agent

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
not to deliver calls to this agent

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.610 
not to deliver calls to this agent
because<00:03:21.430> it's<00:03:21.579> currently<00:03:21.879> at<00:03:22.030> pause<00:03:22.349> same<00:03:23.349> for
