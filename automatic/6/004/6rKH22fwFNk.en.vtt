 we are stone documentation center

 tuttonapoli 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.680
 this is the particular section looks at the depression source 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.679
 badoo 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.070
 the circuit 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.340
 is maintained 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.700
 the rest of the plant 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.230
 to pressure 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.570
 this transcription of the bank 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.460
 It contains 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.460
 the neruda braking system 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.300
 full of piaggio brakes 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.610
 Dentists 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.850
 in these 3 pannone 3 norway 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.640
 date and front brakes 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.350
 the pressure does not give the rear brakes 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.469
 and that which rests on the posterior shoulder determined by load 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.510

 stickers i like the brake pedal x 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.490
 50 barter pressure on the front brakes I'll see that on the rear brakes 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.490
 what to do 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.950
 if there is a cast on the rear suspension + I can simulate 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.950
 it was this hand pump 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:15.040
 were stronger at 150 bar the pressure on rear brakes on his health 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:23.469
 f50 palaces front brakes but I almost a hundred on the rear brakes 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:26.739
 in this way 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.679
 I can love you 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:30.969
 italy belarus 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.369
 the pressure 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:34.149
 to the rear drums 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:37.149
 the secret of the mechanism and within the tonal 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:40.949
 a cart exists 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:42.699
 that is boxwood 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:47.189
 from this upper piston which is controlled directly by pressure 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.189
 existing in the rear suspension 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.079
 increase 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.879
 the pressure on the rear suspension 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.179
 I can see this cannellino 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:02.459
 moves 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.589
 longitudinally 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:06.699
 dead weight was your mind

 bari aldo 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.599
 the pressure that is exerted on rai2 brake cylinders 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:16.899
 this function 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:18.369
 proportional 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:20.999
 to the one I embrace then be discharged
