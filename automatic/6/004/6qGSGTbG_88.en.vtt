at I assume it's going to be a high
achievement<00:04:42.490> total<00:04:42.850> but<00:04:43.360> that's<00:04:43.540> how<00:04:43.810> that's

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
achievement total but that's how that's

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:50.040 
achievement total but that's how that's
how<00:04:44.260> they<00:04:44.410> look<00:04:44.650> for<00:04:44.950> the<00:04:45.100> radiant<00:04:45.610> set<00:04:49.050> and

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
cannot die them the s because of the

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.100 
cannot die them the s because of the
particle<00:05:03.370> effects<00:05:03.670> and<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:03.910> animations<00:05:04.570> they

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
particle effects and the animations they

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.300 
particle effects and the animations they
wanted<00:05:05.410> to<00:05:05.530> make<00:05:05.650> them<00:05:05.800> really<00:05:05.980> cool-looking

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
wanted to make them really cool-looking

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.550 
wanted to make them really cool-looking
so<00:05:06.760> you<00:05:06.820> can't<00:05:07.150> actually<00:05:07.300> apply<00:05:07.750> any<00:05:07.960> dies<00:05:08.230> to

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
so you can't actually apply any dies to

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.500 
so you can't actually apply any dies to
them<00:05:08.710> so<00:05:08.920> they're<00:05:09.070> set<00:05:09.310> to<00:05:09.340> this<00:05:09.580> color<00:05:09.880> but<00:05:10.480> I

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
them so they're set to this color but I

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.290 
them so they're set to this color but I
think<00:05:10.780> they<00:05:10.900> look<00:05:11.050> pretty<00:05:11.110> cool<00:05:11.470> anyway<00:05:12.300> well

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
think they look pretty cool anyway well

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.430 
think they look pretty cool anyway well
that's<00:05:13.420> going<00:05:13.570> to<00:05:13.660> wrap<00:05:13.750> things<00:05:13.990> up<00:05:14.200> I<00:05:14.350> hope

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
that's going to wrap things up I hope

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.990
