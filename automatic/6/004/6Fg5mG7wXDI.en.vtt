failure is one of the cornerstones of
success<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.829> seems<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.309> an<00:00:53.520> oxymoron<00:00:54.170> and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
success that seems to be an oxymoron and

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.420 
success that seems to be an oxymoron and
it<00:00:55.320> doesn't<00:00:55.590> make<00:00:55.680> any<00:00:55.800> sense

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
it doesn't make any sense

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.670 
it doesn't make any sense
think<00:00:57.390> about<00:00:57.600> Thomas<00:00:58.020> Edison<00:01:00.199> he<00:01:01.199> tried<00:01:01.440> over

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
think about Thomas Edison he tried over

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.349 
think about Thomas Edison he tried over
a<00:01:01.710> thousand<00:01:02.280> filaments<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:02.850> his<00:01:02.969> electric

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
a thousand filaments for his electric

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.910 
a thousand filaments for his electric
light<00:01:03.539> bulb<00:01:03.780> before<00:01:03.960> he<00:01:04.260> found<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.559> right<00:01:04.710> one

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
light bulb before he found the right one

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.969 
light bulb before he found the right one
that<00:01:05.820> means<00:01:06.090> he<00:01:06.210> failed<00:01:06.420> at<00:01:06.630> least<00:01:06.810> 999<00:01:07.770> times

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that means he failed at least 999 times

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.410 
that means he failed at least 999 times
I<00:01:12.650> may<00:01:13.650> break<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.130> record<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.729> think<00:01:15.299> I
