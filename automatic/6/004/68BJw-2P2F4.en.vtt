00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
GPX Black Tiger camel I believe is what

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.700 
GPX Black Tiger camel I believe is what
they're<00:00:11.460> called<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.059> if<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.110> guys<00:00:13.230> did<00:00:13.530> not

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
they're called and if you guys did not

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.990 
they're called and if you guys did not
see<00:00:14.179> they<00:00:15.179> are<00:00:15.929> or<00:00:16.440> she<00:00:16.590> runs<00:00:16.800> GPX<00:00:17.460> again<00:00:17.789> and

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
see they are or she runs GPX again and

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.390 
see they are or she runs GPX again and
GPX<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.930> don't<00:00:19.199> know<00:00:19.350> what<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.859> stands<00:00:20.160> her<00:00:20.279> if

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
GPX I don't know what it stands her if

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.220 
GPX I don't know what it stands her if
you<00:00:20.460> guys<00:00:20.609> do<00:00:21.240> leave<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> comment<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
comment section below and let me know

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.490 
comment section below and let me know
but<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.359> believe<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.779> stands<00:00:25.019> for<00:00:25.109> probably

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
but I believe it stands for probably

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.320 
but I believe it stands for probably
graphic<00:00:25.920> print<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.460> some<00:00:26.519> sort<00:00:26.970> because

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
graphic print of some sort because

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.029 
graphic print of some sort because
obviously<00:00:27.930> it's<00:00:28.320> kind<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.619> graphic<00:00:28.920> print

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
obviously it's kind of a graphic print

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.130 
obviously it's kind of a graphic print
upper<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.789> also<00:00:30.090> there<00:00:30.210> was<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.359> row<00:00:30.779> she<00:00:30.840> run

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
upper and also there was a row she run

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.080 
upper and also there was a row she run
floral<00:00:31.890> pack<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> while<00:00:32.369> ago<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.850> was<00:00:32.940> also

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
floral pack a while ago and it was also

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.450 
floral pack a while ago and it was also
a<00:00:33.239> GPX<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:33.840> well<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.230> probably<00:00:34.980> what<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.250> stands

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
a GPX as well so probably what it stands

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.220 
a GPX as well so probably what it stands
for<00:00:35.579> something<00:00:36.030> related<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.719> but<00:00:37.200> I

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
for something related to that but I

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.709 
for something related to that but I
don't<00:00:37.440> know<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.680> exact<00:00:38.149> words<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.510> but

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
don't know the exact words on that but

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.479 
don't know the exact words on that but
um<00:00:39.840> why<00:00:40.500> don't<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.710> show<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.860> guys<00:00:41.070> these<00:00:41.280> up

know they're kind of weird-looking at

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.880 
know they're kind of weird-looking at
first<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.180> when<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.390> try<00:01:33.600> them<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:33.810> give<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.740> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
first but when you try them on give it a

first but when you try them on give it a
give<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> try<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.880> you'll<00:01:36.720> see<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.079> it's

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
give it a try and you'll see that it's

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.219 
give it a try and you'll see that it's
obviously<00:01:37.590> pretty<00:01:38.220> darn<00:01:38.430> comfortable<00:01:38.640> and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.560 
this area on the toe box it just feels
like<00:01:49.470> you're<00:01:49.979> there's<00:01:50.729> nothing<00:01:51.090> between<00:01:51.240> your

squished<00:01:56.399> together<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.880> just<00:01:57.060> feels<00:01:57.240> like

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
squished together it just feels like

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.300 
squished together it just feels like
you're<00:01:57.509> moving<00:01:57.689> everything<00:01:58.380> freely<00:01:58.890> between

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
you're moving everything freely between

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.670 
you're moving everything freely between
this<00:01:59.850> area<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.780> move<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.380> or<00:02:01.469> your

this area and you can move it or your
toes<00:02:01.860> around<00:02:03.020> but<00:02:04.020> yeah<00:02:04.200> there's<00:02:04.409> somewhat

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
secured I don't I just I don't

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.690 
secured I don't I just I don't
understand<00:02:06.719> quite<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.740> sensation<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.640> a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
understand quite the sensation it's a

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.089 
understand quite the sensation it's a
different<00:02:08.970> sensation<00:02:09.119> then<00:02:09.750> usual<00:02:10.379> but<00:02:11.069> uh

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
different sensation then usual but uh

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.740 
different sensation then usual but uh
but<00:02:11.459> it's<00:02:11.610> definitely<00:02:11.760> kind<00:02:12.090> of

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
but it's definitely kind of

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.570 
but it's definitely kind of
one<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.320> get<00:02:13.500> used<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.010> they<00:02:14.460> are

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
one that you get used to and they are

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.940 
one that you get used to and they are
quite<00:02:14.820> comfortable<00:02:15.410> especially<00:02:16.410> for<00:02:16.890> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
quite comfortable especially for the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.500 
quite comfortable especially for the
price<00:02:17.070> I<00:02:17.370> mean<00:02:17.490> that's<00:02:17.670> really<00:02:18.000> where<00:02:18.210> I<00:02:18.480> think

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
price I mean that's really where I think

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.090 
price I mean that's really where I think
everybody<00:02:19.170> loves<00:02:19.320> these<00:02:19.530> things<00:02:19.770> so<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
everybody loves these things so the

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.550 
everybody loves these things so the
reason<00:02:20.370> why<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.360> because<00:02:21.570> they<00:02:22.020> retail<00:02:22.320> like

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
reason why is because they retail like

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.650 
reason why is because they retail like
seventy<00:02:22.950> dollars<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.430> that's<00:02:23.490> just<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:24.060> great

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
seventy dollars and that's just a great

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.890 
seventy dollars and that's just a great
price<00:02:25.020> for<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:26.370> quality<00:02:27.240> product<00:02:27.510> in<00:02:27.750> my

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
price for a a quality product in my

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.660 
price for a a quality product in my
opinion<00:02:27.930> that's<00:02:28.680> durable<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.250> these

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
opinion that's durable and these

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.490 
opinion that's durable and these

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
that it gives you on the toe box the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.690 
that it gives you on the toe box the
area<00:02:41.850> I<00:02:42.120> felt<00:02:42.930> like<00:02:43.080> like<00:02:43.680> my<00:02:43.980> original<00:02:44.580> pair

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
area I felt like like my original pair

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.120 
area I felt like like my original pair
that<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:44.850> bought<00:02:45.030> here<00:02:45.330> these<00:02:45.750> are<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.930> size<00:02:46.200> 9.5

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
that I bought here these are a size 9.5

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.580 
that I bought here these are a size 9.5
and<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:48.300> actually<00:02:48.450> tried<00:02:48.750> in<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.020> nines<00:02:49.230> on

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
and I actually tried in the nines on

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.900 
and I actually tried in the nines on
these<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.070> tried<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.430> attend<00:02:50.700> because<00:02:50.820> I

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
these and I tried in attend because I

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.730 
these and I tried in attend because I
didn't<00:02:51.120> have<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.240> ten<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.600> half<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.020> the

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
didn't have a ten and a half and the

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.110 
didn't have a ten and a half and the
nines<00:02:52.920> are<00:02:53.070> too<00:02:53.190> snug<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.730> tens<00:02:53.940> will

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
nines are too snug in the tens will

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.400 
nines are too snug in the tens will
actually<00:02:54.330> fit<00:02:54.510> just<00:02:54.660> like<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.959> nines<00:02:55.170> did

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
actually fit just like the nines did

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.850 
actually fit just like the nines did
with<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.850> kind<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.330> clock<00:02:58.170> material<00:02:58.680> I

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
with the kind of the clock material I

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.240 
with the kind of the clock material I
don't<00:02:59.760> know<00:02:59.820> why<00:03:00.000> but<00:03:00.800> with<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.980> difference

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
don't know why but with the difference

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.610 
don't know why but with the difference
of<00:03:02.400> these<00:03:02.550> two<00:03:02.760> materials<00:03:02.880> right<00:03:03.360> here<00:03:03.620> it

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
of these two materials right here it

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.440 
of these two materials right here it
feels<00:03:04.800> like<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.130> same<00:03:05.310> size<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.760> me<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.090> maybe

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
feels like the same size to me and maybe

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.330 
feels like the same size to me and maybe
I'm<00:03:06.600> totally<00:03:06.840> spacing<00:03:07.560> out<00:03:07.620> but<00:03:08.190> that's

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
I'm totally spacing out but that's

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.070 
I'm totally spacing out but that's
that's<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.030> way<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.270> felt<00:03:09.420> for<00:03:09.600> me<00:03:09.660> since<00:03:09.930> this

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
that's the way it felt for me since this

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.820 
that's the way it felt for me since this
is<00:03:10.230> kind<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.590> more<00:03:10.740> of<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:12.290> firmer<00:03:13.290> material

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
is kind of a more of a firmer material
