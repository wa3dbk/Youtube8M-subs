i<00:02:35.390> think<00:02:35.900> it's<00:02:36.320> i<00:02:36.470> think<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.890> sport<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.490> going

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
i think it's i think that sport is going

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.880 
i think it's i think that sport is going
to<00:02:37.940> take<00:02:38.150> off<00:02:38.360> so<00:02:39.110> now<00:02:39.260> what<00:02:39.410> does<00:02:39.500> it<00:02:39.650> allow

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
to take off so now what does it allow

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.200 
to take off so now what does it allow
you<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.190> do<00:02:40.280> when<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.490> pat<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:40.880> can<00:02:41.060> just

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
you to do when you pat you can just

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.040 
you to do when you pat you can just
maneuver<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.750> little<00:02:42.080> cut<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.590> little<00:02:42.800> closer

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
maneuver a little cut a little closer

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.360 
maneuver a little cut a little closer
you<00:02:45.050> mean<00:02:45.200> when<00:02:45.380> you're<00:02:45.500> on<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.650> way<00:02:45.770> when

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
you mean when you're on the way when

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.710 
you mean when you're on the way when
you're<00:02:46.459> on<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.610> waves<00:02:46.820> well<00:02:47.090> basically<00:02:47.330> it

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
you're on the waves well basically it

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.780 
you're on the waves well basically it
gives<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:48.020> thrust<00:02:48.410> and<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:48.980> gives<00:02:49.190> you<00:02:49.340> an

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
gives you thrust and it gives you an

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.930 
gives you thrust and it gives you an
extra<00:02:50.120> extra<00:02:50.810> leg<00:02:51.200> really<00:02:51.590> for<00:02:51.980> balance<00:02:52.340> but

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
extra extra leg really for balance but

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.150 
extra extra leg really for balance but
what<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.570> does<00:02:53.720> for<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:53.959> workout<00:02:54.440> which<00:02:54.860> is<00:02:55.010> what

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
what it does for a workout which is what

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.830 
what it does for a workout which is what
i<00:02:55.190> think<00:02:55.520> is<00:02:55.640> really<00:02:55.730> going<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:56.000> take<00:02:56.239> off<00:02:56.480> is

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
i think is really going to take off is

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.460 
i think is really going to take off is
that<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:58.160> really<00:02:58.580> is<00:02:58.820> a<00:02:58.850> great<00:02:59.450> workout<00:03:00.140> and

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
that it really is a great workout and

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.990 
that it really is a great workout and
you<00:03:00.890> can<00:03:01.070> do<00:03:01.160> it<00:03:01.280> wherever<00:03:01.459> there's<00:03:01.790> flat

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
you can do it wherever there's flat

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.520 
you can do it wherever there's flat
water<00:03:02.209> is<00:03:02.420> read<00:03:02.600> says<00:03:02.840> so<00:03:02.989> it<00:03:03.080> probably<00:03:03.320> will

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
water is read says so it probably will

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.370 
water is read says so it probably will
go<00:03:03.770> all<00:03:03.920> over<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.250> world
