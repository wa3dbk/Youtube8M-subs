00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.460
 find for a little video on 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.990
 of Estonia and I hope the end for you 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.369
 that it's going very well even have convinced 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.070
 a study without which I have the potato 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.170
 and so we left for a small 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.180
 video about Estonia and in particular 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.640
 on a weapon on the black hammer he 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.410
 this is the sniper of cocteau raid la 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.230
 cocteau drop and it's for me 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.000
 now the best weapon of the game you 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.770
 go see now on the priest 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.450
 archontes I'm solo his priest to 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.680
 pediment and gilles ans with random 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.660
 home left 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.129
 result I define all alone and you 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.600
 see that I have not left 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.489
 all the time at prg and tells of 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.570
 react 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.010
 I'm going to speed up a clear I've 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.140
 accelerated because it's going to be that during 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.910
 I believe about thirty seconds 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.110
 it's about that or about thirty 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.480
 of seconds so I preferred you 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.239
 speed it up and you'll see look 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.850
 he did not even have time to move 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.049
 this weapon is a pure massacre so if 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.369
 I put it there it's just because 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.540
 like that I'm not bored by the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.619
 mobs is when you're in 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.640
 black of the prg is rare of which I you 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.770
 advise this location you are 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.659
 quiet here and I showed you 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.400
 people in cdi or three examples by 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.810
 example the tank of value it urge 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.450
 these pics first forgot the blackmail it 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.310
 walk with almost every boss and 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.659
 when I say almost all and only 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.200
 it does not work it's going to be like 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.119
 hull omnicult which is the part of the 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.110
 new dlc eternal spirit it does not work 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.640
 no longer because he was going to shield 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.140
 around him and that these terrors 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.970
 bush with the only two on which 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.979
 it 's not going to work all the others 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.450
 walking strong god is the best style 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.869
 and I will also show you on 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.729
 this video 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.200
 the ways to finish the bosses when you 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.189
 and the black hammer then for those who 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.070
 wonder what a martinoire these 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.810
 snipers of the raid and his faculty first 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.060
 and the most interesting is the one that goes 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.220
 make this weapon ultra shit and that's it 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.479
 it is that I shoot to infinity you go 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.009
 tell me how I am how do you do 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.320
 to shoot to infinity without reloading 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.670
 the more he has a damn damage needed 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.820
 know that the black market and the sniper 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.189
 of the game that has the most impact it even the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.960
 icebreaker's less so that says 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.239
 more impact dib far more than 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.310
 damage in foehn precision largely 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.530
 precisions on mainly and therefore 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.080
 precisely account 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.520
 born with the fact that tears when you 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.170
 chain the three balls of your 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.430
 shelling loader at this in 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.459
 a short period of time 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.810
 the loader fills automatically 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.360
 without it consuming you one 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.950
 bullet result you shoot unlimited 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.900
 when you put precision shots 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.270
 and like the bumps in the shots when 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.800
 precision went from the unlimited is 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.090
 so in this video I show you a 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.560
 little how to kill all bosses when 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.750
 you have black smart then you have it 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.459
 seen for the time you saw 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.930
 how did it go to voigt it 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.610
 must put a ball to him expectations 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.900
 who gets up to put him back together is going to get 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.330
 reveal those attacks that gets up jean 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.920
 put back a etc and chain there I 'm going 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.420
 give you a little example on his six 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.810
 first these piss first it's the most 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.940
 blatant 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.380
 you will see that the fake got and where 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.180
 I wanted to speed up the time that I 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.920
 not going to speed up his peaks first there 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.989
 I will not speed it up 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.410
 see how fast he's going 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.819
 fall 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.800
 I want to know that I was with two 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.930
 guys there was a project believes cooper 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.910
 with me dedication to you from elsewhere and a 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.290
 other in dom actually they will care 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.370
 mobs and that's when I get you 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.830
 also advises on lime-funds 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.180
 odd do the at least 2 he has it to you 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.470
 had on voigt I was quiet I 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.870
 fired the boss nobody was pissing off 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.190
 because he hay who destroys who kills 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.989
 the mobs in fact he's walking around 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.040
 for that one is quiet because 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.600
 times the words you saw a 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.250
 pull on it and yeah that shifts my 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.820
 result finder I do not put shots 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.560
 Precision 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.360
 when this is the case in general I switch 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.340
 what do these dead have the time to reload 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.350
 on my chalaronne story of good 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.030
 hurt and you've seen to exist under 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.980
 which it goes down I specify that all 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.750
 assaults all the assault bosses that 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.250
 you have in this video were made 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.500
 in rock of the avant-garde ie 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.410
 level 26 all the furniture that every 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.489
 conch bosses were killed his level 26 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.900
 with a small level mouth because 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.910
 each dassault boss at a level 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.260
 superior to the general level so the 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.700
 words the bosses are 27 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.940
 and you saw that I wanted you to have a 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.700
 phenomenal speed another example and this 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.840
 will be the last the darkeners it takes 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.160
 to be a bit more strategic for the 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.450
 follow must look at his charger 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.250
 or know that you are 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.870
 I do not like you because the Charles 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.250
 darkeners will put themselves in immunity 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.840
 when he is going to fall so you have had to 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.430
 shoot in the shot when he goes 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.410
 raise it's going to be as much in immune 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.910
 until he is recovering well so he 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.079
 you have to weigh your drawn balls 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.579
 three balls of tastes and who will go 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.470
 pick up stop pulling because otherwise 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.090
 you will have to recharge and that you 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.470
 rot at good balls when you in 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.970
 cut once it's okay since finally 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.860
 down you can reload may 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.600
 it allows you to shoot to infinity 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.930
 you saw at the speed at which I 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.100
 kill the fashions that's extraordinary and 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.170
 that's if there is a weapon added on 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.030
 krypton fred it's this sniper 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.280
 it's for me the best the best 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.250
 weapon of the five who offers us widely 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.540
 so that's his first faculty and 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.180
 the others are not interesting 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.680
 incidentally stopped marksmanship and beats 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.670
 socke german plays i really hope 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.650
 I am very much with you I hope 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.060
 that you are going to lute it while waiting 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.700
 tell you I hope this video has you 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.600
 more and then she will enjoy next for 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.770
 an upcoming video 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.770
 go ciao bye
