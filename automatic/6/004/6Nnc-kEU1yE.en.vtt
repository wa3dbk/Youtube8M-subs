00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello welcome to beginners 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.960
 tips and tricks from will also be the same 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.250
 Let's have an example here 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.790
 Let's start with a light 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.650
 Here you can always see if you are, if everyone 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:20.039
 on the shoulder does not have him for 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.140
 magazine storage night meeting council 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.480
 storage in spite of whether which clean 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.029
 could not do any full one here though 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.300
 that's not so bad to come in 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.380
 others and not always 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.200
 It would not be Swiss 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:41.790
 practically here this black tiger 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:44.430
 So you say end industry always comes 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.770
 it or sit back can 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.920
 is charged too 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:55.320
 so you can make out a pillar he 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.270
 but not necessarily 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.239
 do not really need to 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.969
 especially so as the last time they go can 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.710
 my standing he is now the 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.580
 Last hope is there you can too 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.200
 simplify this 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.150
 but everyone should know 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.119
 That's what many do not know 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.650
 can be single in almost all apps 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.930
 I'll make short files 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:29.610
 So is first pulled back 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.579
 So have your load rail so that you 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.409
 So, heaven is right at the back 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:40.710
 stop then brings her did in your 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.450
 In my case, this idea is the same now 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.770
 another mistake lies in between 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.100
 best so then you see in there now 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.509
 has become in this city 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:59.579
 the arrows from the magazine reinfÃ¤hrt then on 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.829
 let's just enjoy the day here 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.520
 single is allowed from now on again 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.770
 purely 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.200
 make it to the very back that he even 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.899
 In the back rank , that makes sense to you 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.970
 racing board can and then press them 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.970
 back to the very back so that 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.019
 it does not really go on anymore and 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.610
 then everyone already has the head and you have 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.890
 you loaded a single one there 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.530
 so clocked it did not matter 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.310
 says I have no magazine for that 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.739
 make the shoot as it was actually 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:39.579
 even apart from a last one 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:41.440
 things that would be here of deco that 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:49.860
 you should not actually usable 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:53.560
 is not good that here so if I 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.519
 that title is not way too high 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.980
 and to go in and Heessen 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.019
 romp tactical wales where he will be too 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.470
 Things can buy the hot tactical 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:08.670
 wales for the book railcity works 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.079
 Everything seemed to work out here 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.440
 the hard box above 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:20.170
 2 and down there a straight handle 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:22.030
 the here and there press this button 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.209
 So push here back when 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.569
 her after answer only if that 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.959
 See, that was it, too 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.420
 beautiful 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.370
 I hope it helped you at least 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:42.690
 a little bit 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:42.690
 and yes and until the next video
