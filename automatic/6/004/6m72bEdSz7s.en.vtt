 His opponent, No. 4 Murata, has 2 hits and 2 hits including home runs 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.040
 Toritani was one after another 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.890
 It was done 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.829
 Helped on the last day 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.909
 I expected a loss 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.129
 It goes beyond cash bonds 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.389
 Very happy National Statistics Bureau 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.389
 Oh yes that's right 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.929
 Now it's mode for 13 minutes 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:32.929
 I will chase 3.5 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.549
 In the first bat 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.979

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:41.019
 Cabrera 3 No. 2 Run Home Run 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.999
 Also this year's opener 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.269
 It is Cabrera who was not able to participate, but is a big success 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.669
 Executive with softball 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.389
 It will be a ball higher pseudonym that has unexpectedly dropped 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.839
 That day I feel like I am at the neck 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:12.969
 Because of this, the Japanese team lost 2 straight 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.969
 I will do the deliberation that thinks it 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:33.219
 Left 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.099
 Aim to increase the number 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.029
 Toriya life return 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:05.939
 Then Kanemoto goes to Mitaka 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.939
 It is called franchise 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.519
 I'm explaining it now 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.949
 Information not found in the media 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.900
 You are explaining 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.610
 Unusual very happy 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.669
 It is two directors 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.669
 It is said that we are packing for liability trial 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:52.729
 Kyocera Dome brand luna 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.729
 Larger than expected 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.150
 Number-based hit 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.150
 Ekko's season 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.819
 It is a satellite image 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:08.680
 It was in the steel frame 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.650
 While Tibet 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.880
 The rule of giving two bases is established 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.300
 It says that the ball has been deposited and shoots a home run 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.300
 It is facility to build 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:41.839
 You also need to use search service Google 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:43.889
 I do because I want to target 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.559
 The reason is 20,000 yen compared to the previous day 

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:48.559
 It was the third generation 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:50.919
 1st start 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.919
 A great visit to each 10 thousand houses 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:58.169
 Above all 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.939
 I ended up every year 

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:03.559
 It was 3 runs 

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:06.559
 It looks like exchange rate 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.949
 If it was Yokohama, it helped if it was so 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:12.549
 I agree
