because<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.300> map<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.570> just<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.410> know<00:00:37.500> pretty

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
stupid especially in search and astre so

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.830 
stupid especially in search and astre so
I<00:00:40.680> figured<00:00:41.100> I'll<00:00:41.700> get<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.120> nade<00:00:42.570> kill

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
I figured I'll get this one nade kill

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.180 
I figured I'll get this one nade kill
and<00:00:43.050> then<00:00:43.410> i'm<00:00:43.530> only<00:00:43.710> getting<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:44.070> my

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
and then i'm only getting as my

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.029 
and then i'm only getting as my
ballistic<00:00:44.610> knife<00:00:45.050> but<00:00:46.050> i<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.440> get<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> couple

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
ballistic knife but i do get a couple

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.400 
ballistic knife but i do get a couple
knife<00:00:47.190> kills<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:48.030> i<00:00:48.300> guess<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.989> accounts

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410

guess that's for you guys to know and

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.610 
guess that's for you guys to know and
this<00:02:37.300> is<00:02:37.510> one<00:02:37.750> thing<00:02:37.989> that<00:02:38.230> I<00:02:38.380> don't<00:02:38.470> like

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
this is one thing that I don't like

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.680 
this is one thing that I don't like
about<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:39.040> blows<00:02:39.220> laughs<00:02:39.550> it's<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:39.819> janky<00:02:40.480> and

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
about the blows laughs it's so janky and

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.360 
about the blows laughs it's so janky and
like<00:02:41.440> it<00:02:42.069> is<00:02:42.459> fail<00:02:43.620> registration<00:02:44.620> because

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
like it is fail registration because

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.070 
like it is fail registration because
both<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.000> those<00:02:46.180> should<00:02:46.420> hit<00:02:46.569> that<00:02:46.600> guy<00:02:46.840> but

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
both of those should hit that guy but

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.449 
both of those should hit that guy but
they<00:02:47.170> didn't<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.620> then<00:02:47.799> look<00:02:47.950> at<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.340> one

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
they didn't and then look at that one

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.160 
they didn't and then look at that one
should<00:02:48.670> i<00:02:48.700> had<00:02:48.819> them<00:02:48.910> too<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.750> got<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:49.930> knife

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
should i had them too so I got a knife

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.530 
should i had them too so I got a knife
mine<00:02:50.470> but<00:02:50.920> I<00:02:51.280> hope<00:02:51.549> you<00:02:51.670> guys<00:02:51.730> forgive<00:02:52.120> me<00:02:52.299> for

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
mine but I hope you guys forgive me for

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.199 
mine but I hope you guys forgive me for
the<00:02:52.630> knife<00:02:52.810> kills<00:02:53.370> but<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:54.640> still<00:02:54.910> think<00:02:55.120> it

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
the knife kills but I still think it

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.680 
the knife kills but I still think it
counts<00:02:55.390> as<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.830> ballistic<00:02:56.830> knife<00:02:57.010> only<00:02:57.190> game

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
counts as a ballistic knife only game

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.479 
counts as a ballistic knife only game
because<00:02:58.690> it's<00:02:58.810> pretty<00:02:59.019> much<00:02:59.110> all<00:02:59.290> I<00:02:59.319> used<00:02:59.560> but

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
because it's pretty much all I used but

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.780 
because it's pretty much all I used but
