00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
face they're damaged and I have to throw

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.000 
face they're damaged and I have to throw
them<00:02:10.170> away<00:02:10.230> then<00:02:10.470> because<00:02:10.740> you're<00:02:10.860> some

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
them away then because you're some

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.470 
them away then because you're some
reason<00:02:11.250> they<00:02:11.370> get<00:02:11.520> wet<00:02:11.790> they<00:02:12.030> like<00:02:12.210> get<00:02:12.390> all

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
reason they get wet they like get all

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.260 
reason they get wet they like get all
wonky<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:12.990> they<00:02:13.170> dry<00:02:13.410> weird<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.970> suggest

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
wonky and they dry weird so I suggest

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.580 
wonky and they dry weird so I suggest
taking<00:02:15.510> them<00:02:15.630> off<00:02:15.780> before<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.200> wash<00:02:16.410> your

taking them off before you wash your

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.590 
taking them off before you wash your
face<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:17.940> is<00:02:18.030> what<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.210> looks<00:02:18.360> like<00:02:18.480> when

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
face so this is what it looks like when

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.420 
face so this is what it looks like when
you<00:02:18.690> open<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.290> comes<00:02:19.470> with<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.770> eyelashes

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430

themselves<00:02:20.970> some<00:02:21.750> glue<00:02:22.080> which<00:02:22.650> this<00:02:23.040> lasts

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
themselves some glue which this lasts

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.070 
themselves some glue which this lasts
for<00:02:23.610> like<00:02:23.730> ever<00:02:23.940> all<00:02:24.240> you<00:02:24.360> need<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.630> really
