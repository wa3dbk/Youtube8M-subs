00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.679
 Dialogues of natural laws 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.679
 the third revolution of medicine 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:23.480
 April 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.430
 what is fundamental about this five biological laws of nature 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.749
 and what implications they bring 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.749
 can clarify the following example 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.100
 a mouse and a cat meet each other 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.239
 The cat in the fine food porten was with the mouse from the point of view of the mouse 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.420
 perceived deadly threat 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.570
 her biological impulse is the way to the European Championship, which she will do directly 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.780
 we all know is that we suddenly unexpected in extreme situations 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.780
 Developing forces and that's exactly what it's all about 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.490
 unnoticed are the alveoli of the mouse in sympathy Kulturni spiked what 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.569
 in this case is called 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:06.200
 that they make one over-function and thus a higher one 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.800
 Allow oxygen permeability 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.700
 thus, the mouse has better breathing and can now run much closer without 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.600
 that he runs out of breath 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.040
 He always runs out of only two minutes away and she will be safe 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.430
 then breathe for two minutes and regenerate it is in private to 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.990
 me or in 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.380
 Parasympatheticus Rooney 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.950
 If these events are transmitted to a human, this could happen 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.460
 look like he's getting a deadly cancer diagnosis from Arx of his trust 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.980
 and gets that situation just like the mouse on almost the Tony's diagnosis 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.750
 their logic is interpreted as the cat where the man runs away world 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.840
 and the difference is that you can not run away from that diagnosis 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.730
 was actually the biological impulse 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.020
 This dread is no longer on the patient can not sleep 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.920
 has no appetite and is totally restless because we logically program 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.420
 is running that she has to escape from a deadly enemy 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.830
 to save his life 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.550
 now there is a big difference in the duration of the term compared to 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.840
 the situation of cat and mouse the mouse is either eaten or 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.690
 She will be on time in safety she will not under any circumstances 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.289
 Be on the run for weeks or months 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.829
 Such a duration of fear of death can not exist in nature 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:28.829
 because the centers have worked for weeks on their maximum capacity 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.400
 they have even shared and are in work claim to meet 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.449
 can 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:37.279
 By the surplus of cells can now even more oxygen in shorter 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:39.479
 Time to be recorded 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:43.369
 he would take the persons back to the doctor he would that one called 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:46.609
 Find malignant tumor in the lungs and close it 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:50.390
 and that this must be a strewn metastasis yesterday 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:54.679
 however, it is an independent cancer program that is frightened by that 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:56.149
 was triggered 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:59.549
 this cell growth has never been evil or meaningless 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.969
 it was only useful to the creature geological to do better 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:04.149
 can 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:08.079
 Now suppose that this all-cleared person would get a positive one 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.769
 Future prospects of Arx 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.090
 then it would suddenly be relieved and finally get into hers 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.789
 Take a breather 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:17.609
 the evil predator was hanged off 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.180
 because now but over weeks, additional cells were built 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.569
 cleverer of that person just something else 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.770
 the excess counts that are now no longer necessary 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.120
 Tuberculosis is broken down and then equipped 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.989
 the person 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.599
 coughing is coughing blood 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.159
 the mouse had no cell due to her only two-minute dread 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.499
 Building experienced and therefore also had no cent from also necessary 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.689
 but man will now usually be worried again and become one 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.219
 only one pulmonary tuberculosis diagnose the value actually 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:55.150
 every symptom of the solution to the fear of death represents what is unpleasant though 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:58.210
 a biologically meaningful measure 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.359
 which has a predetermined duration 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.269
 namely, as long as you were trapped in fear of death 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.930
 however, the excess count only diminishes when the individual 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.459
 the needed 2 mountains in it 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.380
 you do not have any because they were killed, for example, medically 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.770
 the tumor is encapsulated and stays where it is but does not 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.629
 direct danger 

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:23.830
 the tube works that were always accepted as something bad 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.980
 they are actually only the garbage disposal the necessary 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.210
 Healing process 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.530
 so you can see why it was after the Second World War in Germany too 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.220
 a high incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis can 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.740
 that many people had logically resolved their mortal conflict 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.640
 From a geological point of view, they have virtually fled from the cat 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.169
 an infection was never present 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.550
 7 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.029
 But be careful lung cancer is not always the same lung cancer 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:55.190
 because the lungs have many parts 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.890
 all react differently and are activated by other perception 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:59.550
 become 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.360
 that example explicitly revolved around the alveoli or the 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.809
 Lungs Albion 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:09.329
 the saplings counting cups or the Lobau today have other programs with them 

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:11.520
 other causes and processes 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.180
 but in any case only biologically sensible and never 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.409
 vicious 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:20.289
 in no case there is a so-called metastasis and yet in no case 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.309
 For example, smoking or other poisons may still be so-called 

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:25.580
 Trigger lung cancer directly 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.800
 this only goes beyond the biological perception of dreading the deaths 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.070
 over-function of the alveoli a meaningful need value 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.070
 which are not combated so synonymous one has previously accepted 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.580
 to combat the purpose of the mistakes of nature for conventional medicine and the 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.250
 Alternative methods has always been adopted 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.250
 can not be seen far and wide 

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:57.349
 if there is Hamas bombed the logical laws of nature votes is everything 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:00.349
 ask 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:07.689
 the dax-top volunteer Dr 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:17.759
 he is harboring 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:18.610
 lives here
