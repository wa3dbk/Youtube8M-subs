00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.640 
same size stretch it out a little bit
less<00:01:36.329> or<00:01:36.509> make<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.930> want<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.170> make<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.409> sort<00:01:37.590> of

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
less or make you want to make it sort of

less or make you want to make it sort of
like<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> rectangle<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.880> not<00:01:39.000> too<00:01:39.299> pointy<00:01:40.610> just

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
like a rectangle but not too pointy just

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.319 
like a rectangle but not too pointy just
right<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:44.280> always<00:01:44.579> off<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> paper<00:01:45.090> down

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
because this stuff can really stick to

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.710 
because this stuff can really stick to
your<00:01:48.720> table<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.880> never<00:01:50.880> put<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.450> Breyers

after<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.880> body<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.420> looks<00:02:00.600> like

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
after you have the body that looks like

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.770 
after you have the body that looks like
this<00:02:01.170> you're<00:02:01.740> going<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.950> do<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> head<00:02:02.780> you

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
this you're going to do the head you

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.340 
this you're going to do the head you
roll<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.259> into<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:05.060> not<00:02:06.060> really<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.450> circle<00:02:07.110> you

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
roll it into a not really a circle you

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.740 
roll it into a not really a circle you
sort<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.680> want<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:08.039> smaller<00:02:08.940> version<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.569> this

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
sort of want a smaller version of this

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.690 
sort of want a smaller version of this
in<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.830> sort<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:12.260> rectangle

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
in the sort of rectangle

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.640 
in the sort of rectangle
but<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.760> can't<00:02:15.000> be<00:02:15.180> too<00:02:15.480> big<00:02:15.750> but<00:02:16.080> also<00:02:16.230> has<00:02:16.530> all

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
but it can't be too big but also has all

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.990 
but it can't be too big but also has all
kind<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:16.950> course<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.459> want<00:02:19.489> they<00:02:20.489> don't<00:02:20.790> have

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
kind of course you want they don't have

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.330 
kind of course you want they don't have
necks<00:02:21.330> that's<00:02:22.200> where<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.590> head<00:02:22.770> comes<00:02:23.010> in

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
necks that's where the head comes in

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.330 
necks that's where the head comes in
your<00:02:24.030> position<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:24.720> high<00:02:25.050> up<00:02:25.470> like<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.069> like

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
your position it high up like this like

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.490 
your position it high up like this like
he's<00:02:26.459> looking<00:02:26.610> upwards<00:02:27.270> or<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:28.170> can<00:02:28.349> just

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
he's looking upwards or you can just

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.720 
he's looking upwards or you can just
make<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:28.980> look<00:02:29.250> like<00:02:29.489> keys<00:02:30.319> just<00:02:31.319> looking<00:02:31.739> it's

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
make it look like keys just looking it's

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.430 
make it look like keys just looking it's
probably<00:02:32.880> more<00:02:33.180> general<00:02:33.660> way<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.110> see<00:02:34.410> I

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
probably more general way so you see I

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:42.589 
probably more general way so you see I
have<00:02:34.709> this<00:02:37.040> actually<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.069> little<00:02:38.160> too<00:02:38.790> big<00:02:41.599> and

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
have this actually a little too big and

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.300 
have this actually a little too big and
when<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.019> cook<00:02:43.230> these<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.680> just<00:02:43.860> follow<00:02:44.099> the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
when you cook these you just follow the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.300 
when you cook these you just follow the
instructions<00:02:44.700> on<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.480> sculpey<00:02:45.900> pack<00:02:46.310> the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
instructions on the sculpey pack the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.420 
instructions on the sculpey pack the
sculpt<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.880> pretty<00:02:48.420> old<00:02:49.100> you<00:02:50.100> can<00:02:50.250> see<00:02:50.400> that

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
sculpt is pretty old you can see that

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.759 
sculpt is pretty old you can see that
how<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.730> just<00:02:51.030> attach<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:54.769> probably

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
how I just attach that on probably

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.070 
how I just attach that on probably
should<00:02:55.920> be<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.069> little<00:02:56.519> bit<00:02:56.790> smaller<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:57.390> we're

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
should be a little bit smaller so we're

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.420 
should be a little bit smaller so we're
just<00:02:58.110> going<00:02:58.319> to<00:02:58.380> take<00:02:58.620> some<00:02:58.680> off<00:03:01.099> and<00:03:02.099> just
