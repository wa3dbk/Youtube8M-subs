00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
barsa did something pretty epic against

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.629 
barsa did something pretty epic against
AC<00:03:58.269> Milan<00:03:58.540> and<00:03:59.019> I<00:03:59.470> think<00:03:59.680> AC<00:03:59.859> Milan<00:04:00.190> has<00:04:00.340> a<00:04:00.400> good

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
AC Milan and I think AC Milan has a good

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.520 
AC Milan and I think AC Milan has a good
team<00:04:00.819> but<00:04:00.970> I<00:04:01.030> think<00:04:01.299> buyers<00:04:01.630> just<00:04:01.930> a<00:04:02.079> little

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
team but I think buyers just a little

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.000 
team but I think buyers just a little
bit<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.919> little<00:04:03.220> bit<00:04:03.609> more<00:04:04.030> experience<00:04:04.780> I<00:04:05.319> think

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
bit a little bit more experience I think

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.740 
bit a little bit more experience I think
a<00:04:06.099> seeming<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.430> had<00:04:06.579> a<00:04:06.639> really<00:04:06.849> young<00:04:07.180> team<00:04:07.480> and

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
a seeming I had a really young team and

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.839 
a seeming I had a really young team and
you<00:04:08.680> know<00:04:08.799> they<00:04:08.889> had<00:04:09.040> an<00:04:09.160> advantage<00:04:09.370> going<00:04:09.700> up

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
you know they had an advantage going up

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.580 
you know they had an advantage going up
against<00:04:10.120> varsity<00:04:10.299> had<00:04:10.930> a<00:04:10.959> young<00:04:11.230> team<00:04:11.470> and

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
against varsity had a young team and

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.229 
against varsity had a young team and
they<00:04:11.680> couldn't<00:04:11.889> hold<00:04:12.040> that<00:04:12.220> advantage<00:04:12.459> bayern

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
they couldn't hold that advantage bayern

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.449 
they couldn't hold that advantage bayern
is<00:04:13.510> an<00:04:13.630> experienced<00:04:14.349> team<00:04:14.620> they<00:04:14.829> they<00:04:15.190> were<00:04:15.370> in

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
is an experienced team they they were in

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.949 
is an experienced team they they were in
the<00:04:15.549> semi-finals<00:04:16.209> of<00:04:16.239> Champions<00:04:16.660> League<00:04:16.750> last

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
the semi-finals of Champions League last

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.360 
the semi-finals of Champions League last
year<00:04:17.079> right<00:04:17.289> against<00:04:17.530> Real<00:04:17.709> Madrid<00:04:18.010> they<00:04:18.190> went

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
year right against Real Madrid they went

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.099 
year right against Real Madrid they went
out<00:04:18.489> so<00:04:18.880> I<00:04:18.910> think<00:04:19.060> by<00:04:19.329> earns<00:04:19.750> a<00:04:19.870> more

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
out so I think by earns a more

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.810 
out so I think by earns a more
experienced<00:04:20.979> team<00:04:21.250> and<00:04:21.430> I<00:04:21.459> think<00:04:21.669> they're

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
experienced team and I think they're

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.540 
experienced team and I think they're
gonna<00:04:21.909> be<00:04:22.090> able<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.360> hold<00:04:22.479> on<00:04:22.750> to<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:24.190> that<00:04:24.310> lead

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
gonna be able to hold on to to that lead

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.740 
gonna be able to hold on to to that lead
now

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
now

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.780 
now
that's<00:04:26.470> what<00:04:26.650> i<00:04:26.680> think<00:04:26.770> so<00:04:27.190> i<00:04:27.250> think<00:04:27.280> Bayern

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
that's what i think so i think Bayern

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.820 
that's what i think so i think Bayern
might<00:04:28.060> be<00:04:28.180> in<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.390> final<00:04:28.810> if<00:04:29.200> you're<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.410> barsa

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
might be in the final if you're a barsa

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
might be in the final if you're a barsa
fan<00:04:30.040> you<00:04:30.190> know<00:04:30.220> you're<00:04:30.430> probably<00:04:30.580> going<00:04:30.790> to

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
fan you know you're probably going to

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.340 
fan you know you're probably going to
disagree<00:04:31.150> with<00:04:31.390> me<00:04:31.480> but<00:04:31.510> it's<00:04:31.930> just<00:04:32.290> me

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
disagree with me but it's just me

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.470 
disagree with me but it's just me
looking<00:04:32.830> at<00:04:33.070> like<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.400> that's<00:04:33.700> not<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.030> logic

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
looking at like the that's not the logic

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.030 
looking at like the that's not the logic
and<00:04:34.690> so<00:04:34.810> that's<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:35.080> good<00:04:35.260> answer<00:04:35.440> to<00:04:35.620> take<00:04:35.890> that

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
and so that's a good answer to take that

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.530 
and so that's a good answer to take that
buyers<00:04:36.370> gonna<00:04:36.550> be<00:04:36.760> there<00:04:36.910> but<00:04:37.000> I<00:04:37.090> really<00:04:37.120> think

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
i think i was one of the centre-backs it

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.650 
i think i was one of the centre-backs it
was<00:04:57.220> either<00:04:57.310> pepper<00:04:57.610> I<00:04:58.030> don't<00:04:58.360> want<00:04:58.480> number

who<00:04:58.780> it<00:04:58.900> was<00:04:59.050> but<00:04:59.200> there<00:04:59.350> was<00:04:59.440> a<00:04:59.500> late<00:04:59.740> chance

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
who it was but there was a late chance

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.770 
who it was but there was a late chance
to<00:05:00.340> end<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.610> game<00:05:00.640> at<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:00.970> ball<00:05:01.150> just<00:05:01.480> past

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
to end the game at the ball just past

to end the game at the ball just past
the<00:05:01.990> post<00:05:02.200> it<00:05:02.800> could<00:05:03.010> have<00:05:03.100> went<00:05:03.190> into<00:05:03.370> the

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
the post it could have went into the

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.380 
the post it could have went into the
back<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:03.669> then<00:05:03.850> the<00:05:03.940> game<00:05:04.060> would<00:05:04.180> have<00:05:04.300> been

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
back and then the game would have been

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.450 
back and then the game would have been
for<00:05:04.600> two<00:05:04.810> and<00:05:04.990> I<00:05:05.320> forward<00:05:05.800> to<00:05:05.950> I<00:05:05.980> really

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
for two and I forward to I really

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.920 
for two and I forward to I really
thought<00:05:06.669> real<00:05:06.910> mature<00:05:07.270> had<00:05:07.419> a<00:05:07.450> chance<00:05:07.690> but<00:05:07.810> I

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
thought real mature had a chance but I

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.670 
thought real mature had a chance but I
for<00:05:08.230> one<00:05:08.910> it's<00:05:09.910> gonna<00:05:10.150> be<00:05:10.390> tough<00:05:10.600> now<00:05:10.870> I<00:05:11.110> think

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
for one it's gonna be tough now I think

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.400 
for one it's gonna be tough now I think
real<00:05:12.580> madrid<00:05:13.120> have<00:05:13.300> more<00:05:13.630> of<00:05:13.750> a<00:05:13.840> chance<00:05:13.870> than

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
real madrid have more of a chance than

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.650 
real madrid have more of a chance than
barsa<00:05:15.160> and<00:05:15.370> the<00:05:15.490> only<00:05:15.669> reason<00:05:15.850> i<00:05:16.240> say<00:05:16.450> that<00:05:16.480> is

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
barsa and the only reason i say that is

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.770 
barsa and the only reason i say that is
I<00:05:16.780> don't<00:05:17.020> think<00:05:17.380> Dortmund<00:05:18.160> is<00:05:18.280> as<00:05:18.760> much<00:05:19.030> as<00:05:19.300> and

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780

right<00:05:25.300> but<00:05:25.930> I<00:05:25.990> think<00:05:26.620> Bayern<00:05:27.130> has<00:05:27.280> a<00:05:27.310> really

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
right but I think Bayern has a really

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.090 
right but I think Bayern has a really
experienced<00:05:28.330> team<00:05:28.630> and<00:05:29.590> I<00:05:29.680> don't<00:05:29.890> know<00:05:29.979> if

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
experienced team and I don't know if

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.890 
experienced team and I don't know if
Dorman's<00:05:30.460> as<00:05:30.669> experience<00:05:31.360> they<00:05:31.479> have<00:05:31.600> a<00:05:31.630> lot

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
Dorman's as experience they have a lot

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.590 
Dorman's as experience they have a lot
of<00:05:31.930> young<00:05:32.200> players<00:05:32.410> but<00:05:32.919> I<00:05:33.100> think<00:05:33.610> coming<00:05:34.419> I

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
of young players but I think coming I

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.850 
of young players but I think coming I
think<00:05:34.810> any<00:05:35.020> team<00:05:35.290> making<00:05:35.560> it<00:05:35.710> to<00:05:35.770> the

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
think any team making it to the

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.980 
think any team making it to the
semi-finals<00:05:36.580> and<00:05:36.700> being<00:05:36.910> up<00:05:37.120> by<00:05:37.360> three<00:05:37.750> goals

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
semi-finals and being up by three goals

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.440 
semi-finals and being up by three goals
that<00:05:38.290> confidence<00:05:38.979> I<00:05:39.250> don't<00:05:40.030> know<00:05:40.180> if<00:05:40.330> you

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
that confidence I don't know if you

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.850 
that confidence I don't know if you
could<00:05:40.540> come<00:05:40.750> back<00:05:40.990> from<00:05:41.229> that<00:05:41.290> yeah<00:05:41.620> I<00:05:41.650> think

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
could come back from that yeah I think

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.469 
could come back from that yeah I think
it's<00:05:42.130> almost<00:05:42.370> impossible<00:05:42.669> but<00:05:43.090> I<00:05:43.180> think<00:05:43.390> if

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
it's almost impossible but I think if

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:44.940 
it's almost impossible but I think if
any<00:05:43.660> team<00:05:43.930> can<00:05:44.080> do<00:05:44.200> it<00:05:44.320> it<00:05:44.410> might<00:05:44.440> be<00:05:44.590> real

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
any team can do it it might be real

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.130 
any team can do it it might be real
madrid<00:05:45.430> just<00:05:46.120> because<00:05:46.450> of<00:05:46.600> maybe<00:05:46.780> the<00:05:46.930> lack<00:05:47.110> of

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
madrid just because of maybe the lack of

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.159 
madrid just because of maybe the lack of
experience<00:05:47.910> but<00:05:48.910> i<00:05:48.970> doubt<00:05:49.060> it<00:05:49.330> i<00:05:49.690> think<00:05:49.870> it's

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169
