00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.839
 Hello everyone and ladies and gentlemen if me 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.630
 look yes we are shorter today i will tell 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.460
 you about such a wonderful 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.189
 cool non-standard can be said 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.410
 minute changes like that's you for refusing to hand 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.189
 saw the first colin was this 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.899
 and back with a hand that is, I took it 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.309
 jumped off did and everything is fine with 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.239
 you tutors 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.430
 from rustam and in short we start eating two 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.910
 the performance of this element first 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.660
 the technique that you saw that is when 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.640
 you stand and jump out of two legs here 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.100
 so jump with two legs and scroll and 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.500
 somersault but you can still eat the same 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.780
 technique as well as by rolling on 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.129
 that is, the hand stands here 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.750
 you move and just roll 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:08.030
 on an obstacle now I am you 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.030
 I will demonstrate the second type of performance 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.320
 Here now was the second type of performance 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.049
 this element, that is, look like you 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.390
 you need to learn it means the first thing 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.970
 you need it back you need to be able to back 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.200
 pad h that is, you calmly take 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.429
 such so then and if you want to do 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.869
 on 1 equipment 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:42.869
 you need to be able to palm flip that is worth 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:45.220
 wall and you should calmly just take 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.640
 quietly take her palm flip then 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.069
 eat to be able to sleep jump 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.369
 two legs u so do you need to be able to 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:58.420
 palm flip missing flip maybe take off 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.759
 then here if you want of course 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.490
 have you need to be able to palm flip i'm thinking about 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.830
 those who can watch him but I will be in 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.910
 the best case hope is that 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.610
 eat look you're standing bouncing then 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.780
 have you need to jump first then 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.470
 hand already cling to an obstacle and 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.970
 start already spinning there once 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.319
 will spread there is a very common mistake 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.900
 the fact that many are and immediately begin 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.549
 twist for weave meaning they don't jump on 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.950
 obstacles don't look at him that is 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.680
 need to jump look at it from the seas 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.489
 how did you put your hand on it and then 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.750
 starting to twist 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:44.139
 but many just take a hundred by her hand 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.989
 shorter is just an argument on the wall and sometimes 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:48.670
 it ends very bad it means 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.760
 to avoid such mistakes you need 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.090
 stand up jump on the obstacle 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.690
 Well, in our case, this wall jump 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.000
 on the obstacle and hand on it 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.730
 lean on well during flight flight 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.239
 that is, you are moving 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:10.299
 about the obstacle means ours and 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.299
 at this moment how do you touch your hand 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:16.389
 you need to start curling i. 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.310
 watch move jump tee 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:22.180
 bat with arm 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:25.000
 and go back to it's all easy on 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.770
 the first type of performance now I even 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.760
 clearly show you how it will look 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.760
 in action 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.659
 so now let's see a second 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:47.260
 the technique of performing this element is she 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:51.200
 principle is much simpler than 1 because 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.150
 here the principle is a special emphasis on the back 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.439
 site and on your departure do not do that 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.250
 there is here the principle of rolling just 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.299
 make this item 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.329
 insert hand and roll save 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:08.390
 then look let down what he needs 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:12.950
 be able to do to make back with 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:16.130
 hand means look and the first is a wolf 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.650
 spin if from the right to express and especially 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.109
 I donâ€™t care about titles if 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.080
 wrong and hurt your feelings then sorry 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.300
 can scare me in the comments here 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.960
 so see how it's done in wow spin 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.960
 look 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.000
 so look you do vous pink 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.440
 noise pink let's say it is done in 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.250
 the inner side that is you fit 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.610
 to the obstacle 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.590
 and so about twist that is inside 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.319
 you can tell the case when you do 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.629
 back with hand you need to spin in 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:58.240
 to the outside of the country 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.659
 side here is there when things were 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.659
 spin 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:07.330
 we go around like that and when we do the back with 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:12.270
 hand we spin so and more desirable 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.419
 when doing back on 2 technology you 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.719
 recommend 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.280
 be able to order from because touched 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:21.819
 the principle is also needed here that is you 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.490
 Move make a garden with your hand 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:29.919
 rest against this thing that is 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:35.710
 beijing bass kick and swing 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:38.620
 the legs next to the wall that is your legs 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.849
 don't have to be there dick knows where and arm 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.400
 on the wall of this should not be you should 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:47.520
 go to the wall 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:52.000
 put the foot support 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:54.490
 set max while the magician must be drawn to 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.529
 the wall of that leg of moss near the wall 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:01.509
 passes that is you fit wave 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:03.000
 put your hand and the moment you 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:06.190
 turn around 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.020
 focus on the hand so you 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:12.460
 it will be easier to navigate in 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:16.389
 space that is, we take an approach max 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:19.000
 push look at the hand and scroll 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:23.169
 we usually land on the winged leg 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:27.129
 like us three killer pigs all just dudes then 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:32.279
 there is here the wall is worth running up such bam 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:32.279
 in short, do everything here 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:41.580
 I hope my tutor helped you in chili 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.290
 anything like in life if you 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.450
 discovered what i said something 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:49.650
 wrong or something incomprehensible can 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:54.660
 write comments can write to 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:57.600
 comments and ask me and you 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:01.140
 I will answer and explain how to do it right 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:04.890
 or what I explained wrong in principle 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:08.400
 everything I wanted with what or what than I 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.710
 what with what i wanted today with you 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:15.320
 share 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:19.700
 Well all the success to you in your endeavors I 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.700
 drove on to save the world
