I was playing singles in Delhi and I was
by<00:02:21.710> myself<00:02:21.890> so<00:02:22.490> I<00:02:22.520> only<00:02:23.150> had<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.450> think<00:02:23.570> about

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
by myself so I only had to think about

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.720 
by myself so I only had to think about
myself<00:02:24.050> but<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:25.160> know<00:02:25.190> if<00:02:25.400> we're<00:02:25.580> both

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
myself but you know if we're both

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.430 
myself but you know if we're both
selected<00:02:26.060> for<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.510> games<00:02:26.720> then<00:02:27.020> it<00:02:27.140> will<00:02:27.260> just

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
selected for the games then it will just

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.740 
selected for the games then it will just
it<00:02:27.830> will<00:02:27.950> be<00:02:28.070> very<00:02:28.310> different<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.660> know

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
it will be very different and you know

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.540 
it will be very different and you know
as<00:02:29.900> much<00:02:30.080> as<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.350> try<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:30.560> be<00:02:30.830> single-minded<00:02:31.160> I

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
as much as you try to be single-minded I

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.860 
as much as you try to be single-minded I
think<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.880> course<00:02:32.120> I'm<00:02:32.270> going<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.480> be<00:02:32.540> worrying

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
about how he's getting on as well so I

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.400 
about how he's getting on as well so I
think<00:02:35.090> it's<00:02:35.510> gonna<00:02:35.630> be<00:02:35.780> tough<00:02:36.020> but<00:02:36.260> I'll<00:02:36.380> just

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
think it's gonna be tough but I'll just

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.950 
think it's gonna be tough but I'll just
have<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:37.100> figure<00:02:37.670> out<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.820> way<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.360> Jamie<00:02:38.780> will
