piece-of-crap computer actually has a
really<00:00:44.160> good<00:00:44.280> performance<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.870> were<00:00:45.960> able

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
really good performance so we were able

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.420 
really good performance so we were able
to<00:00:46.260> play<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> game<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> resolution<00:00:48.660> of

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
to play the game with a resolution of

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.100 
to play the game with a resolution of
1280<00:00:50.430> by<00:00:51.739> 1024<00:00:52.850> pixels<00:00:53.850> which<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.629> pretty<00:00:54.840> good

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
1280 by 1024 pixels which is pretty good

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.860 
1280 by 1024 pixels which is pretty good
there<00:00:55.590> was<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> four<00:00:56.280> by<00:00:56.489> three<00:00:56.520> aspect<00:00:57.420> ratio

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
there was a four by three aspect ratio

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.910 
there was a four by three aspect ratio
and<00:00:58.910> most<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.660> settings<00:01:01.260> were<00:01:01.559> set<00:01:01.770> to

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
and most of the settings were set to

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.219 
and most of the settings were set to
high<00:01:02.190> as<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.789> can<00:01:02.910> see<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.390> pretty<00:01:03.870> much<00:01:04.049> all

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
high as you can see here pretty much all

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.620 
high as you can see here pretty much all
of<00:01:04.260> them<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:05.010> allowed<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.640> really<00:01:06.119> good

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
of them this allowed a really good

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.340 
of them this allowed a really good
graphic<00:01:07.619> experience<00:01:08.299> now<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:10.049> whatever

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
graphic experience now for whatever

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.859 
graphic experience now for whatever
reason<00:01:10.920> when<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.640> was<00:01:11.850> capturing<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.479> video

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
reason when I was capturing the video

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.240 
reason when I was capturing the video
for<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.549> review<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:16.110> sound<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.220> music

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
for this review the sound and the music

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.359 
for this review the sound and the music
of<00:01:17.670> Starcraft<00:01:18.119> 2<00:01:18.180> was<00:01:18.479> not<00:01:18.659> being<00:01:19.380> captured<00:01:19.890> so

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
of Starcraft 2 was not being captured so

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.359 
of Starcraft 2 was not being captured so
we<00:01:20.850> will<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.119> hearing

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.749 

some<00:01:25.000> other<00:01:25.240> background<00:01:26.020> music<00:01:26.590> so<00:01:27.520> it's<00:01:27.670> not

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
some other background music so it's not

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.310 
some other background music so it's not
so<00:01:27.939> boring<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.820> it's<00:01:31.060> going<00:01:31.180> to<00:01:31.240> be<00:01:31.329> main

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
so boring and it's going to be main

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:40.770 
so boring and it's going to be main
brain<00:01:32.619> of<00:01:32.860> chaos<00:01:33.450> by<00:01:34.470> mental<00:01:35.470> scores

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.340 

as<00:01:41.290> you<00:01:41.380> can<00:01:41.500> see<00:01:42.330> cultures<00:01:43.330> react<00:01:43.840> really

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
as you can see cultures react really

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.850 
as you can see cultures react really
good<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:44.860> there's<00:01:45.280> no<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:47.440> framerate<00:01:47.680> is

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
good and there's no the framerate is

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.550 
good and there's no the framerate is
really<00:01:48.190> good<00:01:48.630> now<00:01:49.630> we<00:01:49.720> have<00:01:49.870> a<00:01:49.900> lot<00:01:50.110> of<00:01:50.229> Units

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
really good now we have a lot of Units

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.010 
really good now we have a lot of Units
on<00:01:50.740> screen<00:01:51.040> and<00:01:51.360> frame<00:01:52.360> rate<00:01:52.540> is<00:01:52.720> not<00:01:52.960> going

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
on screen and frame rate is not going

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.780 
on screen and frame rate is not going
down<00:01:53.290> at<00:01:53.710> any<00:01:53.920> moment<00:01:54.070> that's<00:01:55.000> way<00:01:55.390> over<00:01:55.420> 30<00:01:56.790> is

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
down at any moment that's way over 30 is

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.490 
down at any moment that's way over 30 is
probably<00:01:58.119> 40<00:01:58.650> plus<00:01:59.670> frames<00:02:00.670> per<00:02:00.880> second<00:02:01.500> you

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
probably 40 plus frames per second you

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.150 
probably 40 plus frames per second you
can<00:02:02.650> see<00:02:02.800> fire<00:02:03.070> facts<00:02:03.520> shadows<00:02:04.180> light

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
can see fire facts shadows light

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.699 
can see fire facts shadows light
explosions<00:02:06.210> not<00:02:07.210> dropping<00:02:07.479> not<00:02:08.140> even<00:02:08.350> one

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709

explosions not dropping not even one
single<00:02:09.160> frame<00:02:09.369> it's<00:02:10.090> really<00:02:10.750> good

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
single frame it's really good

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.090 
single frame it's really good
performance<00:02:12.150> also<00:02:13.150> consider<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.780> we<00:02:13.870> have<00:02:13.900> a

performance also consider that we have a

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.089 
performance also consider that we have a
pretty<00:02:15.100> high<00:02:15.310> resolution<00:02:17.160> right<00:02:18.160> now

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
pretty high resolution right now

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.690 
pretty high resolution right now
considering<00:02:20.939> its<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.659> don't<00:02:22.170> like<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.319> low<00:02:22.469> one

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700
