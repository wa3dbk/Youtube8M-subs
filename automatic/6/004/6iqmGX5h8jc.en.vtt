00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
squirts it out of the top so that you

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.100 
squirts it out of the top so that you
can<00:00:49.670> get<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:50.969> here<00:00:51.180> without<00:00:51.329> messing<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:51.989> up

can get it in here without messing it up

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.790 
can get it in here without messing it up
too<00:00:52.379> much

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.200

one<00:01:03.210> out<00:01:03.769> drop<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.800> little<00:01:05.040> bit<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.370> the<00:01:05.519> top

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:22.770 

let's<00:01:14.720> light<00:01:15.230> this

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:30.570 

and<00:01:23.260> you<00:01:23.409> see<00:01:23.590> that<00:01:23.710> playing<00:01:24.040> here

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.320 

oh<00:01:30.640> it<00:01:31.510> went<00:01:31.660> out<00:01:32.370> yes<00:01:33.370> I<00:01:33.490> didn't<00:01:33.760> guess<00:01:34.240> you

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
oh it went out yes I didn't guess you

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.260 
oh it went out yes I didn't guess you
need<00:01:34.510> to<00:01:34.600> prime<00:01:34.900> this<00:01:35.110> more<00:01:35.850> let<00:01:36.850> me<00:01:36.880> see<00:01:37.060> if<00:01:37.150> I

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
need to prime this more let me see if I

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:50.120 
need to prime this more let me see if I
can<00:01:37.420> start<00:01:37.750> it<00:01:37.900> again

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.620 

there<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.820> can<00:01:50.880> see<00:01:51.030> that

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.899 

let<00:01:54.229> me<00:01:54.320> let<00:01:54.469> that<00:01:54.680> go<00:01:54.920> for<00:01:55.130> just<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.460> second<00:01:55.789> or

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
let me let that go for just a second or

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.450 
let me let that go for just a second or
two<00:01:55.939> yet

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.399 

okay<00:02:02.060> whereas<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.510> other<00:02:02.540> one<00:02:02.930> was<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.110> side

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
okay whereas the other one was a side

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.230 
okay whereas the other one was a side
burner<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.190> flames<00:02:04.460> came<00:02:04.760> out<00:02:04.970> of<00:02:05.119> the

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
burner and the flames came out of the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.630 
burner and the flames came out of the
sides<00:02:05.570> I<00:02:05.960> think<00:02:06.619> all<00:02:06.770> of<00:02:06.799> this<00:02:07.040> flame<00:02:07.340> is<00:02:07.490> going

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
sides I think all of this flame is going

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.870 
sides I think all of this flame is going
to<00:02:07.700> come<00:02:07.909> out<00:02:07.940> of<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.240> top<00:02:09.310> all<00:02:10.310> right<00:02:10.490> I<00:02:10.670> have

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
to come out of the top all right I have

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.280 
to come out of the top all right I have
two<00:02:11.060> cups<00:02:11.300> of<00:02:11.450> water<00:02:11.720> here<00:02:13.330> setting<00:02:14.330> at<00:02:14.510> 60

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290

from 60 degrees in six minutes and 57
seconds<00:02:50.010> let's<00:02:51.000> see<00:02:51.120> how<00:02:51.240> long<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.570> takes<00:02:51.600> so

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
seconds let's see how long it takes so

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.949 
seconds let's see how long it takes so
for<00:02:52.709> Bernal<00:02:53.160> for<00:02:54.030> one<00:02:54.270> fluid<00:02:54.540> ounce<00:02:54.720> of

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
for Bernal for one fluid ounce of

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.950 
for Bernal for one fluid ounce of
alcohol<00:02:55.470> denatured<00:02:55.980> alcohol

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.060 

it's<00:03:02.920> just<00:03:03.220> about<00:03:03.430> ready<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:03.820> go<00:03:04.060> out<00:03:04.300> and

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
it's just about ready to go out and

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.180 
it's just about ready to go out and
there<00:03:06.070> it<00:03:06.190> went<00:03:06.370> out<00:03:06.670> at<00:03:07.470> 10<00:03:08.470> minutes<00:03:08.860> and

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
there it went out at 10 minutes and

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:17.820 
there it went out at 10 minutes and
let's<00:03:09.610> say<00:03:09.790> 17<00:03:10.420> seconds<00:03:12.000> 1017<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:17.440> this

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
let's say 17 seconds 1017 so this

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.250 
let's say 17 seconds 1017 so this
brought<00:03:18.100> two<00:03:18.670> cups<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:19.030> water<00:03:19.270> starting<00:03:19.720> at<00:03:19.840> 60

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
brought two cups of water starting at 60

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.460 
brought two cups of water starting at 60
degrees<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:21.790> full<00:03:22.150> boil<00:03:22.450> in<00:03:22.810> six<00:03:23.260> minutes

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
degrees to a full boil in six minutes

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.680 
degrees to a full boil in six minutes
and<00:03:23.740> 57<00:03:24.370> seconds<00:03:24.840> that's<00:03:25.840> only<00:03:26.050> about<00:03:26.340> what<00:03:27.690> 20

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
and 57 seconds that's only about what 20

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.450 
and 57 seconds that's only about what 20
seconds<00:03:29.110> or<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:30.180> faster<00:03:31.290> than<00:03:32.290> on<00:03:32.470> this<00:03:32.650> one<00:03:32.860> on

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
seconds or so faster than on this one on

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.620 
seconds or so faster than on this one on
the<00:03:33.700> solo<00:03:34.050> but<00:03:35.050> then<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.350> solo<00:03:35.710> burned<00:03:36.630> for

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
the solo but then the solo burned for

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.440 
the solo but then the solo burned for
nine<00:03:37.930> minutes<00:03:38.170> of<00:03:38.410> 39<00:03:38.890> seconds<00:03:39.430> until<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.300> ran

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
nine minutes of 39 seconds until it ran

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.570 
nine minutes of 39 seconds until it ran
out<00:03:40.690> whereas<00:03:41.380> this<00:03:41.530> one<00:03:41.590> ran<00:03:41.950> out<00:03:42.130> at<00:03:42.310> 1017<00:03:44.580> so

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
out whereas this one ran out at 1017 so

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.750 
out whereas this one ran out at 1017 so
I<00:03:46.530> really<00:03:47.530> thought<00:03:47.680> it<00:03:47.830> would<00:03:47.950> do<00:03:48.100> faster<00:03:48.610> than

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
I really thought it would do faster than

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.600 
I really thought it would do faster than
that<00:03:49.980> but<00:03:51.360> it<00:03:52.360> definitely<00:03:52.570> would<00:03:52.900> give<00:03:53.110> you

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
that but it definitely would give you

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.130 
that but it definitely would give you
good<00:03:54.610> drinking<00:03:55.000> water<00:03:55.030> it's<00:03:55.450> a<00:03:55.540> long<00:03:55.900> enough

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
good drinking water it's a long enough

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.740 
good drinking water it's a long enough
burned<00:03:56.350> for<00:03:56.590> that<00:03:56.770> actually<00:03:57.720> instead<00:03:58.720> of

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
burned for that actually instead of

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.090 
burned for that actually instead of
putting<00:03:58.900> an<00:03:59.140> ounce<00:03:59.260> in<00:03:59.440> there<00:03:59.620> you<00:03:59.710> might<00:03:59.890> want

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
putting an ounce in there you might want

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.730 
putting an ounce in there you might want
to<00:04:00.190> cut<00:04:00.370> it<00:04:00.760> down<00:04:00.790> to<00:04:01.180> a<00:04:01.540> half<00:04:02.260> ounce<00:04:02.500> or

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
to cut it down to a half ounce or

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.510 
to cut it down to a half ounce or
whatever<00:04:03.040> mark<00:04:03.460> your<00:04:03.610> bottle<00:04:04.140> so<00:04:05.140> that<00:04:05.520> this

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
it doesn't look like you can pour the

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.380 
it doesn't look like you can pour the
alcohol<00:04:08.320> back<00:04:08.890> out<00:04:09.100> of<00:04:09.250> these<00:04:09.430> so<00:04:10.120> whatever

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390
