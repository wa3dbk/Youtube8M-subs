00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.000
 Our world is not a good world 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.980
 And we suffer because we are part of it. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.020
 We consider rulers as rescuers, and their crowns as a beacon of hope in dark times. 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.380
 But the real savior already knows our fate. 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.000
 He knows that we are the same as this rotten world. 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.380
 And is there atonement? Or do we just need to leave the world that we have defiled? 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.240
 The road to salvation is long. 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.700
 Our redemption is not in restoration, but only in self-destruction. 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.300
 Our shepherds lead us to the slaughter and must be punished for it. 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.840
 The promised land is very close ... 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.520
 She is here... 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.520
 On the edge of my sword! 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.600
 No more empires 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.920
 ... heroes ... 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.020
 ... and kings!
