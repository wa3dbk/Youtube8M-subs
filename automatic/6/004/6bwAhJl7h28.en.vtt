00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
next step yet he's really not yet a

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.680 
next step yet he's really not yet a
10-round<00:03:13.140> fighter<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.920> given<00:03:14.520> his<00:03:14.670> style<00:03:14.970> of

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
10-round fighter and given his style of

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.150 
pressure and a lot of punches going 10
should<00:03:18.720> definitely<00:03:19.110> benefit<00:03:19.590> him<00:03:19.710> so<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:19.950> think

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
should definitely benefit him so I think

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.900 
should definitely benefit him so I think
