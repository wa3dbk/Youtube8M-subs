then you'll also come in here and cut

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.630 
then you'll also come in here and cut
some<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.630> other<00:01:54.810> ones<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:56.280> cut<00:01:56.490> them

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
some of the other ones and you cut them

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.660 
some of the other ones and you cut them
all<00:01:56.850> at<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.420> height<00:01:57.689> and<00:02:01.369> usually<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.520> to

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
all at this height and usually I like to

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.510 
all at this height and usually I like to
cut<00:02:02.909> if<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.719> look<00:02:03.930> right<00:02:04.110> here<00:02:04.219> right<00:02:05.219> above

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
cut if you look right here right above

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.370 
cut if you look right here right above
that's<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.000> bud<00:02:06.240> there<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:06.990> see<00:02:07.170> some

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
that's a bud there you can see some

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.619 
that's a bud there you can see some
growth<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.399> do<00:02:08.580> see<00:02:08.819> some<00:02:09.060> growth<00:02:09.330> cut

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
growth if you do see some growth cut

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.670 
growth if you do see some growth cut
right<00:02:09.840> above<00:02:10.110> that

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.390 

and<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:14.510> just<00:02:14.689> continue<00:02:14.959> removing<00:02:15.829> these

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
and you just continue removing these

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.300 
and you just continue removing these
large<00:02:16.760> branches<00:02:17.510> all<00:02:17.810> around<00:02:18.590> as<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.040> see

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
large branches all around as you see

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.210 
large branches all around as you see
here<00:02:19.819> as<00:02:19.939> to<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.689> large<00:02:20.930> branches<00:02:21.650> you'll

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
here as to the large branches you'll

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.789 
here as to the large branches you'll
come<00:02:22.489> in<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:22.879> use<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.120> heavy-duty<00:02:23.659> pruners<00:02:24.620> and

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
come in and use a heavy-duty pruners and

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.349 
come in and use a heavy-duty pruners and
you<00:02:25.489> just<00:02:25.760> come<00:02:26.000> in<00:02:26.329> just<00:02:26.480> like<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:28.359> it

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:29.359 
you just come in just like so and it

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.740 
you just come in just like so and it
really<00:02:29.629> makes<00:02:29.930> pruning<00:02:30.739> easy<00:02:31.129> I<00:02:31.459> don't<00:02:32.390> like

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
really makes pruning easy I don't like

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.920 
really makes pruning easy I don't like
to<00:02:32.959> use<00:02:33.319> you<00:02:34.310> know<00:02:34.400> chainsaws<00:02:35.000> you<00:02:35.720> always

have to be careful whatever you use if

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.479 
have to be careful whatever you use if
you<00:02:37.579> you<00:02:38.030> might<00:02:38.269> want<00:02:38.480> I<00:02:38.810> wear<00:02:39.200> glove<00:02:40.159> wear

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
and you just work your way around the

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.640 
and you just work your way around the
butterfly<00:02:45.739> shrub<00:02:46.159> just<00:02:47.030> like<00:02:47.299> this<00:02:47.599> and<00:02:47.870> by

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
butterfly shrub just like this and by

butterfly shrub just like this and by
the<00:02:48.680> time<00:02:49.010> you're<00:02:49.250> done<00:02:49.280> as<00:02:49.819> you'll<00:02:50.569> see<00:02:50.900> we'll

the time you're done as you'll see we'll

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.920 
the time you're done as you'll see we'll
have<00:02:51.829> cut<00:02:52.040> all<00:02:52.250> these<00:02:52.489> branches<00:02:52.879> twelve<00:02:53.750> to

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
have cut all these branches twelve to

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.800 
have cut all these branches twelve to
eighteen<00:02:54.049> inches<00:02:54.680> if<00:02:54.889> you<00:02:54.950> have<00:02:55.819> very<00:02:56.239> thick

eighteen inches if you have very thick

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.410 
eighteen inches if you have very thick
branches<00:02:57.439> feel<00:02:58.129> free<00:02:58.459> to<00:02:58.489> use<00:02:58.939> a<00:02:58.970> little

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
branches feel free to use a little

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.660 
branches feel free to use a little
handsaw<00:03:00.049> for<00:03:00.739> some<00:03:00.920> of<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.099> larger<00:03:01.519> branches

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
handsaw for some of the larger branches

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.539 
handsaw for some of the larger branches
if<00:03:02.239> it<00:03:02.780> requires<00:03:03.260> that<00:03:03.620> but<00:03:04.040> most<00:03:04.280> of<00:03:04.430> these

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
if it requires that but most of these

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.030 
if it requires that but most of these
are<00:03:04.609> pretty<00:03:05.060> young<00:03:05.319> again<00:03:06.319> you<00:03:06.470> do<00:03:06.620> this<00:03:06.859> each

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
are pretty young again you do this each

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.080 
are pretty young again you do this each
and<00:03:07.310> every<00:03:07.609> year

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
and every year

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.599 
and every year
now<00:03:08.269> one<00:03:08.510> other<00:03:08.750> option<00:03:09.049> you<00:03:09.439> can<00:03:09.680> do<00:03:09.859> instead

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
now one other option you can do instead

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.160 
now one other option you can do instead
of<00:03:10.670> twelve<00:03:10.939> to<00:03:11.090> eighteen<00:03:11.120> inches<00:03:11.720> from<00:03:12.019> the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
of twelve to eighteen inches from the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.559 
of twelve to eighteen inches from the
ground<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:13.069> can<00:03:13.099> cut<00:03:13.459> it<00:03:13.579> to<00:03:13.609> two<00:03:13.970> inches<00:03:14.299> from

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
ground you can cut it to two inches from

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.099 
ground you can cut it to two inches from
the<00:03:14.689> ground

the ground

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.530 
the ground
and<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.530> reason<00:03:15.920> you<00:03:16.069> do<00:03:16.220> that<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.669> instead<00:03:17.449> of

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
and the reason you do that is instead of

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.319 
and the reason you do that is instead of
the<00:03:17.690> plant<00:03:18.019> getting<00:03:18.410> eight<00:03:18.859> feet<00:03:19.310> tall<00:03:19.579> it'll

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
the plant getting eight feet tall it'll

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.349 
the plant getting eight feet tall it'll
be<00:03:20.449> more<00:03:20.660> like<00:03:20.690> five<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.319> a<00:03:21.530> half<00:03:21.590> feet<00:03:21.980> tall

be more like five and a half feet tall
when<00:03:23.359> you're<00:03:23.540> done<00:03:23.720> your<00:03:23.930> butterfly<00:03:24.379> shrub

when you're done your butterfly shrub

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.650 
when you're done your butterfly shrub
will<00:03:24.980> look<00:03:25.190> like<00:03:25.400> this<00:03:25.730> you<00:03:25.940> can<00:03:26.090> follow<00:03:26.329> up

will look like this you can follow up

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.990 
will look like this you can follow up
throughout<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.230> year<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:27.739> prune<00:03:28.310> out<00:03:28.489> any<00:03:28.760> of
