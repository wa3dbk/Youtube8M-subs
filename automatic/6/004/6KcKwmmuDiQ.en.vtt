00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
all right so it's been about ten minutes

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.590 
all right so it's been about ten minutes
so<00:00:03.090> it's<00:00:03.270> time<00:00:03.510> for<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.780> benzoyl<00:00:04.080> peroxide<00:00:04.230> I

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:05.600 
so it's time for a benzoyl peroxide I

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.320 
so it's time for a benzoyl peroxide I
use<00:00:06.600> two<00:00:07.140> full<00:00:07.620> pumps<00:00:08.330> for<00:00:09.330> my<00:00:09.420> whole<00:00:09.599> face<00:00:11.330> end

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
up using the tube of benzoyl peroxide go

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.279 
up using the tube of benzoyl peroxide go
ahead<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:14.910> use<00:00:15.089> one<00:00:15.350> thick<00:00:16.350> fingers<00:00:17.190> like

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
ahead and use one thick fingers like

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.670 
ahead and use one thick fingers like
like<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.789> and<00:00:20.990> then<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.050> first<00:00:22.380> thing<00:00:22.529> I'll

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
like that and then the first thing I'll

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.359 
like that and then the first thing I'll
do<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:24.859> dab<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.039> on<00:00:26.189> there<00:00:27.650> really<00:00:28.650> generously

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
do is dab it on there really generously

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.600 
do is dab it on there really generously
as<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:30.090> can<00:00:30.300> see<00:00:33.620> this<00:00:34.620> benzoyl<00:00:35.040> peroxide<00:00:35.579> is

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
as you can see this benzoyl peroxide is

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.160 
as you can see this benzoyl peroxide is
a<00:00:35.820> gel<00:00:37.040> so<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.070> doesn't<00:00:38.460> dry<00:00:38.760> very<00:00:38.969> quickly<00:00:39.170> so

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
a gel so it doesn't dry very quickly so

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.049 
a gel so it doesn't dry very quickly so
you<00:00:40.260> can<00:00:40.379> just<00:00:40.530> dab<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.370> everywhere<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:41.910> it'll

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
you can just dab it everywhere and it'll

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.080 
you can just dab it everywhere and it'll
be<00:00:42.210> there<00:00:42.360> when<00:00:42.390> you're<00:00:42.629> ready<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.110> and

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
be there when you're ready for it and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.229 
be there when you're ready for it and
then<00:00:45.090> I'm<00:00:45.210> going<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.360> very<00:00:45.899> very<00:00:46.410> gently<00:00:47.239> smear

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
then I'm going to very very gently smear

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.410 
then I'm going to very very gently smear
this<00:00:48.450> around<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.610> seems<00:00:50.610> at<00:00:50.969> first<00:00:52.219> like<00:00:53.420> this

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
this around it seems at first like this

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.529 
this around it seems at first like this
is<00:00:54.539> just<00:00:54.719> way<00:00:54.870> too<00:00:54.930> much<00:00:56.149> that's<00:00:57.149> how<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.390> may

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
is just way too much that's how it may

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.110 
is just way too much that's how it may
feel<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:59.059> but<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.899> not<00:01:01.140> believe<00:01:01.739> me

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
feel to you but it's not believe me

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.310 
feel to you but it's not believe me
that's<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.329> key<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> regimen<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
that's the key to the regimen is the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.179 
that's the key to the regimen is the
more<00:01:04.619> benzoyl<00:01:05.309> peroxide<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:06.060> better

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
more benzoyl peroxide the better

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.260 
more benzoyl peroxide the better
remember<00:01:08.189> when<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.400> start<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> regimen

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
remember when you start on the regimen

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.780 
remember when you start on the regimen
you<00:01:09.450> want<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> use<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> very<00:01:09.960> small<00:01:10.350> amount<00:01:10.920> but

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
you want to use a very small amount but

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.420 
you want to use a very small amount but
since<00:01:12.270> I've<00:01:12.420> been<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.990> long<00:01:13.110> time

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
since I've been on it for a long time

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.859 
since I've been on it for a long time
that's<00:01:14.430> why<00:01:14.610> I'm<00:01:14.729> using<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.060> full<00:01:15.299> two<00:01:15.479> pumps

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
that's why I'm using the full two pumps

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.100 
that's why I'm using the full two pumps

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.250 
what I'm doing here is just very gently
smearing<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.310> around<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:27.330> allowing<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.230> to

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
smearing it around and allowing it to

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.840 
smearing it around and allowing it to
absorb<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:28.950> its<00:01:29.100> own<00:01:30.740> it<00:01:31.740> should<00:01:31.980> be<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.370> gentle

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
absorb on its own it should be so gentle

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.930 
absorb on its own it should be so gentle

two for my eyes there this is going to
go<00:02:05.730> on<00:02:05.910> here<00:02:06.300> because<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:07.020> takes<00:02:07.230> a<00:02:07.380> while

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.450 

you<00:02:17.320> just<00:02:17.470> want<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.620> keep<00:02:17.860> smearing<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.370> around

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.600 

it's<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.630> good<00:02:30.840> time<00:02:31.020> to<00:02:31.230> think<00:02:32.040> about<00:02:32.220> other

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610

face there
I<00:02:47.360> could<00:02:48.360> even<00:02:48.450> keep<00:02:48.750> going<00:02:48.960> a<00:02:49.020> little<00:02:49.050> longer

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
I could even keep going a little longer

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.320 
I could even keep going a little longer
