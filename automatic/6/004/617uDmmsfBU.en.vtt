00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 so you me youtube you're good here 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.670
 same we have the samsung galaxy and 53 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.379
 60 in this court violence of how 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.929
 assign a different tone to a contact 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.809
 to assign a different mouse a 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.740
 melody as you want to call it 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.120
 procedure is very simple but more 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.670
 important to keep in mind is that when 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.699
 we create a contact to be able to have a 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.100
 30 a different from all the rest 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.230
 in general that we have configured by 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.720
 sounds this has related in the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.220
 phone this contact for example 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.619
 we must do a demonstration in this 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.230
 case I have here because of the contacts that 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.630
 have been the scene only in the in 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.239
 the sd card I will make a call 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.620
 from the phone you expect and how 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.410
 they will see who I do not have options for 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.760
 compression of melodies so when 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.430
 usually phone will ring with the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.230
 melody to the sound that all the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.190
 other phones we are going to make a 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.190
 call more using ls three mini 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.190
 calling 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.960
 is the challenge for all phones 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.090
 hello all my contacts right now I'm going to 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.230
 eliminate from that contact and then from 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:10.900
 store on the phone 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:14.070
 to a team where something on the phone 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:18.760
 I'm not just going to delete it here 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.860
 we are going to eliminate it accept and delete it 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.770
 right now I'll let store 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.430
 store some records inside me 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.990
 no no 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:34.630
 how to store it on the phone I will 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.000
 add here is already the option to 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.730
 add on the phone and here 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.490
 important to look for the option that says 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.870
 tone in the option that says everything that 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.260
 We select any other 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:51.130
 sound that is either an mp3 sound that 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.690
 we have downloaded or simply the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.860
 ringtones of those coming from 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.740
 between that phone we will choose 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.200
 any other 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.399
 this is completely different although it 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.869
 it seems like a little bit to the one that ended that I do not know 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.720
 if it is completely different and right now 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.039
 the very fat in this case if we 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.610
 we go back and look at the notebook 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.920
 directions let's see the contact 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.440
 It has to be around here, I'm not bad, it's 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.430
 this really that the video comes out the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.900
 name but this is the contact is 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.900
 let's make the call again 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.560
 and you will see that you already have a project 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.560
 completely different 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.189
 so it's simple we can configure the 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.430
 Importers to the different contacts 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:44.200
 we have to simply do it 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.970
 individually and pass them all to 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.340
 phone if we have them in the sim card 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.620
 perform an import of contacts at 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.620
 phone and then each one will go 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.939
 changing the rector especially for this 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.900
 video I invite you to subscribe 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.900
