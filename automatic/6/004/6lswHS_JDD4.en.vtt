00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.200
 it continues with the success 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.490
 or with the trophy dj team 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.190
 from metro 2033 like dax and around this 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.070
 success or to keep this trophy 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.139
 you in the outpost outpost the funkturm 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:22.050
 rich and the message of 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.160
 Commanders therefore send the whole thing around 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.920
 The whole thing would have to do in the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.570
 mission defense would have to start there 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.260
 Here are some monsters here at the beginning 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.449
 shoot dead 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.789
 until the door is open and then 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.139
 is the guy there because he talks and 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.120
 does not talk and tell anybody 

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:42.260
 in any case, in the end wants to know 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.469
 only that you take a cassette and the 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.979
 bring to the funkturm and as a message 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.979
 sent 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:01:00.539
 then you take the cassette or fear 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:06.090
 up and down though then one like that 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.500
 memory circle sign is you are allowed 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.090
 not back to the last memory point 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.770
 and to the next mission as 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.619
 Outpost with the beginning but 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.750
 you have to have the other mission by 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.700
 continue play through and end 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.649
 then it will continue right here I have 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.640
 the opponents already seem to the opponents 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.799
 switched off 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.590
 So just play as long as you are 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.270
 this job comes without any wears 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.270
 now a memory point or something 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.999
 no idea plays easy and then 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.859
 could not miss that 

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:37.249
 exactly so the would not have high 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.249
 climb 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.770
 and then you already have more success 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.500
 The other success has not yet 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.990
 we can do the same 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.210
 inquisitor or something to kill two demons 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.770
 You can do that up there, too 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.869
 that sits a demon and there you can 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.180
 then if you have a kilt reset 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.030
 memories again sitting there 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.970
 So he just once more with red 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.580
 shoot head then death should be 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.660
 In any case, the cassette here and 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.890
 then pressed square or xbox and here 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.180
 then you should be successful 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.010
 or get the trophy 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:24.120
 in the description is a link to 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.750
 my facebook page and from the 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.650
 others do the playlist link until 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.350
 next time 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.600
 and my bock you still have the type 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.720
 definitely go to the next 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.720
 times
