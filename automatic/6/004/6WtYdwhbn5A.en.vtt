our<00:01:59.590> portal<00:01:59.860> to<00:01:59.980> get<00:02:00.130> this<00:02:00.220> information<00:02:00.520> so

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
our portal to get this information so

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.290 
our portal to get this information so
let's<00:02:01.870> go<00:02:02.170> back<00:02:02.200> up<00:02:02.560> here<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:03.010> let<00:02:03.250> me<00:02:03.300> go

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
let's go back up here and let me go

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.620 
let's go back up here and let me go
first<00:02:04.630> of<00:02:04.840> all<00:02:04.990> back<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.860> home<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:07.450> show

first of all back to the home to show

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.260 
first of all back to the home to show
you<00:02:07.780> where<00:02:07.930> we<00:02:08.110> can<00:02:08.320> find<00:02:08.530> this<00:02:08.619> information

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
you where we can find this information

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.730 
you where we can find this information
if<00:02:10.270> I<00:02:10.450> select<00:02:10.780> on<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.020> post<00:02:11.230> services

if I select on the post services

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.880 
if I select on the post services
underneath<00:02:12.130> storage<00:02:13.230> you're<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.260> call<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.800> the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
underneath storage you're a call and the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.100 
underneath storage you're a call and the
first<00:02:15.130> step<00:02:15.370> we<00:02:15.520> created<00:02:16.120> this<00:02:16.240> easy<00:02:16.600> as<00:02:16.870> your

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
first step we created this easy as your

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.420 
first step we created this easy as your
storage<00:02:17.470> all<00:02:17.740> lowercase

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
storage all lowercase

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.910 
storage all lowercase
so<00:02:19.240> let's<00:02:19.420> first<00:02:19.600> copy<00:02:19.960> this<00:02:20.200> this<00:02:20.620> is<00:02:20.770> our

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
so let's first copy this this is our

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.230 
so let's first copy this this is our
account<00:02:21.160> name<00:02:21.340> from<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.580> properties<00:02:22.000> window

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
account name from the properties window

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.990 
account name from the properties window
and<00:02:23.190> we<00:02:24.190> can<00:02:24.220> paste<00:02:24.459> this<00:02:24.610> in<00:02:24.730> here<00:02:24.760> for

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
and we can paste this in here for

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.160 
and we can paste this in here for
account<00:02:25.240> name<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:26.400> account<00:02:27.400> key<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:28.080> going<00:02:29.080> to

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
account name and account key is going to

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.580 
account name and account key is going to
be<00:02:29.700> up<00:02:30.700> here<00:02:31.060> we<00:02:31.660> can<00:02:31.840> just<00:02:31.990> copy<00:02:32.170> this<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.530> the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
be up here we can just copy this to the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.240 
be up here we can just copy this to the
clipboard

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.710 

paste<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:36.910> in

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
paste that in

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.810 
paste that in
we<00:02:39.290> don't<00:02:39.470> need<00:02:39.530> is<00:02:39.680> TPS<00:02:40.160> for<00:02:40.370> this<00:02:40.490> so<00:02:40.730> I'll

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
we don't need is TPS for this so I'll

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.240 
we don't need is TPS for this so I'll
just<00:02:40.880> go<00:02:41.120> ahead<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.390> select<00:02:41.950> HTTP<00:02:43.000> it's<00:02:44.000> fine

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
just go ahead and select HTTP it's fine

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.580 
just go ahead and select HTTP it's fine
that's<00:02:46.250> optional<00:02:46.790> talk<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.060> you<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:48.230> should

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590

be good for this so now let me go ahead

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.680 
be good for this so now let me go ahead
and<00:02:50.060> save<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:52.450> realistically<00:02:53.450> we're<00:02:53.600> gonna

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
and save and realistically we're gonna

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.910 
and save and realistically we're gonna
walk<00:02:53.930> through<00:02:54.080> another<00:02:54.290> wizard<00:02:54.440> before<00:02:54.680> we

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
walk through another wizard before we

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.040 
walk through another wizard before we
can<00:02:55.070> publish<00:02:55.220> this<00:02:55.520> so<00:02:56.240> if<00:02:56.540> I<00:02:56.630> come<00:02:56.780> up<00:02:56.810> here

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
can publish this so if I come up here

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.220 
can publish this so if I come up here
and<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:57.230> select<00:02:57.290> publish<00:02:58.750> what's<00:02:59.750> gonna<00:02:59.870> happen

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
and I select publish what's gonna happen

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.650 
and I select publish what's gonna happen
is<00:03:00.290> it's<00:03:00.410> gonna<00:03:00.500> ask<00:03:00.710> me<00:03:01.040> for<00:03:01.820> my<00:03:02.060> credentials

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
is it's gonna ask me for my credentials

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.320 
is it's gonna ask me for my credentials
so<00:03:03.500> this<00:03:04.190> is<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.310> process<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:04.850> probably<00:03:05.150> only

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
so this is a process you probably only

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.400 
so this is a process you probably only
have<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.660> walk<00:03:05.810> through<00:03:05.960> one<00:03:06.140> something<00:03:06.290> to

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
have to walk through one something to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.710 
have to walk through one something to
walk<00:03:06.560> through<00:03:06.770> it<00:03:06.860> with<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.420> so<00:03:08.420> what<00:03:08.630> we're

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
walk through it with you so what we're

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.940 
walk through it with you so what we're
gonna<00:03:08.780> do<00:03:09.050> is<00:03:09.260> I've<00:03:09.380> already<00:03:09.680> got<00:03:09.800> an<00:03:09.860> account

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
gonna do is I've already got an account

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.010 
gonna do is I've already got an account
here<00:03:10.160> I'm<00:03:10.340> gonna<00:03:10.490> have<00:03:10.850> another<00:03:11.180> one<00:03:11.330> for<00:03:11.930> the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
here I'm gonna have another one for the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.830 
here I'm gonna have another one for the
sake<00:03:12.200> of<00:03:12.230> this<00:03:12.350> demonstration<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:14.600> these

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
sake of this demonstration and these

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.390 
sake of this demonstration and these
credentials<00:03:15.140> are<00:03:15.260> gonna<00:03:15.410> authenticate<00:03:15.620> me<00:03:16.040> to

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
credentials are gonna authenticate me to

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.490 
credentials are gonna authenticate me to
publish<00:03:16.850> otherwise<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:17.960> could<00:03:18.140> just<00:03:18.290> create

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
publish otherwise I could just create

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.960 
publish otherwise I could just create
the<00:03:18.650> package<00:03:18.980> files<00:03:19.190> go<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.550> portal<00:03:19.880> and

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
the package files go to the portal and

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.200 
the package files go to the portal and
upload<00:03:20.420> them<00:03:20.770> so<00:03:21.770> here<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.340> want<00:03:22.580> to<00:03:22.700> create<00:03:22.880> a

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
upload them so here I want to create a

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.010 
upload them so here I want to create a
new<00:03:23.420> certificate<00:03:25.000> there's<00:03:26.000> just<00:03:26.150> several<00:03:26.810> of

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
new certificate there's just several of

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.690 
new certificate there's just several of
them<00:03:27.110> that<00:03:27.260> I<00:03:27.290> already<00:03:27.650> have<00:03:28.070> created<00:03:28.370> for

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
them that I already have created for

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.070 
them that I already have created for
demos<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.150> put<00:03:29.300> it<00:03:29.390> in<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.510> past<00:03:29.690> but<00:03:29.990> I'm

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
demos and put it in the past but I'm

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.380 
demos and put it in the past but I'm
going<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:30.230> create<00:03:30.410> a<00:03:30.470> new<00:03:30.590> one<00:03:31.240> give<00:03:32.240> it<00:03:32.300> a

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
going to create a new one give it a

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.910 
going to create a new one give it a
friendly<00:03:32.630> name<00:03:32.780> we'll<00:03:32.930> call<00:03:33.080> it<00:03:33.170> a<00:03:33.440> sure<00:03:33.860> demo

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.970 

and<00:03:37.920> then<00:03:38.780> once<00:03:39.780> I've<00:03:39.930> done<00:03:40.080> that<00:03:40.140> I'll<00:03:40.680> select

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
and then once I've done that I'll select

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.520 
and then once I've done that I'll select
copy<00:03:41.520> full<00:03:41.940> path<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:42.870> this<00:03:43.050> is<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.200> second

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
copy full path so this is the second

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.850 
copy full path so this is the second
step<00:03:43.680> if<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:43.920> come<00:03:44.070> out<00:03:44.160> here<00:03:44.300> I'll<00:03:45.300> say<00:03:45.860> oops

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
step if I come out here I'll say oops

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.390 
step if I come out here I'll say oops
yep<00:03:47.520> so<00:03:47.760> once<00:03:48.240> I've<00:03:48.360> copied<00:03:48.600> that<00:03:48.840> full<00:03:49.080> path<00:03:49.400> I

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
yep so once I've copied that full path I

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.600 
yep so once I've copied that full path I
can<00:03:50.760> come<00:03:50.940> out<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.360> developer<00:03:51.510> portal<00:03:52.610> and

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
can come out to the developer portal and

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.340 
can come out to the developer portal and
upload<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.450> certificate<00:03:55.020> to<00:03:55.200> the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
upload the certificate to the

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.620

certificate<00:04:20.420> into<00:04:21.420> the<00:04:21.540> name<00:04:21.750> so<00:04:22.320> let's<00:04:22.530> go

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
certificate into the name so let's go

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.050 
certificate into the name so let's go
ahead<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:22.800> say<00:04:23.040> at<00:04:23.100> least<00:04:23.190> remove<00:04:23.490> that<00:04:23.730> part
