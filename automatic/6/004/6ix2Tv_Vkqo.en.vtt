00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hi to all that kind guys 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.730
 welcome to this new video here on 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.410
 my channel where we will talk about things 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.150
 very very interesting 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.190
 in fact it had not arrived for some time 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.799
 a blog so I finally decided 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.320
 to record one on the occasion of two 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.810
 very important things the first place 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.340
 boys we have exceeded 60 thousand 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.189
 subscribed to my main channel 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.000
 so obviously I absolutely want to 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.519
 thank you for this very great 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.410
 goal and think that with over 1000 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.929
 videos uploaded we have also passed the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.669
 10 million total views 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.079
 and that's why he can't do 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.030
 nothing but really thanking them 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.010
 very much regarding the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.440
 second channel we are close and 10 thousand 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.640
 subscribers therefore in the case in which still 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.050

 receive all the information for 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.030
 regarding the release of new videos 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.719
 the times they will come out and all things 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.370
 such 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.010
 the second thing concerns instead 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.110
 finally after months and months and months in 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.360
 whose real talked about the arrival of the new 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.460
 computer from gaming this computer from 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.439
 gaming will allow you the first place to 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.689
 explore new games that do precisely 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.880
 parts of the PC world, therefore, PC gaming 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.890
 and above all they can work a lot 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.170
 much better on my videos indeed 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.130
 children having now exceeded 60 thousand 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.290
 subscribers and I feel a little 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.820
 responsibility of having to make some 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.770
 so my work more serious for 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.049
 this is why I decided to do a 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.180
 great investment by doing a lot of 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.009
 sacrifices, however, by making some sacrifices 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.110
 it was an expense I wanted to make 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.030
 for the fact that you are going to 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.920
 improve my work like many of 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.659
 you will know it is not that it is a big one 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.729
 computer expert so just for 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.619
 this is why I relied on it all over again 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.110
 computer science from tom's hardware that yes 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.939
 they are immediately activated to make me a 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.490
 nice gaming computer so obviously 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.590
 I thank them and finally they are guys 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.270
 really happy to be able to work on 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.220
 a new computer that allows you to 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.040
 support maybe even 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.140
 much faster and in fact col 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.790
 computer that I had before and that real 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.890
 too many processes still were 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.380
 very fact of rendering lenses 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.000
 guys were really endless now not 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.530
 I could stand it no longer shows me up 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.570
 at 3 am to wait for that 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.860
 came the rendering and then put it to 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.520
 upload videos for the day 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.200
 following 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.640
 and this also with regard to the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.490
 stress was something that was done to him 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.110
 feel a lot instead want or despite 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.400
 however has not yet approved a 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.900
 full the computer since it is me 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.460
 arrived after the single day then 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.050
 I really tried very little 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.940
 sure for the components I have 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.790
 chosen and found obviously in 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.709
 description I can work very much 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.780
 better and with greater ease among other things 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.480
 ragazzuoli here I still have the keyboard that 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.640
 I have to discard this is the siam kit 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.310
 flock octane is really able to 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.680
 very little and you will have the unboxing of this one 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.020
 so my full second channel keyboard 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.730
 the joseph gates linke description 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.050
 let's say that here as you know not 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.940
 is that he is a great expert but a 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.470
 unboxing can be really good 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.270
 because I'm sure he really does 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.430
 many can be of interest to a new one 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.560
 keyboard because this precisely seems 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.090
 be very very interesting 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.800
 in the last period I noticed that 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.660
 series that I brought you on the channel mi 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.430
 I liked a lot maybe some not 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.440
 much like for example dolder but I have 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.209
 noted that just in general the 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.920
 of the order of any gameplay 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.290
 youtuber is not liked 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.709
 very much so I realized the 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.900
 fact that perhaps just dolder 1886 was 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.209
 plus a title to play personally 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.640
 and not just look at youtube 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.440
 very different thing instead for dragon 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.120
 ball xeno towards I noticed this 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.130
 series is really unpopulated 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.140
 so much so much so that every 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.269
 single episode really exceeds in a few 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.280
 hours the thousand likes for this guys me 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.170
 I'm really excited about it 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.730
 why see them learned so much the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.620
 my job is really great 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.480
 great satisfaction therefore not 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.400
 I can only thank the new 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.320
 to conclude then I can say of 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.190
 be more and more urged to do better 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.959
 here on youtube 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.910
 so guys, I really want to bet 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.100
 great on my channel and above all 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.630
 also on my second channel since 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.160
 now with a new computer can 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.260
 explore a new game library 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.390
 which first of all being on the control 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.250
 in fact I couldn't play guys on 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.080
 second channel shortly than soon 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.459
 precisely I will have the chance I want 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.020
 start of the new ed series 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.730
 emotionally organize myself in because 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.680
 managing two channels is not for nothing 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.330
