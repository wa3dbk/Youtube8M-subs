hey guys grace part 1 here and ah today
just<00:00:06.359> lost<00:00:06.569> my<00:00:06.720> train<00:00:06.930> of<00:00:06.990> thought<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.230> little

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
just lost my train of thought a little

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.940 
just lost my train of thought a little
bit<00:00:07.589> for<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.250> second<00:00:08.519> there<00:00:08.550> today<00:00:09.559> I'm<00:00:10.559> going

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
bit for a second there today I'm going

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.950 
bit for a second there today I'm going
to<00:00:11.010> be<00:00:11.099> doing<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.550> tutorial<00:00:11.610> on<00:00:12.179> combination

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
combination lock so which buttons i

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.179 
combination lock so which buttons i
consider<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.540> much<00:01:19.530> more<00:01:19.560> complicated

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
consider to be much more complicated

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.810 
consider to be much more complicated
than<00:01:20.700> levers<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.750> let's<00:01:21.990> get<00:01:22.110> started<00:01:22.460> so<00:01:23.460> what

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
than levers so let's get started so what

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.370 
than levers so let's get started so what
I'm<00:01:23.909> going<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.119> start<00:01:24.330> off<00:01:24.509> doing<00:01:24.869> here<00:01:25.229> is

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
I'm going to start off doing here is

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.940 
I'm going to start off doing here is
just<00:01:26.090> placing<00:01:27.090> down<00:01:27.270> three<00:01:27.720> levers<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.380> I'm

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
just placing down three levers and I'm

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.429 
just placing down three levers and I'm
going<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.250> what<00:01:29.400> my<00:01:29.520> combination<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.630> be<00:01:30.900> this

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
going to what my combination to be this

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.880 
going to what my combination to be this
being<00:01:31.799> lever<00:01:32.070> one<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.670> being<00:01:32.880> lever<00:01:33.119> 3<00:01:33.890> 1

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
being lever one and this being lever 3 1

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.550 
being lever one and this being lever 3 1
and<00:01:35.250> 3<00:01:35.850> will<00:01:36.479> be<00:01:36.600> my<00:01:36.750> combination<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.530> open

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
and 3 will be my combination to open

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.960 
and 3 will be my combination to open
that<00:01:37.920> door<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.280> see<00:01:38.460> over<00:01:38.670> there<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that door you see over there in the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.300 
that door you see over there in the
corner<00:01:39.320> so<00:01:40.320> how<00:01:40.530> we're<00:01:40.680> going<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.920> accomplish

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
corner so how we're going to accomplish

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.179 
corner so how we're going to accomplish
this<00:01:41.700> first<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.420> well<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.560> main<00:01:43.740> thing<00:01:43.770> with

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
this first is well the main thing with

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.710 
this first is well the main thing with
this<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.670> we're<00:01:44.970> going<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.299> inverting

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
this is we're going to be inverting

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.690 
this is we're going to be inverting
torches<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.799> we're<00:01:47.159> going<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.340> want<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.520> put

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
torches so we're going to want to put

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.120 
torches so we're going to want to put
one<00:01:47.970> right<00:01:48.149> out<00:01:48.329> here<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.600> block<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.200> then

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
one right out here a block and then

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.350 
one right out here a block and then
we're<00:01:50.220> going<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.369> put<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> torch<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.180> side

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
we're going to put a torch on this side

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.880 
we're going to put a torch on this side
now<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.229> whichever<00:01:53.009> um<00:01:53.869> lever<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.590> want

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
now for whichever um lever that you want

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.980 
now for whichever um lever that you want
to<00:01:56.250> influence<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.210> be<00:01:57.299> part<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.780> code<00:01:57.960> i

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
to influence to be part of the code i

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.080 
to influence to be part of the code i

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.899 
should say you're going to want to put a
torch<00:02:00.360> next<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.899> like<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:02.310> i<00:02:02.549> said

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
torch next to it like that so i said

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.560 
torch next to it like that so i said
lever<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.600> three<00:02:03.840> will<00:02:03.990> be<00:02:04.140> my

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
lever one and three will be my

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.490 
lever one and three will be my
combination<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.860> so<00:02:08.720> they<00:02:09.720> get<00:02:09.899> torches<00:02:10.200> and

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
combination and so they get torches and

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.050 
combination and so they get torches and
then<00:02:10.709> I'm<00:02:10.830> going<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.250> bring<00:02:11.400> them<00:02:11.610> out<00:02:11.760> like

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
then I'm going to bring them out like

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.930 
then I'm going to bring them out like
that

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
that

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.470 
that
connect<00:02:13.540> them<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.810> this<00:02:13.960> block<00:02:16.020> like<00:02:17.020> so<00:02:17.530> and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
connect them to this block like so and

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.180 
connect them to this block like so and
then<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.720> middle<00:02:19.960> one<00:02:20.110> number<00:02:20.410> two<00:02:20.590> will<00:02:21.040> not

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
then the middle one number two will not

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.740 
then the middle one number two will not
get<00:02:21.400> anything<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:22.120> will<00:02:22.270> connect<00:02:22.570> straight

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
get anything and will connect straight

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.310 
get anything and will connect straight
up<00:02:22.960> the<00:02:23.080> middle<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:24.540> would<00:02:25.540> be<00:02:25.690> helpful<00:02:25.960> if<00:02:26.230> i

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
up the middle so would be helpful if i

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.950 
up the middle so would be helpful if i
connect<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.770> to<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.100> tour<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:28.690> I'm<00:02:28.780> going<00:02:28.930> to

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
connect it to the tour so I'm going to

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.280 
connect it to the tour so I'm going to
connect<00:02:29.260> this<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.590> door<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:32.050> should

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
connect this to the door that should

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.650 
connect this to the door that should
work<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.850> then<00:02:33.850> it's<00:02:34.060> going<00:02:34.270> to<00:02:34.390> look<00:02:34.630> like

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
work and then it's going to look like

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.010 
work and then it's going to look like
this<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.260> throw<00:02:36.010> that<00:02:36.070> switch<00:02:36.280> down<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.840> going

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
this I throw that switch down it's going

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.560 
this I throw that switch down it's going
to<00:02:38.200> invert<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:38.560> torch<00:02:38.980> but<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.150> one<00:02:40.360> is

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
to invert that torch but that one is

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.660 
to invert that torch but that one is
still<00:02:40.900> inverted<00:02:41.230> because<00:02:41.830> this<00:02:42.190> one<00:02:42.430> is

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
still inverted because this one is

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.560 
still inverted because this one is
powering<00:02:43.540> that<00:02:43.780> block<00:02:43.990> throw<00:02:44.740> that<00:02:44.920> one<00:02:45.070> down

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
powering that block throw that one down

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.200 
powering that block throw that one down
they're<00:02:46.570> both<00:02:46.750> inverted<00:02:47.880> leaving<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:49.030> one

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
they're both inverted leaving that one

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.400 
they're both inverted leaving that one
to<00:02:49.360> be<00:02:49.450> powered<00:02:49.810> opening<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:50.830> door<00:02:51.540> now<00:02:52.540> this

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
to be powered opening the door now this

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.100 
to be powered opening the door now this
one<00:02:53.740> is<00:02:53.920> not<00:02:54.640> part<00:02:54.970> of<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:55.360> this<00:02:55.480> would<00:02:55.720> read

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
one is not part of it so this would read

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.100 
one is not part of it so this would read
true<00:02:56.800> false<00:02:57.760> true<00:02:58.150> that<00:02:58.510> chicken<00:02:58.810> over<00:02:58.990> there

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
true false true that chicken over there

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.390 
true false true that chicken over there
just<00:02:59.230> distract<00:02:59.680> me<00:02:59.950> because<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:00.190> want<00:03:00.340> to

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
just distract me because I want to

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.400 
just distract me because I want to
murder<00:03:00.610> it<00:03:00.820> so<00:03:01.090> bad<00:03:01.300> right<00:03:01.480> now<00:03:01.540> but<00:03:01.840> I'm<00:03:02.260> going

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
murder it so bad right now but I'm going

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.900 
murder it so bad right now but I'm going
to<00:03:02.470> refrain<00:03:02.800> from<00:03:02.830> murdering<00:03:03.340> that<00:03:03.520> chicken

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
to refrain from murdering that chicken

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.180 
to refrain from murdering that chicken
but<00:03:04.600> any<00:03:04.810> other<00:03:05.020> combination<00:03:05.320> to<00:03:05.830> this<00:03:05.950> lock

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
but any other combination to this lock

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.760 
but any other combination to this lock
such<00:03:06.910> as<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.270> will<00:03:07.840> result<00:03:08.170> in<00:03:08.410> a<00:03:08.500> false

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
such as that will result in a false

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.130 
such as that will result in a false
combination<00:03:09.480> that's<00:03:10.480> why<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:10.750> don't<00:03:10.990> just

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
combination that's why you don't just

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.640 
combination that's why you don't just
leave<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:12.160> blank<00:03:12.220> like<00:03:12.790> it's<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.090> fake<00:03:14.080> switch

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
leave that blank like it's a fake switch

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.100 
leave that blank like it's a fake switch
I<00:03:14.860> mean<00:03:15.010> there's<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.400> fake<00:03:15.580> switch<00:03:15.880> but<00:03:16.630> by

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
I mean there's a fake switch but by

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.870 
I mean there's a fake switch but by
putting<00:03:17.350> redstone<00:03:18.010> on<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.489> turns<00:03:18.730> it

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
putting redstone on it that turns it

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.240 
putting redstone on it that turns it
into<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.180> false<00:03:19.720> which<00:03:20.020> when<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.770> pull<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.070> down

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
into a false which when you pull it down

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.250 
into a false which when you pull it down
then<00:03:21.850> it<00:03:21.970> activates<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.600> redstone<00:03:23.020> line

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
then it activates the redstone line

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.790 
then it activates the redstone line
making<00:03:24.250> sure<00:03:24.640> that<00:03:25.000> even<00:03:25.390> if<00:03:25.630> these<00:03:26.500> two<00:03:26.770> are

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
making sure that even if these two are

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.600 
making sure that even if these two are
pulled<00:03:27.190> down<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:28.110> torch<00:03:29.190> will<00:03:30.190> remain

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
pulled down that torch will remain

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.710 
pulled down that torch will remain
inverted<00:03:31.540> because<00:03:32.170> this<00:03:32.590> is<00:03:32.770> being<00:03:32.920> powered

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
inverted because this is being powered

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.270 
inverted because this is being powered
so<00:03:34.720> now<00:03:36.239> I'm<00:03:37.239> going<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:37.450> sneeze<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.980> would<00:03:39.130> be

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
so now I'm going to sneeze that would be

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.400 
so now I'm going to sneeze that would be
bad<00:03:39.489> now<00:03:40.120> I'm<00:03:40.330> going<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:40.660> show<00:03:40.690> you<00:03:40.870> how<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.140> add

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
bad now I'm going to show you how to add

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.370 
bad now I'm going to show you how to add
on<00:03:41.620> more<00:03:41.980> than<00:03:42.280> three<00:03:42.640> switches<00:03:42.910> you<00:03:43.570> can<00:03:43.810> use

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
on more than three switches you can use

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.410 
on more than three switches you can use
this<00:03:44.560> as<00:03:44.800> much<00:03:45.010> as<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.280> want<00:03:45.519> and<00:03:45.700> to

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
this as much as you want and to

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.020 
this as much as you want and to
extrapolate<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:47.110> effect<00:03:47.440> whatever<00:03:47.670> so<00:03:48.670> I'm

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
extrapolate the effect whatever so I'm

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.910 
extrapolate the effect whatever so I'm
going<00:03:49.300> to<00:03:49.360> add<00:03:49.540> on<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:50.050> more<00:03:50.230> switches<00:03:50.470> you<00:03:50.769> can

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
going to add on to more switches you can

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.920 
going to add on to more switches you can
add<00:03:51.070> on<00:03:51.250> 12<00:03:51.640> more<00:03:51.880> switches<00:03:52.150> if<00:03:52.450> you<00:03:52.540> wanted<00:03:52.810> to

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
add on 12 more switches if you wanted to

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.990 
add on 12 more switches if you wanted to
but<00:03:53.140> just<00:03:53.650> for<00:03:53.920> times<00:03:54.130> sake<00:03:54.400> i'm<00:03:54.700> going<00:03:54.850> to<00:03:54.910> add

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
but just for times sake i'm going to add

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.020 
but just for times sake i'm going to add
on<00:03:55.180> to<00:03:55.390> and<00:03:55.600> again<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:56.709> whichever<00:03:57.670> ones<00:03:57.910> you

on to and again I whichever ones you

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.000 
on to and again I whichever ones you
want<00:03:58.239> in<00:03:58.390> to<00:03:58.660> influence<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.290> code<00:03:59.530> you<00:03:59.800> put<00:03:59.980> a

want in to influence the code you put a

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.729 
want in to influence the code you put a
torch<00:04:00.250> behind<00:04:00.580> this<00:04:01.390> switch<00:04:02.290> is<00:04:02.440> going<00:04:02.650> to

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
torch behind this switch is going to

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.780 
torch behind this switch is going to
become<00:04:03.010> switch<00:04:03.280> one<00:04:03.519> that's<00:04:04.390> which<00:04:04.780> switch

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
become switch one that's which switch

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.199 
become switch one that's which switch
5234<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:07.120> I'm<00:04:07.989> just<00:04:08.380> going<00:04:08.709> to<00:04:08.739> add<00:04:08.950> on<00:04:09.250> switch

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
5234 and I'm just going to add on switch

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.630 
5234 and I'm just going to add on switch
one<00:04:10.480> so<00:04:11.080> now<00:04:11.290> switch<00:04:11.650> one<00:04:11.920> is<00:04:12.190> also

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
one so now switch one is also

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.009 
one so now switch one is also
influencing<00:04:13.330> the<00:04:13.390> code<00:04:13.570> I'm<00:04:13.660> going<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:13.870> flip

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
influencing the code I'm going to flip

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.890 
influencing the code I'm going to flip
these<00:04:14.140> up<00:04:14.760> switch<00:04:15.760> one<00:04:16.000> is<00:04:16.180> influencing<00:04:16.780> the

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
these up switch one is influencing the

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.590 
these up switch one is influencing the
code<00:04:17.109> whereas<00:04:17.830> switch<00:04:18.400> five<00:04:18.669> will<00:04:19.359> not

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
code whereas switch five will not

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.300

influence<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.200> cooked<00:04:20.470> oh<00:04:20.709> if<00:04:20.859> you<00:04:20.979> come<00:04:21.160> any

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
influence the cooked oh if you come any

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.620 
influence the cooked oh if you come any
closer<00:04:21.489> chicken<00:04:21.850> Oh

oh<00:04:22.690> I<00:04:23.140> warned<00:04:23.620> you<00:04:24.720> so<00:04:25.720> now<00:04:26.080> pulling<00:04:26.590> down

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
oh I warned you so now pulling down

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.240 
oh I warned you so now pulling down
switch<00:04:27.040> one<00:04:27.310> switch<00:04:28.300> to<00:04:28.630> and<00:04:28.990> switch<00:04:29.680> for<00:04:29.980> the

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
switch one switch to and switch for the

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.210 
switch one switch to and switch for the
door<00:04:31.150> opens<00:04:31.570> again<00:04:32.080> any<00:04:32.350> other<00:04:32.920> combination

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
door opens again any other combination

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.510 
door opens again any other combination
of<00:04:33.880> these<00:04:34.420> switches<00:04:34.750> will<00:04:35.530> result<00:04:35.980> in<00:04:36.160> a<00:04:36.250> false

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
of these switches will result in a false

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.300 
of these switches will result in a false
code<00:04:37.440> therefore<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:39.760> door<00:04:39.940> will<00:04:40.120> not<00:04:40.150> open<00:04:41.310> so

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
code therefore the door will not open so

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.980 
code therefore the door will not open so
now<00:04:42.550> I'm<00:04:42.910> going<00:04:43.120> to<00:04:43.300> have<00:04:43.450> to<00:04:43.480> show<00:04:43.750> you<00:04:43.810> I

I'm<00:04:52.300> talking<00:04:52.600> about<00:04:52.660> anymore<00:04:53.700> how<00:04:54.700> to<00:04:54.760> open<00:04:55.570> it

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
I'm talking about anymore how to open it

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.600 
I'm talking about anymore how to open it
up<00:04:56.190> from<00:04:57.190> this<00:04:57.790> side<00:04:58.030> when<00:04:58.240> you're<00:04:58.390> inside<00:04:58.870> and

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
up from this side when you're inside and

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.300 
up from this side when you're inside and
I'm<00:05:00.610> going<00:05:00.910> to<00:05:00.940> add<00:05:01.120> on<00:05:01.330> another<00:05:02.160> excuse<00:05:03.160> me

a<00:05:06.490> pressure<00:05:07.360> plate<00:05:07.540> to<00:05:08.020> increase<00:05:08.740> the

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
a pressure plate to increase the

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.840 
a pressure plate to increase the
difficulty<00:05:10.300> I<00:05:10.450> guess<00:05:10.720> of<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:10.990> code<00:05:11.730> so<00:05:12.730> what

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
difficulty I guess of the code so what

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.100 
difficulty I guess of the code so what
we're<00:05:12.940> going<00:05:13.030> to<00:05:13.120> want<00:05:13.210> to<00:05:13.300> do<00:05:13.420> is<00:05:13.600> get<00:05:13.900> rid<00:05:13.960> of

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
we're going to want to do is get rid of

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.900 
we're going to want to do is get rid of
that<00:05:15.030> that<00:05:16.830> then<00:05:17.830> we're<00:05:18.040> going<00:05:18.130> to<00:05:18.190> add<00:05:18.280> three

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
that that then we're going to add three

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.600 
that that then we're going to add three
blocks<00:05:19.180> right<00:05:19.540> here<00:05:19.930> and<00:05:20.320> what<00:05:21.220> these<00:05:21.340> blocks

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
blocks right here and what these blocks

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.000 
blocks right here and what these blocks
are<00:05:21.730> going<00:05:21.880> to<00:05:21.970> look<00:05:22.030> like<00:05:22.090> is<00:05:24.000> that<00:05:25.000> and

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
are going to look like is that and

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.480 
are going to look like is that and
that's<00:05:27.010> going<00:05:27.250> to<00:05:27.310> go<00:05:27.430> there<00:05:27.610> and<00:05:29.370> we're<00:05:30.370> going

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
that's going to go there and we're going

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.160 
that's going to go there and we're going
to<00:05:30.550> get<00:05:30.610> rid<00:05:30.760> of<00:05:30.790> that<00:05:31.000> and<00:05:31.780> we're<00:05:32.020> going<00:05:32.140> to

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
to get rid of that and we're going to

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.310 
to get rid of that and we're going to
turn<00:05:32.410> that<00:05:32.680> that<00:05:33.370> way<00:05:33.580> and<00:05:34.420> we're<00:05:35.170> going<00:05:35.290> to

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
turn that that way and we're going to

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.470 
turn that that way and we're going to
bring<00:05:35.500> that<00:05:35.860> one<00:05:36.100> out<00:05:36.250> here<00:05:36.550> now<00:05:36.580> you<00:05:37.270> don't

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
bring that one out here now you don't

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.850 
bring that one out here now you don't
want<00:05:37.630> to<00:05:37.690> put<00:05:37.840> your<00:05:37.990> pressure<00:05:38.230> plate<00:05:38.500> here<00:05:38.710> you

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
want to put your pressure plate here you

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.960 
want to put your pressure plate here you
want<00:05:39.010> to<00:05:39.070> put<00:05:39.190> your<00:05:39.280> pressure<00:05:39.520> plate<00:05:39.820> at<00:05:39.940> least

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
want to put your pressure plate at least

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.550 
want to put your pressure plate at least
here<00:05:40.390> i'm<00:05:40.660> going<00:05:40.870> to<00:05:40.930> put<00:05:41.050> it<00:05:41.140> here<00:05:41.410> because

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
here i'm going to put it here because

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.240 
here i'm going to put it here because
why<00:05:41.860> not<00:05:43.560> yeah<00:05:44.560> so<00:05:44.710> you<00:05:44.800> want<00:05:44.950> it<00:05:44.980> to<00:05:45.100> look<00:05:45.190> like

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
why not yeah so you want it to look like

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:51.950 
why not yeah so you want it to look like
that<00:05:47.130> and<00:05:48.990> then<00:05:49.990> you<00:05:50.500> want<00:05:50.740> to<00:05:50.890> drag<00:05:51.220> this<00:05:51.670> out

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
that and then you want to drag this out

00:05:51.960 --> 00:06:01.170 
that and then you want to drag this out
to<00:05:52.960> here<00:05:54.240> and<00:05:55.240> now<00:05:58.140> does<00:05:59.140> that<00:05:59.320> work<00:06:00.030> yes<00:06:01.030> it

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
to here and now does that work yes it

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.240 
to here and now does that work yes it
does<00:06:01.330> okay<00:06:01.690> so<00:06:02.200> now<00:06:02.380> we're<00:06:02.530> going<00:06:02.620> to<00:06:02.680> plug<00:06:03.010> in

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
does okay so now we're going to plug in

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.360 
does okay so now we're going to plug in
the<00:06:03.490> code<00:06:03.850> again<00:06:03.970> which<00:06:04.420> is<00:06:05.310> 12<00:06:06.310> for<00:06:08.370> that

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
the code again which is 12 for that

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.190 
the code again which is 12 for that
torch<00:06:10.030> is<00:06:10.390> now<00:06:11.050> inverting<00:06:11.590> that<00:06:12.450> and<00:06:13.450> now<00:06:14.140> we

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
torch is now inverting that and now we

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.140 
torch is now inverting that and now we
hit<00:06:14.440> this<00:06:15.630> door<00:06:16.630> opens<00:06:17.250> there<00:06:18.250> you<00:06:18.280> go<00:06:18.520> now
