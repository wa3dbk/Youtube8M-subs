hopefully<00:01:25.900> they<00:01:26.020> can't<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:29.409> can<00:01:29.560> track

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
hopefully they can't we can track

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.200 
hopefully they can't we can track
hopefully<00:01:30.009> we<00:01:30.280> can<00:01:30.430> try<00:01:30.580> and<00:01:30.670> confuse<00:01:30.970> them<00:01:31.150> a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
hopefully we can try and confuse them a

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:40.100 
hopefully we can try and confuse them a
little<00:01:31.390> bit<00:01:33.119> oh<00:01:35.159> shit

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.389 

that<00:01:41.110> looks<00:01:41.470> lice<00:01:41.649> is<00:01:41.799> a<00:01:41.830> bad<00:01:42.009> idea<00:01:42.039> they

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
that looks lice is a bad idea they

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:43.590 
that looks lice is a bad idea they
climbing<00:01:42.700> through<00:01:42.789> the<00:01:42.909> windows<00:01:43.299> and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
climbing through the windows and

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.899 
climbing through the windows and
everything<00:01:47.039> that's<00:01:48.039> good<00:01:48.280> job<00:01:48.430> I<00:01:48.549> can<00:01:48.729> jump

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
everything that's good job I can jump

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.609 
everything that's good job I can jump
out<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.210> windows

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.740 

so<00:01:54.250> we<00:01:54.399> can<00:01:54.520> also<00:01:54.640> use<00:01:54.789> this<00:01:55.119> barricade<00:01:55.570> in

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
so we can also use this barricade in

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.289 
so we can also use this barricade in
system<00:01:56.200> on<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:57.159> houses<00:01:57.609> we've<00:01:57.939> crossed<00:01:58.149> the

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
system on the houses we've crossed the

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.179 
system on the houses we've crossed the
road<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.880> we<00:02:01.090> can<00:02:01.270> rotate<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.750> wood<00:02:02.039> same<00:02:03.039> as

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
road and we can rotate the wood same as

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.240 
road and we can rotate the wood same as
over<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.490> road<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:05.140> seal<00:02:05.380> up<00:02:05.500> windows<00:02:05.829> so

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
over the road and seal up windows so

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.469 
over the road and seal up windows so
when<00:02:06.609> we<00:02:06.729> can<00:02:06.880> do<00:02:07.000> this<00:02:07.030> in<00:02:07.390> dayz<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:10.330> going

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
when we can do this in dayz it's going

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.979 
when we can do this in dayz it's going
to<00:02:10.539> be<00:02:10.660> another<00:02:11.170> interesting<00:02:11.980> aspect<00:02:12.400> of<00:02:12.989> the
