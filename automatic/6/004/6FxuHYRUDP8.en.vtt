00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.830
 hello youtube friends in this video 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:08.109
 let's learn how to do the hard reset 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.430
 of a zte blade l 2 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:14.140
 watch the model 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.790
 zte blade l 2 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.800
 this internal battery equipment what 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.330
 first thing we have to do will be 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.450
 we ensure that the battery has at least 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.930
 50 percent of the load then 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.930
 let's pay 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.510
 and now let's press the key 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.309
 more volume and the power button 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.149
 a few seconds until I turn on and 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.149
 let's go power 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.020
 we turn out we could press volume 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.100
 more until this logo appears 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.510
 android 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.810
 once the android logo appears 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.310
 let's press power 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.830
 so that the menu of 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.450
 recovery here we're going to come down with 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.240
 volume less up to where uy says 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.449
 datafactory reset and select with 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.980
 volume more we go down with less volume 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.010
 as far as it says yes 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.030
 and we select with more volume 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.640
 we wait for the process to be done 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.670
 and now we go down to where uy says 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.060
 cache partition with less volume 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.619
 we work with more volume 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.600
 We do this so that you have a better 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.640
 cleaning the equipment finally 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.220
 we restart in the first option that 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.899
 we see shaded that says reboot system 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.899
 we select with more volume 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.030
 now we will simply wait for 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.370
 our cell phone is reset and at 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.170
 finish we will have the cell phone 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.620
 completely restored to its mode of 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.620
 factory 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.940
 in this part we must be patient 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:27.100
 usually delays between 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.100
 a minute or two minutes or 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.700
 very well we are going to finish 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.130
 here the team as you can see no longer 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.970
 is seeing the initial configuration what 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.970
 I call our language of preference 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.810
 we configure it later 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.210
 and ready friends as you come we have finished 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.100

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.120
 video has served them
