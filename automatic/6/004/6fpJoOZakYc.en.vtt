 It is just around the a is here Nee 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.530
 But it also went up more now 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:22.180
 I write the direction of the one-man train exit as a direction 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:26.620
 It I also yeah this is the configuration that I am here. 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:30.510
 What little I station name is on the other side around Nemuro Main Line 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:33.300
 It's about coming from Art Lang, there are stores over the land 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.170
 There is nothing 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.170
 Here 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.680
 It takes a little time but I lost time but 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.340
 It is Nemuro main line 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:53.390
 There is a certain amount of Eki and there is something Tokachi Shimizu 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:01:01.190
 It's 3 days It's Tokachi Shimizu me 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:02.330
 I think that Tokachi and Super Tokachi of the limited express was a stop station Next to the station where the limited express stops 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.670
 Hey this yonha 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.250
 It is also good that there is a secret station 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.410
 I did 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:14.049
 There is nothing around 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:18.189
 It is some feeling Te especially Land, Arin' that only protect and bearded 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:21.939
 In there reporter I think there is a Haobi 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:26.920
 Can do in essence was as usual but there is a station building 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:30.250
 There is a mistake like this, but it is good here and here 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.420
 I went to a room with a super warm but something 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:38.250
 There are both companies and it is surprisingly close to 350 for new songs 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.880
 Togachi water 210 yen 3 days ah 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.430
 To Obihiro 530 yen 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.530
 You should be looking at pretty squishy teeth timetable 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.800
 Band c Road surface 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:59.190
 With 623 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:03.060
 One Takikawa Station and Kamitoku Snow 123 in the Kamitoku area 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.170
 It's just 4 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.220
 So it is 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:13.260
 It does not stop It is a passing train oc feeling 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.680
 There is nothing golden break after the net is this 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.660
 Without especially anything etc. 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.470
 I say this only 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.820
