measured it the other day and to the

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.640 
measured it the other day and to the
millimetre<00:02:04.030> is<00:02:04.360> exactly<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:05.020> same<00:02:05.229> width<00:02:05.470> as

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
millimetre is exactly the same width as

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.089 
millimetre is exactly the same width as
