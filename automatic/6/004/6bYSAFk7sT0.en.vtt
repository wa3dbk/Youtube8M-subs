unfortunately<00:00:18.050> I<00:00:18.079> broke<00:00:18.470> the<00:00:18.970> ice<00:00:19.970> are<00:00:20.150> you

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
unfortunately I broke the ice are you

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.429 
unfortunately I broke the ice are you
asking<00:00:20.689> for<00:00:20.800> but<00:00:21.800> you<00:00:22.159> broke<00:00:22.519> the<00:00:22.579> charger<00:00:22.880> so

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
asking for but you broke the charger so

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.599

last<00:00:24.439> year<00:00:24.529> they<00:00:24.800> show<00:00:24.980> just<00:00:25.310> a<00:00:25.429> mock-up

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609

there's<00:00:28.009> we<00:00:28.310> have<00:00:28.429> youtube<00:00:28.789> video<00:00:29.089> of<00:00:29.269> this<00:00:29.419> I

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
there's we have youtube video of this I

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.170 
there's we have youtube video of this I
broke<00:00:30.859> it<00:00:30.919> the<00:00:31.130> first<00:00:31.310> day<00:00:31.399> of<00:00:31.519> the<00:00:31.609> shows<00:00:31.880> and

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
broke it the first day of the shows and

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.229 
broke it the first day of the shows and
then<00:00:32.329> down<00:00:32.719> here<00:00:32.750> for<00:00:33.230> that<00:00:33.350> video<00:00:33.500> yes<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.969> we

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
then down here for that video yes and we

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.779 
then down here for that video yes and we
basically<00:00:35.750> designed<00:00:36.260> to<00:00:37.010> different<00:00:37.430> products

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:37.789 
basically designed to different products

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:39.220 
basically designed to different products
here<00:00:37.940> that<00:00:38.120> are<00:00:38.239> single<00:00:38.480> board<00:00:38.809> computers

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230

it's<00:00:46.429> an<00:00:46.579> expansion<00:00:47.089> of<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.300> quick<00:00:47.480> starboard

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
it's an expansion of the quick starboard

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.099 
it's an expansion of the quick starboard
so<00:00:48.589> we've<00:00:48.800> exposed<00:00:49.309> many<00:00:50.300> interfaces<00:00:50.660> for

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
so we've exposed many interfaces for

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.329 
so we've exposed many interfaces for
interfaces<00:00:51.829> such<00:00:52.519> as<00:00:52.579> camera<00:00:53.179> lvds

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
interfaces such as camera lvds

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.500 
interfaces such as camera lvds
touchscreen<00:00:56.170> we've<00:00:57.170> added<00:00:57.379> SATA<00:00:57.829> an<00:00:58.519> hdmi<00:00:59.239> all

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
touchscreen we've added SATA an hdmi all

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.150 
touchscreen we've added SATA an hdmi all

we<00:01:03.760> have<00:01:03.880> this<00:01:04.059> available<00:01:04.210> right<00:01:04.989> now<00:01:05.050> it's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
we have this available right now it's

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.800 
we have this available right now it's
running<00:01:05.740> inside<00:01:06.100> this<00:01:06.340> box<00:01:06.700> it's<00:01:07.390> like<00:01:07.660> a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
power is coming from the cat5 cable and

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.969 
power is coming from the cat5 cable and
we<00:01:13.570> have<00:01:13.720> it<00:01:13.810> hooked<00:01:13.900> up<00:01:14.050> to<00:01:14.140> this<00:01:14.320> 14<00:01:14.800> inch

off<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:25.680> touch<00:01:26.680> screen<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.720> you<00:01:28.750> can<00:01:28.960> see<00:01:29.259> it's

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
off the touch screen so you can see it's

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.890 
off the touch screen so you can see it's

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
been released to developers so that's

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.170 
been released to developers so that's
coming<00:02:27.319> soon<00:02:27.560> what<00:02:28.280> is<00:02:28.370> this<00:02:28.489> poem<00:02:28.760> Parker<00:02:29.030> so

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
coming soon what is this poem Parker so

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.959 
coming soon what is this poem Parker so
this<00:02:29.359> is<00:02:29.540> basically<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.230> 51<00:02:30.829> that<00:02:31.760> was

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:31.969 
this is basically the 51 that was

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:34.929 
this is basically the 51 that was
designed<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:33.109> fit<00:02:33.379> directly<00:02:33.680> behind<00:02:34.129> a<00:02:34.370> 6.2
