awesome so this is one of the greatest

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.270 
awesome so this is one of the greatest
thing<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:45.030> head<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.270> very<00:00:45.660> smooth<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:47.070> flu

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
thing the head is very smooth the flu

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.310 
thing the head is very smooth the flu
ahead<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.789> then<00:00:48.480> one<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.780> biggest<00:00:48.989> thing

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
ahead and then one of the biggest thing

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.760 
ahead and then one of the biggest thing
is<00:00:49.469> probably<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.280> legs<00:00:51.230> that<00:00:52.230> helps<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.590> lot

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
is probably this legs that helps a lot

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.490 
is probably this legs that helps a lot
so<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.610> think<00:00:54.120> couple<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.600> people<00:00:55.110> mentioned

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
so I think couple of people mentioned

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.049 
so I think couple of people mentioned
and<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.680> probably<00:00:55.949> notice<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.579> use<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> lot

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
and you probably notice if you use a lot

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.319 
and you probably notice if you use a lot
that<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.660> tend<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.199> pop<00:00:58.590> some<00:00:59.039> time<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.030> one

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
that it's a tend to pop some time so one

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.990 
that it's a tend to pop some time so one
thing<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.629> did<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:02.340> know<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.640> one<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
thing I did and I know that one of the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.119 
thing I did and I know that one of the
strongest<00:01:03.390> point<00:01:03.690> about<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.110> leg<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.680> that

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
strongest point about this leg is that

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.010 
strongest point about this leg is that
you<00:01:05.280> if<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.610> balance<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.270> well<00:01:06.540> with<00:01:06.869> your

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
you if you balance it well with your

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.960 
you if you balance it well with your
camera<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.070> actually<00:01:08.250> leave<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.790> there

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
camera you can actually leave it there

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.149 
camera you can actually leave it there
and<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.240> will<00:01:09.360> stand<00:01:09.630> alone<00:01:09.750> which<00:01:10.200> how<00:01:10.530> person

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
and it will stand alone which how person

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.469 
and it will stand alone which how person
will<00:01:11.280> never<00:01:11.460> do<00:01:12.530> but<00:01:13.640> when<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:15.030> some

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
will never do but when you do some

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.170 
will never do but when you do some
movement<00:01:15.930> with<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.200> monopod<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.880> bowl

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
movement with this monopod if the bowl

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.590 
movement with this monopod if the bowl
is<00:01:18.509> really<00:01:18.840> tight<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.680> bottom<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> leg

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
is really tight on the bottom of the leg

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.539 
is really tight on the bottom of the leg
you'll<00:01:21.600> feel<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:21.990> little<00:01:22.530> pop<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.220> hard<00:01:23.430> to

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
you'll feel that little pop it's hard to

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.980 
you'll feel that little pop it's hard to
describe<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.270> will<00:01:24.360> feel<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.720> little

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
describe but you will feel that little

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.260 
describe but you will feel that little
pop<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:26.070> thing<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.310> did<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.759> actually

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
pop so one thing I did is actually

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.480 
pop so one thing I did is actually
loosen<00:01:27.630> up<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.560> lag<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> little<00:01:29.189> bit<00:01:29.310> so

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
loosen up the the lag a little bit so

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.560 
loosen up the the lag a little bit so
it's<00:01:29.640> not<00:01:29.790> as<00:01:30.119> tight<00:01:31.110> as<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.500> came<00:01:32.490> out<00:01:32.700> with<00:01:32.939> so

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
it's not as tight as it came out with so

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.560 
it's not as tight as it came out with so
when<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.810> lose<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.890> also<00:01:35.520> won't<00:01:35.880> lose<00:01:36.360> that

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
when I lose this I also won't lose that

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.490 
when I lose this I also won't lose that
pop<00:01:36.990> when<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.009> move<00:01:38.400> your<00:01:38.850> monopod<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
pop when you move your monopod in the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.770 
pop when you move your monopod in the
wider<00:01:40.740> range<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.729> that's<00:01:41.970> why<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.150> little<00:01:42.600> bit

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
wider range so that's why a little bit

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.649 
wider range so that's why a little bit
my<00:01:42.990> little<00:01:43.200> tip<00:01:43.470> was<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.770> unscrew<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.430> a

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
my little tip was to unscrew this a

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.090 
my little tip was to unscrew this a
little<00:01:45.659> bolt<00:01:45.990> here<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.829> will<00:01:46.950> become

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
little bolt here and you will become

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.160 
little bolt here and you will become
more<00:01:47.549> loose<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.090> wasn't<00:01:48.329> loosen<00:01:48.720> up<00:01:48.840> too<00:01:49.020> much

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
more loose I wasn't loosen up too much

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.859 
more loose I wasn't loosen up too much
because<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.950> might<00:01:50.159> come<00:01:50.430> off<00:01:50.460> am<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.689> might

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
because it might come off am I you might

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.160 
because it might come off am I you might
you<00:01:52.049> lose<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.850> nut<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.299> bolt<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:55.140> I

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
you lose the the nut and bolt so I

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.620 
you lose the the nut and bolt so I
wouldn't<00:01:55.590> lose<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.890> too<00:01:56.100> much<00:01:56.250> but<00:01:56.880> just<00:01:57.270> like

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
wouldn't lose it too much but just like

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.709 
wouldn't lose it too much but just like
a<00:01:57.960> half<00:01:58.350> circle<00:01:58.380> or<00:01:59.100> half<00:01:59.340> round<00:01:59.640> or<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.479> it's

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
a half circle or half round or so it's

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.830 
a half circle or half round or so it's
just<00:02:01.170> enough<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.579> doesn't<00:02:02.850> stick<00:02:03.210> I

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
just enough so that it doesn't stick I

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.200 
just enough so that it doesn't stick I
think<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.500> gets<00:02:04.649> stuck<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.219> little<00:02:05.670> bit<00:02:05.850> the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
think it gets stuck a little bit the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.180 
think it gets stuck a little bit the
ball<00:02:06.450> gets<00:02:06.750> stuck<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.380> leg<00:02:07.590> get<00:02:07.860> little

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
ball gets stuck in the leg get little

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.160 
ball gets stuck in the leg get little
stiff<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:09.119> I'll<00:02:09.209> lose<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.720> that's<00:02:09.959> what<00:02:10.140> I

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
stiff so I'll lose that that's what I

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.730 
stiff so I'll lose that that's what I
did<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:10.739> my<00:02:11.280> solution<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:11.970> another<00:02:12.300> monopod

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
did for my solution so another monopod

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.880 
did for my solution so another monopod
then<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.730> use<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.030> lot<00:02:15.390> it's<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.050> secular<00:02:16.590> zoom

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
then I use a lot it's the secular zoom

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.120 
then I use a lot it's the secular zoom
system<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:18.030> some<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.140> have<00:02:19.230> seen<00:02:19.500> but<00:02:19.890> this

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
system so some of you have seen but this

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.730 
system so some of you have seen but this
zoom<00:02:20.430> system<00:02:20.910> what<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.330> does<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.260> has

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
zoom system what it does is that it has

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.510 
zoom system what it does is that it has
a<00:02:22.770> tripod<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:24.080> then<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.470> can<00:02:25.740> stick<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.220> into

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
a tripod and then I can stick this into

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.880 
a tripod and then I can stick this into
the<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.390> hole<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.900> tripod<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.440> becomes

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
the the hole in the tripod it becomes

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.670 
the the hole in the tripod it becomes
the<00:02:29.190> this<00:02:30.120> monopod<00:02:30.510> becomes<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.140> head<00:02:31.410> and

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
the this monopod becomes the head and

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.580 
the this monopod becomes the head and
the<00:02:32.130> centerpiece<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.600> monopod<00:02:34.110> at<00:02:34.320> this

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
the centerpiece of the monopod at this

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.580 
the centerpiece of the monopod at this
truck<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.130> excuse<00:02:35.490> me<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:37.110> one<00:02:37.320> thing<00:02:37.500> I

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
truck I excuse me so the one thing I

truck I excuse me so the one thing I
really<00:02:38.070> like<00:02:38.250> about<00:02:38.280> all<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.300> secular<00:02:39.660> tripod

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
really like about all the secular tripod

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.950 
really like about all the secular tripod
that<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.290> own<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.890> this<00:02:41.820> zoom<00:02:42.060> system<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.750> the

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
that I own and this zoom system is the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.030 
that I own and this zoom system is the
one-stop<00:02:43.380> system<00:02:43.770> so<00:02:44.670> instead<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:46.040> three

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
one-stop system so instead of three

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.700 
one-stop system so instead of three
stops<00:02:47.370> or<00:02:47.910> two<00:02:48.360> stops<00:02:48.630> like<00:02:48.900> some<00:02:49.170> other<00:02:49.350> men

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
stops or two stops like some other men

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.290 
stops or two stops like some other men
Florida<00:02:50.010> monopod<00:02:50.400> or<00:02:50.460> some<00:02:50.790> other<00:02:50.910> secular

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
Florida monopod or some other secular

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.410 
Florida monopod or some other secular
truck<00:02:51.840> tripod<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:53.310> way<00:02:53.520> just<00:02:53.760> one<00:02:53.820> stop<00:02:54.210> is

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
truck tripod this way just one stop is

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.530 
truck tripod this way just one stop is
always<00:02:54.780> one<00:02:54.990> click<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:56.280> adjust<00:02:56.880> really<00:02:57.300> quick

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
always one click to adjust really quick

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.690 
always one click to adjust really quick
so<00:02:57.900> as<00:02:58.020> my<00:02:58.200> all<00:02:58.410> my<00:02:58.560> tripod<00:02:58.860> is<00:02:59.250> one<00:02:59.460> thing

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
so as my all my tripod is one thing

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.760 
so as my all my tripod is one thing
that's<00:03:00.030> one<00:03:00.750> thing<00:03:00.930> that's<00:03:01.080> really<00:03:01.200> important

for me to have is the one stop so this

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.810 
for me to have is the one stop so this
one's<00:03:05.910> great<00:03:06.120> it's<00:03:06.510> one<00:03:06.750> stop<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.380> love<00:03:08.250> secular

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820

one's great it's one stop I love secular
has<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.210> much<00:03:09.360> that<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:10.380> know<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:11.060> majority

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
has so much that you know the majority

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.080 
has so much that you know the majority
of<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.240> tripod<00:03:12.960> has<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.560> cycler<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.910> it's

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
of the tripod has is the cycler and it's

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.390 
of the tripod has is the cycler and it's
also<00:03:15.300> touch<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.900> go<00:03:16.080> play<00:03:16.410> system<00:03:16.860> then<00:03:17.220> I

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
also touch and go play system then I

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.620 
also touch and go play system then I
like<00:03:17.610> about<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.940> lot<00:03:18.240> and<00:03:18.470> but<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:21.000> one<00:03:21.210> cons

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
like about a lot and but the one cons

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.760 
like about a lot and but the one cons
about<00:03:22.580> this<00:03:23.580> monopod<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:25.050> there's<00:03:25.560> no

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
about this monopod is that there's no

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.970 
about this monopod is that there's no
lag<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:26.970> round<00:03:27.390> we<00:03:28.050> can<00:03:28.290> still<00:03:28.530> have<00:03:28.740> this

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
lag this round we can still have this

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.940 
lag this round we can still have this
little<00:03:29.340> thing<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.990> you<00:03:31.080> see<00:03:31.260> this<00:03:31.410> that

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
little thing and you see this that

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.770 
little thing and you see this that
little<00:03:32.160> thing<00:03:32.370> that<00:03:32.430> comes<00:03:32.790> out<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.150> you<00:03:33.270> put

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
little thing that comes out that you put

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.290 
little thing that comes out that you put
your<00:03:33.990> feet<00:03:34.320> on<00:03:34.350> your<00:03:34.740> foot<00:03:35.430> on<00:03:35.670> there<00:03:35.880> so

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
your feet on your foot on there so

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.090 
your feet on your foot on there so
you'll<00:03:36.480> be<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:37.260> won't<00:03:37.440> move<00:03:37.590> around<00:03:37.800> too<00:03:38.070> much

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
you'll be you won't move around too much

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.420 
you'll be you won't move around too much
but<00:03:38.580> again<00:03:39.210> this<00:03:39.390> is<00:03:39.450> not<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.840> three<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:41.310> know

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
but again this is not a three you know

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.250 
but again this is not a three you know
there's<00:03:41.700> no<00:03:41.880> three<00:03:42.150> leg<00:03:42.390> that<00:03:42.630> hold<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:43.020> little

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
there's no three leg that hold it little

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.100 
there's no three leg that hold it little
tighter<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:43.890> that's<00:03:44.130> only<00:03:44.430> thing<00:03:44.850> and<00:03:45.090> also<00:03:45.780> is

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
tighter so that's only thing and also is

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.540 
tighter so that's only thing and also is
this<00:03:46.560> bulky<00:03:47.130> this<00:03:47.400> is<00:03:47.640> huge<00:03:48.060> right<00:03:49.490> also<00:03:50.490> it

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
this bulky this is huge right also it

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.060 
this bulky this is huge right also it
doesn't<00:03:50.790> go<00:03:51.000> as<00:03:51.120> low<00:03:51.450> as<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:52.140> manfrotto<00:03:52.770> ones

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
doesn't go as low as the manfrotto ones

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.680 
doesn't go as low as the manfrotto ones
so<00:03:53.880> you<00:03:53.940> don't<00:03:54.180> get<00:03:54.300> that<00:03:54.540> lower<00:03:54.780> angle<00:03:56.270> so<00:03:57.270> I

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
so you don't get that lower angle so I

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.830 
so you don't get that lower angle so I
actually<00:03:58.170> personally<00:03:58.890> prefer<00:03:59.460> that<00:04:00.270> monopod

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
actually personally prefer that monopod

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.320 
actually personally prefer that monopod
over<00:04:01.260> this<00:04:01.500> but<00:04:01.950> my<00:04:02.130> second<00:04:02.520> shooter<00:04:02.850> has<00:04:03.030> to

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
over this but my second shooter has to

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.170 
over this but my second shooter has to
use<00:04:03.960> them<00:04:04.170> monopod<00:04:04.650> so<00:04:05.010> I<00:04:05.040> usually<00:04:05.760> stop<00:04:06.000> with

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
use them monopod so I usually stop with

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.840 
use them monopod so I usually stop with
this<00:04:06.360> but<00:04:06.690> I<00:04:06.720> also<00:04:06.960> like<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.320> carry<00:04:07.740> this<00:04:08.550> one

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
this but I also like to carry this one

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.050 
this but I also like to carry this one
in<00:04:09.030> my<00:04:09.060> tripod<00:04:09.510> legged<00:04:10.170> together<00:04:10.860> so<00:04:11.310> that's

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
in my tripod legged together so that's

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.140 
in my tripod legged together so that's
why<00:04:12.180> I<00:04:12.240> use<00:04:12.270> this<00:04:12.660> multiplied<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:14.310> hope<00:04:15.000> that

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
why I use this multiplied and hope that

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.500 
why I use this multiplied and hope that
helps<00:04:15.480> thanks<00:04:15.959> for<00:04:16.140> watching
