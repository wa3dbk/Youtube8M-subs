tutorial<00:00:05.990> this<00:00:06.990> time<00:00:07.290> i<00:00:07.589> am<00:00:07.649> going<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.069> discuss

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
tutorial this time i am going to discuss

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.640 
tutorial this time i am going to discuss
a<00:00:08.970> few<00:00:09.059> different<00:00:09.570> things<00:00:09.809> you<00:00:10.050> can<00:00:10.139> do<00:00:10.320> with

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
a few different things you can do with

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.299 
a few different things you can do with
some<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.280> kong<00:00:11.490> hey<00:00:11.790> hit<00:00:12.179> types<00:00:12.889> and<00:00:13.889> how

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
some of the kong hey hit types and how

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.400 
some of the kong hey hit types and how
the<00:00:14.370> hit<00:00:14.580> types<00:00:14.790> work<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.780> little<00:00:16.080> bit<00:00:16.230> more

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
the hit types work a little bit more

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.460 
the hit types work a little bit more
I've<00:00:17.400> already<00:00:17.609> discussed<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.690> Nano<00:00:18.990> sampler

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
I've already discussed the Nano sampler

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.910 
I've already discussed the Nano sampler
and<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.619> nurse<00:00:19.770> Rex<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:21.500> moving<00:00:22.500> on<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
and the nurse Rex so moving on to the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.040 
and the nurse Rex so moving on to the
physical<00:00:23.460> bass<00:00:23.670> drum<00:00:24.060> you'll<00:00:24.720> notice<00:00:24.930> that

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
physical bass drum you'll notice that

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.230 
physical bass drum you'll notice that
there's<00:00:25.170> no<00:00:25.500> actual<00:00:25.949> dif<00:00:26.369> different<00:00:27.119> hit

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
there's no actual dif different hit

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.910 
there's no actual dif different hit
types<00:00:27.449> for<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.320> don't<00:00:28.740> have<00:00:28.830> any

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
types for it so you don't have any

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.290 
types for it so you don't have any
variation<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.789> can't<00:00:29.970> really<00:00:30.000> do<00:00:30.269> much

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
variation so you can't really do much

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.770 
variation so you can't really do much
with<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:31.969> physical<00:00:32.969> snare<00:00:33.210> drum<00:00:33.450> however

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
with that physical snare drum however

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.870 
with that physical snare drum however
different<00:00:34.469> story<00:00:34.710> you've<00:00:35.309> got<00:00:35.520> four

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
different story you've got four

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.880 
different story you've got four
different<00:00:36.180> positions<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.899> they<00:00:37.739> go

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
different positions and they go

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.639 
different positions and they go
progressively<00:00:38.700> from<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.480> center<00:00:39.840> outward<00:00:40.410> if

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
progressively from the center outward if

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.560 
progressively from the center outward if
you<00:00:40.739> want<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.950> look<00:00:41.010> at<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.399> way<00:00:41.430> or<00:00:41.760> from

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
you want to look at it that way or from

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.350 
you want to look at it that way or from
the<00:00:42.600> edge<00:00:42.809> inward<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.219> center<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.850> Center

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
the edge inward to the center so Center

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.420 
the edge inward to the center so Center
the<00:00:45.750> first<00:00:45.989> position<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.680> if<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.340> were

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the first position is if you were

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.190 
the first position is if you were
hitting<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.820> drum<00:00:48.059> right<00:00:48.750> where<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:48.989> see<00:00:49.170> it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
hitting the drum right where you see it

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.150 
hitting the drum right where you see it
here<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.710> center<00:00:50.629> position<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.289> would<00:00:53.010> be

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
here in the center position to would be

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.920 
here in the center position to would be
if<00:00:53.280> you're<00:00:53.460> hitting<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> drum<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.329> little<00:00:54.809> bit

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
if you're hitting the drum a little bit

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.869 
if you're hitting the drum a little bit
more<00:00:56.270> outward<00:00:57.270> towards<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> edge<00:00:58.879> position

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
more outward towards the edge position

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.549 
more outward towards the edge position
position<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.750> would<00:01:00.960> kind<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.199> call<00:01:01.410> it

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
position to I would kind of call it

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.100 
position to I would kind of call it
somewhere<00:01:02.430> from<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.300> little<00:01:03.570> bit<00:01:03.660> further<00:01:03.840> from

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
somewhere from a little bit further from

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.469 
somewhere from a little bit further from
the<00:01:04.170> center<00:01:04.409> but<00:01:04.799> not<00:01:04.949> quite<00:01:05.400> close<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
the center but not quite close to the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.350 
the center but not quite close to the
edge<00:01:07.040> position<00:01:08.040> 3<00:01:08.310> however<00:01:08.520> would<00:01:08.880> be<00:01:09.000> closer

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
edge position 3 however would be closer

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.030 
edge position 3 however would be closer
to<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.750> edge<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:10.110> not<00:01:10.320> quite<00:01:10.560> all<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> way<00:01:10.890> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
to the edge but not quite all the way to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.280 
to the edge but not quite all the way to
the<00:01:11.220> edge<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.700> then<00:01:12.299> position<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:13.049> would<00:01:13.170> be

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the edge and then position for would be

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.210 
the edge and then position for would be
that<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.979> actual<00:01:14.400> edge<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:16.320> listening

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
that the actual edge so just listening

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.310 
that the actual edge so just listening
to<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.049> drum<00:01:19.590> as<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.990> behind<00:01:21.990> by

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
to this to this drum as it is behind by

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.660 
to this to this drum as it is behind by
its<00:01:22.470> default<00:01:22.799> it's<00:01:23.009> going<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.460> center

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
its default it's going to be the center

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.030 
its default it's going to be the center
position<00:01:24.080> you<00:01:25.080> can<00:01:25.200> hear<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.619> center

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
position you can hear it in the center

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.260 
position you can hear it in the center
change<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> position<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:29.000> go<00:01:30.000> slightly

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
change the position to go slightly

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.140 
change the position to go slightly
outward<00:01:31.700> section<00:01:32.700> 3<00:01:33.000> closer<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> edge

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
outward section 3 closer to the edge

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:43.609 
outward section 3 closer to the edge
position<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.450> definitely<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> edge<00:01:42.619> and

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
position for definitely on the edge and

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.219 
position for definitely on the edge and
also<00:01:44.430> these<00:01:45.060> hit<00:01:45.360> types<00:01:45.600> are<00:01:45.780> going<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.960> depend

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
also these hit types are going to depend

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.710 
also these hit types are going to depend
a<00:01:46.950> little<00:01:47.310> bit<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.000> different<00:01:48.360> parameters

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
a little bit on the different parameters

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.929 
a little bit on the different parameters
that<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.259> set<00:01:49.530> inside<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.399> actual<00:01:50.520> snare

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
that you set inside the actual snare

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.530 
that you set inside the actual snare
drum<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:52.079> what<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.979> can<00:01:53.220> do<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.270> some

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
drum so what you can do to have some

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.370 
drum so what you can do to have some
variation<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.610> if<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.880> wanted<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.479> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
variation on this if you wanted to the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.109 
variation on this if you wanted to the
easy<00:01:58.590> thing<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.009> do<00:01:59.130> would<00:01:59.250> be<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.430> have<00:01:59.820> this

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
easy thing to do would be to have this

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.679 
easy thing to do would be to have this
pad<00:02:00.420> be<00:02:00.719> on<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:02.250> center<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.759> then<00:02:02.820> have<00:02:03.450> pad

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
pad be on the center and then have pad

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.069 
pad be on the center and then have pad
to<00:02:04.020> also<00:02:04.590> linked<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> same<00:02:05.219> snare<00:02:05.549> drum

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
to also linked to the same snare drum

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.410 
to also linked to the same snare drum
okay<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.500> by<00:02:07.860> assigning<00:02:08.459> both<00:02:09.000> drums

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
okay you do that by assigning both drums

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.020 
okay you do that by assigning both drums
to<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.810> same<00:02:10.140> snare<00:02:10.500> drum<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.950> then<00:02:11.670> having

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
to the same snare drum and then having

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.490 
to the same snare drum and then having
the<00:02:12.209> second<00:02:12.629> drum<00:02:12.840> which<00:02:13.170> is

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the second drum which is

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.420 
the second drum which is
lined<00:02:13.740> in<00:02:13.890> blue<00:02:14.100> here<00:02:14.780> work<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.080> edge<00:02:16.430> so

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
lined in blue here work on the edge so

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.600 
lined in blue here work on the edge so
then<00:02:17.700> what<00:02:18.240> happens<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:18.810> drum<00:02:19.770> 1<00:02:20.010> will<00:02:20.460> be

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
then what happens is drum 1 will be

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.850 
then what happens is drum 1 will be
playing<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.090> center<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:24.600> then<00:02:24.660> drum<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.290> pad

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
playing the center and then drum to pad

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.640 
playing the center and then drum to pad
2<00:02:26.160> will<00:02:26.430> be<00:02:26.520> playing<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.970> edge<00:02:27.270> so<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.470> do

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
2 will be playing the edge so you can do

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.530 
2 will be playing the edge so you can do
a<00:02:28.680> pattern<00:02:29.310> where<00:02:29.460> it<00:02:29.610> goes<00:02:29.760> three<00:02:30.240> drum

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
a pattern where it goes three drum

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.130 
a pattern where it goes three drum
strikes<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.290> one<00:02:31.620> edge<00:02:32.480> just<00:02:33.480> bury<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.900> up<00:02:34.020> a

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
strikes and one edge just bury it up a

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.080 
strikes and one edge just bury it up a
little<00:02:34.290> bit<00:02:34.530> by<00:02:34.770> hitting<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.130> edge<00:02:38.090> so

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
little bit by hitting that edge so

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.520 
little bit by hitting that edge so
that's<00:02:39.330> one<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.780> things<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:40.020> can<00:02:40.230> do<00:02:40.350> with

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
that's one of the things you can do with

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.520 
that's one of the things you can do with
this<00:02:40.709> this<00:02:40.980> type<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.250> drum<00:02:41.520> set<00:02:41.760> up<00:02:42.200> now<00:02:43.200> let's

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
this this type of drum set up now let's

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.710 
this this type of drum set up now let's
go<00:02:43.680> back<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.130> let's<00:02:44.280> initialize<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.510> patch

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
go back and let's initialize the patch

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.550 
go back and let's initialize the patch
once<00:02:46.020> again<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.940> now<00:02:48.870> we'll<00:02:49.170> move<00:02:49.320> on<00:02:49.530> from

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
once again and now we'll move on from

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.410 
once again and now we'll move on from
the<00:02:49.920> snare<00:02:50.130> drum<00:02:50.400> into<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:52.880> physical<00:02:53.880> tom

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
the snare drum into the physical tom

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.240 
the snare drum into the physical tom
drum<00:02:54.810> which<00:02:55.020> also<00:02:55.290> doesn't<00:02:55.709> have<00:02:55.890> any<00:02:56.010> head

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
drum which also doesn't have any head

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.850 
drum which also doesn't have any head
types<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:57.630> we'll<00:02:57.870> keep<00:02:58.050> going<00:02:58.470> go<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.770> the

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
types so we'll keep going go to the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.530 
types so we'll keep going go to the
synth<00:02:59.070> bass<00:02:59.250> drum<00:02:59.550> which<00:02:59.700> also<00:02:59.940> doesn't<00:03:00.360> have

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
synth bass drum which also doesn't have

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.560 
synth bass drum which also doesn't have
any<00:03:00.630> different<00:03:01.170> hit<00:03:01.440> types<00:03:02.180> now<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.239> synth

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
any different hit types now the synth

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.010 
any different hit types now the synth
hi-hat<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.380> i<00:03:04.739> believe<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:06.030> snare<00:03:06.390> doesn't

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
hi-hat and i believe the snare doesn't

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.320 
hi-hat and i believe the snare doesn't
have<00:03:07.110> any<00:03:07.230> variations<00:03:07.830> in<00:03:08.310> sent<00:03:08.790> Tom<00:03:09.030> there's

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
have any variations in sent Tom there's

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.479 
have any variations in sent Tom there's
no<00:03:09.450> variations<00:03:09.959> as<00:03:10.110> well<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.070> last<00:03:11.220> one

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
no variations as well so the last one

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.250 
no variations as well so the last one
really<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.880> discuss<00:03:12.209> is<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.480> high<00:03:12.720> hat<00:03:12.989> and

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
really to discuss is the high hat and

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.380 
really to discuss is the high hat and
the<00:03:13.770> high<00:03:13.920> hat<00:03:14.160> is<00:03:14.400> an<00:03:14.850> interesting<00:03:15.120> one

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
the high hat is an interesting one

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.740 
the high hat is an interesting one
because<00:03:15.450> you've<00:03:16.020> got<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:17.000> situation<00:03:18.000> we're<00:03:18.480> in

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750

the fully closed position actually what
I'll<00:03:56.820> do<00:03:56.940> is<00:03:57.030> I'll<00:03:57.120> switch<00:03:57.360> this<00:03:57.510> up<00:03:57.660> I'll<00:03:57.840> have

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
I'll do is I'll switch this up I'll have

this be the closed and this will be the
semi<00:03:59.760> closed<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.980> other<00:04:02.250> thing<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:02.670> I<00:04:02.790> would

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
semi closed the other thing that I would

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.520 
semi closed the other thing that I would
do<00:04:03.209> in<00:04:03.420> this<00:04:03.450> situation<00:04:05.750> well<00:04:06.750> I'll<00:04:07.230> get<00:04:07.440> to

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
do in this situation well I'll get to

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.740 
do in this situation well I'll get to
that<00:04:07.590> in<00:04:07.680> a<00:04:07.799> second<00:04:08.130> but<00:04:08.610> this<00:04:08.910> is<00:04:09.090> one<00:04:09.269> one<00:04:09.600> way

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
that in a second but this is one one way

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.180 
that in a second but this is one one way
you<00:04:09.810> can<00:04:10.019> do<00:04:10.170> it<00:04:10.200> so<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.530> when<00:04:10.890> you're

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
you can do it so that when you're

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.670 
you can do it so that when you're
playing<00:04:11.820> them<00:04:12.120> you've<00:04:12.870> got<00:04:13.049> a<00:04:13.079> variation

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
playing them you've got a variation

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.220 
playing them you've got a variation
between<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:14.820> open<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.420> a<00:04:15.600> semi-open

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
between the open and a semi-open

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.710 
between the open and a semi-open
and<00:04:17.950> you've<00:04:18.370> got<00:04:18.460> a<00:04:18.520> variation<00:04:19.180> between<00:04:19.240> the

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
and you've got a variation between the

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.850 
and you've got a variation between the
fully<00:04:19.930> closed<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.710> the<00:04:20.860> semi<00:04:21.130> closed<00:04:22.860> okay

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
fully closed and the semi closed okay

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.740 
fully closed and the semi closed okay
now<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.460> other<00:04:24.670> thing<00:04:24.760> that<00:04:25.000> is<00:04:25.420> interesting

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
now the other thing that is interesting

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:35.550 
now the other thing that is interesting
if<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:26.740> play<00:04:27.100> this<00:04:29.310> if<00:04:30.310> you<00:04:30.460> play<00:04:30.730> this<00:04:34.560> okay

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
if you play this if you play this okay

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.600 
if you play this if you play this okay
the<00:04:35.920> other<00:04:36.130> thing<00:04:36.430> you<00:04:36.460> can<00:04:36.580> do<00:04:36.820> just<00:04:37.950> if<00:04:38.950> you

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
the other thing you can do just if you

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.600 
the other thing you can do just if you
remember<00:04:40.090> on<00:04:40.620> let's<00:04:41.620> let's<00:04:42.010> let's<00:04:42.100> change

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
remember on let's let's let's change

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.160 
remember on let's let's let's change
this<00:04:42.760> let's<00:04:43.000> let's<00:04:43.240> initialize<00:04:43.480> it<00:04:43.810> first<00:04:43.990> and

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
this let's let's initialize it first and

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.080 
this let's let's initialize it first and
then<00:04:44.260> I'll<00:04:44.350> kind<00:04:44.770> of<00:04:44.860> walk<00:04:44.920> through<00:04:45.070> this<00:04:45.400> so

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
then I'll kind of walk through this so

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.700 
then I'll kind of walk through this so
if<00:04:46.180> we<00:04:46.270> initialize<00:04:46.660> the<00:04:46.810> patch<00:04:47.020> we<00:04:47.350> go<00:04:47.500> back

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
if we initialize the patch we go back

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.420 
if we initialize the patch we go back
into<00:04:47.980> the<00:04:48.100> high<00:04:48.280> hat<00:04:48.490> setting<00:04:50.070> go<00:04:51.070> to<00:04:51.130> synth

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
into the high hat setting go to synth

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.100 
into the high hat setting go to synth
high<00:04:51.610> hat<00:04:51.850> what<00:04:52.570> i<00:04:52.600> will<00:04:52.720> do<00:04:53.140> is<00:04:53.380> up<00:04:53.650> to<00:04:53.680> decay

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
high hat what i will do is up to decay

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.830 
high hat what i will do is up to decay
play<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.470> open<00:04:56.970> so<00:04:57.970> we've<00:04:58.060> got<00:04:58.180> a<00:04:58.210> long<00:04:58.390> decay

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
play the open so we've got a long decay

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.240 
play the open so we've got a long decay
okay<00:04:59.440> and<00:04:59.530> i'm<00:04:59.620> just<00:04:59.740> going<00:04:59.830> to<00:04:59.950> do<00:05:00.040> this<00:05:00.130> for

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
okay and i'm just going to do this for

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.570 
okay and i'm just going to do this for
emphasis<00:05:00.700> now<00:05:01.420> if<00:05:01.810> i<00:05:02.050> assign<00:05:02.770> the<00:05:03.130> first<00:05:03.370> two

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
emphasis now if i assign the first two

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.570 
emphasis now if i assign the first two
pads<00:05:03.850> to<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:04.300> same<00:05:04.480> high<00:05:04.690> hat<00:05:04.960> and<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:06.190> second

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
pads to the same high hat and the second

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.420 
pads to the same high hat and the second
pad<00:05:06.760> is<00:05:07.030> going<00:05:07.270> to<00:05:07.330> be<00:05:07.420> closed<00:05:08.040> but<00:05:09.040> the<00:05:09.190> first

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
pad is going to be closed but the first

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.460 
pad is going to be closed but the first
one<00:05:09.640> is<00:05:09.670> going<00:05:09.970> to<00:05:10.030> be<00:05:10.120> open<00:05:10.510> what's<00:05:11.290> going<00:05:11.440> to

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
one is going to be open what's going to

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.440 
one is going to be open what's going to
happen<00:05:11.560> is<00:05:11.920> you're<00:05:12.280> going<00:05:12.370> to<00:05:12.430> play<00:05:12.670> this<00:05:12.700> this

happen is you're going to play this this
sound<00:05:18.090> and<00:05:19.950> what<00:05:20.950> what<00:05:21.190> you'll<00:05:21.340> notice<00:05:21.460> is

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
sound and what what you'll notice is

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.160 
sound and what what you'll notice is
it's<00:05:21.880> not<00:05:22.030> exclusive<00:05:22.270> when<00:05:22.750> you<00:05:22.810> play<00:05:22.990> this

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
sound this one plays over top of it if

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.730 
sound this one plays over top of it if
you<00:05:28.180> want<00:05:28.330> to<00:05:28.390> have<00:05:28.510> them<00:05:28.630> exclusive<00:05:29.230> what

and<00:05:31.420> assign<00:05:32.230> a<00:05:32.560> mute<00:05:33.100> group<00:05:33.370> to<00:05:33.940> both<00:05:34.090> of<00:05:34.300> them

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
and assign a mute group to both of them

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.110 
and assign a mute group to both of them
and<00:05:34.660> what<00:05:35.530> this<00:05:35.680> does<00:05:35.740> is<00:05:36.250> as<00:05:36.490> soon<00:05:36.760> as<00:05:36.970> this

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
and what this does is as soon as this

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.810 
and what this does is as soon as this
one<00:05:37.360> plays<00:05:37.690> if<00:05:38.170> you<00:05:38.440> if<00:05:38.680> you<00:05:38.800> play<00:05:39.100> both<00:05:39.430> pads

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
one plays if you if you play both pads

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.820 
one plays if you if you play both pads
on<00:05:40.240> top<00:05:40.840> of<00:05:40.990> each<00:05:41.110> other<00:05:41.230> they're<00:05:41.650> going<00:05:41.770> to

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
on top of each other they're going to

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.120 
on top of each other they're going to
mute<00:05:42.070> each<00:05:42.190> other<00:05:42.430> out<00:05:43.530> so<00:05:44.530> just<00:05:44.800> take<00:05:44.950> a<00:05:44.980> look

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
mute each other out so just take a look

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:52.200 
mute each other out so just take a look
see<00:05:45.490> how<00:05:45.610> that<00:05:45.760> sounds<00:05:50.160> as<00:05:51.160> soon<00:05:51.610> as<00:05:51.700> I<00:05:51.820> press

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
see how that sounds as soon as I press

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.410 
see how that sounds as soon as I press
on<00:05:52.420> pad<00:05:52.690> to<00:05:52.990> it<00:05:53.290> cancels<00:05:53.830> out<00:05:53.980> that<00:05:54.340> open<00:05:54.790> sound

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
on pad to it cancels out that open sound

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:09.630 
on pad to it cancels out that open sound
and<00:05:55.810> it<00:05:55.930> cancels<00:05:56.470> out<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:56.770> decay<00:06:07.320> and<00:06:08.640> that's

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
and it cancels out the decay and that's

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.820 
and it cancels out the decay and that's
how<00:06:09.940> you<00:06:10.000> create<00:06:10.840> mute<00:06:11.290> groups<00:06:11.530> and<00:06:11.710> that's

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
how you create mute groups and that's

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.800 
how you create mute groups and that's
how<00:06:11.950> you<00:06:12.010> use<00:06:12.250> mute<00:06:12.940> groups<00:06:13.240> and<00:06:13.480> this<00:06:13.660> would

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
how you use mute groups and this would

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.210 
how you use mute groups and this would
be<00:06:13.840> this<00:06:14.080> having<00:06:14.530> this<00:06:14.770> would<00:06:14.950> have<00:06:15.100> the<00:06:15.190> same

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
be this having this would have the same

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.070 
be this having this would have the same
effect<00:06:15.430> as<00:06:15.970> if<00:06:16.060> you<00:06:16.840> were<00:06:17.250> as<00:06:18.660> if<00:06:19.660> you're<00:06:19.780> using

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
effect as if you were as if you're using

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.840 
effect as if you were as if you're using
the<00:06:20.350> eight<00:06:20.530> and<00:06:20.800> nine<00:06:20.980> channel<00:06:21.460> on<00:06:21.580> the<00:06:21.670> reed

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850 
the eight and nine channel on the reed

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.770 
the eight and nine channel on the reed
rum<00:06:22.090> exclusively

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
rum exclusively

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.350 
rum exclusively
however<00:06:25.560> I'm<00:06:26.040> not<00:06:26.190> sure<00:06:26.400> if<00:06:26.490> this<00:06:26.610> is<00:06:26.670> doing<00:06:27.240> it

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
however I'm not sure if this is doing it

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.850 
however I'm not sure if this is doing it
exactly<00:06:27.540> correct<00:06:28.290> because<00:06:28.440> I<00:06:28.590> think<00:06:28.650> it's

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
exactly correct because I think it's

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.890 
exactly correct because I think it's
going<00:06:28.980> to<00:06:29.040> mute<00:06:29.370> it<00:06:29.460> no<00:06:29.639> matter<00:06:29.760> what<00:06:29.880> so<00:06:30.420> let's

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
going to mute it no matter what so let's

high hats you hear how even hitting

in this situation what you would have to

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.020 
in this situation what you would have to
do<00:07:22.620> is<00:07:22.800> you<00:07:22.950> would<00:07:23.010> have<00:07:23.190> to<00:07:23.340> do<00:07:23.490> use<00:07:23.700> a<00:07:23.729> mute

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.030 
do is you would have to do use a mute

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.570 
do is you would have to do use a mute
group<00:07:24.210> on<00:07:24.450> both<00:07:24.600> of<00:07:24.630> these<00:07:24.930> or<00:07:25.560> sorry<00:07:26.160> you<00:07:26.460> have

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 
group on both of these or sorry you have

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.770 
group on both of these or sorry you have
to<00:07:26.700> use<00:07:26.880> a<00:07:27.180> mute<00:07:27.419> group<00:07:27.720> not<00:07:28.229> the<00:07:28.500> all<00:07:28.710> group

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:29.780 
to use a mute group not the all group

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.430 
to use a mute group not the all group
like<00:07:30.780> that<00:07:31.140> then<00:07:32.040> go<00:07:32.250> back<00:07:32.370> in<00:07:33.350> then<00:07:34.350> it

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 
like that then go back in then it

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.340 
like that then go back in then it
cancels<00:07:34.830> out<00:07:34.979> each<00:07:35.160> other<00:07:35.720> so<00:07:36.720> this<00:07:36.930> is<00:07:36.960> this

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:37.350 
cancels out each other so this is this

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:38.719 
cancels out each other so this is this
has<00:07:37.500> the<00:07:37.620> same<00:07:37.770> effect<00:07:37.890> as<00:07:38.190> using<00:07:38.580> that

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:38.729 
has the same effect as using that

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:41.210 
has the same effect as using that
exclusive<00:07:39.570> eight<00:07:40.080> and<00:07:40.440> nine<00:07:40.590> channel<00:07:41.010> on<00:07:41.130> the

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:46.350 
the open and closed hi-hat in this case

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.710 
the open and closed hi-hat in this case
in<00:07:46.530> Kong<00:07:46.740> it's<00:07:46.979> much<00:07:47.160> easier<00:07:47.190> to<00:07:47.580> just<00:07:47.880> create

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 
in Kong it's much easier to just create

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.840 
in Kong it's much easier to just create
a<00:07:48.810> mute<00:07:49.080> group<00:07:49.320> for<00:07:49.650> both<00:07:49.680> both<00:07:50.370> your<00:07:50.580> drums

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 
clothes sound and the closed down will

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.730 
clothes sound and the closed down will
mute<00:07:55.710> out<00:07:55.860> the<00:07:56.010> ocean<00:07:56.280> sound<00:07:57.470> just<00:07:58.470> as<00:07:58.650> you
