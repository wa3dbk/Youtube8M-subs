00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.359 
critiques in general is just that they
are<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> bit<00:01:46.079> more<00:01:46.110> hefty<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.680> heavier<00:01:47.009> than<00:01:47.280> a

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
are a bit more hefty and heavier than a

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.679 
are a bit more hefty and heavier than a
traditional<00:01:47.520> pair<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.270> your<00:01:48.450> headphones

traditional pair of in your headphones

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.319 
traditional pair of in your headphones
or<00:01:49.259> earphones<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.280> they<00:01:50.729> add<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> little

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
or earphones and so they add a little

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.789 
or earphones and so they add a little
bit<00:01:51.450> more<00:01:51.479> weight<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.930> your<00:01:52.049> years<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.439> general

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
bit more weight to your years in general

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.139

so<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.250> you're<00:01:53.399> really<00:01:53.579> going<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.729> do<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> lot<00:01:54.119> of

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
so if you're really going to do a lot of

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.330 
so if you're really going to do a lot of
moving<00:01:54.840> around<00:01:55.079> or<00:01:55.500> listening<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.770> music<00:01:55.860> for

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
extended periods of times I would say

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.780 
extended periods of times I would say
that<00:01:58.259> they<00:01:58.320> are<00:01:58.350> not<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.770> best<00:01:59.070> fit<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.670> terms

at one time you can only sync and pair
to<00:04:02.019> one<00:04:02.230> product<00:04:02.620> which<00:04:03.069> is<00:04:03.220> a<00:04:03.250> one<00:04:03.579> con<00:04:03.879> but

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:04.449 
to one product which is a one con but

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.089 
to one product which is a one con but
otherwise<00:04:04.720> again<00:04:05.260> audio<00:04:05.560> quality<00:04:05.709> is<00:04:05.980> pretty

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
otherwise again audio quality is pretty

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:07.680 
otherwise again audio quality is pretty
good<00:04:06.310> it<00:04:06.489> gets<00:04:06.639> relatively<00:04:07.030> loud<00:04:07.299> so<00:04:07.599> if

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
good it gets relatively loud so if

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.000 
good it gets relatively loud so if
you're<00:04:07.780> running<00:04:07.900> around<00:04:08.079> or<00:04:08.349> jogging<00:04:08.560> outdoor

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
you're running around or jogging outdoor

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.439 
you're running around or jogging outdoor
so<00:04:09.190> you<00:04:09.280> definitely<00:04:09.370> hear<00:04:09.849> what's<00:04:10.030> going<00:04:10.090> on

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449 
so you definitely hear what's going on

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.930 
so you definitely hear what's going on
the<00:04:11.139> actual<00:04:11.500> assault<00:04:11.980> on<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.280> tips<00:04:12.639> are<00:04:12.790> also

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
the actual assault on the tips are also

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.180 
the actual assault on the tips are also
relatively<00:04:13.359> noise<00:04:13.690> isolating<00:04:14.290> so<00:04:14.680> it's<00:04:14.949> gonna

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
relatively noise isolating so it's gonna

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.640 
relatively noise isolating so it's gonna
kind<00:04:15.790> of<00:04:15.819> block<00:04:16.060> how<00:04:16.239> your<00:04:16.419> outside<00:04:16.750> sounds<00:04:17.199> as

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
kind of block how your outside sounds as

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.900 
kind of block how your outside sounds as
you're<00:04:17.829> listening<00:04:18.099> to<00:04:18.190> your<00:04:18.310> music<00:04:18.370> which<00:04:18.789> is

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
you're listening to your music which is

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.939 
you're listening to your music which is
good<00:04:19.150> so<00:04:19.810> overall<00:04:20.079> these<00:04:20.199> have<00:04:20.470> a<00:04:20.500> decent

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
good so overall these have a decent

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:22.350 
good so overall these have a decent
value<00:04:21.099> for<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.459> money<00:04:21.639> I<00:04:21.699> think<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:21.969> design

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
value for the money I think the design

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.120 
value for the money I think the design
is<00:04:22.539> pretty<00:04:22.719> unique<00:04:23.050> just<00:04:23.680> because<00:04:23.919> of<00:04:24.039> that

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
is pretty unique just because of that

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.820 
is pretty unique just because of that
interesting

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
interesting

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.830 
interesting
kind<00:04:25.400> of<00:04:25.430> designs<00:04:25.789> the<00:04:25.970> circular<00:04:26.360> tip<00:04:26.599> going

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
kind of designs the circular tip going

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.360 
kind of designs the circular tip going
on<00:04:27.020> even<00:04:27.349> though<00:04:27.440> it's<00:04:27.590> not<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.800> smallest<00:04:28.159> or
