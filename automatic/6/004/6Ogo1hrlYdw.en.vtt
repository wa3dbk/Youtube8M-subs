Ashley<00:05:50.159> and<00:05:50.849> I<00:05:51.419> probably<00:05:51.779> will<00:05:51.959> display<00:05:52.379> this

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:52.529

Ashley and I probably will display this
somewhere<00:05:52.949> I<00:05:53.189> don't<00:05:54.179> know<00:05:54.359> where<00:05:54.419> though<00:05:55.459> but

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:56.459 
somewhere I don't know where though but

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:59.779 
somewhere I don't know where though but
I<00:05:57.769> think<00:05:58.769> it's<00:05:58.889> made<00:05:59.039> out<00:05:59.159> of<00:05:59.189> a<00:05:59.309> hard<00:05:59.519> plastic

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
I think it's made out of a hard plastic

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:05.179 
I think it's made out of a hard plastic
I<00:06:00.149> think<00:06:02.569> still<00:06:03.569> it's<00:06:03.719> a<00:06:03.809> solid<00:06:04.169> addition<00:06:04.409> so<00:06:04.949> I

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:05.189 
I think still it's a solid addition so I

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:07.519 
I think still it's a solid addition so I
wanted<00:06:05.819> to<00:06:05.879> get<00:06:06.059> it<00:06:06.239> because<00:06:06.329> it<00:06:07.019> would<00:06:07.229> creak

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:07.529 
wanted to get it because it would creak

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:12.009 
wanted to get it because it would creak
