we're going to be demonstrating today

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.480 
we're going to be demonstrating today
the<00:00:27.930> main<00:00:28.140> difference<00:00:28.560> between<00:00:28.619> safe<00:00:29.189> strap

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
and bootstrap is that safe strap will

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.450 
and bootstrap is that safe strap will
not<00:00:32.279> touch<00:00:32.969> your<00:00:33.210> primary<00:00:33.809> system<00:00:34.290> files<00:00:34.590> on

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
your system partition safe strap is

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.650 
your system partition safe strap is
essentially<00:00:38.250> going<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.430> create<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:39.000> separate

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
essentially going to create a separate

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.750 
essentially going to create a separate
partition<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.530> that's<00:00:41.010> where<00:00:41.250> all<00:00:41.340> your<00:00:41.370> rom

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
system files are going to go leaving

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.100 
system files are going to go leaving
your<00:00:44.070> primary<00:00:44.640> file<00:00:44.910> undisturbed<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:45.809> if
