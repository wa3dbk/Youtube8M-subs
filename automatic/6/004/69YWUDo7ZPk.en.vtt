the yard that you're going to have to

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.510 
the yard that you're going to have to
measure<00:00:34.670> alright<00:00:35.670> let's<00:00:36.300> start<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.520> tree

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
measure alright let's start with a tree

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.549 
measure alright let's start with a tree
areas<00:00:39.030> where<00:00:39.300> you've<00:00:39.450> got<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> sorry<00:00:40.230> a

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
areas where you've got like a sorry a

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.490 
areas where you've got like a sorry a
circle<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> tree<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.969> middle<00:00:42.500> and

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
circle with a tree in the middle and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.930 
circle with a tree in the middle and
let's<00:00:44.219> say<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.760> particular

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
let's say that for this particular

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.540 
let's say that for this particular
example<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:46.200> you've<00:00:46.680> got<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.129> DS<00:00:47.309> are<00:00:47.430> like

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
example that you've got the DS are like

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.670 
example that you've got the DS are like
six<00:00:47.850> feet<00:00:48.030> across<00:00:48.180> well<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> recommend<00:00:49.350> for

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
six feet across well I recommend for

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.139 
six feet across well I recommend for
everything<00:00:50.100> when<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.340> go<00:00:50.489> out<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.760> measure<00:00:50.850> for

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
everything when I go out and measure for

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.970 
everything when I go out and measure for
someone's<00:00:51.480> at<00:00:51.750> someone's<00:00:52.110> house<00:00:52.289> what<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.890> do

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
someone's at someone's house what I do

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.310 
someone's at someone's house what I do
is<00:00:53.219> try<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.430> square<00:00:53.730> everything<00:00:53.940> off<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.750> I'll

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
is try to square everything off so I'll

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.170 
is try to square everything off so I'll
measure<00:00:55.590> across<00:00:55.829> if<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:56.280> six<00:00:56.520> feet<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:57.090> I

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
measure across if it's six feet then I

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.900 
measure across if it's six feet then I
just<00:00:57.329> laid<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.629> six<00:00:57.899> by<00:00:58.079> six<00:00:58.640> so<00:00:59.640> we're<00:00:59.760> going

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
just laid it six by six so we're going

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.119 
just laid it six by six so we're going
to<00:01:00.000> do<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.210> for<00:01:00.420> those<00:01:00.600> two<00:01:00.780> areas<00:01:01.050> here<00:01:01.440> all

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
to do that for those two areas here all

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.369 
to do that for those two areas here all
right<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.670> have<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> triangular<00:01:03.570> area<00:01:03.809> here

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
right you have a triangular area here

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.890 
right you have a triangular area here
that's<00:01:05.369> pretty<00:01:05.610> typical<00:01:05.909> somebody's<00:01:06.750> seen

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
that's pretty typical somebody's seen

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.780 
that's pretty typical somebody's seen
between<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.530> may<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.740> between<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.280> driveway

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
between you may see between a driveway

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.450 
between you may see between a driveway
and<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> walkway<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.290> let's<00:01:10.860> say<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.040> for

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and the walkway so let's say that for

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.090 
and the walkway so let's say that for
this<00:01:12.229> example<00:01:13.229> right<00:01:13.470> here<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.920> measures

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
this example right here that it measures

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.260 
this example right here that it measures
15<00:01:14.760> by<00:01:14.939> 15<00:01:16.220> this<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.400> basically<00:01:17.729> half<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.060> square

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
15 by 15 this is basically half a square

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.310 
15 by 15 this is basically half a square
if<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.600> complete<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> square<00:01:21.110> you'll<00:01:22.110> see

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
if you complete the square you'll see

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.929 
if you complete the square you'll see
that<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.650> area<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.070> basically<00:01:23.460> half<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.820> that

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
that this area is basically half of that

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.090 
that this area is basically half of that
so<00:01:24.180> we'll<00:01:24.330> do<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.170> math<00:01:25.350> 15<00:01:25.830> times

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
so we'll do if you do the math 15 times

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.700 
so we'll do if you do the math 15 times
15<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.820> then<00:01:27.030> we'll<00:01:27.240> divide<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.900> by<00:01:28.200> two<00:01:28.259> and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
15 and then we'll divide that by two and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.080 
15 and then we'll divide that by two and
that<00:01:28.950> will<00:01:29.070> give<00:01:29.250> us<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.490> area<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:30.000> this

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
that will give us the area for this

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.109 
that will give us the area for this
triangular<00:01:30.930> area<00:01:31.320> here<00:01:31.590> all<00:01:32.070> right<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.820> area

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
triangular area here all right the area

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.190 
triangular area here all right the area
here<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.420> front<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> house

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
here in front of the house

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.719 
here in front of the house
pretty<00:01:34.860> common<00:01:35.130> you're<00:01:35.430> going<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.610> see

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
pretty common you're going to see

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.670 
pretty common you're going to see
something<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.720> think<00:01:37.140> I've<00:01:37.320> got<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.650> here

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
something like I think I've got in here

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.399 
something like I think I've got in here
thirty<00:01:38.130> by<00:01:38.729> five<00:01:39.450> okay<00:01:40.079> that's<00:01:40.290> pretty

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
thirty by five okay that's pretty

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.080 
thirty by five okay that's pretty
typical<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.009> five<00:01:41.280> feet<00:01:41.520> out<00:01:41.549> from<00:01:41.970> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
typical you have five feet out from the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.210 
typical you have five feet out from the

corner to say 30 by 20 on the side of
your<00:01:50.280> home<00:01:50.520> you'll<00:01:51.149> probably<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.630> some

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
your home you'll probably have some

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.990 
your home you'll probably have some
vegetation<00:01:52.320> or<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:52.890> an<00:01:53.100> area<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.610> comes<00:01:53.850> out

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
vegetation or so an area that comes out

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.910 
vegetation or so an area that comes out
about<00:01:54.119> three<00:01:54.600> feet<00:01:54.840> from<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.200> house<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.740> say

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
about three feet from the house and say

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.910 
about three feet from the house and say
you<00:01:56.159> know<00:01:56.280> 30<00:01:56.579> 40<00:01:56.670> 50<00:01:57.210> feet<00:01:57.360> long<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:58.229> once<00:01:58.770> you

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
you know 30 40 50 feet long so once you

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.440 
you know 30 40 50 feet long so once you
get<00:01:59.040> all<00:01:59.310> these<00:01:59.460> measurements<00:02:00.030> what<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.299> want

get all these measurements what you want
to<00:02:00.540> start<00:02:00.689> doing<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:01.799> it's<00:02:02.130> just

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
to start doing it's just it's just

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.679 
to start doing it's just it's just
writing<00:02:02.549> them<00:02:02.759> down<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.119> coming<00:02:03.299> up<00:02:03.509> with

writing them down and coming up with

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.039 
writing them down and coming up with
some<00:02:03.840> numbers<00:02:04.020> here<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:05.420> we'll<00:02:06.420> start<00:02:06.659> out<00:02:06.869> up

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
some numbers here so we'll start out up

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.290 
some numbers here so we'll start out up
here<00:02:07.079> with<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.129> area<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.640> side<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.119> house

that one out got that one taken care of
you<00:02:15.040> got<00:02:15.159> a<00:02:15.190> 30<00:02:15.549> by<00:02:15.849> 20<00:02:15.909> area<00:02:16.780> right<00:02:16.959> here<00:02:17.489> we'll

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
you got a 30 by 20 area right here we'll

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.460 
you got a 30 by 20 area right here we'll
scratch<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:19.060> one<00:02:19.239> out<00:02:19.450> that's<00:02:19.989> taken<00:02:20.440> care

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
scratch that one out that's taken care

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.970 
scratch that one out that's taken care
of

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
of

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.619 
of
we<00:02:21.370> got<00:02:21.519> a<00:02:21.549> 30<00:02:21.940> by<00:02:22.180> 5<00:02:22.599> which<00:02:23.379> is<00:02:23.560> this<00:02:23.920> area

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
we got a 30 by 5 which is this area

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.720 
we got a 30 by 5 which is this area
scratched<00:02:25.629> that<00:02:25.930> went<00:02:26.170> off<00:02:26.290> this<00:02:27.010> triangular

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
scratched that went off this triangular

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.660 
scratched that went off this triangular
area<00:02:28.269> here<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.599> 15<00:02:29.140> by<00:02:29.379> 15<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:30.220> we're<00:02:30.400> going<00:02:30.519> to

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
area here is 15 by 15 so we're going to

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.300 
area here is 15 by 15 so we're going to
again<00:02:31.180> divide<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.750> 1<00:02:31.930> by<00:02:32.049> 2<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:33.069> works

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
again divide that 1 by 2 and that works

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.210 
again divide that 1 by 2 and that works
out<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.659> 1/12<00:02:34.659> dot<00:02:34.959> 5<00:02:35.230> we've<00:02:35.560> got<00:02:35.709> that<00:02:36.040> one

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
out to 1/12 dot 5 we've got that one

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.420 
out to 1/12 dot 5 we've got that one
taken<00:02:36.549> care<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:37.560> what<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.709> leaves<00:02:39.010> are<00:02:39.280> our

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
taken care of what that leaves are our

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.789 
taken care of what that leaves are our
two<00:02:39.670> tree<00:02:40.060> areas<00:02:40.480> here<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:40.959> those<00:02:41.560> are<00:02:41.709> your

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
two tree areas here and those are your

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.390 
two tree areas here and those are your
6x6<00:02:42.579> areas<00:02:42.909> okay<00:02:43.269> if<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.379> just<00:02:45.040> do<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.370> math

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
6x6 areas okay if you just do the math

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.150 
6x6 areas okay if you just do the math
err<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.329> add<00:02:46.510> everything<00:02:46.750> up<00:02:47.109> well<00:02:47.769> this<00:02:47.890> comes

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
err to add everything up well this comes

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.339 
err to add everything up well this comes
to<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.959> 1050<00:02:50.280> 4.50<00:02:51.280> square<00:02:51.730> feet<00:02:52.000> all<00:02:52.660> right<00:02:52.720> so

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
to is 1050 4.50 square feet all right so

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.170 
to is 1050 4.50 square feet all right so
now<00:02:53.560> we've<00:02:53.769> got<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.010> square<00:02:54.310> footage<00:02:54.700> area<00:02:55.030> that

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
now we've got a square footage area that

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.180 
now we've got a square footage area that
we<00:02:55.329> can<00:02:55.780> pretty<00:02:56.079> much<00:02:56.140> guys<00:02:56.530> late<00:02:56.769> anything

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
we can pretty much guys late anything

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.380 
we can pretty much guys late anything
from<00:02:57.430> all<00:02:58.030> right

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
from all right

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.059 
from all right
as<00:02:59.290> far<00:02:59.590> as<00:02:59.620> coverage<00:03:00.190> goes<00:03:00.989> one<00:03:01.989> yard<00:03:02.349> at<00:03:02.680> two

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
as far as coverage goes one yard at two

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.309 
as far as coverage goes one yard at two
inches<00:03:03.340> we'll<00:03:03.730> cover<00:03:03.940> about<00:03:04.209> 150<00:03:04.989> square<00:03:05.200> feet

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
inches we'll cover about 150 square feet

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.610 
inches we'll cover about 150 square feet
a<00:03:05.769> yard<00:03:06.549> at<00:03:06.730> 3<00:03:07.000> inches<00:03:07.209> we'll<00:03:07.480> cover<00:03:07.659> about<00:03:07.900> 120

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
a yard at 3 inches we'll cover about 120

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.009 
a yard at 3 inches we'll cover about 120
square<00:03:08.829> feet<00:03:08.950> so<00:03:09.519> let's<00:03:09.730> say<00:03:10.390> for<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:10.720> first

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
square feet so let's say for this first

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.869 
square feet so let's say for this first
example<00:03:11.409> you<00:03:11.769> decide<00:03:11.890> that<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.459> just<00:03:12.489> want<00:03:12.819> to

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
example you decide that you just want to

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.640 
example you decide that you just want to
go<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.000> inches<00:03:13.690> deep<00:03:13.989> which<00:03:14.260> the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
go to inches deep which the

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.800 
go to inches deep which the
recommendation<00:03:15.400> is<00:03:15.519> 2<00:03:15.700> to<00:03:15.819> 3<00:03:16.030> inches<00:03:16.209> so<00:03:16.780> you

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
recommendation is 2 to 3 inches so you

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.170 
recommendation is 2 to 3 inches so you
just<00:03:17.079> want<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.260> go<00:03:17.410> 2<00:03:17.470> inches<00:03:18.010> deep<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:18.519> what

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
just want to go 2 inches deep so what

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.050 
just want to go 2 inches deep so what
we're<00:03:19.329> going<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.510> do<00:03:19.720> is<00:03:20.079> we'll<00:03:20.349> take<00:03:20.590> this

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
we're going to do is we'll take this

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.710 
we're going to do is we'll take this
calculated<00:03:22.060> number<00:03:22.239> here<00:03:22.599> the<00:03:23.160> 1054<00:03:24.160> and

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
calculated number here the 1054 and

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.940 
calculated number here the 1054 and
we're<00:03:25.720> going<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.900> go<00:03:25.989> 2<00:03:26.049> inches<00:03:26.500> deep<00:03:26.560> we're

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
we're going to go 2 inches deep we're

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.819 
we're going to go 2 inches deep we're
going<00:03:27.069> to<00:03:27.130> divide<00:03:27.459> that<00:03:27.519> number<00:03:27.849> by<00:03:28.500> 150<00:03:29.500> all

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
going to divide that number by 150 all

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.819 
going to divide that number by 150 all
right<00:03:29.980> if<00:03:30.069> you<00:03:30.160> do<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:30.579> it<00:03:31.180> comes<00:03:31.450> out<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.829> 7.0

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
right if you do that it comes out to 7.0

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.849 
right if you do that it comes out to 7.0
3<00:03:33.190> square<00:03:33.579> yards<00:03:34.030> if<00:03:34.480> you<00:03:34.690> can<00:03:34.900> if<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:35.620> want<00:03:35.709> to

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
3 square yards if you can if you want to

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.650 
3 square yards if you can if you want to
go<00:03:35.950> 3<00:03:36.310> inches<00:03:36.579> deep<00:03:36.639> then<00:03:37.329> we're<00:03:37.480> going<00:03:37.599> to

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
go 3 inches deep then we're going to

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.050 
go 3 inches deep then we're going to
divide<00:03:37.930> that<00:03:38.230> same<00:03:38.560> number<00:03:38.980> by<00:03:39.190> 120<00:03:39.879> and

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
divide that same number by 120 and

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.330 
divide that same number by 120 and
that'll<00:03:40.629> give<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:41.019> a<00:03:41.230> comes<00:03:41.799> out<00:03:41.949> with<00:03:42.129> eight

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
that'll give you a comes out with eight

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.089 
that'll give you a comes out with eight

point seven nine square yards and you're

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.189 
point seven nine square yards and you're
going<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.310> round<00:03:45.430> them<00:03:45.639> up<00:03:45.790> either<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.629> the<00:03:46.810> to

going to round them up either to the to

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.680 
going to round them up either to the to

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
the nearest number for this one just be

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.569 
the nearest number for this one just be
seven<00:03:50.049> yards<00:03:50.440> that<00:03:50.829> when<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.160> round<00:03:51.310> that<00:03:51.519> up

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
seven yards that when you round that up

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.409 
seven yards that when you round that up
to<00:03:51.730> 9<00:03:52.000> so<00:03:52.810> that's<00:03:53.199> pretty<00:03:53.530> much<00:03:53.709> in<00:03:53.889> a<00:03:53.980> nutshell
