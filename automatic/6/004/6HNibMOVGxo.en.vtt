00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
went ahead and blocked it out with 36

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.680 
went ahead and blocked it out with 36
then<00:00:45.620> I<00:00:45.650> came<00:00:45.769> back<00:00:46.070> with<00:00:46.280> 80<00:00:46.550> grit<00:00:46.670> with<00:00:47.540> the

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
then I came back with 80 grit with the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.869 
then I came back with 80 grit with the
same<00:00:47.960> procedure<00:00:48.829> but<00:00:49.010> I<00:00:49.280> used<00:00:49.460> 80<00:00:49.699> grit

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
same procedure but I used 80 grit

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.430 
same procedure but I used 80 grit
sandpaper<00:00:50.180> just<00:00:50.750> like<00:00:50.870> you<00:00:51.019> see<00:00:51.199> right<00:00:51.230> there

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
sandpaper just like you see right there

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.069 
sandpaper just like you see right there
now<00:00:52.339> what<00:00:52.489> I'm<00:00:52.610> doing<00:00:52.640> is<00:00:53.269> I'm<00:00:53.659> just<00:00:53.690> rounding

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
now what I'm doing is I'm just rounding

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.720 
now what I'm doing is I'm just rounding
these<00:00:54.500> edges<00:00:54.890> up<00:00:55.040> so<00:00:55.190> I<00:00:55.280> don't<00:00:55.370> want<00:00:55.610> real

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
these edges up so I don't want real

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.460 
these edges up so I don't want real
sharp<00:00:56.059> edges<00:00:56.269> I<00:00:56.480> want<00:00:56.659> everything<00:00:57.110> to<00:00:57.140> match

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
sharp edges I want everything to match

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.660 
sharp edges I want everything to match
so<00:00:57.710> I'm<00:00:57.800> going<00:00:57.949> to<00:00:57.980> take<00:00:58.159> my<00:00:58.339> piece<00:00:58.400> of

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
so I'm going to take my piece of

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.510 
so I'm going to take my piece of
sandpaper<00:00:58.989> and<00:00:59.989> I'm<00:01:00.110> just<00:01:00.320> kinda<00:01:00.500> lightly<00:01:00.980> if

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
sandpaper and I'm just kinda lightly if

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.400 
sandpaper and I'm just kinda lightly if
you<00:01:01.670> look<00:01:01.820> real<00:01:02.030> close<00:01:02.270> I'm<00:01:02.870> just<00:01:03.109> lightly

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
cutting the edge okay just around it off

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.580 
cutting the edge okay just around it off
I<00:01:07.850> don't<00:01:07.910> want<00:01:08.149> to<00:01:08.210> round<00:01:08.330> it<00:01:08.539> too<00:01:08.660> much<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:09.500> I

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
I don't want to round it too much and I

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.300 
I don't want to round it too much and I
don't<00:01:09.649> want<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:10.190> round<00:01:10.369> it<00:01:10.610> not<00:01:11.060> enough<00:01:11.390> though

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
don't want to round it not enough though

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.680 
don't want to round it not enough though
what<00:01:13.310> happens<00:01:13.700> if<00:01:13.820> you<00:01:13.940> round<00:01:14.149> that<00:01:14.270> edge<00:01:14.479> too

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
what happens if you round that edge too

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.850 
what happens if you round that edge too
much<00:01:14.869> it's<00:01:15.020> going<00:01:15.110> to<00:01:15.170> be<00:01:15.289> round<00:01:15.470> here<00:01:15.649> and

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
much it's going to be round here and

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.800 
much it's going to be round here and
it's<00:01:16.009> going<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.190> be<00:01:16.250> square<00:01:16.520> here<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.509> be<00:01:17.690> very

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
it's going to be square here so be very

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.180 
it's going to be square here so be very
careful<00:01:18.110> not<00:01:18.380> to<00:01:18.560> round<00:01:18.710> to<00:01:18.920> month<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:19.130> I'm

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
careful not to round to month so I'm

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.440 
careful not to round to month so I'm
gonna<00:01:19.310> go<00:01:19.369> ahead<00:01:19.550> and<00:01:19.670> get<00:01:19.759> that<00:01:19.910> top<00:01:20.179> right

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
gonna go ahead and get that top right

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.980 
gonna go ahead and get that top right

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
now I did take that down a little

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.429 
now I did take that down a little
farther<00:01:44.299> because<00:01:44.630> it<00:01:44.689> was<00:01:44.780> actually<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.170> dent

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
farther because it was actually a dent

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:46.780 
farther because it was actually a dent
in<00:01:45.590> this<00:01:45.680> area<00:01:46.009> so<00:01:46.130> I<00:01:46.159> went<00:01:46.340> ahead<00:01:46.430> and<00:01:46.610> fix

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
in this area so I went ahead and fix

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.370 
in this area so I went ahead and fix
that<00:01:47.000> damn<00:01:47.210> okay<00:01:47.420> if<00:01:47.630> you<00:01:47.780> look<00:01:47.960> right<00:01:48.140> here

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
that damn okay if you look right here

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.200 
that damn okay if you look right here
you<00:01:48.439> can<00:01:48.710> see<00:01:48.950> where<00:01:49.250> it<00:01:49.340> starts<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.909> it<00:01:50.060> gets

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
you can see where it starts and it gets

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.740 
you can see where it starts and it gets
thicker<00:01:50.509> as<00:01:50.810> we<00:01:50.960> go<00:01:51.110> down<00:01:51.790> okay<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:53.060> that's

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
thicker as we go down okay and that's

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.899 
thicker as we go down okay and that's
how<00:01:53.930> thick<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:54.350> was<00:01:54.470> on<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.890> edge<00:01:55.070> here<00:01:55.430> for

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
how thick it was on the edge here for

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.230 
how thick it was on the edge here for
the<00:01:56.140> going<00:01:57.140> down<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.470> quarter<00:01:57.770> panel<00:01:58.240> and

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
the going down the quarter panel and

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.819 
the going down the quarter panel and
then<00:01:59.360> if<00:01:59.450> you<00:01:59.540> look<00:01:59.659> right<00:01:59.840> here<00:01:59.899> coarse<00:02:00.500> up<00:02:00.710> on

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
then if you look right here coarse up on

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.020 
then if you look right here coarse up on
the<00:02:00.920> top<00:02:01.100> of<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.340> quarter<00:02:01.549> panel

okay<00:02:05.000> just<00:02:05.329> from<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.570> factory<00:02:06.049> you<00:02:06.140> can<00:02:06.290> see

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
okay just from the factory you can see

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.340 
okay just from the factory you can see
the<00:02:07.909> difference<00:02:08.420> okay<00:02:08.899> I'm<00:02:09.019> gonna<00:02:09.110> back<00:02:09.290> that

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
the difference okay I'm gonna back that

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.870 
the difference okay I'm gonna back that
up<00:02:09.739> because<00:02:09.860> when<00:02:10.310> you<00:02:10.399> look<00:02:10.519> at<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.759> real

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
up because when you look at it real

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.660 
up because when you look at it real
close<00:02:11.000> layer<00:02:11.299> but<00:02:11.989> you<00:02:12.019> see<00:02:12.470> that<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.280> factory

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
close layer but you see that the factory

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.729 
close layer but you see that the factory
original<00:02:13.820> parts<00:02:14.390> don't<00:02:14.600> fit<00:02:14.720> perfect<00:02:15.410> okay

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
original parts don't fit perfect okay

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.259 
original parts don't fit perfect okay
because<00:02:16.040> this<00:02:16.220> is<00:02:16.340> actually<00:02:16.519> a<00:02:16.790> factory

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
because this is actually a factory

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.289
