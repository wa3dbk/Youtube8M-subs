00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:02.209 
they've got this little screw here it's
very<00:01:59.700> easy<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.390> screw<00:02:00.689> screwing<00:02:01.289> right<00:02:01.560> or

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
very easy to screw screwing right or

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.719 
very easy to screw screwing right or
clockwise<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.420> going<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.869> tighten<00:02:04.560> it

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
clockwise is going to tighten it

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.700 
clockwise is going to tighten it
screwing<00:02:05.729> left<00:02:06.060> counterclockwise<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.500> going

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
screwing left counterclockwise is going

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.160 
screwing left counterclockwise is going
to<00:02:07.770> loosen<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.060> actually<00:02:09.480> often<00:02:09.960> think

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
to loosen it and I actually often think

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.750 
to loosen it and I actually often think
of<00:02:10.290> a<00:02:10.350> Christmas<00:02:10.740> tree<00:02:10.770> base<00:02:11.160> when<00:02:11.430> I'm<00:02:11.520> trying

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
of a Christmas tree base when I'm trying

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.460 
of a Christmas tree base when I'm trying
to<00:02:12.000> screw<00:02:12.660> in<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.930> Christmas

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
to screw in a Christmas

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.050 
to screw in a Christmas
so<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.190> might<00:02:14.370> be<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.550> one<00:02:14.730> way<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:15.030> thinking

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
so that might be a one way of thinking

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.170 
so that might be a one way of thinking
of<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:16.560> I'm<00:02:16.710> gonna<00:02:16.830> apply<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.760> ones<00:02:17.940> with

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
of this so I'm gonna apply the ones with

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.880 
of this so I'm gonna apply the ones with
the<00:02:18.270> dials<00:02:18.660> are<00:02:18.930> always<00:02:19.290> going<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.500> go<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:19.740> the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
the dials are always going to go on the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.210 
the dials are always going to go on the
top<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.340> tool<00:02:20.520> so<00:02:21.450> loosen<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.230> screw<00:02:22.560> as

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
top of the tool so loosen the screw as

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.860 
top of the tool so loosen the screw as
far<00:02:23.670> back<00:02:23.850> as<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.090> can<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.480> don't<00:02:24.630> need<00:02:24.750> to

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
far back as you can you don't need to

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.450 
far back as you can you don't need to
remove<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.380> group<00:02:25.650> just<00:02:25.800> make<00:02:26.100> sure<00:02:26.280> that

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
remove this group just make sure that

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.280 
remove this group just make sure that
when<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:26.670> look<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.210> there<00:02:27.480> it's<00:02:28.050> not

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
when you look in there it's not

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.020 
when you look in there it's not
protruding<00:02:28.920> out<00:02:29.160> from<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.580> interior

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
protruding out from the interior

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.870 
protruding out from the interior
circumference<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.770> I'm<00:02:32.160> just<00:02:32.370> going<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.640> put

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
circumference and I'm just going to put

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.910 
circumference and I'm just going to put
this<00:02:33.230> right<00:02:34.230> on<00:02:34.470> top<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:35.190> this<00:02:36.060> rod<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.960> I'm

going to fasten it I'm gonna keep

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.580 
going to fasten it I'm gonna keep
turning<00:02:41.880> until<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.360> can<00:02:42.510> turn<00:02:42.720> no<00:02:42.960> more<00:02:43.170> you

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
turning until I can turn no more you

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
don't need to turn it so that it gets to

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.970

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.100 
but you're not actually compressing it
all<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.890> way<00:04:23.039> so<00:04:23.100> I<00:04:23.370> can<00:04:23.640> still<00:04:23.990> change<00:04:24.990> my

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.909 
just going to put the snap up into that
little<00:05:36.759> hole<00:05:37.229> just<00:05:38.229> like<00:05:38.380> that<00:05:38.560> and<00:05:38.830> it

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
little hole just like that and it

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.890 
little hole just like that and it
catches<00:05:39.099> perfectly<00:05:39.789> again<00:05:40.539> I'm<00:05:40.719> going<00:05:40.840> to

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
catches perfectly again I'm going to

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.510 
catches perfectly again I'm going to
make<00:05:40.990> sure<00:05:41.050> that<00:05:41.320> this<00:05:41.440> closes<00:05:41.919> all<00:05:42.159> the<00:05:42.190> way

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
make sure that this closes all the way

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.360 
make sure that this closes all the way
and<00:05:42.849> it<00:05:42.940> does<00:05:43.650> now<00:05:44.650> you<00:05:44.710> want<00:05:44.979> to<00:05:45.009> be<00:05:45.130> careful

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
and it does now you want to be careful

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.800 
and it does now you want to be careful
when<00:05:45.669> you're<00:05:45.759> doing<00:05:45.820> your<00:05:46.060> fabric<00:05:46.539> you<00:05:46.719> want

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
when you're doing your fabric you want

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.469 
when you're doing your fabric you want
to<00:05:46.960> figure<00:05:47.169> out<00:05:47.340> where<00:05:48.340> the<00:05:48.759> snaps<00:05:49.000> are<00:05:49.330> going

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
to figure out where the snaps are going

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.209 
to figure out where the snaps are going
to<00:05:49.539> line<00:05:49.750> up<00:05:49.780> this<00:05:50.259> is<00:05:50.409> very<00:05:50.710> important

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:51.219 
to line up this is very important

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:53.360 
to line up this is very important
because<00:05:51.310> you<00:05:51.490> do<00:05:51.610> only<00:05:51.759> get<00:05:51.940> one<00:05:52.120> shot<00:05:52.360> at<00:05:52.539> this

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
because you do only get one shot at this

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.740 
because you do only get one shot at this
press<00:05:54.370> this<00:05:54.580> down<00:05:54.759> here<00:05:55.000> real<00:05:55.120> quick<00:05:55.300> so<00:05:55.509> what

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
your fabric now if you have two pieces

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.439 
your fabric now if you have two pieces
like<00:06:00.280> this<00:06:00.490> it's<00:06:00.729> a<00:06:00.759> little<00:06:00.849> bit<00:06:01.060> easier<00:06:01.330> but

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.449 
like this it's a little bit easier but

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:02.249 
like this it's a little bit easier but

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:04.569 
match so you want to figure out where

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:06.809 
match so you want to figure out where
that's<00:06:04.840> going<00:06:04.960> to<00:06:05.020> line<00:06:05.289> up<00:06:05.500> so<00:06:06.280> I<00:06:06.310> can<00:06:06.580> see

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:06.819
