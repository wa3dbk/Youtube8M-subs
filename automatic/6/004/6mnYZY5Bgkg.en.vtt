00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
don't actually have the hope oh wait a

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.639 
don't actually have the hope oh wait a
second<00:01:56.640> ah<00:01:56.729> here<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:57.719> go<00:01:57.869> here's<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.380> ice

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
second ah here we go here's the ice

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.959 
second ah here we go here's the ice
level<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.549> this<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.180> something<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.659> was

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
level so this is something that I was

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.550 
level so this is something that I was
that<00:02:02.969> someone<00:02:03.329> told<00:02:03.540> me<00:02:03.689> about<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.200> let's<00:02:04.409> see

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
that someone told me about so let's see

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.630 
that someone told me about so let's see
if<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.680> got<00:02:04.920> them<00:02:05.100> right<00:02:05.280> here

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
if we got them right here

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.520 
if we got them right here
there<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.750> yep<00:02:07.399> the<00:02:08.399> antigravity<00:02:09.530> thing

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
there is the yep the antigravity thing

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.250 
there is the yep the antigravity thing
plus<00:02:11.129> something<00:02:11.550> else<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.930> can<00:02:13.080> actually

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
plus something else so we can actually

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.760 
plus something else so we can actually
go

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
go

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.190 
go

minutes then I'll be able to move to the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.500 
minutes then I'll be able to move to the
next<00:02:23.370> space<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.700> I'll<00:02:23.760> quickly<00:02:24.000> make<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.240> video

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
next space and I'll quickly make a video

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.090 
next space and I'll quickly make a video
I'll<00:02:24.840> be<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.080> first<00:02:25.260> guy<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.500> make<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.770> video<00:02:25.950> on

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
I'll be the first guy to make a video on

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.310 
I'll be the first guy to make a video on
how<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.310> make<00:02:26.490> some<00:02:26.610> new<00:02:26.970> jumps<00:02:27.300> with<00:02:27.840> this

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
how to make some new jumps with this

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.930 
how to make some new jumps with this
particular<00:02:28.920> thing<00:02:29.130> now<00:02:29.340> it's<00:02:29.490> kind<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.730> weird

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
particular thing now it's kind of weird

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.060 
particular thing now it's kind of weird
there's<00:02:30.090> only<00:02:30.270> there's<00:02:31.230> one<00:02:31.320> trap<00:02:31.800> in<00:02:31.950> this

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
there's only there's one trap in this

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.370 
there's only there's one trap in this
space<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:32.880> how's<00:02:33.540> this<00:02:33.660> even<00:02:33.780> possible<00:02:34.020> is

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
space but how's this even possible is

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.890 
space but how's this even possible is
this<00:02:34.500> even<00:02:34.910> doable<00:02:35.910> no<00:02:36.210> no<00:02:36.420> no<00:02:36.600> no<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:36.780> think

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
this even doable no no no no I think

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.760 
this even doable no no no no I think
that<00:02:37.110> um<00:02:38.420> I'm<00:02:39.420> trying<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.750> think<00:02:40.200> about<00:02:40.560> this

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
that um I'm trying to think about this

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.380 
that um I'm trying to think about this
there's<00:02:41.190> only<00:02:41.370> one<00:02:41.670> trap<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.150> looks<00:02:42.270> like

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
there's only one trap it looks like

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.910 
there's only one trap it looks like
that's<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.600> anti<00:02:42.930> grabby<00:02:43.230> thing<00:02:43.500> but<00:02:43.800> I'm

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
that's the anti grabby thing but I'm

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.860 
that's the anti grabby thing but I'm
sure<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.250> there's<00:02:44.580> more<00:02:44.880> traps<00:02:45.300> be<00:02:45.480> told<00:02:45.750> and

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
sure that there's more traps be told and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.330 
sure that there's more traps be told and
I'm<00:02:45.990> sure<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.380> everyone's<00:02:46.920> starting<00:02:47.190> out

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
I'm sure that everyone's starting out

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.820 
I'm sure that everyone's starting out
with<00:02:47.400> this<00:02:47.640> as<00:02:47.940> well<00:02:48.270> so<00:02:48.560> we're<00:02:49.560> gonna<00:02:49.650> be

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
with this as well so we're gonna be

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.660 
with this as well so we're gonna be

shape too but it looks like it goes it
doesn't<00:04:52.740> go<00:04:52.830> infinitely<00:04:53.370> so<00:04:53.520> it<00:04:53.610> has<00:04:53.730> a

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
doesn't go infinitely so it has a

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.390 
doesn't go infinitely so it has a
certain<00:04:54.090> amount<00:04:54.180> ofor<00:04:55.080> it<00:04:55.320> reverses<00:04:56.040> back<00:04:56.070> to

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
certain amount ofor it reverses back to

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.890 
certain amount ofor it reverses back to
its<00:04:56.550> second<00:04:56.880> thing<00:04:56.970> let's<00:04:57.150> let's<00:04:57.540> count<00:04:57.750> right

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
its second thing let's let's count right

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.730 
its second thing let's let's count right
here<00:04:58.080> so<00:04:58.260> one<00:04:58.650> two<00:04:59.130> three<00:04:59.450> four<00:05:00.450> two<00:05:01.320> three

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
here so one two three four two three

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.710 
here so one two three four two three
four<00:05:02.040> takes<00:05:02.610> about<00:05:02.700> four<00:05:03.030> shots<00:05:03.330> for<00:05:03.540> it<00:05:03.630> to

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
four takes about four shots for it to

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.210 
four takes about four shots for it to
bounce<00:05:03.900> back<00:05:04.110> and<00:05:04.320> forth<00:05:04.410> and<00:05:04.710> it<00:05:04.830> looks<00:05:05.040> like

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
bounce back and forth and it looks like

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.250 
bounce back and forth and it looks like
