00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.760
 legendary names for future models 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.770
 the German brand has rescued a name 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.390
 historic of the trunk of memories for 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.880
 attract the attention of themselves and others 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.950
 although it does not suppose a renewed religion 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.680
 of the famous icon of the 80s 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.480
 The Opel Monza Concept has the DNA 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.490
 that will mark the new aesthetic trend 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.750
 and technology that will be implemented in the 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.750
 future series cars 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.980
 this futuristic four- seater coupe 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.980
 with hinged doors and opening type 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.260
 Seagull wing measures 4.69 meters 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.020
 length and only one meter 31 of 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.899
 height to lack pillar of we have 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.550
 Free access to the two rows of seats 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.829
 Opel has ensured that the free height at 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.420
 roof has not suffered any decline since 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.010
 the carrier is located 15 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.440
 centimeters below the average 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.180
 usual the trunk offers some 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.180
 generous 500 liters capacity 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.220
 Cutting seats markedly 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.750
 sports subject in with ferocity and give 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.730
 step to a new box of 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.560
 instruments that extends throughout the 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.990
 width of the dashboard organized in 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.400
 several heights lacks watches and 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.040
 screens where to show the information 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.440
 relevant to driving in place 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.730
 It has 18 LEDs that project the 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.910
 three-dimensional data on the 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.910
 dashboard 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.050
 allows endless combinations and the 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.280
 Most controls are tactile 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.440
 we can select the information that 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.300
 We create timely through a series 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.530
 of buttons located on the steering wheel or 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.420
 through voice commands 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.810
 customizing colors and backgrounds to 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.810
 Will 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.090
 its cutting- edge technology is not only 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.229
 applicable in the mechanical aspect but 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.570
 also in the field of 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.040
 infotainment the sound equipment 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.830
 and multimedia comes with three 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.830
 pre-set configurations have you 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.550
 ah 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.050
 is the pure essence of the evolution of 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.300
 the hybrid mechanics of autonomy 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.130
 extended that the work scheme is 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.500
 very similar to the one used by the opel 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.170
 ampera although updated and much more 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.120
 efficient batteries do not stay alone 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.370
 along the central tunnel but at 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.350
 being smaller packages can 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.830
 distributed evenly throughout 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.830
 the vehicle 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.819
 and has two engines for its 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.280
 running one electric and one of 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.349
 internal combustion it is a new 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.230
 three-cylinder propellant with one liter of 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.060
 cubicaje and equipped with turbo compressor 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.610
 gets the name of that idea and is 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.590
 fueled by natural gas this last 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.810
 it works as a generator to load the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.580
 battery that gives life to the electric that is 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.860
 the one in charge of transmitting the power to 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.330
 the wheels can also work from 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.330
 exclusively electric form 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.060
 styles or modern and futuristic are the 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.800
 three adjectives that best define a 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.690
 model that is at the same time ambassador of 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.030
 future and awareness of the past 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.950
 we will probably never see a new 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.230
 opel generation mounts circulating by 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.890
 our streets but we will always have 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.890
 the hope
