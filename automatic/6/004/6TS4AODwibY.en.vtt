about<00:00:06.290> the<00:00:07.290> Fokker<00:00:07.799> 100<00:00:08.870> we<00:00:09.870> just<00:00:10.170> sent<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.910> the

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
about the Fokker 100 we just sent to the

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.289 
about the Fokker 100 we just sent to the
dot<00:00:12.150> org<00:00:12.710> the<00:00:13.710> plane<00:00:13.980> was<00:00:14.190> originally<00:00:15.030> made<00:00:15.240> by

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
dot org the plane was originally made by

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.580 
dot org the plane was originally made by
christina<00:00:15.929> marie<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:17.750> hardwood<00:00:18.750> kuga<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.320> me

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
christina marie and hardwood kuga and me

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.570 
christina marie and hardwood kuga and me
we<00:00:19.949> built<00:00:20.220> up<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:21.150> whole<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.689> new<00:00:22.220> panel<00:00:23.220> as<00:00:23.460> a

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
we built up the whole and new panel as a

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.599 
we built up the whole and new panel as a
new<00:00:23.789> glare<00:00:24.150> shield<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:25.199> system<00:00:25.590> death<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.160> a

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
new glare shield the system death and a

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.599 
new glare shield the system death and a
lot<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.789> art<00:00:27.150> work<00:00:27.630> concerning<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:29.099> panels

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
lot of art work concerning the panels

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.510 
lot of art work concerning the panels
and<00:00:30.590> different<00:00:32.480> liveries<00:00:33.500> so<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:35.100> let<00:00:35.340> us

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
and different liveries so just let us

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.420 
and different liveries so just let us
jump<00:00:35.910> into<00:00:36.290> this<00:00:37.290> plane<00:00:39.260> you<00:00:40.260> finds<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.770> panel

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
jump into this plane you finds a panel

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.529 
jump into this plane you finds a panel
in<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.530> default<00:00:43.530> resolution<00:00:43.739> it's<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.820> 1280

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
in the default resolution it's a 1280

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.990 
in the default resolution it's a 1280
for<00:00:46.350> 800<00:00:47.309> pixel<00:00:48.559> but<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.739> can't<00:00:50.070> choose<00:00:50.460> any

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
for 800 pixel but you can't choose any

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.389 
for 800 pixel but you can't choose any
white<00:00:51.390> screen<00:00:51.840> resolution<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.710> want<00:00:53.010> maybe

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
white screen resolution you want maybe

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.340 
white screen resolution you want maybe
you<00:00:53.550> have<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.969> change<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> bit<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.320> that

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
you have to change it a bit in that

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.349 
you have to change it a bit in that
plane<00:00:55.800> may<00:00:56.010> cause<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.930> so<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.320> jump<00:00:58.980> em

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
plane may cause of you so just jump em

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.590 
plane may cause of you so just jump em
so<00:01:00.359> what's<00:01:01.050> what's<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.890> see<00:01:02.600> just

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
so what's what's a you see just

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.580 
so what's what's a you see just
immediately<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.640> explain<00:01:06.630> or<00:01:06.930> magazine

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
immediately it's a explain or magazine

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.530 
immediately it's a explain or magazine
which<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.610> definitely<00:01:09.090> cannot<00:01:09.750> buy<00:01:11.030> but<00:01:12.030> here

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
which you definitely cannot buy but here

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.789 
which you definitely cannot buy but here
it<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.380> what<00:01:13.979> i<00:01:14.010> call<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.330> code<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.259> start

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
it is what i call it the code and start

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.240 
it is what i call it the code and start
button<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.700> will<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.390> put<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
button you will have to put the

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.160 
button you will have to put the
newspaper<00:01:20.250> away<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.880> course<00:01:21.240> otherwise<00:01:21.869> you

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
newspaper away of course otherwise you

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.760 
newspaper away of course otherwise you
cannot<00:01:22.470> see<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> glare<00:01:22.950> shield<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:24.500> in<00:01:25.500> this

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
cannot see the glare shield and in this

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.230 
cannot see the glare shield and in this
time<00:01:26.210> in<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.420> moment<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:29.729> whole<00:01:30.509> plane<00:01:31.040> will

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
time in this moment the whole plane will

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.050 
time in this moment the whole plane will
set<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.840> certain<00:01:34.590> state<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.030> is

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
set to a certain state that it is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.440 
set to a certain state that it is
possible<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.170> do<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.220> whole<00:01:38.430> code<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.150> start

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
possible to do the whole code and start

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.130 
possible to do the whole code and start
procedure<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:43.310> next<00:01:44.310> what<00:01:44.579> i<00:01:44.640> want<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.509> I

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
procedure so next what i want to do is I

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.139 
procedure so next what i want to do is I
want<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.560> explain<00:01:48.170> this<00:01:49.170> overhead<00:01:50.100> panel<00:01:50.759> for

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
want to explain this overhead panel for

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.200 
want to explain this overhead panel for
this<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.479> switch<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.430> battery<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.840> cross<00:01:54.840> tie<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
this I switch a battery on cross tie and

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.490 
this I switch a battery on cross tie and
avionics<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.110> inverters<00:01:58.790> so<00:01:59.790> we<00:02:00.149> can<00:02:00.500> we

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
avionics and the inverters so we can we

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.730 
avionics and the inverters so we can we
can<00:02:01.770> see<00:02:02.070> what<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.610> going<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:04.229> panel

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
can see what is going on on this panel

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.600 
can see what is going on on this panel
of<00:02:05.549> course<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:06.990> electric<00:02:07.560> panel<00:02:08.009> with
