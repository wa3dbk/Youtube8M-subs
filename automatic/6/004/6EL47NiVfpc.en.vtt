well<00:00:03.750> hi<00:00:04.020> everyone<00:00:04.370> today<00:00:05.370> we'll<00:00:05.609> be

00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:05.729 
well hi everyone today we'll be

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:08.390 
well hi everyone today we'll be
discussing<00:00:06.060> how<00:00:06.480> to<00:00:06.509> make<00:00:07.379> Swarovski<00:00:08.069> crystal

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
discussing how to make Swarovski crystal

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.970 
discussing how to make Swarovski crystal
flip-flops<00:00:08.850> with<00:00:09.540> blocks<00:00:09.900> this<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.679> very

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
flip-flops with blocks this is a very

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.430 
flip-flops with blocks this is a very
similar<00:00:11.309> technique<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.450> rose<00:00:12.719> which<00:00:13.259> were

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
similar technique to the rose which were

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.220 
similar technique to the rose which were
discussed<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:13.980> video<00:00:14.130> number<00:00:14.490> two<00:00:15.230> except

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
discussed in video number two except

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.010 
discussed in video number two except
we'll<00:00:16.410> actually<00:00:16.590> be<00:00:16.830> making<00:00:17.509> blocks<00:00:18.509> that

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
we'll actually be making blocks that

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.650 
we'll actually be making blocks that
have<00:00:19.200> a<00:00:19.230> different<00:00:19.710> color<00:00:20.099> of<00:00:20.660> crystals

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
have a different color of crystals

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.319 
have a different color of crystals
inside<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.919> instead<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.310> being<00:00:23.550> all<00:00:23.790> one<00:00:24.060> color

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:24.329 
inside so instead of being all one color

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.080 
inside so instead of being all one color
like<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.809> rose<00:00:25.020> and<00:00:25.559> then<00:00:26.070> alternating<00:00:26.700> with

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
like the rose and then alternating with

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.240 
like the rose and then alternating with
a<00:00:27.360> different<00:00:27.689> color<00:00:27.899> this<00:00:28.590> will<00:00:28.770> actually<00:00:29.130> be

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
a different color this will actually be

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.889 
a different color this will actually be
mixing<00:00:29.700> the<00:00:29.849> colors<00:00:30.149> a<00:00:30.180> little<00:00:30.360> more<00:00:30.630> it

00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:30.899 
mixing the colors a little more it

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:32.780 
mixing the colors a little more it
requires<00:00:31.200> a<00:00:31.290> bit<00:00:31.619> more<00:00:31.829> attention<00:00:31.950> to<00:00:32.309> detail

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
requires a bit more attention to detail

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.810 
requires a bit more attention to detail
but<00:00:33.059> it's<00:00:33.540> really<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.110> same<00:00:34.380> procedure<00:00:34.950> so

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
but it's really the same procedure so

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.140 
but it's really the same procedure so
let's<00:00:36.030> get<00:00:36.180> started

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
let's get started

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.390 
let's get started
as<00:00:39.150> you<00:00:39.810> can<00:00:40.020> see<00:00:40.230> I've<00:00:40.530> used<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.130> same

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
as you can see I've used the same

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.700 
as you can see I've used the same
technique<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:42.450> laying<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.930> foundation<00:00:43.560> in

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
technique for laying the foundation in

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.700 
technique for laying the foundation in
the<00:00:43.740> front<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.220> the<00:00:44.490> flip-flop<00:00:45.120> as<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:46.050> used<00:00:46.380> in

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the front of the flip-flop as we used in

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.800 
the front of the flip-flop as we used in
the<00:00:46.800> second<00:00:47.190> video<00:00:47.280> which<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.450> video

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
the second video which was the video

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.350 
the second video which was the video
about<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.579> Swarovski<00:00:50.579> crystal<00:00:50.970> flip-flops

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
about the Swarovski crystal flip-flops

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.870 
about the Swarovski crystal flip-flops
with<00:00:51.540> Rose<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.280> want<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.489> go<00:00:53.579> ahead<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
with Rose so you want to go ahead and

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.610 
with Rose so you want to go ahead and
lay<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.060> foundation<00:00:54.450> because<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.470> is

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
lay that foundation because this is

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.350 
lay that foundation because this is
really<00:00:55.860> going<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.370> determine<00:00:56.520> how<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.060> rest

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
really going to determine how the rest

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.470 
really going to determine how the rest
of<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.600> turns<00:00:57.810> out<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.860> as<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.400> can<00:00:59.550> see<00:00:59.610> right

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
of it turns out so as you can see right

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.380 
of it turns out so as you can see right
here<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.989> already<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.470> a<00:01:01.649> row<00:01:01.950> of<00:01:02.100> pink<00:01:02.460> so

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
here we already have a row of pink so

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.490 
here we already have a row of pink so
let's<00:01:03.630> go<00:01:03.780> ahead<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:05.420> start<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.170> I'm<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.440> to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
let's go ahead and start so I'm going to

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.640 
let's go ahead and start so I'm going to
add<00:01:07.650> another<00:01:08.070> pink<00:01:09.030> crystal<00:01:10.130> on<00:01:11.130> each<00:01:11.610> side

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
add another pink crystal on each side

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.230 
add another pink crystal on each side
and<00:01:13.650> then<00:01:13.800> let's<00:01:14.010> go<00:01:14.159> ahead<00:01:14.190> and<00:01:14.580> pick<00:01:14.790> up<00:01:14.970> a

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
and then let's go ahead and pick up a

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.190 
and then let's go ahead and pick up a
clear<00:01:15.900> crystal<00:01:16.380> here<00:01:17.659> and<00:01:18.659> we'll<00:01:18.840> put<00:01:19.020> that

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
clear crystal here and we'll put that

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.980 
clear crystal here and we'll put that
right<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:20.010> the<00:01:20.100> middle<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.630> then<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.780> want<00:01:21.960> to

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
right in the middle and then you want to

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:40.230 
right in the middle and then you want to
put<00:01:22.170> three<00:01:22.560> crystals<00:01:23.190> along<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.820> top

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.570 

of<00:01:40.660> course<00:01:40.900> you<00:01:41.050> should<00:01:41.230> be<00:01:41.260> doing<00:01:41.620> this<00:01:41.800> while

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
of course you should be doing this while

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.610 
of course you should be doing this while
the<00:01:42.730> flip-flop<00:01:43.120> is<00:01:43.300> facing<00:01:43.690> you<00:01:43.810> not<00:01:44.110> away

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
the flip-flop is facing you not away

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.150 
the flip-flop is facing you not away
from<00:01:44.830> you<00:01:44.950> like<00:01:45.100> I'm<00:01:45.310> doing<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.920> next

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
from you like I'm doing the next

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.010 
from you like I'm doing the next
technique<00:01:48.580> we're<00:01:49.030> going<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.390> discuss<00:01:49.750> it's

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
technique we're going to discuss it's

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.750 
technique we're going to discuss it's
actually<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.470> same<00:01:50.650> technique<00:01:51.160> it's<00:01:51.430> just<00:01:51.670> a

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
actually the same technique it's just a

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.940 
actually the same technique it's just a
little<00:01:51.970> variation<00:01:52.270> actually<00:01:52.930> probably<00:01:53.740> most

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
little variation actually probably most

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.430 
little variation actually probably most
of<00:01:54.070> you<00:01:54.280> will<00:01:54.520> like<00:01:54.700> this<00:01:54.880> one<00:01:54.940> better<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:56.320> can

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
of you will like this one better you can

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.050 
of you will like this one better you can
see<00:01:56.590> I've<00:01:56.680> actually<00:01:56.860> already<00:01:57.160> done<00:01:57.370> the<00:01:57.790> first

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
see I've actually already done the first

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.450 
see I've actually already done the first
two<00:01:58.390> blocks<00:01:58.780> this<00:01:59.530> actually<00:01:59.920> makes<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.250> block

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
two blocks this actually makes the block

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.690 
two blocks this actually makes the block
technique<00:02:00.850> easier<00:02:01.240> to<00:02:01.390> see<00:02:01.600> so<00:02:02.440> you<00:02:03.220> start<00:02:03.520> off

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
technique easier to see so you start off

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.400 
technique easier to see so you start off
with<00:02:03.760> your<00:02:04.320> traditional<00:02:06.750> start<00:02:07.750> that<00:02:08.289> you

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
with your traditional start that you

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.340 
with your traditional start that you
would<00:02:08.619> for<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:08.830> rows<00:02:09.100> but<00:02:09.850> then<00:02:10.030> you<00:02:10.509> do<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:11.050> row

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
would for the rows but then you do a row

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.220 
would for the rows but then you do a row
of<00:02:11.500> clear<00:02:11.770> crystals<00:02:12.220> three<00:02:12.520> across<00:02:13.080> then<00:02:14.080> you

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
of clear crystals three across then you

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.729 
of clear crystals three across then you
do

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
do

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.750 
do
clear<00:02:15.010> color<00:02:15.610> clear<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:17.160> then<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:18.610> do

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
clear color clear and then you do

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.320 
clear color clear and then you do
another<00:02:19.060> row<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.810> three<00:02:20.260> that's<00:02:20.410> clear<00:02:20.739> and

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
another row of three that's clear and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.090 
another row of three that's clear and
then<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.690> very<00:02:22.870> next<00:02:23.080> block<00:02:23.410> we've<00:02:23.650> done<00:02:23.890> a

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
then the very next block we've done a

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.500 
then the very next block we've done a
row<00:02:24.400> that's<00:02:24.810> one<00:02:25.810> row<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.200> color<00:02:26.730> then<00:02:27.730> color

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
row that's one row of color then color

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.490 
row that's one row of color then color
clear<00:02:29.380> color<00:02:30.090> then<00:02:31.090> three<00:02:31.570> color<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.380> these

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
clear color then three color so these

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.470 
clear color then three color so these
are<00:02:32.680> real<00:02:33.010> blocks<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.670> can<00:02:33.850> see<00:02:34.060> them<00:02:34.209> start

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
are real blocks you can see them start

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.540 
are real blocks you can see them start
to<00:02:34.540> build<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.470> I'll<00:02:35.560> go<00:02:35.739> ahead<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.070> do<00:02:36.280> the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
to build and I'll go ahead and do the

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.199 
to build and I'll go ahead and do the
next<00:02:36.580> row<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:37.930> this<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.350> going<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.650> be<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:39.100> row<00:02:39.880> of

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
next row so this is going to be a row of

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:52.180 
next row so this is going to be a row of
clear<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.760> we'll<00:02:45.880> put<00:02:46.060> three<00:02:46.450> clear<00:02:46.750> across

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.360 

and<00:02:52.700> actually<00:02:53.000> this<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:54.140> blocks<00:02:54.740> will<00:02:55.010> start

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
and actually this the blocks will start

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.150 
and actually this the blocks will start
to<00:02:56.110> straighten<00:02:57.110> up<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.260> further<00:02:57.620> along<00:02:57.950> you

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
to straighten up the further along you

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.070 
to straighten up the further along you
get<00:02:58.400> on<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.760> strap<00:02:59.090> obviously<00:02:59.840> when<00:02:59.990> you're

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
get on the strap obviously when you're

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.060 
get on the strap obviously when you're
down<00:03:00.410> here<00:03:00.920> placing<00:03:01.700> them<00:03:02.770> they<00:03:03.770> don't<00:03:03.950> look

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
down here placing them they don't look

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.220 
down here placing them they don't look
crooked<00:03:04.370> but<00:03:04.880> they're<00:03:05.120> definitely<00:03:05.270> slanted<00:03:06.140> a

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
crooked but they're definitely slanted a

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.080 
crooked but they're definitely slanted a
little<00:03:06.470> bit<00:03:06.620> because<00:03:07.040> this<00:03:07.370> is<00:03:07.490> not<00:03:07.670> perfectly

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
little bit because this is not perfectly

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.030 
little bit because this is not perfectly
straight<00:03:08.240> you<00:03:09.140> could<00:03:09.320> always<00:03:09.440> do<00:03:09.680> something

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
straight you could always do something

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.970 
straight you could always do something
different<00:03:10.520> in<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.960> front<00:03:12.290> if<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.710> want<00:03:12.890> to

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
different in the front if you want to

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.100 
different in the front if you want to
make<00:03:13.100> it<00:03:13.280> straighter<00:03:13.580> but<00:03:14.000> personally<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:14.930> like

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
make it straighter but personally I like

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.590 
make it straighter but personally I like
it<00:03:15.470> because<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.890> goes<00:03:16.070> with<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.640> natural

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
it because it goes with the natural

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.190 
it because it goes with the natural
shape<00:03:18.410> of<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.620> strap<00:03:19.600> so<00:03:20.600> let's<00:03:20.780> go<00:03:20.930> ahead<00:03:21.050> and

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
shape of the strap so let's go ahead and

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.920 
shape of the strap so let's go ahead and
put<00:03:21.620> in<00:03:21.710> our<00:03:21.860> clear<00:03:22.190> middle<00:03:22.490> crystal<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:23.270> then

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
put in our clear middle crystal and then

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.110 
put in our clear middle crystal and then
we'll<00:03:24.020> surround<00:03:24.410> that<00:03:24.500> with<00:03:26.050> two<00:03:27.050> clear<00:03:29.560> and

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
we'll surround that with two clear and

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:39.390 
we'll surround that with two clear and
then<00:03:32.120> three<00:03:32.420> clear<00:03:32.690> across<00:03:33.020> the<00:03:33.080> top

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.309 

and<00:03:39.940> again<00:03:40.180> this<00:03:40.330> is<00:03:40.510> much<00:03:40.720> easier<00:03:41.110> when

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
and again this is much easier when

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:48.690 
and again this is much easier when
you're<00:03:41.470> doing<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.280> flip-flop<00:03:42.849> facing<00:03:43.239> you<00:03:47.700> so

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
you're doing the flip-flop facing you so

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.890 
you're doing the flip-flop facing you so
you<00:03:48.760> just<00:03:48.849> want<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.150> make<00:03:49.269> sure<00:03:49.299> that<00:03:49.659> your

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
you just want to make sure that your

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.949 
you just want to make sure that your
work<00:03:50.620> is<00:03:50.860> pretty<00:03:51.099> neat<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:55.030> as<00:03:55.299> you<00:03:55.450> can<00:03:55.569> see<00:03:55.780> we

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
work is pretty neat so as you can see we

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:04.000 
work is pretty neat so as you can see we
have<00:03:56.140> three<00:03:57.060> blocks<00:03:58.060> right<00:03:58.360> now

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.119 

let's<00:04:04.610> go<00:04:04.760> ahead<00:04:04.879> and<00:04:05.060> add<00:04:05.360> a<00:04:05.720> color-block<00:04:06.290> we

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
let's go ahead and add a color-block we

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.280 
let's go ahead and add a color-block we
just<00:04:07.340> added<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:07.730> clear<00:04:07.970> block<00:04:08.239> let's<00:04:08.629> add<00:04:08.780> one

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
just added the clear block let's add one

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.619 
just added the clear block let's add one
with<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.830> pink<00:04:10.069> crystals<00:04:10.360> so<00:04:11.360> we'll<00:04:11.450> do<00:04:11.599> a

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
with the pink crystals so we'll do a

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:17.310 
with the pink crystals so we'll do a
layer<00:04:12.019> or<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.799> row<00:04:13.129> of<00:04:13.459> three<00:04:13.640> pink<00:04:14.269> crystals

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.909 

and<00:04:18.820> then<00:04:19.820> we'll<00:04:20.180> add<00:04:20.389> our<00:04:20.419> clear<00:04:21.260> crystal<00:04:21.739> in

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
and then we'll add our clear crystal in

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.710 
and then we'll add our clear crystal in
the<00:04:22.040> middle<00:04:22.310> of<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.520> second<00:04:22.850> row<00:04:22.970> then<00:04:23.690> the

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
the middle of the second row then the

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.340 
the middle of the second row then the
two<00:04:24.580> pink<00:04:25.580> on<00:04:25.910> each<00:04:26.330> side<00:04:26.540> of<00:04:26.570> it<00:04:28.690> then<00:04:29.690> one<00:04:30.050> row

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
two pink on each side of it then one row

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:38.980 
two pink on each side of it then one row
of<00:04:31.190> pink<00:04:31.580> crystals<00:04:36.460> and<00:04:37.460> after<00:04:37.880> each<00:04:38.210> block<00:04:38.630> or

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
of pink crystals and after each block or

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.070 
of pink crystals and after each block or
square<00:04:39.320> you<00:04:39.650> really<00:04:39.889> want<00:04:40.039> to<00:04:40.100> make<00:04:40.220> sure<00:04:40.400> that

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
square you really want to make sure that

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.100 
square you really want to make sure that
all<00:04:42.080> of<00:04:42.289> your<00:04:42.410> crystals<00:04:42.979> are<00:04:43.130> in<00:04:43.220> alignment<00:04:44.110> so

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
all of your crystals are in alignment so

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.939 
all of your crystals are in alignment so
now<00:04:45.260> is<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:45.680> time<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:46.010> shift<00:04:46.220> them<00:04:46.460> not<00:04:47.270> later

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
now is the time to shift them not later

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:55.120 
now is the time to shift them not later
so<00:04:48.949> as<00:04:49.310> you<00:04:50.300> can<00:04:50.419> see<00:04:53.380> this<00:04:54.380> is<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.740> second

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
so as you can see this is the second

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.930 
so as you can see this is the second
technique<00:04:55.340> so<00:04:55.910> this<00:04:56.090> is<00:04:56.300> a<00:04:56.570> true<00:04:57.490> square<00:04:58.490> or

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
technique so this is a true square or

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.510 
technique so this is a true square or
block<00:04:59.240> it's<00:05:00.199> a<00:05:00.320> lot<00:05:00.560> easier<00:05:00.800> to<00:05:01.070> see<00:05:01.340> that

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
block it's a lot easier to see that

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.060 
block it's a lot easier to see that
that's<00:05:01.699> what<00:05:01.850> it<00:05:02.060> is<00:05:02.090> in<00:05:02.740> this<00:05:03.740> particular

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
that's what it is in this particular

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.010 
that's what it is in this particular
video<00:05:07.090> so<00:05:08.090> I'll<00:05:08.240> show<00:05:08.419> you<00:05:08.450> the<00:05:08.570> other<00:05:08.750> side

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
video so I'll show you the other side

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.100 
video so I'll show you the other side
too<00:05:09.610> this<00:05:10.610> is<00:05:10.760> some<00:05:11.120> work<00:05:11.300> this<00:05:11.599> is<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:11.900> same

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
too this is some work this is the same

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.159 
too this is some work this is the same
technique<00:05:12.620> it's<00:05:13.010> just<00:05:13.340> not<00:05:13.490> changing<00:05:14.330> color<00:05:14.990> I

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
technique it's just not changing color I

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.290 
technique it's just not changing color I
