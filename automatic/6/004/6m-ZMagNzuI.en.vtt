00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
here match up very nicely with this

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.640 
here match up very nicely with this
plans<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:12.000> we're<00:01:12.180> simply<00:01:12.630> going<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.170> lay<00:01:13.500> it

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
plans so we're simply going to lay it

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.830 
plans so we're simply going to lay it
down<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:14.159> place<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.850> match<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.170> holes<00:01:16.409> up<00:01:16.710> and

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
down in place and match the holes up and

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:33.700 
down in place and match the holes up and
remember<00:01:18.840> our<00:01:18.869> spacer<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.920> here

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.380 

note<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.100> hole<00:01:35.370> should<00:01:35.790> line<00:01:36.120> up<00:01:38.390> all

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
note that the hole should line up all

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.470 
note that the hole should line up all
the<00:01:39.450> way<00:01:39.720> into<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.200> top<00:01:40.440> of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.650> box<00:01:41.480> note

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
the way into the top of the box note

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.560 
the way into the top of the box note
again<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:44.430> three<00:01:44.730> rivets<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.240> need<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.510> be

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
again the three rivets that need to be

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.170 
again the three rivets that need to be
pulled<00:01:45.960> first<00:01:46.380> when<00:01:46.830> we<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.160> rivet<00:01:47.550> because

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
pulled first when we go to rivet because

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.270 
pulled first when we go to rivet because
this<00:01:48.420> part<00:01:48.720> would<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.230> the<00:01:49.350> way<00:01:49.590> if<00:01:50.220> we

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
this part would be in the way if we

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.730 
this part would be in the way if we
waited<00:01:50.790> too<00:01:51.180> long<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.600> we<00:01:54.750> need<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.110> up<00:01:55.350> drill

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
waited too long so we need to up drill

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.920 
waited too long so we need to up drill
to<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.160> final<00:01:56.490> rivet<00:01:56.790> size<00:01:57.030> where<00:01:57.600> all<00:01:57.720> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
to the final rivet size where all the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.950 
to the final rivet size where all the
holes<00:01:58.140> line<00:01:58.560> up<00:02:01.970> then<00:02:02.970> eventually<00:02:03.300> we'll<00:02:03.810> get

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
holes line up then eventually we'll get

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.110 
holes line up then eventually we'll get
the<00:02:04.140> other<00:02:04.260> half<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.980> the<00:02:05.070> fuselage<00:02:05.550> in<00:02:05.820> place

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
the other half of the fuselage in place

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.370 
the other half of the fuselage in place
as<00:02:06.690> if<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.820> will<00:02:09.000> work<00:02:09.179> out<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.869> same<00:02:10.140> way

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
as if as it will work out the same way

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.660 
as if as it will work out the same way
as<00:02:10.710> far<00:02:11.010> as<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.720> rivet<00:02:12.720> connections<00:02:13.610> now<00:02:14.610> we

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
as far as the rivet connections now we

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.690 
as far as the rivet connections now we
