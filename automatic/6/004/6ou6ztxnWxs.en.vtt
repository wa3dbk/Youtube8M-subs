four<00:02:37.650> go<00:02:37.769> across<00:02:37.980> in<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.400> lake<00:02:38.550> up<00:02:38.730> north<00:02:39.000> if

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
four go across in the lake up north if

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.630 
four go across in the lake up north if
there<00:02:39.390> isn't<00:02:39.630> too<00:02:39.750> much<00:02:39.900> slush<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.620> picked<00:02:41.489> up

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
there isn't too much slush I picked up

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.550 
there isn't too much slush I picked up
an<00:02:41.790> old<00:02:41.880> snowmobile<00:02:42.510> pretty<00:02:43.049> excited<00:02:43.500> about

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
an old snowmobile pretty excited about

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.590 
an old snowmobile pretty excited about
that<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.069> I<00:02:44.160> guess<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.459> be<00:02:44.549> a<00:02:44.580> very<00:02:44.850> long<00:02:45.150> haul

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
that and I guess to be a very long haul

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.900 
that and I guess to be a very long haul
across<00:02:46.019> there<00:02:46.290> when<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.560> snow<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.370> deep<00:02:47.700> and

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
across there when the snow is deep and

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.430 
across there when the snow is deep and
if<00:02:48.000> there<00:02:48.150> isn't<00:02:48.390> much<00:02:48.540> slush<00:02:48.840> it'd<00:02:49.140> only<00:02:49.260> take

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
if there isn't much slush it'd only take

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.809 
if there isn't much slush it'd only take
a<00:02:49.590> couple<00:02:49.860> minutes<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.220> get<00:02:50.370> across<00:02:50.580> this

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
a couple minutes to get across this

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.449 
a couple minutes to get across this
snowmobile<00:02:51.680> all<00:02:52.680> right<00:02:52.890> everyone<00:02:53.280> well
