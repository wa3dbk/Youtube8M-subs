 Hi I knew that your wine channel is 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.189
 today I will continue the series of 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.439
 videos about the producer countries of 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.779
 wine and its regions 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.000
 Today I'm going to talk about burgundy to burgundy. 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.090
 known for the complexity of its 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.430
 soils and consequently the complexity 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.680
 of many of their nests 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.030
 good weather in the burgundy region a 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.640
 famous 8 80 is very hot in summer and 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.180
 very cold in winter what we people 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.539
 also calls continental climate help 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.260
 the most prominent in this region is with 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.270
 sure for the air the key of the nec 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.430
 agamemnon the burgundy region is 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.329
 northeast in france 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.329
 take a look at the map 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.320
 if you still have not seen the word 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.840
 charle one day you go is the name of a 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.130
 subregion and the name of the wine that 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.880
 of this sub-region 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.370
 It is a fairly dry white wine. 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.820
 refreshing notes of apple produced 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:27.960
 100% as target found right and that is a pair 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.050
 perfect for oysters and seafood in 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.510
 General also supports in Burgundy that the 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.420
 Worth not finding your house wines 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.940
 produced with this burgundy grape and 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.119
 are complex wines that are wines that 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.240
 need time to mature in 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.850
 they present spice notes of 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.910
 red fruit mushroom 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.170
 but it is not the type of wine for 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.340
 hurry up 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.619
 This wine needs a time to 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.660
 mature and show what you've come for now 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.759
 south of Burgundy we have a 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.149
 region called bulge there is a region 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.030
 produce wines that are easier to 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.250
 to be drunk less complex 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.610
 you find xardonÃ© we meet pinola 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.030
 but there is some gamek ink that 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.790
 produces most of these wines is a 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.040
 grape that generates wines like I said is more 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.650
 easy to drink and are wines 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.600
 excellent for summer is the kind of 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.940
 red wine you can put there in the 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.040
 cooler take it more fresh with 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.290
 sure is a good request 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.709
 There's a lot more to talk about in Burgundy. 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.600
 it's just brushstrokes basic version 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.060
 I think to start for you to have a 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.180
 idea of â€‹â€‹what burgundy is and it's already cool 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.349
 Burgundy wines are wines like me 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.150
 said very stylish is not think not 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.430
 I think you 'll find somewhere 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.090
 bargain when you see one come to 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.000
 burgundy and they are wine a little bit 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.130
 more expensive but if you have to order 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.330
 save a little more to take 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.240
 a nice wine 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.290
 it's worth spending a little more 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.959
 buy coming 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.200

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:31.290

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:35.340

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.620
 when did you go to buy it because at 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.560
 Sometimes opening a wine of your own 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:48.319
 before the maturation time of it can 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.319
 be a little is
