00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the pads you know and I think when the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.020 
the pads you know and I think when the
shoulder<00:00:40.800> pads<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> lot<00:00:41.340> people<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.940> know

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
shoulder pads on a lot people you know

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.180 
shoulder pads on a lot people you know
tend<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.390> go<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:43.230> feel<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> lot<00:00:43.770> more<00:00:43.800> safe

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
tend to go just feel a lot more safe

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.540 
tend to go just feel a lot more safe
about<00:00:44.489> going<00:00:44.700> hard<00:00:44.910> competing<00:00:46.309> coach<00:00:47.309> more

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
about going hard competing coach more

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.680 
about going hard competing coach more
tries<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.000> make<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.300> hostile<00:00:48.660> environment

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
tries to make it a hostile environment

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.610 
tries to make it a hostile environment
and<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:50.180> guess<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.300> could<00:00:51.329> say<00:00:51.629> full<00:00:52.410> pads

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
and so I guess you could say full pads

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.590 
and so I guess you could say full pads
almost<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.370> mean<00:00:53.820> as<00:00:54.030> though<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.480> attitude

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
almost I mean as though is the attitude

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.139 
almost I mean as though is the attitude
we<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:55.079> well<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.829> know<00:00:56.070> you'll<00:00:56.399> go<00:00:56.579> full<00:00:56.850> pads
