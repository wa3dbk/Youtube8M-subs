00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
this universe mode so again that is much

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.740 
this universe mode so again that is much
appreciated<00:00:31.730> but<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:33.000> off<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.149> feedback

you<00:00:33.780> guys<00:00:34.170> left<00:00:34.469> me<00:00:34.680> on<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.070> first<00:00:35.280> video

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
you guys left me on that first video

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.370 
you guys left me on that first video
it's<00:00:36.180> kind<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.480> hard<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> know<00:00:37.020> what<00:00:37.230> exactly

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
it's kind of hard to know what exactly

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.369 
it's kind of hard to know what exactly
is<00:00:38.100> best<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.879> do<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.329> terms<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.750> universe<00:00:40.110> mode

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
is best to do in terms of universe mode

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.810 
is best to do in terms of universe mode
on<00:00:40.590> 2k14

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
on 2k14

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.180 
on 2k14
just<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.690> pure<00:00:42.960> amount<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.500> different<00:00:43.829> ideas

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
just the pure amount of different ideas

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.970 
just the pure amount of different ideas
and<00:00:44.460> different<00:00:44.539> requests<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.870> terms<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.710> shows

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
and different requests in terms of shows

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.049 
and different requests in terms of shows
and<00:00:47.190> stuff<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:47.520> that

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and stuff like that

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.500 
and stuff like that
I<00:00:48.090> think<00:00:48.899> WCW<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.860> ECW<00:00:49.980> were<00:00:50.730> both<00:00:50.969> really

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
I think WCW and ECW were both really

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.689 
I think WCW and ECW were both really
really<00:00:51.629> popular<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.890> more<00:00:53.070> than<00:00:53.219> likely<00:00:53.250> I

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
really popular and more than likely I

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.220 
really popular and more than likely I
would<00:00:53.879> definitely<00:00:54.360> do<00:00:54.510> one<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.750> those<00:00:54.870> shows

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
would definitely do one of those shows

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.860 
would definitely do one of those shows
down<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.860> line<00:00:56.039> but<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:56.940> terms<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.449> actually

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
down the line but in terms of actually

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.110 
down the line but in terms of actually
getting<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.170> universe<00:00:58.559> mode<00:00:58.829> going<00:00:59.190> as<00:00:59.340> soon<00:01:00.000> as

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
getting a universe mode going as soon as

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.849 
getting a universe mode going as soon as
I<00:01:00.210> get<00:01:00.329> my<00:01:00.420> hands<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.899> game<00:01:01.140> obviously

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
I get my hands in the game obviously

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.100 
I get my hands in the game obviously
guys<00:01:02.219> keep<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.760> mind<00:01:02.969> there<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.570> not<00:01:03.780> gonna<00:01:03.899> be

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
guys keep in mind there is not gonna be

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.370 
guys keep in mind there is not gonna be
any<00:01:04.379> craters<00:01:05.250> available<00:01:05.909> I'm<00:01:06.869> gonna<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.229> to

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
any craters available I'm gonna have to

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.380 
any craters available I'm gonna have to
start<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.860> universe<00:01:08.280> boat<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.729> bit<00:01:09.030> like<00:01:09.210> last

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
start this universe boat a bit like last

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.080 
start this universe boat a bit like last
time<00:01:09.720> we're<00:01:10.439> much<00:01:10.650> more<00:01:10.860> basic<00:01:11.159> universe<00:01:11.820> mode

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
time we're much more basic universe mode

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.770 
time we're much more basic universe mode
and<00:01:12.360> then<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:12.990> change<00:01:13.290> as<00:01:13.590> things<00:01:13.890> go<00:01:14.130> on

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
and then we can change as things go on

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.820 
and then we can change as things go on
so<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.810> think<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.320> start<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> universe

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
so I think the start of the universe

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.070 
so I think the start of the universe
mode<00:01:17.400> derived<00:01:17.939> from<00:01:18.000> off<00:01:18.119> your<00:01:18.270> feedback<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
mode derived from off your feedback and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.499 
mode derived from off your feedback and
trying<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.040> please<00:01:20.430> as<00:01:20.729> many<00:01:20.970> people<00:01:21.420> as

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
trying to please as many people as

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.440 
trying to please as many people as
possible<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:22.259> think<00:01:22.560> I'm<00:01:23.460> gonna<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.880> doing<00:01:24.240> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
possible I think I'm gonna be doing a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.620 
possible I think I'm gonna be doing a
ruthless<00:01:25.380> aggression<00:01:25.820> ARRIRAW<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.090> then<00:01:27.600> a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
ruthless aggression ARRIRAW and then a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.770 
ruthless aggression ARRIRAW and then a
current<00:01:28.110> date<00:01:28.290> roster<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.009> Smackdown<00:01:29.640> like<00:01:30.630> I

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
current date roster on Smackdown like I

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.319 
current date roster on Smackdown like I
said<00:01:31.170> I'll<00:01:31.560> likely<00:01:31.920> change<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.520> up<00:01:32.640> as<00:01:32.880> cause

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
said I'll likely change it up as cause

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.270 
said I'll likely change it up as cause
come<00:01:33.600> out<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.900> as<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.110> game<00:01:34.290> progresses<00:01:34.799> and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
come out and as the game progresses and

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.420 
come out and as the game progresses and
probably<00:01:36.240> end<00:01:36.360> up<00:01:36.420> doing<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.869> full-fledged<00:01:37.619> ECW

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
probably end up doing a full-fledged ECW

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.640 
probably end up doing a full-fledged ECW
show<00:01:38.640> like<00:01:39.270> I've<00:01:39.420> done<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:39.689> 12<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:39.990> 13

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
show like I've done on 12 and 13

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.770 
show like I've done on 12 and 13
but<00:01:41.130> again<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:41.820> keeping<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.299> mind<00:01:42.479> it's

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
but again just keeping in mind it's

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.929 
but again just keeping in mind it's
gonna<00:01:42.840> take<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> while<00:01:43.470> for<00:01:43.710> any<00:01:44.189> cause<00:01:44.579> or<00:01:44.610> at

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
gonna take a while for any cause or at

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.999 
gonna take a while for any cause or at
least<00:01:45.090> any<00:01:45.299> good<00:01:45.540> cause<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.500> become<00:01:46.649> available

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
least any good cause to become available

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.789 
least any good cause to become available
in<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.210> meantime<00:01:48.450> I'm<00:01:48.930> going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.290> doing<00:01:49.500> an

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
in the meantime I'm going to be doing an

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.550 
in the meantime I'm going to be doing an
extreme<00:01:50.610> division<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.479> one<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:51.990> those<00:01:52.170> shows

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
will be to add just one or two of the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.949
