look different but it also looks very

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.710 
look different but it also looks very
similar<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.710> that's<00:02:08.459> really<00:02:08.789> all<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.149> saw<00:02:09.539> that

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
similar so that's really all I saw that

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.570 
similar so that's really all I saw that
looked<00:02:09.989> similar<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.500> follow<00:02:10.800> 3<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.250> mean<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
looked similar to follow 3 I mean the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.730 
looked similar to follow 3 I mean the
gameplay

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
gameplay

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.250 
gameplay
for<00:02:12.980> follow<00:02:13.460> for<00:02:13.820> combat<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.690> everything<00:02:15.140> it

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
for follow for combat and everything it

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.920 
for follow for combat and everything it
looks<00:02:15.290> better<00:02:16.160> than<00:02:16.520> fallout<00:02:16.820> 3<00:02:17.210> you<00:02:17.660> know<00:02:17.750> it

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
looks better than fallout 3 you know it

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.560 
looks better than fallout 3 you know it
looks<00:02:17.990> it<00:02:18.410> looks<00:02:19.040> like<00:02:19.610> fall<00:02:19.910> of<00:02:20.060> four<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.480> it

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
looks it looks like fall of four and it

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.710 
looks it looks like fall of four and it
doesn't<00:02:20.900> look<00:02:20.930> anything<00:02:21.380> like<00:02:21.560> fallout<00:02:22.250> 3<00:02:22.760> so

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
doesn't look anything like fallout 3 so

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.840 
doesn't look anything like fallout 3 so
the<00:02:24.080> only<00:02:24.290> thing<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:24.920> looked<00:02:25.160> like<00:02:25.370> fall<00:02:25.700> of

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
the only thing that looked like fall of

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.730 
the only thing that looked like fall of
three<00:02:26.090> was<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.480> lock-picking<00:02:26.840> in<00:02:27.410> the

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
three was the lock-picking in the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.640 
three was the lock-picking in the
terminal<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.610> even<00:02:29.500> didn't<00:02:30.500> look

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
terminal and that even didn't look

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.770 
terminal and that even didn't look
exactly<00:02:30.860> like<00:02:31.310> fallout<00:02:31.730> 3<00:02:32.030> looked<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.450> little

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
exactly like fallout 3 looked a little

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.500 
exactly like fallout 3 looked a little
bit<00:02:32.990> different<00:02:34.930> but<00:02:35.930> again<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:37.400> footage<00:02:38.210> was

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
bit different but again the footage was

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.200 
bit different but again the footage was
really<00:02:39.110> difficult<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.860> see<00:02:40.100> because<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:41.090> know

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
really difficult to see because you know

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.350 
really difficult to see because you know
again<00:02:41.960> the<00:02:42.020> guys<00:02:42.260> being<00:02:42.500> secret<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.640> didn't

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
again the guys being secret and didn't

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.960 
again the guys being secret and didn't
want<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.540> get<00:02:44.630> in<00:02:44.750> trouble<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:46.640> guys<00:02:46.730> can

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
want to get in trouble so you guys can

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.600 
want to get in trouble so you guys can
go<00:02:47.090> look<00:02:47.390> look<00:02:48.050> for<00:02:48.260> yourself<00:02:48.770> I<00:02:49.100> mean<00:02:49.370> it's

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
go look look for yourself I mean it's

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.540 
go look look for yourself I mean it's
it's<00:02:50.030> not<00:02:50.300> too<00:02:50.480> hard<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.810> find<00:02:51.250> I'm<00:02:52.250> not<00:02:52.400> going

it's not too hard to find I'm not going

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.760 
it's not too hard to find I'm not going
to<00:02:52.610> link<00:02:52.820> it<00:02:52.970> again<00:02:53.210> or<00:02:53.510> show<00:02:54.320> it<00:02:54.470> or<00:02:54.590> anything
