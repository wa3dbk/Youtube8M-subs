 hi how about i am triforce and here what 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.250
 I'm going to make a very, very fast video 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.770
 just to tell them how to surround themselves 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.190
 or how do you access root we enter a 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.750
 galaxy s3 if it does not matter if they have 4.1.2 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.710
 I encouraged you to update to the version 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.720
 they did while 422 works 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.880
 same way in both versions of the rom 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.279
 then they quickly need to play 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.279
 here s 3 must be downloaded 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.590
 mount a is already connected via usb 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:34.890
 to the computer you need software 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:36.840
 odin we are seeing everything there we are going to 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.079
 occupy a file on the pda button in 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:45.420
 this case is the file cf root sgs three 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.100
 6.4 versions and you can see it weighs 27 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.770
 megas has already decompressed we are going to because 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.870
 you are going to download a tablet 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.239
 obviously since they decompress it 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.430
 to generate this file point such with 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.070
 this weight then they choose him they put 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.770
 open as I told you is already connected the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.690
 galaxy s3 here simply puts you a 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.559
 start help him a couple of seconds 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.559
 only 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.979
 it did not happen even five seconds they were 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.710
 there ends up closing or if they want 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.549
 leave it open here disconnect and so 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.340
 of fast they already had root access in their 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:26.659
 samsung galaxy s3 device with geely 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.579
 well 4.1.2 bojan and well 4 2 2 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.170
 here it's going to restart and quickly 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.359
 I'm going to show that you already have the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.640
 supersur application that is what we 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:37.939
 grants root access on our samsung 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.079
 galaxy s3 and 9,300 as always these 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.450
 facts are going to be available in 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:45.140
 android mx dot net there in the post of 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.670
 update your samsung galaxy s3 to 422 goes 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.590
 to be there the rom to update and 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.409
 also going to be there the 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.909
 file to get the router 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.690
 I told them this is a team that 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.430
 lent 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.200
 to do the update to do it 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.300
 and ruth and so that you could see 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.380
 these videos 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.380
 let's go here eps 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.619
 and there is the icon that gives us the 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.310
 root access that is the supersur 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.990
 we count 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.070
 we can continue 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.070
 to update them 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.459
 and that was all that fast so 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.430
 simple so easy they have access 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.150
 root in android 4.2.2 and as I said 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.730
 It also works without any problem in 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.340

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.390
