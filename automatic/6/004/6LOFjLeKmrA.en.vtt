00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
and you can choose the rate of change of

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.960 
and you can choose the rate of change of
time<00:01:59.320> of<00:01:59.440> day<00:01:59.590> so<00:02:00.100> you<00:02:00.190> can<00:02:00.220> say<00:02:00.490> I<00:02:00.520> wanted<00:02:00.909> to

time of day so you can say I wanted to

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.430 
time of day so you can say I wanted to
change<00:02:01.120> it<00:02:01.270> in<00:02:01.390> real<00:02:01.570> time<00:02:01.840> that'll<00:02:02.320> take

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
change it in real time that'll take

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.500 
change it in real time that'll take
forever<00:02:02.590> but<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.400> can<00:02:03.490> obviously<00:02:03.640> say<00:02:03.850> 20<00:02:04.270> x

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
forever but you can obviously say 20 x

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.120 
forever but you can obviously say 20 x
30<00:02:04.720> x<00:02:04.900> or<00:02:05.290> whatever<00:02:05.530> sort<00:02:05.710> of<00:02:05.800> speed<00:02:05.950> you<00:02:06.070> want

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
30 x or whatever sort of speed you want

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.800 
30 x or whatever sort of speed you want
to<00:02:06.340> change<00:02:06.580> so<00:02:07.120> the<00:02:07.240> challenge<00:02:07.420> could<00:02:07.659> take

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
to change so the challenge could take

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.569 
to change so the challenge could take
place<00:02:07.990> over<00:02:08.229> five<00:02:08.409> minutes<00:02:08.590> half<00:02:09.280> of<00:02:09.459> it

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:09.579 
place over five minutes half of it

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.220 
place over five minutes half of it
you'll<00:02:09.700> be<00:02:09.819> in<00:02:09.909> their<00:02:10.060> time<00:02:10.239> half<00:02:10.749> of<00:02:10.959> B<00:02:11.079> and

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
compete in driveclub either solo or as

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.569 
compete in driveclub either solo or as
part<00:02:49.810> of<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:49.900> club<00:02:50.110> but<00:02:50.709> for<00:02:50.739> those<00:02:50.980> hardcore

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
part of a club but for those hardcore

part of a club but for those hardcore
gamers<00:02:51.910> who<00:02:52.000> really<00:02:52.329> want<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.599> kind<00:02:52.840> of

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
gamers who really want to kind of

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.229 
gamers who really want to kind of
pathetic<00:02:53.160> ever<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.250> milliseconds<00:02:54.489> the

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
pathetic ever of milliseconds the

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.940 
pathetic ever of milliseconds the
handler<00:02:55.540> model<00:02:55.780> has<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.079> depth<00:02:56.349> so<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:56.680> can

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
handler model has that depth so you can

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.580 
handler model has that depth so you can
trail<00:02:57.310> break<00:02:57.549> into<00:02:57.819> corners<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.930> can<00:02:59.170> apply

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
trail break into corners you can apply

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.020 
trail break into corners you can apply
the<00:02:59.709> opposite<00:03:00.069> lock<00:03:00.220> at<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.400> right<00:03:00.579> time<00:03:00.849> to

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
the opposite lock at the right time to

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.819 
the opposite lock at the right time to
control<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.540> drift<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.410> can<00:03:02.560> get<00:03:02.680> the

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
control the drift and you can get the

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.229 
control the drift and you can get the
most<00:03:03.040> out<00:03:03.250> of<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.370> as<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.489> simulation<00:03:04.030> as<00:03:04.120> well

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
most out of it as a simulation as well

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.640 
most out of it as a simulation as well
so<00:03:04.420> yes<00:03:04.569> it's<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:04.959> best<00:03:05.110> of<00:03:05.200> both<00:03:05.260> worlds

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
so yes it's the best of both worlds

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.339 
so yes it's the best of both worlds
hopefully<00:03:05.950> now<00:03:06.640> obviously<00:03:07.599> one<00:03:07.959> thing<00:03:08.200> the

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
hopefully now obviously one thing the

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:09.750 
hopefully now obviously one thing the
drive<00:03:08.530> club<00:03:08.709> is<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:09.010> club's<00:03:09.220> that's<00:03:09.670> the

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
drive club is the club's that's the

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.250 
drive club is the club's that's the
whole<00:03:09.910> point<00:03:10.150> how<00:03:10.540> many<00:03:10.720> people<00:03:10.870> can<00:03:11.079> join<00:03:11.200> a

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
whole point how many people can join a

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.930 
whole point how many people can join a
club<00:03:11.470> together<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:12.069> how<00:03:12.160> can<00:03:12.370> they<00:03:12.459> interact

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
club together and how can they interact

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.759 
club together and how can they interact
mean<00:03:13.209> what<00:03:13.360> if<00:03:13.480> you've<00:03:13.569> only<00:03:13.690> got<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:13.900> four

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
mean what if you've only got a four

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.380 
mean what if you've only got a four
friends<00:03:15.250> you<00:03:15.370> know<00:03:15.459> can<00:03:15.670> compute<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.269> rare

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
friends you know can compute a the rare

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.240 
friends you know can compute a the rare
so<00:03:16.540> can<00:03:16.660> you<00:03:16.750> compete<00:03:17.019> with<00:03:17.170> Jess<00:03:17.349> for<00:03:17.530> when

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
so can you compete with Jess for when

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.949 
so can you compete with Jess for when
the<00:03:18.310> limit<00:03:18.579> is<00:03:18.700> 12<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:19.329> also<00:03:19.569> the<00:03:19.660> minimums

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
the limit is 12 and also the minimums

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.530 
the limit is 12 and also the minimums
too<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:21.190> forward<00:03:21.459> but<00:03:21.579> yeah<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:22.420> doesn't

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
too so forward but yeah it doesn't

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.759 
too so forward but yeah it doesn't
really<00:03:22.750> matter<00:03:22.930> how<00:03:23.230> many<00:03:23.380> people<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:23.739> got

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769
