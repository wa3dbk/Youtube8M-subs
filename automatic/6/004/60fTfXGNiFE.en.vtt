about that but I think I need to get a
new<00:00:32.820> green<00:00:33.239> screen<00:00:33.630> cuz<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.680> one's<00:00:35.450> could

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
new green screen cuz that one's could

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.630 
new green screen cuz that one's could
have<00:00:36.540> state<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.020> I've<00:00:37.620> tried<00:00:38.190> iron<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.550> it

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640

have state of it I've tried iron in it
as<00:00:38.790> well<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:40.620> doesn't<00:00:40.829> really<00:00:40.890> make<00:00:41.070> a

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
as well but it doesn't really make a

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.430 
as well but it doesn't really make a
difference<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:42.030> probably<00:00:42.480> on<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> video<00:00:43.170> once

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440
