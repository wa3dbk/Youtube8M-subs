all<00:00:42.030> loaded<00:00:42.239> up<00:00:42.390> here<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.719> I'm<00:00:42.780> just<00:00:42.899> going<00:00:43.020> to

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
all loaded up here so I'm just going to

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.380 
all loaded up here so I'm just going to
lower<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.379> browser<00:00:43.620> mark<00:00:43.950> website<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:45.239> all

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
lower the browser mark website and all

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.889 
lower the browser mark website and all
three<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> devices<00:00:46.079> rather<00:00:46.410> quickly<00:00:47.899> so

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
three of the devices rather quickly so

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.100 
three of the devices rather quickly so
what<00:00:49.500> we're<00:00:49.590> going<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.800> do<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:51.110> obviously

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
what we're going to do is to obviously

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.930 
what we're going to do is to obviously
make<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.770> face<00:00:53.039> try<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.460> press<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> model

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
make it face try and press the model

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.970 
make it face try and press the model
ruffle<00:00:54.180> at<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.329> same<00:00:54.539> time<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.590> then<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.920> how

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
ruffle at the same time and then see how

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.540 
ruffle at the same time and then see how
we<00:00:56.010> get<00:00:56.280> some<00:00:56.489> with<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.989> so<00:00:57.989> here<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:58.949> go<00:00:59.250> it

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
we get some with that so here we go it

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.360 
we get some with that so here we go it
may<00:00:59.730> not<00:00:59.879> be<00:00:59.940> identical<00:01:00.930> but<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:02.070> doesn't

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
may not be identical but that doesn't

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.460 
may not be identical but that doesn't
really<00:01:02.489> matter<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.180> guess<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.989> try<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.350> do

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
really matter that I guess so try and do

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.929 
really matter that I guess so try and do
these<00:01:04.650> two<00:01:04.890> at<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.010> same<00:01:05.220> time<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:05.700> well<00:01:05.820> as

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
these two at the same time as well as

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:14.060 
these two at the same time as well as
this<00:01:06.090> one<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.470> one<00:01:07.979> two<00:01:11.119> three<00:01:12.950> think<00:01:13.950> I

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
this one here so one two three think I

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.490 
this one here so one two three think I
got<00:01:14.220> them<00:01:14.310> all<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> roof<00:01:14.760> at<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:14.970> same<00:01:15.180> time

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
got them all the roof at the same time

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.920 
got them all the roof at the same time
so<00:01:16.500> they're<00:01:16.650> all<00:01:16.830> off<00:01:17.009> now<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:18.540> I'm<00:01:18.630> over<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
so they're all off now so I'm over to

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.149 
so they're all off now so I'm over to
the<00:01:19.110> random<00:01:19.909> clean<00:01:20.909> dodgy<00:01:21.479> music<00:01:21.930> here<00:01:22.159> and

the random clean dodgy music here and

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.590 
the random clean dodgy music here and
we'll<00:01:23.340> catch<00:01:23.580> up<00:01:23.610> at<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> end<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.450> see
