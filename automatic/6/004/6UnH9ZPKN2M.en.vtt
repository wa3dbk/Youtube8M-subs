00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.009
 Hi, it's me and this is the stage 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.109
 Welcome to our restaurant 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.239
 our house we have just inaugurated now 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.599
 on July 1 and nothing if you want the 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:26.599
 consello 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.040
 this is for us born of a 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.680
 concept that basically what you intend 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.000
 it's a little bit about haute cuisine and 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.500
 broadcast through a restaurant 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.570
 our kitchen what for us is 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.610
 the proximity and the luxury not and that also 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.820
 responds a little bit to what is the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.129
 stage acronym that are days to smell 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.129
 savor surprise to grow and enjoy 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.870
 when you go to see a show or a 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.580
 movie movie you buy your ticket 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.380
 you arrive and you no longer worry about 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.820
 nothing else here the intention is a bit 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.100
 create this experience also that the 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.500
 client since entering the stage and 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.360
 have previously chosen their menu that 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.979
 have already done online we will have put 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.140
 in contact with him checked his 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.970
 allergies his hobbies his intolerances what 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.350
 that you do not like and we will try that from 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.869
 that come in so you have to worry about 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.640
 nothing we receive you at the bar and that only 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.140
 we have to ask you who is a 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.820
 cocktail that is a beer that you are a 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.800
 wine what do you want? 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.509
 you feel and you can start to 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.180
 appear people with food around here with 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.470
 snacks with different things also 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.090
 the possibility that in Navarre there 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.300
 chefs combining with the waiters 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.640
 or with the hoteliers to have a cocktail of 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.380
 stage with a top made by the cook 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.110
 and you're watching it jack on the spot with the 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.940
 stage team is roughly formed 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.509
 by 20 about 20 people or so 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.869
 between everything between kitchen room back 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.869
 office 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.990
 but fourth menu pass and over here 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.240
 us and we will give here other 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.890
 some snacks we will change too 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.180
 will be on hand sometimes be mouth to mouth 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.500
 Sometimes they are called 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.570
 we will try that they are already in a 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.070
 part in the bar now you come here and 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.830
 you are in the kitchen in direct contact and 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.150
 and then you would go to your table but everything 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.830
 this a very dynamic way too 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.300
 this is not a dictatorship if someone 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.740
 wants to go that I do not want to be there that 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.780
 I want to measure myself to the table comes to the 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.040
 table we want those tapas to come here 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.470
 in the middle of going there what 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.240
 We do is catch the finished dishes 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.220
 we end here and the client sees that 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.870
 we interact first not only with the 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.790
 vegetables with the plants that we grow 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.580
 here or that we care here but that 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.620
 also what we are doing 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.480
 it's a bit to give you one more experience 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.560
 alive and if the client gives us play because 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.140
 we do not tell someone two aids 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.350
 fun surprising a technique 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.180
 incredible good national product not 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.950
 we stop telling stories not with everything 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.610
 this 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.610
 he says patience 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.610
 university 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.439
 when they gave me the second star of 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.930
 gastronomy I wonder when how 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.730
 I saw myself in a few years and I 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.290
 saw happy I hope happy and cooking 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.209
 doing what I like this we do 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.829
 to enjoy with the client so that 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.709
 just enjoy the client or just us 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.209
 so that we all enjoy and so that 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.400
 Finally let's contribute something I think this is 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.409
 our granite today we want 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.790
 make many more granites but what to say 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.549
 that to this day I think that is what 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.530
 he asked us for the body we get out of 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.909
 guts and is what we want to do is a 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.829
 very strong greeting for all 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.500
 gastro-economy readers and that you 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:33.609
 we are waiting for everyone here at the stage 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.609
