Sunday the 11th of December and main
talking<00:00:06.930> point<00:00:07.410> today<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:08.040> around<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.000> area

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
talking point today is around the area

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.610 
talking point today is around the area
of<00:00:09.300> low<00:00:09.540> pressures<00:00:10.050> that<00:00:10.170> are<00:00:10.230> going<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.469> come

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
of low pressures that are going to come

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.749 
of low pressures that are going to come
across<00:00:10.710> this<00:00:11.010> during<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.340> course<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.670> this

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
across this during the course of this

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.910 
across this during the course of this
week<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.750> reason<00:00:12.929> for<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.469> basically

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
week and the reason for it is basically

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.440 
week and the reason for it is basically
that<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.190> jet<00:00:14.429> stream<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.940> over<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.210> top<00:00:15.269> of

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
that the jet stream is over the top of

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.210 
that the jet stream is over the top of
the<00:00:15.750> UK<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.199> it's<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.440> really<00:00:16.590> active<00:00:16.800> jet

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
the UK and it's a really active jet

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.890 
the UK and it's a really active jet
stream<00:00:17.490> we've<00:00:17.850> got<00:00:17.970> cold<00:00:18.210> air<00:00:18.359> coming<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.720> from

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
stream we've got cold air coming in from

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.359 
stream we've got cold air coming in from
the<00:00:18.960> poles<00:00:19.260> warm<00:00:19.650> air<00:00:19.830> coming<00:00:19.980> up<00:00:20.189> on<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
the poles warm air coming up on the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.099 
the poles warm air coming up on the
tropics<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.060> effect<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.900> to

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
tropics and the effect of this is to

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.050 
tropics and the effect of this is to
cause<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> very<00:00:22.529> narrow<00:00:22.920> channel<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.640> really

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
cause a very narrow channel of really

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.910 
cause a very narrow channel of really
strong<00:00:24.300> winds<00:00:24.600> scream<00:00:25.109> across<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.560> Atlantic

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
strong winds scream across the Atlantic

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.950 
strong winds scream across the Atlantic
and<00:00:26.099> bring<00:00:26.640> low-pressure<00:00:27.119> areas<00:00:27.539> interest

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
and bring low-pressure areas interest

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.439 
and bring low-pressure areas interest
also<00:00:28.529> we're<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> left<00:00:29.519> exit<00:00:29.820> region<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
also we're in a left exit region of the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.939 
also we're in a left exit region of the
jet<00:00:30.660> stream<00:00:30.779> which<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.380> an<00:00:31.650> area<00:00:31.890> of

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
jet stream which is an area of

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.100 
jet stream which is an area of
development<00:00:32.130> rapid<00:00:32.910> development<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:33.840> areas

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
development rapid development for areas

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.690 
development rapid development for areas
of<00:00:34.230> low<00:00:34.410> pressure<00:00:34.440> I'll<00:00:35.130> show<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.460> more<00:00:35.640> of

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
of low pressure I'll show you more of

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.190 
of low pressure I'll show you more of

things<00:00:56.460> love<00:00:56.670> building<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.149> Ridge<00:00:57.480> out

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
things love building this Ridge out

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.459 
things love building this Ridge out
towards<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.410> west<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> UK<00:00:59.460> now<00:01:00.469> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
towards the west of the UK now the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.799 
towards the west of the UK now the
models<00:01:01.829> again<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.460> think<00:01:02.640> are<00:01:03.090> having

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
models again I think are having

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.149 
models again I think are having
difficulty<00:01:04.290> dealing<00:01:04.500> with<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:04.860> what<00:01:05.129> I

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
difficulty dealing with it's what I

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.920 
difficulty dealing with it's what I
think's<00:01:05.640> happening<00:01:05.970> here<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.450> Ridge<00:01:06.750> is

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
think's happening here is this Ridge is

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.980 
think's happening here is this Ridge is
building<00:01:07.320> look<00:01:07.470> out<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:07.979> Atlantic<00:01:08.189> I

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
building look out in the Atlantic I

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.480 
building look out in the Atlantic I
suspect<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.170> Ridge<00:01:10.500> may<00:01:10.710> continue<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.310> try

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
suspect this Ridge may continue to try

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.330 
suspect this Ridge may continue to try
and<00:01:11.610> build<00:01:12.229> with<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> flow<00:01:13.680> coming<00:01:14.010> up<00:01:14.100> here

from<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> southwest<00:01:15.500> excuse<00:01:16.500> me<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.729> if

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
from the southwest excuse me so that if

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.999 
from the southwest excuse me so that if

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
northern parts of Russia we get our link

pie<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.409> sky<00:01:37.439> but<00:01:37.860> that's<00:01:38.130> where<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.400> can

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
pie in the sky but that's where I can

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.039 
pie in the sky but that's where I can
see<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:38.939> pattern<00:01:39.180> going<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.810> would

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
see this pattern going but I would

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.550 
see this pattern going but I would
stress<00:01:40.470> that's<00:01:41.070> not<00:01:41.430> backed<00:01:41.759> up<00:01:42.000> at<00:01:42.210> all<00:01:42.659> by

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
stress that's not backed up at all by

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.440 
stress that's not backed up at all by
the<00:01:43.590> models<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.430> there's<00:01:44.640> lots<00:01:44.970> going<00:01:45.090> out

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the models but there's lots going out

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.359 
the models but there's lots going out
and<00:01:45.689> at<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> moment<00:01:46.140> folks<00:01:46.530> there's<00:01:46.890> lots<00:01:47.189> of

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
and at the moment folks there's lots of

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.280 
and at the moment folks there's lots of
happenings<00:01:47.939> going<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.450> atmosphere<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.020> I

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
happenings going on the atmosphere and I

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.960 
happenings going on the atmosphere and I
think<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.560> models<00:01:49.950> are<00:01:50.040> actually<00:01:50.399> genuinely

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
think the models are actually genuinely

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.030 
think the models are actually genuinely
having<00:01:51.630> quite<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> bit<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.229> difficulty<00:01:52.590> being

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
having quite a bit of difficulty being

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.929 
having quite a bit of difficulty being
able<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.579> deal<00:01:53.790> with<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.000> um<00:01:55.340> okay<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.670> is

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
able to deal with it um okay this is

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.550 
able to deal with it um okay this is
from<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:58.579> ecmwf<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.060> ECMWF<00:02:00.750> model

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
from the ecmwf this is the ECMWF model

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.359 
from the ecmwf this is the ECMWF model
run<00:02:01.740> from<00:02:02.270> midnight<00:02:03.270> last<00:02:03.719> night<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.350> if<00:02:05.280> we

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
run from midnight last night and if we

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.440 
run from midnight last night and if we
take<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.670> through<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.939> days<00:02:06.119> there<00:02:06.360> in

take you through the days there in
24-hour<00:02:06.930> steps<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.560> is

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
24-hour steps so this is

all the models are going but I'm not
convinced<00:02:59.440> that's<00:03:00.100> what's<00:03:00.430> going<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.820> happen
