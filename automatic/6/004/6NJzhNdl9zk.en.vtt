00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.800
 After reading 'American Dreams' and developing my own idea of ​​who Riley is ... 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.800
 ... Yaani came in and I thought, "Send everyone else home, she's obviously Riley!". 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.100
 "What the hell ?! I thought I was bitten." 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.900
 "I know, it was kind of cool!" 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:39.200
 With Left Behind, we wanted to develop a DLC that would be as elaborate as the main campaign. 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:47.200
 In many ways, the narrative tension still surpasses the things we have done for the main campaign. 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.600
 There is definitely a greater focus on exploration, the combat-free gameplay. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.200
 The environment that Ellie and Riley discover is a shopping mall. 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.100
 It's like a playground of lost history. 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.000
 Additionally, it explores the question of what survivors would have done in this mall after the outbreak. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.600
 "I thought all the time, you were dead." 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.000
 "Yes." 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.600
 Riley was her first close friend, her first big relationship. 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.700
 Whether they want to see it or not, the truth is that they really need each other. 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.000
 When you play The Last of Us, you know what's going on with Riley. 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.700
 It is known throughout the DLC that obviously something will happen. 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.600
 It is one of the most formative experiences for Ellie. 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.800
 It is a real friendship. They mean a lot to each other. 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.000
 It is something like the one relationship they can count on. 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.600
 I think it's cool because you also get to know a more playful side of Ellie. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.900
 "When were we ever in danger?" 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.900
 There will be some extremely difficult fights. 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.500
 Some of these battles are meant to introduce new features that we have added to the combat system. 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.800
 "Multi-faction" battles mean that humans and infected people, ie the two enemy groups, ... 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.100
 ... can fight each other. 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.100
 You can play them against each other. You throw a bottle, whereupon an infected person kills a person. 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.000
 You lead an infected person to an enemy and get rid of him. 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.500
 We tried many new things and thought about it and I think we have been very successful. 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.500
 Ellie and Riley are very personal characters and you can watch their relationship. 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.600
 This is still an area that needs further research. 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.100
 I think The Last of Us: Left Behind does just that.
