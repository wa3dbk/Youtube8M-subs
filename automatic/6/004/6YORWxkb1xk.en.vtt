when you're jamming over a song like
this<00:00:04.690> there<00:00:05.319> are<00:00:05.350> a<00:00:05.470> lot<00:00:05.740> of<00:00:05.770> different

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:05.950 
this there are a lot of different

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.250 
this there are a lot of different
variations<00:00:06.729> that<00:00:06.790> can<00:00:07.000> take<00:00:07.149> place<00:00:07.359> if<00:00:08.140> you

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.260 
variations that can take place if you

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.110 
variations that can take place if you
want<00:00:08.410> to<00:00:08.500> play<00:00:08.650> outside<00:00:08.830> and<00:00:09.340> do<00:00:09.519> the<00:00:09.670> unusual

want to play outside and do the unusual
things<00:00:10.389> that<00:00:10.540> we<00:00:10.660> did<00:00:10.839> in<00:00:11.019> actual<00:00:11.290> solo

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
things that we did in actual solo

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.799 
things that we did in actual solo
certainly<00:00:12.490> possible<00:00:12.700> the<00:00:13.419> other<00:00:13.540> thing<00:00:13.780> you

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
certainly possible the other thing you

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:14.970 
certainly possible the other thing you
can<00:00:13.900> do<00:00:14.080> here<00:00:14.200> is<00:00:14.320> we<00:00:14.440> can<00:00:14.589> actually<00:00:14.620> use

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
can do here is we can actually use

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.610 
can do here is we can actually use
several<00:00:15.280> different<00:00:15.570> scale<00:00:16.570> shapes<00:00:16.930> we<00:00:17.470> can

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:17.620 
several different scale shapes we can

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.189 
several different scale shapes we can
play<00:00:17.740> our<00:00:17.800> are<00:00:18.310> basically<00:00:18.789> our<00:00:18.939> adorian<00:00:19.570> or<00:00:19.720> e

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
play our are basically our adorian or e

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.500 
play our are basically our adorian or e
minor<00:00:20.470> pentatonic<00:00:21.119> because<00:00:22.119> we're<00:00:22.269> playing

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
minor pentatonic because we're playing

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.710 
minor pentatonic because we're playing
our<00:00:22.599> e<00:00:22.840> dominant<00:00:23.679> seven<00:00:24.010> chord<00:00:24.420> we<00:00:25.420> can<00:00:25.570> also

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
our e dominant seven chord we can also

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.689 
our e dominant seven chord we can also
play<00:00:26.050> what<00:00:26.259> I<00:00:26.289> consider<00:00:26.679> the<00:00:26.800> e<00:00:26.859> dominant

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
play what I consider the e dominant

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.490 
play what I consider the e dominant
pentatonic<00:00:28.330> which<00:00:28.539> is<00:00:28.689> just<00:00:28.929> the<00:00:29.050> E<00:00:29.080> minor

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
pentatonic which is just the E minor

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.529 
pentatonic which is just the E minor
pentatonic<00:00:29.949> except<00:00:30.730> with<00:00:30.849> a<00:00:30.880> natural<00:00:31.119> third

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
pentatonic except with a natural third

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:39.440 
pentatonic except with a natural third
instead<00:00:31.929> of<00:00:32.110> a<00:00:32.250> minor<00:00:33.250> third<00:00:33.520> or<00:00:33.670> flat<00:00:33.850> third

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.260 

cool

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.520 

you<00:00:48.270> some<00:00:48.450> nice<00:00:48.630> sounding<00:00:48.960> stuff<00:00:49.200> with<00:00:49.380> that

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
you some nice sounding stuff with that

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.370 
you some nice sounding stuff with that
and<00:00:49.740> that<00:00:49.980> works<00:00:50.130> great<00:00:50.250> over<00:00:50.910> seven<00:00:51.380> almost

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 
and that works great over seven almost

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.810 
and that works great over seven almost
got<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> little<00:00:52.650> bit<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.950> mixolydian<00:00:53.400> feel

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
got a little bit of a mixolydian feel

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.280 
got a little bit of a mixolydian feel
because<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.270> got<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> natural<00:00:54.930> third<00:00:55.140> in

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
because it's got the natural third in

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.410 
because it's got the natural third in
the<00:00:55.380> flat<00:00:55.590> seven<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.130> like<00:00:56.280> our<00:00:56.460> mixolydian

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
the flat seven just like our mixolydian

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.410 
the flat seven just like our mixolydian
mode<00:00:57.630> does<00:00:58.140> come<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.580> can<00:00:59.610> do<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.000> couple

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
mode does come so we can do a couple

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.689 
mode does come so we can do a couple
variations<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:01.020> scales<00:01:01.290> a<00:01:01.500> couple<00:01:02.400> of<00:01:02.489> licks

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
variations of scales a couple of licks

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.690 
variations of scales a couple of licks
you<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.059> try<00:01:03.239> over<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.629> one<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.280> kind<00:01:05.610> of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
you can try over this one is is kind of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.460 
you can try over this one is is kind of
an<00:01:05.790> outside<00:01:06.119> thing<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.869> happens<00:01:07.290> it's

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
an outside thing that that happens it's

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.609 
an outside thing that that happens it's
pretty<00:01:07.650> interesting<00:01:07.890> when<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.550> take<00:01:09.240> any

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
pretty interesting when you can take any

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.890 
pretty interesting when you can take any
lick<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.830> has<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> minor<00:01:11.369> third<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.030> like<00:01:12.690> a

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
lick that has a minor third in it like a

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.990 
lick that has a minor third in it like a
pentatonic<00:01:13.530> type<00:01:14.010> lick<00:01:14.280> for<00:01:14.670> example<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:17.000> do

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
pentatonic type lick for example I do

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.760 
pentatonic type lick for example I do
that<00:01:18.210> start<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.690> thirteenth<00:01:19.200> fret<00:01:19.470> right

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
that start on the thirteenth fret right

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.410 
that start on the thirteenth fret right
all<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.920> actually<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.610> basically<00:01:24.300> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
all it actually is is it basically a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.150 
all it actually is is it basically a
minor<00:01:24.869> seventh<00:01:25.320> arpeggio<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:31.470> then<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.920> can

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
minor seventh arpeggio and then I can

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.210 
minor seventh arpeggio and then I can
move<00:01:32.190> that<00:01:32.580> either<00:01:33.270> up<00:01:33.600> or<00:01:33.810> down<00:01:33.869> by<00:01:34.800> a<00:01:34.830> minor

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
move that either up or down by a minor

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.460 
move that either up or down by a minor
third<00:01:35.550> right<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:36.390> we<00:01:36.509> count<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.960> one<00:01:37.140> two

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
third right so if we count it one two

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.130 
third right so if we count it one two
three<00:01:37.920> frets<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.490> would<00:01:38.729> go<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.940> here<00:01:42.140> and

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
three frets that would go to here and

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.540 
three frets that would go to here and
then<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> down<00:01:44.430> another<00:01:44.759> minor<00:01:45.030> third<00:01:46.550> this

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
then do it down another minor third this

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.100 
then do it down another minor third this
is<00:01:47.640> really<00:01:47.789> going<00:01:48.000> off<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> diminished

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
is really going off of like a diminished

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.199 
is really going off of like a diminished
scale<00:01:49.500> principle<00:01:50.069> where<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.640> can<00:01:50.789> move<00:01:50.940> our

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209 
scale principle where we can move our

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.020 
scale principle where we can move our
licks<00:01:51.660> up<00:01:51.929> or<00:01:52.350> down<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> minor<00:01:52.920> third<00:01:53.220> we<00:01:53.819> can<00:01:53.850> do

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
licks up or down a minor third we can do

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.340 
licks up or down a minor third we can do
that<00:01:54.179> with<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.330> lot<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.509> pentatonic<00:01:55.140> stuff

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
that with a lot of pentatonic stuff

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.779 
that with a lot of pentatonic stuff
because<00:01:55.709> of<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> minor<00:01:56.160> third<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.759> is

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
because of the minor third that is

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.790 
because of the minor third that is
inherent<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.080> we<00:01:58.110> can<00:01:58.350> actually<00:01:58.530> do

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
inherent in it so we can actually do

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.160 
inherent in it so we can actually do
this<00:01:58.950> leg

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.320 

me<00:02:03.229> which<00:02:04.009> makes<00:02:04.250> for<00:02:04.400> a<00:02:04.430> really<00:02:04.580> cool<00:02:04.970> like<00:02:05.150> to

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
me which makes for a really cool like to

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.020 
me which makes for a really cool like to
step<00:02:05.630> down<00:02:05.810> off<00:02:06.310> so<00:02:07.310> we're<00:02:07.490> starting<00:02:07.670> outside

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
step down off so we're starting outside

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.639 
step down off so we're starting outside
if<00:02:08.390> we're<00:02:08.509> playing<00:02:08.599> at<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:09.020> minor<00:02:09.259> pentatonic

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
if we're playing at a minor pentatonic

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.910 
if we're playing at a minor pentatonic
we're<00:02:10.009> right<00:02:10.160> here<00:02:11.230> so<00:02:12.230> we're<00:02:12.349> going<00:02:12.560> up<00:02:12.739> a

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
we're right here so we're going up a

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.710 
we're right here so we're going up a
half<00:02:13.130> step<00:02:13.160> that's<00:02:13.700> doing<00:02:14.000> our<00:02:14.120> chromatic<00:02:14.569> up

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
half step that's doing our chromatic up

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.990 
half step that's doing our chromatic up
a<00:02:14.870> half<00:02:15.050> step<00:02:15.080> there<00:02:15.500> are<00:02:15.800> outside<00:02:16.520> up<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.819> half

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
a half step there are outside up a half

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.770 
a half step there are outside up a half
step<00:02:17.030> thing<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.660> then<00:02:18.050> we<00:02:18.110> do<00:02:18.230> this<00:02:18.349> leg<00:02:19.780> down

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
step thing and then we do this leg down

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.280 
step thing and then we do this leg down
a<00:02:21.110> minor<00:02:21.500> third<00:02:22.630> down<00:02:23.630> another<00:02:23.930> minor<00:02:24.230> third

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
a minor third down another minor third

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.720 
a minor third down another minor third
and<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.410> cool<00:02:27.620> thing<00:02:27.650> is<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:28.040> puts<00:02:28.550> us<00:02:28.670> right

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
and the cool thing is that puts us right

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.000 
and the cool thing is that puts us right
and<00:02:29.269> basically<00:02:29.780> what<00:02:30.319> would<00:02:30.650> be<00:02:30.769> considered

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
and basically what would be considered

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.830 
and basically what would be considered
our<00:02:31.340> fourth<00:02:31.580> position<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:32.120> E<00:02:32.300> minor

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
our fourth position of E minor

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.630 
our fourth position of E minor
pentatonic<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:36.380> I'm<00:02:36.470> basically<00:02:36.920> I'm<00:02:37.370> ending

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
pentatonic so I'm basically I'm ending

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.890 
pentatonic so I'm basically I'm ending
up<00:02:37.790> playing<00:02:38.090> an<00:02:38.209> E<00:02:38.330> minor<00:02:39.050> seventh<00:02:39.590> or<00:02:39.680> pigeon

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
up playing an E minor seventh or pigeon

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.020 
up playing an E minor seventh or pigeon
which<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.019> a<00:02:42.049> really<00:02:42.260> cool<00:02:42.500> like<00:02:43.030> another

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
which is a really cool like another

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.330 
which is a really cool like another
thing<00:02:44.239> we<00:02:44.360> can<00:02:44.510> do<00:02:44.600> is<00:02:44.750> actually<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:45.410> lick<00:02:45.769> that

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
thing we can do is actually a lick that

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.670 
thing we can do is actually a lick that
um<00:02:47.060> looks<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:47.900> lot<00:02:47.989> harder<00:02:48.200> than<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:48.470> actually

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
um looks a lot harder than it actually

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.590 
um looks a lot harder than it actually
is<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.340> that's<00:02:49.459> point<00:02:49.819> doing<00:02:50.000> this<00:02:51.250> law<00:02:52.250> firm

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
is and that's point doing this law firm

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.789 
is and that's point doing this law firm
seventh<00:02:53.600> fret<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.959> open<00:02:54.200> on<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.380> first<00:02:54.410> string

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
seventh fret to open on the first string

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.720 
seventh fret to open on the first string
and<00:02:55.670> then<00:02:55.819> hitting<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.239> second<00:02:56.720> string<00:02:57.519> on<00:02:58.519> a

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
and then hitting the second string on a

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.430 
and then hitting the second string on a
threat

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.950 

a<00:03:02.470> son<00:03:03.370> then<00:03:03.700> laughter<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.180> did<00:03:04.360> official<00:03:04.630> pull

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
a son then laughter I did official pull

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:13.670 
a son then laughter I did official pull
off<00:03:05.080> that<00:03:05.500> I'm<00:03:06.130> hitting<00:03:06.460> the<00:03:06.820> first<00:03:07.150> ring<00:03:07.300> open

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.430 

and<00:03:14.680> I<00:03:14.800> could<00:03:14.830> do<00:03:15.100> I<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:16.660> double<00:03:16.990> stop<00:03:17.200> there

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
and I could do I the double stop there

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.500 
and I could do I the double stop there
step<00:03:18.070> my<00:03:18.190> double<00:03:18.520> stop<00:03:18.730> up<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.000> 12<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.110> 10<00:03:21.510> 17

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
step my double stop up to 12 and 10 17

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:35.410 
step my double stop up to 12 and 10 17
to<00:03:22.660> 15<00:03:24.960> and<00:03:25.960> then<00:03:26.020> i<00:03:26.140> can<00:03:26.290> get<00:03:26.440> clear<00:03:26.710> up<00:03:26.830> here

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.900 

so<00:03:36.410> that's<00:03:36.560> kind<00:03:36.740> of<00:03:36.770> anything<00:03:37.130> gives<00:03:37.610> a<00:03:37.700> lot

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
so that's kind of anything gives a lot

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.880 
so that's kind of anything gives a lot
of<00:03:37.940> angst<00:03:38.240> when<00:03:38.569> you<00:03:38.660> get<00:03:38.780> up<00:03:38.900> there<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:39.500> you

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
of angst when you get up there it you

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.920 
of angst when you get up there it you
know<00:03:40.010> doesn't<00:03:40.700> have<00:03:40.849> an<00:03:40.970> outside<00:03:41.480> summit<00:03:41.810> as<00:03:41.900> a

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
know doesn't have an outside summit as a

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.110 
know doesn't have an outside summit as a
very<00:03:42.230> aggressive<00:03:42.739> sound<00:03:43.250> so<00:03:43.760> when<00:03:43.910> you<00:03:44.000> get

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
very aggressive sound so when you get

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.000 
very aggressive sound so when you get
real<00:03:44.270> aggressive<00:03:44.569> like<00:03:44.870> that<00:03:44.900> makes<00:03:45.890> it

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
real aggressive like that makes it

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.000 
real aggressive like that makes it
really<00:03:46.190> you<00:03:46.760> know<00:03:46.880> more<00:03:47.620> powerful<00:03:48.620> sounding

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
really you know more powerful sounding

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.740 
really you know more powerful sounding

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
sometimes with the outside stuff we can

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.100 
sometimes with the outside stuff we can
go<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.790> little<00:03:52.940> bit<00:03:53.120> outside<00:03:53.480> make<00:03:53.989> it

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
but you just have to start with small

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.940 
but you just have to start with small
licks<00:04:06.019> with<00:04:06.200> some<00:04:06.380> of<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.530> licks<00:04:06.709> that<00:04:06.769> we've

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
done here and start experimenting trying

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.360 
done here and start experimenting trying
to<00:04:09.140> get<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:09.290> little<00:04:09.410> bit<00:04:09.620> out<00:04:09.769> and<00:04:09.950> then<00:04:10.069> go<00:04:10.250> back

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
to get a little bit out and then go back

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.500 
to get a little bit out and then go back
once<00:04:10.700> again<00:04:10.850> get<00:04:11.360> weird<00:04:11.569> and<00:04:11.780> then<00:04:12.230> go<00:04:12.380> home
