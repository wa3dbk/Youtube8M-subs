00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
greece's things like that these are not

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.590 
greece's things like that these are not
necessary<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.129> can<00:00:47.280> be<00:00:47.370> handy<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.030> you

necessary that can be handy but you

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.119 
necessary that can be handy but you
don't<00:00:48.780> need<00:00:48.899> them<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.620> don't<00:00:49.800> need<00:00:49.950> them

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
don't need them you don't need them

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.209 
don't need them you don't need them
they're<00:00:50.879> like<00:00:51.379> all<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.530> need<00:00:52.739> really<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.100> a

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
they're like all you need really is a

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.639 
they're like all you need really is a
rag<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.730> some<00:00:53.760> water<00:00:54.199> these<00:00:55.199> thing<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.559> make

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
rag and some water these thing to make

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.900 
rag and some water these thing to make
it<00:00:55.770> may<00:00:55.860> be<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.980> bit<00:00:56.129> quicker<00:00:56.430> if<00:00:56.610> you've<00:00:56.699> got<00:00:56.820> to

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
it may be a bit quicker if you've got to

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.549 
it may be a bit quicker if you've got to
clean<00:00:57.120> multiple<00:00:57.629> bikes<00:00:57.780> here<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.379> help

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
clean multiple bikes here this can help

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.950 
clean multiple bikes here this can help
otherwise<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.309> don't<00:00:59.430> need<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.750> sooo<00:01:00.750> thing<00:01:00.899> I

need no no you don't all the special
brushes<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.329> stuff<00:01:03.390> they're<00:01:03.690> handy<00:01:04.260> but<00:01:04.949> not

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
brushes and stuff they're handy but not

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100 
brushes and stuff they're handy but not
essential<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:06.390> you're<00:01:06.540> cleaning<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.840> lot<00:01:06.990> of

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
essential if you're cleaning a lot of

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.840 
essential if you're cleaning a lot of
bikes<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.799> make<00:01:07.979> things<00:01:08.189> faster<00:01:08.400> like

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
bikes that make things faster like

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.190 
bikes that make things faster like
you're<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> protein<00:01:09.479> otherwise<00:01:09.869> they<00:01:10.049> don't

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
you're in a protein otherwise they don't

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.859 
you're in a protein otherwise they don't
another<00:01:10.830> thing<00:01:11.070> as<00:01:11.159> well<00:01:11.189> with<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.869> carbon

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
another thing as well with a carbon

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.090 
another thing as well with a carbon
parts<00:01:13.439> be<00:01:14.310> careful<00:01:14.760> with<00:01:14.850> carbon<00:01:15.360> stuff<00:01:16.100> all

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
parts be careful with carbon stuff all

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.380 
parts be careful with carbon stuff all
right<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.340> careful<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.790> carbon<00:01:18.119> bits

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
right be careful with the carbon bits

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.929 
right be careful with the carbon bits
because<00:01:18.630> if<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.650> put<00:01:19.680> de<00:01:20.100> greases<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.700> them

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
because if you put de greases on them

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.330 
because if you put de greases on them
that<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.810> affect<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.170> carbon<00:01:22.530> layup<00:01:22.860> alright

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
that can affect the carbon layup alright

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.030 
that can affect the carbon layup alright
so<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.549> don't<00:01:23.759> want<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.890> using<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> lot<00:01:25.950> of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
so you don't want to be using a lot of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.859 
so you don't want to be using a lot of
solvents<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.640> carbon<00:01:27.060> stuff<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.540> be<00:01:27.659> very

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
solvents on carbon stuff to be very

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.149 
solvents on carbon stuff to be very
careful<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.409> that's<00:01:28.680> why<00:01:28.829> water

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
careful with that that's why water

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.859 
careful with that that's why water
generally<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.759> best<00:01:29.939> one<00:01:30.090> depends<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:30.750> you

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
generally is the best one depends on you

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.140 
generally is the best one depends on you
