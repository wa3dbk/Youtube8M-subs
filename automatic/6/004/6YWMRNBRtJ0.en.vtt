00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
it this is supposed to be ideal for

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.070 
it this is supposed to be ideal for
cleaning<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.949> quick<00:00:20.340> litter<00:00:21.090> messes<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.930> any

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
cleaning that quick litter messes of any

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.130 
cleaning that quick litter messes of any
litter<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.680> tracks<00:00:23.180> meaning<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.390> comes<00:00:24.720> off

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
litter that tracks meaning it comes off

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.279 
litter that tracks meaning it comes off
of<00:00:25.199> their<00:00:25.500> paws<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.800> onto<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.820> floor<00:00:27.230> out<00:00:28.230> of

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
of their paws and onto the floor out of

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.089 
of their paws and onto the floor out of
the<00:00:28.439> litter<00:00:28.710> box<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> perfect<00:00:30.060> example

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
the litter box this is a perfect example

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.200 
the litter box this is a perfect example
hopefully<00:00:32.099> something<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.640> can<00:00:32.790> help<00:00:32.969> with

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
hopefully something that can help with

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.970 
hopefully something that can help with
that

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.440 

and<00:00:38.780> looks<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:40.250> so<00:00:41.250> there's<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
and looks like so there's that the the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:54.439 
and looks like so there's that the the
main<00:00:42.690> end<00:00:43.140> there<00:00:44.510> comes<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:53.360> power<00:00:54.360> cord

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
main end there comes with a power cord

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.490 
main end there comes with a power cord
and<00:00:54.960> then<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.340> got<00:00:57.289> the<00:00:59.719> the<00:01:00.719> handle<00:01:01.199> and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
and then it's got the the handle and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.229 
and then it's got the the handle and
that<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:02.340> just<00:01:02.550> twist<00:01:02.789> those<00:01:03.000> together

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
that you just twist those together

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.929 
that you just twist those together
obviously

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
obviously

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.760 
obviously
and<00:01:05.939> here's<00:01:06.570> another<00:01:06.750> connection<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.590> some

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
and here's another connection of some

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.149 
and here's another connection of some
sort<00:01:08.630> then<00:01:09.630> there's<00:01:09.869> an<00:01:10.439> instruction<00:01:11.130> manual

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
sort then there's an instruction manual

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.920 
sort then there's an instruction manual
so<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.850> ends<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.150> looking<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.570> this

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
so it ends up looking like this

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.399 
so it ends up looking like this
basically<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:14.580> we're<00:01:15.570> gonna<00:01:15.689> do<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> full

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
basically and we're gonna do a full

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.590 
basically and we're gonna do a full

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
will test it as to its capability of

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.969 
will test it as to its capability of
picking<00:01:23.220> up<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.460> litter<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.960> might<00:01:25.409> test<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.830> on

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
picking up a litter and might test it on

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.600 
picking up a litter and might test it on
hard<00:01:26.850> floors<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.630> carpet<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:32.100> says<00:01:32.310> it's

hard floors and carpet and it says it's

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.100 
hard floors and carpet and it says it's
um<00:01:33.740> versatile<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.979> lightweight<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.990> can<00:01:36.990> do

um versatile and lightweight and can do

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.469 
um versatile and lightweight and can do
up<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.380> 60<00:01:37.740> minutes<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.189> cleaning<00:01:38.729> without<00:01:39.150> it

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
up to 60 minutes of cleaning without it

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.819 
up to 60 minutes of cleaning without it
being<00:01:39.600> plugged<00:01:39.960> back<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.560> what<00:01:40.710> I'm

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
being plugged back in is what I'm

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.870 
being plugged back in is what I'm
assuming<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.990> it's<00:01:42.990> good<00:01:43.200> for<00:01:43.610> crumbs<00:01:44.610> and

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
assuming and it's good for crumbs and

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.260 
assuming and it's good for crumbs and
dirt<00:01:45.060> pet<00:01:45.420> hair<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.930> pet<00:01:46.829> litter<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.430> would
