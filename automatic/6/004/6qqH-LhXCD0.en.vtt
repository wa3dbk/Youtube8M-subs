00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.500
 energy and economic performance 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.940
 thermal comfort and phonic quality of 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.219
 air and hygiene in the premises 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.139
 sustainability of the building ventilation 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.240
 mechanically controlled double flow 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.250
 is an appropriate response to 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.840
 requirements of the modern habitat that this 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.840
 either for new or renovation 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.480
 the role of mechanical ventilation 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.130
 controlled is to ensure the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.500
 air exchange by bringing to 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.390
 eur9 collected outside and 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.579
 rejecting the stale air of the dwelling 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.530
 unlike simple ventilation 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.270
 flow that rejects the warm air of the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.910
 house and makes return cold air 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.250
 the vmc dual stream integrates a system 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.780
 heat exchangers that recovers the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.149
 calories from the extracted air and the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.829
 transfers to fresh air entering the stream 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.930
 fresh air collected outside 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.329
 the house is transported to 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.460
 dual flow system the latter is 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.140
 preheated in which are thanks to a 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.180
 high efficiency heat exchanger 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.280
 then transit through a network of ducts 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.369
 from insufflation to the living rooms 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.260
 the rooms the living room the office the stream 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.840
 of stale air laden with moisture and 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.210
 various household pollutants is sucked 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.310
 in the rooms say wet the kitchen 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.170
 and sanitary bathrooms or 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.850
 still the laundry this busy earth 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.619
 in calories but also to 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.420
 pollution transit in the network 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.500
 extraction to the caisson of the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.500
 double flux ventilation 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.159
 at the heart of the device lies 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.350
 the heat exchanger 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.690
 it is in the latter that warm air and 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.520
 wet 7 these calories to their nine and 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.200
 cold coming from outside 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.119
 the performance of some systems 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.070
 around 90% 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.780
 that means a lot of the 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.850
 calories normally lost are 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.020
 recovered and saved thanks to 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.940
 the device 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.190
 the vmc dual stream plays a role 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.200
 important at any season in summer she 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.060
 Refreshes incoming fresh air 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.310
 and control summer overheating 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.170
 at mid-season the bypass allows 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.270
 optimize the recovery of calories 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.520
 for indoor temperatures and 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.929
 outside are close once 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.450
 the heat exchanged performed 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.730
 stale air cooled air rejected to 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.340
 outside by a wall outlet or 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.440
 roofs opted for a system of 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.900
 performing ventilation is therefore doing 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.420
 choosing a comfortable healthy habitat 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.769
 and economical in perfect adequacy with 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.769
 the rt 2012 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.250
 by recovering more than 90% of calories 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
 rejected air 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.410
 it is possible thanks to a ventilation 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.980
 double stream to reduce its bill by 20% 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.260
 of heating 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.690
 so a family who occupies a house 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.790
 of 100 square meters and 1500 expenses 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.070
 per year for heating might 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.000
 save 300 euros a year on his 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.640
 energy bill 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.769
 the savings achieved will lighten your 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.840
 monthly charges and improve your 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.840
 ability to finance your project
