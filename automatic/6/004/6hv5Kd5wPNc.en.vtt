set<00:00:05.850> walk<00:00:06.060> in<00:00:06.240> this<00:00:06.390> video<00:00:06.720> even<00:00:07.319> though

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
set walk in this video even though

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.740 
set walk in this video even though
there's<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:08.130> summon<00:00:08.460> command<00:00:08.610> now<00:00:08.940> spoilers

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
there's a summon command now spoilers

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.020 
there's a summon command now spoilers
are<00:00:09.900> still<00:00:10.139> pretty<00:00:10.410> useful<00:00:10.620> actually<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:11.849> can

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
are still pretty useful actually you can

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.999 
are still pretty useful actually you can
power<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.269> redstone<00:00:12.690> signal<00:00:12.809> when<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.530> player<00:00:13.799> is

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
power a redstone signal when a player is

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.799 
power a redstone signal when a player is
near<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.370> spawner<00:00:14.639> or<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.509> can<00:00:15.660> make<00:00:15.780> a

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
near the spawner or you can make a

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.109 
near the spawner or you can make a
really<00:00:16.139> compact<00:00:16.500> randomizer<00:00:17.070> or<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:17.940> can

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
really compact randomizer or you can

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.820 
really compact randomizer or you can
detect<00:00:18.480> when<00:00:18.720> some<00:00:18.960> entities<00:00:19.320> are<00:00:19.500> near

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
detect when some entities are near

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.160 
detect when some entities are near
for<00:00:20.220> example<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.820> item<00:00:21.060> will<00:00:21.330> only<00:00:21.510> respawn

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
for example this item will only respawn

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.620 
for example this item will only respawn
after<00:00:22.470> it's<00:00:22.800> picked<00:00:23.039> up<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:24.090> let's<00:00:24.480> get

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
after it's picked up so let's get

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.189 
after it's picked up so let's get
started

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
started

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.410 
started
this<00:00:25.740> one<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.099> easy<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.609> just<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.000> set<00:00:27.210> block

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
this one is easy it's just a set block

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.599 
this one is easy it's just a set block
commands<00:00:27.779> creating<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.260> spawner<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.800> course<00:00:29.039> so

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
commands creating a spawner of course so

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.179 
commands creating a spawner of course so
if<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.090> want<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.390> adjust<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.349> bit<00:00:31.470> we're

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
if you want to adjust it a bit we're

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.280 
if you want to adjust it a bit we're
gonna<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.730> add<00:00:32.850> some<00:00:32.880> stuff<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.960> we'll

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
gonna have to add some stuff so we'll

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.530 
gonna have to add some stuff so we'll
add<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> zero<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.160> replace<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.969> some<00:00:36.329> curly

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
add a zero and replace and some curly

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.869 
add a zero and replace and some curly
brackets<00:00:36.960> for<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.380> data<00:00:37.559> tag<00:00:37.829> then<00:00:38.489> we'll<00:00:38.640> put

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
brackets for the data tag then we'll put

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.319 
brackets for the data tag then we'll put
entity<00:00:39.390> ID<00:00:39.600> Colin<00:00:40.200> Cowie<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.860> there<00:00:41.100> well<00:00:42.090> done

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
entity ID Colin Cowie in there well done

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.959 
entity ID Colin Cowie in there well done
you<00:00:42.719> just<00:00:42.989> created<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.440> cow<00:00:43.620> spawner<00:00:44.160> now<00:00:44.910> we

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
you just created a cow spawner now we

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.700 
you just created a cow spawner now we
want<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.450> trigger<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.809> pressure<00:00:46.170> plate<00:00:46.379> when

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
want to trigger a pressure plate when

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.470 
want to trigger a pressure plate when
the<00:00:46.800> player<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.250> near<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.579> spawner<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.360> we'll

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
the player is near the spawner so we'll

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.510 
the player is near the spawner so we'll
add<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> bunch<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.020> other<00:00:49.140> tax<00:00:49.530> will<00:00:50.219> make<00:00:50.399> it

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
add a bunch of other tax will make it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.420 
add a bunch of other tax will make it
spawn<00:00:50.760> an<00:00:50.879> XP<00:00:51.239> orb<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.660> set<00:00:52.289> spawn<00:00:52.620> count<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.190> 1

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
spawn an XP orb and set spawn count to 1

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.910 
spawn an XP orb and set spawn count to 1
so<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:53.969> only<00:00:54.090> spawning<00:00:54.480> one<00:00:54.809> entity<00:00:55.079> sets

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
so it's only spawning one entity sets

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.610 
so it's only spawning one entity sets
spawn<00:00:56.219> range<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.910> 1<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.300> if<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.109> want<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.500> can

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
spawn range to 1 and if you want you can

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.099 
spawn range to 1 and if you want you can
also<00:00:58.739> set<00:00:58.980> delay<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.340> zero<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.449> zero<00:01:00.930> by

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
also set delay to zero but it's zero by

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.709 
also set delay to zero but it's zero by
default<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:02.010> not<00:01:02.190> necessary<00:01:02.730> set<00:01:03.510> min

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
default so it's not necessary set min

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.570 
default so it's not necessary set min
spawn<00:01:03.989> delay<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.290> max<00:01:04.470> spawn<00:01:04.710> delay<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.010> 1<00:01:05.339> so

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
spawn delay and max spawn delay to 1 so

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.670 
spawn delay and max spawn delay to 1 so
it<00:01:05.670> will<00:01:05.700> keep<00:01:06.000> spawning<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.630> XP<00:01:07.020> orb<00:01:07.229> every

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
it will keep spawning the XP orb every

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.190 
it will keep spawning the XP orb every
tick<00:01:07.920> max<00:01:08.790> nearby<00:01:09.150> entities<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.689> gonna<00:01:09.869> stop

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
tick max nearby entities is gonna stop

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.600 
tick max nearby entities is gonna stop
the<00:01:10.350> spawner<00:01:10.650> when<00:01:11.010> there<00:01:11.159> are<00:01:11.280> too<00:01:11.460> many

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the spawner when there are too many

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.789 
the spawner when there are too many
entities<00:01:11.970> near<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.900> we'll<00:01:13.020> just<00:01:13.200> set<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.590> to

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
entities near so we'll just set that to

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.460 
entities near so we'll just set that to
the<00:01:13.890> highest<00:01:14.040> number<00:01:14.280> possible<00:01:15.259> 32,000<00:01:16.350> and

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
the highest number possible 32,000 and

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.429 
the highest number possible 32,000 and
we'll<00:01:17.310> set<00:01:17.520> require<00:01:17.970> player<00:01:18.299> range<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.840> 5<00:01:19.080> but

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
we'll set require player range to 5 but

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.870 
we'll set require player range to 5 but
you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.710> change<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.159> depending<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.700> what

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
you can change that depending on what

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.660 
you can change that depending on what
you<00:01:21.030> are<00:01:21.119> using<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.630> format<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.950> when

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
you are using this format for so when

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.580 
you are using this format for so when
you<00:01:23.790> put<00:01:24.030> those<00:01:24.240> tags<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.869> command<00:01:25.170> block<00:01:25.259> as

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
you put those tags in a command block as

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.219 
you put those tags in a command block as
you<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.189> see<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.549> gonna<00:01:26.729> spawn<00:01:27.000> an<00:01:27.180> XP<00:01:27.479> or<00:01:27.659> so

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
you can see it's gonna spawn an XP or so

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.140 
you can see it's gonna spawn an XP or so
we<00:01:28.619> didn't<00:01:28.890> tell<00:01:29.070> them<00:01:29.159> yet<00:01:29.340> where<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.850> spawn

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
we didn't tell them yet where to spawn

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.550 
we didn't tell them yet where to spawn
it<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.829> not<00:01:32.009> doing<00:01:32.369> much<00:01:32.640> yet<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.560> fix

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
it so it's not doing much yet to fix

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.770 
it so it's not doing much yet to fix
that<00:01:34.740> we'll<00:01:35.009> add<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.549> spawn<00:01:35.820> data<00:01:36.119> tag<00:01:36.509> and

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
that we'll add the spawn data tag and

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.380 
that we'll add the spawn data tag and
put<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.409> position<00:01:37.920> tag<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.240> your

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
put the position tag in it to get your

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.960 
put the position tag in it to get your
position<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:40.110> usually<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:41.009> use<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.520> spawn

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
position I usually just use a spawn

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.880 
position I usually just use a spawn
point<00:01:42.299> then<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.020> can<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.290> your<00:01:43.439> coordinates

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
point then you can see your coordinates

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.859 
point then you can see your coordinates
then<00:01:44.430> put<00:01:44.670> those<00:01:44.850> coordinates<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
then put those coordinates in the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.050 
then put those coordinates in the
command<00:01:46.140> block<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.500> add<00:01:46.890> docked<00:01:47.340> 5<00:01:47.640> next<00:01:47.939> to

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
command block and add docked 5 next to

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.670 
command block and add docked 5 next to
them<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.659> they<00:01:48.780> are<00:01:48.810> spawning<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> middle

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
them so they are spawning in the middle

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.429 
them so they are spawning in the middle
and<00:01:49.979> we'll<00:01:50.399> our<00:01:50.579> top<00:01:50.970> 3<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.720> y<00:01:51.869> coordinate

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
and we'll our top 3 to the y coordinate

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.620 
and we'll our top 3 to the y coordinate
if<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:53.189> don't<00:01:53.369> do<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.970> spawns<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
if you don't do that it spawns the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.929 
if you don't do that it spawns the
entity<00:01:55.079> inside<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.890> block<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:56.399> some<00:01:56.579> reason

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
entity inside the block for some reason

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.370 
entity inside the block for some reason
I'll<00:01:57.600> also<00:01:57.840> add<00:01:58.110> H<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.770> set<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.990> 5999<00:02:01.020> so

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
I'll also add H and set it to 5999 so

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.109 
I'll also add H and set it to 5999 so
the<00:02:01.500> XP<00:02:01.770> orb<00:02:01.950> will<00:02:02.130> despawn<00:02:02.430> immediately

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
the XP orb will despawn immediately

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.719 
the XP orb will despawn immediately
you're<00:02:03.930> probably<00:02:04.200> thinking<00:02:04.740> why<00:02:05.369> don't<00:02:05.579> you

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
you're probably thinking why don't you

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.280 
you're probably thinking why don't you
just<00:02:05.939> use<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.390> test<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.869> command

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
just use the test for command

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.619 
just use the test for command
well<00:02:07.680> if<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.340> have<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.520> lot<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.910> clocks<00:02:09.300> running

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
well if you have a lot of clocks running

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.449 
well if you have a lot of clocks running
in<00:02:09.840> your<00:02:09.989> world<00:02:10.170> like<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.649> one<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.340> will

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
in your world like this one that will

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.309 
in your world like this one that will
make<00:02:11.489> your<00:02:11.760> world<00:02:11.970> laggy<00:02:12.270> but<00:02:12.840> if<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.140> really

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
make your world laggy but if you really

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.880 
make your world laggy but if you really
want<00:02:13.590> you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
want you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.740 
want you
that's<00:02:14.130> four<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.730> can<00:02:14.880> also<00:02:15.000> use<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> spawner

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
that's four you can also use a spawner

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.260 
that's four you can also use a spawner
that<00:02:16.110> triggers<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> clock<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.100> then<00:02:17.760> use<00:02:18.000> this

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
that triggers a clock and then use this

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.110 
that triggers a clock and then use this
for<00:02:18.890> now<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.190> will<00:02:20.310> get<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.700> bit<00:02:20.940> more

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
for now it will get a bit more

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.360 
for now it will get a bit more
complicated<00:02:21.480> but<00:02:21.959> it's<00:02:22.140> really<00:02:22.319> useful<00:02:22.620> I'll

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
complicated but it's really useful I'll

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.610 
complicated but it's really useful I'll
show<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.670> how<00:02:23.880> I<00:02:23.940> did<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.270> randomizer<00:02:24.720> we

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
show you how I did the randomizer we

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.410 
show you how I did the randomizer we
need<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.860> add<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.250> tag<00:02:26.640> called<00:02:27.030> spawn

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
need to add a tag called spawn

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.660 
need to add a tag called spawn
potentials<00:02:28.050> it's<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.770> list<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.160> possible

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
potentials it's a list of possible

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.850 
potentials it's a list of possible
entities<00:02:30.180> every<00:02:30.900> time<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.230> spawner<00:02:31.500> spawns

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
entities every time the spawner spawns

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.650 
entities every time the spawner spawns
an<00:02:32.010> entity<00:02:32.340> it's<00:02:32.580> going<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.970> choose<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.300> new

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
an entity it's going to choose a new

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.020 
an entity it's going to choose a new
entity<00:02:33.930> out<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:34.650> list<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.190> we'll<00:02:35.820> create

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
entity out of this list so we'll create

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.480 
entity out of this list so we'll create
that<00:02:36.330> tag<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.810> at<00:02:37.440> these<00:02:37.650> curly<00:02:38.040> brackets<00:02:38.370> in

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
that tag and at these curly brackets in

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.580 
that tag and at these curly brackets in
there<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.510> curly<00:02:39.780> brackets<00:02:40.110> will<00:02:40.380> put

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
there in the curly brackets will put

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.400 
there in the curly brackets will put
type<00:02:40.980> that's<00:02:41.520> basically<00:02:41.910> just<00:02:42.030> entity<00:02:42.630> ID<00:02:42.810> but

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
type that's basically just entity ID but

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.110 
type that's basically just entity ID but
with<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.620> different<00:02:44.010> name<00:02:44.069> then<00:02:44.910> there's

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
with a different name then there's

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.300 
with a different name then there's
weight<00:02:45.450> that's<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.500> chance<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.010> spawner

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
weight that's the chance the spawner

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.790 
weight that's the chance the spawner
chooses<00:02:47.850> that<00:02:47.970> entity<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.800> there's

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
chooses that entity and there's

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.830 
chooses that entity and there's
properties<00:02:50.370> that's<00:02:50.820> basically<00:02:51.239> just<00:02:51.570> spawn

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
properties that's basically just spawn

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.620 
properties that's basically just spawn
data<00:02:52.170> but<00:02:52.650> with<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.890> different<00:02:53.250> name<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.970> the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
data but with a different name in the

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.240 
data but with a different name in the
properties<00:02:54.870> we'll<00:02:55.290> put<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.620> position<00:02:56.070> and

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
properties we'll put the position and

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.420 
properties we'll put the position and
age<00:02:56.540> now<00:02:57.540> we'll<00:02:58.140> just<00:02:58.350> copy<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:58.769> three<00:02:59.220> times

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
age now we'll just copy that three times

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.670 
age now we'll just copy that three times
and<00:02:59.820> change<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.150> position<00:03:00.570> a<00:03:00.660> bit<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:01.500> might

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
and change the position a bit you might

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.440 
and change the position a bit you might
also<00:03:01.860> want<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.160> change<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.550> DNA<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.880> bit<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.330> it

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
also want to change the DNA a bit so it

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.949 
also want to change the DNA a bit so it
doesn't<00:03:03.480> spawn<00:03:03.959> items<00:03:04.440> constantly<00:03:05.959> something

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
doesn't spawn items constantly something

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.020 
doesn't spawn items constantly something
else<00:03:07.320> you<00:03:07.500> can<00:03:07.650> do<00:03:07.769> with<00:03:07.800> spoilers<00:03:08.130> you<00:03:08.880> can

else you can do with spoilers you can

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.970 
else you can do with spoilers you can

did<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:29.820> like<00:03:30.030> this<00:03:30.299> is<00:03:30.540> because<00:03:30.870> when<00:03:31.049> you<00:03:31.170> use

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
did it like this is because when you use

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.800 
did it like this is because when you use
replace<00:03:31.890> or<00:03:32.160> keep<00:03:32.549> it<00:03:32.820> says<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.570> block

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
replace or keep it says the block

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.630

couldn't<00:03:34.140> be<00:03:34.200> placed<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.829> when<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.519> use

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640

couldn't be placed and when you use
destroy<00:03:36.180> it's<00:03:36.510> actually<00:03:37.079> breaking<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.680> block

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
destroy it's actually breaking the block

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.830 
destroy it's actually breaking the block
and<00:03:38.070> that<00:03:38.220> will<00:03:38.370> drop<00:03:38.610> some<00:03:38.880> XP<00:03:39.269> just<00:03:39.600> like

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
and that will drop some XP just like

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.610 
and that will drop some XP just like

these error messages in your console now

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.270 
these error messages in your console now
that<00:03:48.510> isn't<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.900> huge<00:03:49.200> problem<00:03:49.230> but<00:03:50.100> it<00:03:50.220> will

that isn't a huge problem but it will

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.009 
that isn't a huge problem but it will
also<00:03:50.459> increase<00:03:50.850> your<00:03:51.299> memory<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.870> eventually

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
also increase your memory and eventually

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.990 
also increase your memory and eventually
it<00:03:52.560> will<00:03:52.650> make<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:52.950> game<00:03:53.100> unplayable<00:03:53.280> for

it will make the game unplayable for

it will make the game unplayable for
some<00:03:54.150> reason<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:55.579> don't<00:03:56.579> use<00:03:56.820> items<00:03:57.150> spawners

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
some reason so don't use items spawners

though<00:03:58.170> sometimes<00:03:58.920> you<00:03:59.190> really<00:03:59.610> want<00:03:59.790> to

spawn an item using a spawner in the
code<00:04:02.310> for<00:04:02.519> example<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:03.209> use<00:04:03.660> an<00:04:03.840> item<00:04:03.959> spawner

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
code for example I use an item spawner

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.170 
code for example I use an item spawner
to<00:04:04.620> detect<00:04:04.950> if<00:04:05.070> there<00:04:05.250> was<00:04:05.400> an<00:04:05.519> item<00:04:05.700> near<00:04:06.030> the

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
to detect if there was an item near the

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.690 
to detect if there was an item near the
spawner<00:04:06.450> only<00:04:07.350> if<00:04:07.500> there<00:04:07.709> wasn't<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.370> would

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
spawner only if there wasn't it would

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.640 
spawner only if there wasn't it would
spawn<00:04:08.940> an<00:04:09.060> item<00:04:09.329> but<00:04:09.780> there<00:04:09.989> still<00:04:10.140> a<00:04:10.350> way<00:04:10.590> to

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
spawn an item but there still a way to

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.190 
spawn an item but there still a way to
do<00:04:10.829> this<00:04:11.010> just<00:04:11.730> make<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.060> spawner<00:04:12.420> spawn<00:04:12.810> XP

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200

still stops spawning

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.469

determines in which area this vulner is
looking<00:04:35.210> if<00:04:35.360> there<00:04:35.810> are<00:04:35.900> other<00:04:36.020> entities<00:04:36.230> near

looking if there are other entities near
so<00:04:37.670> yeah<00:04:38.000> not<00:04:38.810> a<00:04:38.870> very<00:04:39.140> interesting<00:04:39.470> video

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
so yeah not a very interesting video

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.260 
so yeah not a very interesting video
today<00:04:40.160> but<00:04:40.460> I<00:04:40.490> hope<00:04:40.730> it's<00:04:40.940> still<00:04:41.000> pretty

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
today but I hope it's still pretty

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.420 
today but I hope it's still pretty
useful<00:04:41.480> thanks<00:04:42.470> for<00:04:42.590> watching<00:04:42.890> and<00:04:43.100> I<00:04:43.340> don't

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
useful thanks for watching and I don't

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.900 
useful thanks for watching and I don't
