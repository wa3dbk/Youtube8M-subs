00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.770
 good everything again 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.410
 time without seeing us now I have the figure 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:20.210
 from nico robin of his version of the new 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.800
 z film here is the case 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.410
 very nice boxes from the new 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.200
 movie with mushrooms in the windows 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.700
 we can see some images in the 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.850
 different poses that the 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.850
 figure 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.430
 the Windows 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.420
 list 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.420
 the golden sticker 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.750
 good 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.810
 the box we spend with rubin 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.810
 a nap 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.430
 niko robin 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.590
 very good figure has some details 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.430
 later I'll tell 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.430
 talking 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.140
 and 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.670
 where to start good 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.670
 has extra accessories that is 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.230
 another pair of pigtails for when they 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.170
 want to pose without the hat 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.440
 an extra right hand to change the 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.580
 back for a musket and a sheath 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.460
 extra because here's a little 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.870
 problem with the sword 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.750
 then I say it 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.530
 good 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.530
 to get started 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.950
 to remove the sword and put the 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.480
 forest 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:06.220
 you take your hand 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.020
 remove the sword so the leaf rather 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.660
 and you have to completely disarm the 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.720
 back 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.570
 not relocates 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.610
 and to act as if it's going to be saved in 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:23.290
 the case insert this here 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.290
 and this then only 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.260
 change the case 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:35.210
 and there it is 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:39.550
 you have this this and then they take it 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.550
 and simply mistakes in which you 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.080
 it gets on the second hand that we came 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.080
 open 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.180
 A) Yes 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.720
 the list 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.910
 and we have robin now with the forest 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.830
 tÃ©lam on the right the problem with the 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.020
 sword is that I do not know why they will have 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.120
 done like that really or no more 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.620
 they spent more plastic pieces when 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.220
 they could have made a normal sword 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.580
 like the wolf 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.580
 I want 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.190
 really because it's not a sword 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:31.930
 normal that can be founded 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.930
 and save plastic pieces in addition 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.610
 good and what 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.860
 less points in that part another point 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.540
 negative of the figure 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.280
 What is it 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.230
 if the hat position 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.270
 use it to really to put the 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.270
 hat by hand moves 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.730
 you have to change this because you have a 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.790
 hole in there so that the hat 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:09.819
 to connect you already saw hats you get 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:11.859
 this other piece that gets 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.050
 they really would have made a hat 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:17.519
 normal 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.870
 never put on like that but good or with a 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.780
 magnet like other figures but 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.550
 I do not know what the sculptor is thinking 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.729
 it seems new what I was reading 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:31.710
 is his first figure as problems of 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:34.330
 his first water figure but good 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.970
 I hope they do not give him more because he got 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.520
 enough legs here is the other way 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.940
 for example 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.750
 you can not put the sword what is that 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.620
 but good 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.620
 at home 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.200
 and this is how it should be 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.190
 and 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.190
 what other thing 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.700
 yes 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.580
 good as everyone will know 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.069
 in the film 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.379
 the ability of the fruit in mode mode 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:17.189
 makes all things go back 12 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:19.949
 years in time and they rejuvenated 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:21.659
 to robin 12 years so apparently the 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.030
 they wanted to do with appearance 18 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:26.630
 years but I feel that the gene gave 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:30.440
 too many things on the face 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:32.930
 It does not look like it but 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.729
 certain angles there are others that yes but no 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.349
 of all and so 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.150
 removing all these negative points 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:43.830
 of the sculptor 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.830
 it really is a very pretty figure 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.449
 very good painting work especially 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:50.449
 in boots and tights 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.330
 to the bases 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.580
 it seems they are all going to be red 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.919
 with the logo of the movie and you know 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.919
 the name of the character width 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:19.770
 a great job in painting 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.770
 and because I think that these are extra 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.660
 but if you get saved many pieces 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.620
 if they had made a sword sheath 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.990
 normal 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:34.180
 and this is if any other doubt already comes 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.590
 you know the comments section 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:40.169
 I really do not know what else possible 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:42.719
 figure there are no more poses or accessories 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:45.590
 and well , see you next 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:45.590
 Thank you
