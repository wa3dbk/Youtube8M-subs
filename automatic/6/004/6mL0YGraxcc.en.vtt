though<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.130> died<00:02:20.490> in<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:20.850> video<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.960> a<00:02:21.990> danger

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
though I died in this video to a danger

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.830 
though I died in this video to a danger
but<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.800> was<00:02:23.010> because<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.460> lag<00:02:23.750> usually<00:02:24.750> you

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
but that was because of lag usually you

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.930 
but that was because of lag usually you
can<00:02:25.020> just<00:02:25.230> use<00:02:25.350> devotion<00:02:25.980> then<00:02:26.220> freedom<00:02:26.730> and

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
can just use devotion then freedom and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.510 
can just use devotion then freedom and
just<00:02:27.120> escape<00:02:27.540> easily<00:02:27.780> as<00:02:28.290> it's<00:02:28.590> nearly<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
just escape easily as it's nearly the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.510 
just escape easily as it's nearly the
teleport<00:02:30.360> zone<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:30.810> glory<00:02:31.260> amlet<00:02:31.800> unless

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
teleport zone of glory amlet unless

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.580 
teleport zone of glory amlet unless
someone<00:02:32.790> comes<00:02:33.060> with<00:02:33.570> a<00:02:33.600> teleport<00:02:34.170> blocking

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
someone comes with a teleport blocking

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.860 
someone comes with a teleport blocking
like<00:02:34.770> three<00:02:35.070> people<00:02:35.280> then<00:02:36.000> you're<00:02:36.570> and

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
like three people then you're and

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.320 
like three people then you're and
now<00:02:37.350> it's<00:02:37.560> time<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.740> do<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:37.980> price<00:02:38.250> check<00:02:38.490> so

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
now it's time to do a price check so

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.990 
now it's time to do a price check so
these<00:02:39.510> are<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.870> items<00:02:40.050> that<00:02:40.710> I<00:02:40.740> got<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.370> I

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
these are the items that I got and I

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.730 
these are the items that I got and I
think<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:42.420> will<00:02:42.480> be<00:02:42.840> selling<00:02:43.230> all<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.470> them

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
think I will be selling all of them

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.590 
think I will be selling all of them
before<00:02:44.160> doing<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.550> price<00:02:44.760> shape<00:02:45.030> because<00:02:45.330> if<00:02:45.480> I

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
before doing a price shape because if I

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.840 
before doing a price shape because if I
do<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.870> price<00:02:46.080> check<00:02:46.320> now<00:02:46.530> it's<00:02:47.250> not<00:02:47.610> actually

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
do the price check now it's not actually

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.720 
do the price check now it's not actually
accurate<00:02:48.300> because<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.080> ashes<00:02:49.680> go<00:02:49.860> for<00:02:50.100> 1.8

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
accurate because the ashes go for 1.8

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.180 
accurate because the ashes go for 1.8
thousand<00:02:51.390> actually<00:02:51.959> they<00:02:52.110> go<00:02:52.260> for<00:02:52.560> nine<00:02:52.800> point

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
thousand actually they go for nine point

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.510 
thousand actually they go for nine point
two<00:02:53.280> thousand<00:02:54.030> so<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.930> this<00:02:55.500> is<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.709> lie<00:02:56.100> this

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
two thousand so the this is a lie this

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.449 
two thousand so the this is a lie this
is<00:02:56.730> no<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.990> kind<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.350> doubt<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:58.830> will<00:02:58.980> be

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
is no and I kind of doubt that I will be

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.760 
is no and I kind of doubt that I will be
selling<00:02:59.820> all<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.030> these<00:03:00.300> dragon<00:03:00.720> bolts<00:03:01.140> efore

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
selling all of these dragon bolts efore

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.620 
selling all of these dragon bolts efore
that<00:03:02.130> much<00:03:02.430> because<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:02.880> feel<00:03:03.180> like<00:03:03.330> no<00:03:03.510> one

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
that much because I feel like no one

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.520 
that much because I feel like no one
actually<00:03:04.020> uses<00:03:04.230> them<00:03:04.620> let's<00:03:05.220> try<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.490> do<00:03:05.700> that

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
actually uses them let's try to do that

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.470 
actually uses them let's try to do that
yeah<00:03:07.530> especially<00:03:08.040> since<00:03:08.400> we'll<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.240> ones

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
yeah especially since we'll the ones

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.110 
yeah especially since we'll the ones
were<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.080> least<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.740> lava<00:03:11.250> strike<00:03:11.640> Wynnum<00:03:12.030> so

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
were the least and lava strike Wynnum so

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.420 
were the least and lava strike Wynnum so
you<00:03:12.240> get<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.390> lot<00:03:12.660> of<00:03:12.690> those<00:03:12.990> now<00:03:13.260> so<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:13.920> assume

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
you get a lot of those now so I assume

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.580 
you get a lot of those now so I assume
it's<00:03:14.459> just<00:03:14.850> way<00:03:15.480> too<00:03:15.510> many<00:03:15.810> people<00:03:16.050> are<00:03:16.350> trying

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.860 
it's just way too many people are trying
to<00:03:16.709> sell<00:03:16.920> them<00:03:17.160> oh<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.790> did<00:03:18.120> actually<00:03:18.330> sell<00:03:18.720> them

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
to sell them oh I did actually sell them

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.350 
to sell them oh I did actually sell them
for<00:03:19.110> one<00:03:19.320> point<00:03:19.560> one<00:03:19.769> mill<00:03:19.980> in<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.580> way<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:21.060> also

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
for one point one mill in a way I also

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.780 
for one point one mill in a way I also
had<00:03:21.720> one<00:03:22.050> point<00:03:22.290> one<00:03:22.650> mill<00:03:22.890> in<00:03:23.130> my<00:03:23.370> money<00:03:23.580> pouch

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
had one point one mill in my money pouch

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.930 
had one point one mill in my money pouch
before<00:03:24.360> I<00:03:24.600> did<00:03:25.110> anything<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:26.070> is<00:03:26.610> because

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
before I did anything that is because

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.150 
before I did anything that is because
they<00:03:27.090> also<00:03:27.269> dropped<00:03:27.780> some<00:03:27.900> cash<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.709> they

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
they also dropped some cash and they

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.910 
they also dropped some cash and they
drop<00:03:29.760> twenty<00:03:30.450> thousand<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.500> does<00:03:31.680> add<00:03:31.890> up

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
drop twenty thousand so it does add up

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.850 
drop twenty thousand so it does add up
eventually<00:03:32.570> okay<00:03:33.570> so<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.320> shouldn't<00:03:34.709> be

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
eventually okay so you shouldn't be

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.920 
eventually okay so you shouldn't be
