causes the color to shift and you'll see

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.310 
causes the color to shift and you'll see
that<00:03:41.120> in<00:03:41.269> just<00:03:41.360> a<00:03:41.480> second<00:03:41.870> so<00:03:42.110> we're<00:03:42.230> gonna

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
that in just a second so we're gonna

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.430 
that in just a second so we're gonna
take<00:03:42.500> these<00:03:42.709> four<00:03:43.040> maybe<00:03:43.370> five<00:03:43.760> lemons<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.510> go

take these four maybe five lemons and go

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.710 
take these four maybe five lemons and go
ahead<00:03:45.560> and<00:03:45.709> press<00:03:45.890> them<00:03:46.130> and<00:03:46.540> introduce<00:03:47.540> them

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
ahead and press them and introduce them

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:59.020 
ahead and press them and introduce them
into<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.560> ginger<00:03:48.890> juice<00:03:57.640> so<00:03:58.640> you<00:03:58.670> see<00:03:58.880> that

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
ginger grace is gonna look like what

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.949 
ginger grace is gonna look like what
we're<00:04:04.430> gonna<00:04:04.519> do<00:04:04.700> is<00:04:04.820> we're<00:04:04.940> going<00:04:05.030> to<00:04:05.150> add<00:04:05.360> six

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
ounces of simple syrup that's just equal

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.170 
ounces of simple syrup that's just equal
parts<00:04:09.019> sugar<00:04:09.290> and<00:04:09.920> water<00:04:10.130> now<00:04:10.820> a<00:04:10.850> lot<00:04:11.150> of

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
parts sugar and water now a lot of

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.490 
parts sugar and water now a lot of
people<00:04:11.330> will<00:04:11.540> say<00:04:11.720> oh<00:04:11.900> hey

stove what we're gonna do is if she's

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.719 
stove what we're gonna do is if she's
just<00:04:24.260> gonna<00:04:24.440> mix<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:24.919> up<00:04:25.039> like<00:04:25.130> that<00:04:25.400> make<00:04:25.700> a

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
just gonna mix it up like that make a

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.820 
just gonna mix it up like that make a
nice<00:04:25.940> little<00:04:26.090> slurry<00:04:26.450> and<00:04:26.830> since<00:04:28.030> microwaves

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
nice little slurry and since microwaves

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.820 
nice little slurry and since microwaves
heat<00:04:30.830> up<00:04:31.130> water<00:04:31.580> molecules<00:04:32.180> and<00:04:32.599> this<00:04:33.500> is<00:04:33.650> half

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
heat up water molecules and this is half

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.070 
heat up water molecules and this is half
water<00:04:34.130> that's<00:04:35.090> exactly<00:04:35.539> what<00:04:35.660> we're<00:04:35.750> gonna<00:04:35.840> do

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
water that's exactly what we're gonna do

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.390 
water that's exactly what we're gonna do
we're<00:04:36.200> gonna<00:04:36.320> take<00:04:36.530> this<00:04:36.710> slurry<00:04:37.130> and<00:04:37.220> we're

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
we're gonna take this slurry and we're

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.440 
we're gonna take this slurry and we're
gonna<00:04:37.490> stick<00:04:37.640> in<00:04:37.789> the<00:04:37.849> microwave<00:04:38.240> for<00:04:38.270> like

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
gonna stick in the microwave for like

gonna stick in the microwave for like
one<00:04:38.750> minute<00:04:38.960> stir<00:04:39.740> it<00:04:39.830> up<00:04:39.950> and<00:04:40.130> guess<00:04:40.370> what

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
one minute stir it up and guess what

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.690 
one minute stir it up and guess what
instant<00:04:41.990> some<00:04:42.080> observable<00:04:42.530> so<00:04:43.190> in<00:04:43.400> between

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
instant some observable so in between

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.400 
instant some observable so in between
takes<00:04:43.940> I<00:04:44.060> realized<00:04:44.479> that<00:04:44.870> the<00:04:45.110> amount<00:04:45.349> of

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
takes I realized that the amount of

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.930 
takes I realized that the amount of
ginger<00:04:45.710> beer<00:04:45.830> that<00:04:46.039> we<00:04:46.130> were<00:04:46.220> making<00:04:46.580> was<00:04:46.910> not
