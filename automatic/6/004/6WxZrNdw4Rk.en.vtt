abilities abilities in general is a good
thing<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:51.960> i<00:01:52.020> think<00:01:52.259> sprint<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:53.490> add<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.360> nano

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
thing but i think sprint can add a nano

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.889 
thing but i think sprint can add a nano
can<00:01:55.259> add<00:01:55.409> something<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.340> hill<00:01:56.610> game<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.119> i

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
can add something to a hill game and i
