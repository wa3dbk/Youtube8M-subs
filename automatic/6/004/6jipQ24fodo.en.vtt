00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:08.340
 this in the realization that is 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:13.679
 was very requested to publish yes 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:18.810
 it is 2 c 39 in a cooled cavity 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:22.189
 water-based built with few pieces in 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:27.349
 old electronic db container 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:30.349
 va there is some hole that I don't have yet 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.349
 used 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:48.750
 internally it is one of the amplifiers 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:55.229
 more Spartan than I ever built 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:01:02.010
 generous transformer one use 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:07.799
 high voltage equipment a 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:15.500
 capacitor a timer of the 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:15.500
 fintes an output relay 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:32.890
 Teflon plate a stoneware relay the cavity 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.890
 with the two tubes 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:48.600
 with the inlet water circuit e 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:53.130
 exit from the front of the bundle of pipes 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.130
 the output input circuit 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.320
 the agreement circuit 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.190
 of charity 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.950
 the instrument 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:24.580
 let's try to turn it on silently 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.530
 here are the tubes 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.530
 circuit 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.250
 water 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.250
 term realized 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:11.239
 all very simple Spartan I repeat 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:21.980
 very functional with 10 watts of 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:27.200
 driving is over 230 230 with 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:34.450
 some tubes also 250 but I don't push it 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.450
 in addition to a continuous service via m 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.440
 and that 's all
