this<00:03:51.300> is<00:03:51.420> way<00:03:51.540> too<00:03:51.570> easy<00:03:51.930> yeah<00:03:52.110> here's<00:03:52.410> the

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
this is way too easy yeah here's the

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.040 
this is way too easy yeah here's the
thing<00:03:52.650> is<00:03:52.740> this<00:03:53.100> is<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.340> beta<00:03:53.760> test<00:03:54.180> right<00:03:54.570> not<00:03:54.840> a

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
thing is this is a beta test right not a

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.680 
thing is this is a beta test right not a
demo<00:03:55.350> so<00:03:55.680> this<00:03:55.830> is<00:03:56.010> not<00:03:56.160> in<00:03:56.400> essence<00:03:57.240> to<00:03:57.480> you

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
demo so this is not in essence to you

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.120 
demo so this is not in essence to you
know<00:03:57.780> make<00:03:57.900> you<00:03:58.050> buy<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.350> game<00:03:58.650> with<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:58.920> dis

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
know make you buy the game with a dis

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.260 
know make you buy the game with a dis
little<00:03:59.370> taste<00:03:59.550> of<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.760> you're<00:04:00.120> actually

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
little taste of it you're actually

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.760 
little taste of it you're actually
working<00:04:00.600> on<00:04:00.810> behalf<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:01.110> blizzard<00:04:01.440> to<00:04:01.530> stress

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
working on behalf of blizzard to stress

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.220 
working on behalf of blizzard to stress
test<00:04:02.010> their<00:04:02.160> servers<00:04:02.550> for<00:04:03.210> that<00:04:03.570> reason<00:04:03.810> I

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
test their servers for that reason I

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.750 
test their servers for that reason I
think<00:04:04.260> that's<00:04:04.860> why<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.220> game<00:04:05.430> is<00:04:05.490> easy

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
think that's why the game is easy

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.760 
think that's why the game is easy
because<00:04:06.300> they're<00:04:06.810> not<00:04:06.930> seeing<00:04:07.560> if<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.740> game

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
because they're not seeing if the game

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.760 
because they're not seeing if the game
works<00:04:08.130> also<00:04:08.640> lizard<00:04:09.480> is<00:04:09.720> pretty<00:04:10.440> good<00:04:10.650> at
