of<00:01:13.100> a<00:01:13.159> gradual<00:01:13.670> incline<00:01:13.939> as<00:01:14.149> you<00:01:14.210> can<00:01:14.329> see<00:01:14.479> here

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
of a gradual incline as you can see here

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.870 
of a gradual incline as you can see here
the<00:01:14.810> steps<00:01:15.049> are<00:01:15.259> farther<00:01:15.889> apart<00:01:16.039> and<00:01:16.639> it's

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
the steps are farther apart and it's

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.309 
the steps are farther apart and it's
quite<00:01:17.090> a<00:01:17.119> gradual<00:01:17.509> incline<00:01:17.749> but<00:01:17.990> as<00:01:18.109> you<00:01:18.229> get

00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:18.319 
quite a gradual incline but as you get

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:19.840 
quite a gradual incline but as you get
to<00:01:18.380> that<00:01:18.469> quarter<00:01:18.979> mark<00:01:19.159> halfway<00:01:19.429> point

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
to that quarter mark halfway point

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.059 
to that quarter mark halfway point
things<00:01:20.539> start<00:01:20.749> to<00:01:20.990> get<00:01:21.170> a<00:01:21.229> little<00:01:21.409> bit<00:01:21.619> steeper

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:22.069 
things start to get a little bit steeper

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:23.590 
things start to get a little bit steeper
don't<00:01:22.249> forget<00:01:22.520> we<00:01:22.609> have<00:01:22.639> to<00:01:22.789> get<00:01:23.030> up<00:01:23.149> a<00:01:23.299> pretty

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
don't forget we have to get up a pretty

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.059 
don't forget we have to get up a pretty
significant<00:01:24.259> elevation<00:01:24.710> to<00:01:24.770> get<00:01:24.889> to<00:01:24.979> the

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
significant elevation to get to the

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:26.559 
significant elevation to get to the
plateau<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:25.490> I'll<00:01:25.700> try<00:01:25.909> to<00:01:25.969> beat<00:01:26.209> Nelson

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569 
plateau and I'll try to beat Nelson

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:28.239 
plateau and I'll try to beat Nelson

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:28.249 
Nelson just that one little step we got

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:29.859 
Nelson just that one little step we got

the first have done the ground what's

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.139 
the first have done the ground what's
kind<00:01:36.979> of<00:01:37.069> the<00:01:37.130> first<00:01:37.310> quarter<00:01:37.789> of<00:01:37.880> it<00:01:37.969> like

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
kind of the first quarter of it like

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:39.849 
kind of the first quarter of it like
well<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:38.719> first<00:01:38.929> quarter<00:01:39.259> is<00:01:39.380> not<00:01:39.560> quite<00:01:39.829> like

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:39.859 
well the first quarter is not quite like

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:41.739 
well the first quarter is not quite like
we<00:01:40.069> are<00:01:40.189> here<00:01:40.520> when<00:01:40.700> of<00:01:40.969> course<00:01:41.179> in<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:41.389> final

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
we are here when of course in the final

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:43.120 
we are here when of course in the final
quarter<00:01:42.049> gear<00:01:42.229> but<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.439> first<00:01:42.649> quarter<00:01:43.009> is<00:01:43.069> a

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
quarter gear but the first quarter is a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.099 
quarter gear but the first quarter is a
bit<00:01:43.340> more<00:01:43.549> of<00:01:43.609> a<00:01:43.700> gradual<00:01:44.090> incline<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.810> stairs

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:45.109 
bit more of a gradual incline the stairs

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:46.690 
bit more of a gradual incline the stairs
are<00:01:45.350> a<00:01:45.380> little<00:01:45.590> bit<00:01:45.679> farther<00:01:45.950> apart<00:01:46.159> a<00:01:46.490> little

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
are a little bit farther apart a little

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.580 
are a little bit farther apart a little
bit<00:01:46.880> raw<00:01:47.119> here<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:47.869> it's<00:01:47.990> a<00:01:48.020> good<00:01:48.139> way<00:01:48.289> to<00:01:48.350> sort

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
bit raw here so it's a good way to sort

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.499 
bit raw here so it's a good way to sort
of<00:01:48.679> ease<00:01:48.889> your<00:01:49.520> way<00:01:49.639> into<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:50.029> grind<00:01:50.209> as<00:01:50.420> it

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
of ease your way into the grind as it

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.609 
of ease your way into the grind as it
were<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:50.840> it's<00:01:50.959> a<00:01:50.990> little<00:01:51.170> bit<00:01:51.289> of<00:01:51.350> slower

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
were and it's a little bit of slower

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:52.870 
were and it's a little bit of slower

people coming up behind us for sure
we're<00:01:58.819> one<00:01:58.939> gradual<00:01:59.450> very<00:01:59.689> deliberate<00:02:00.139> steps

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
we're one gradual very deliberate steps

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.929 
we're one gradual very deliberate steps
here<00:02:00.649> exactly<00:02:01.069> we're<00:02:01.340> gonna<00:02:01.429> stop<00:02:01.700> right<00:02:01.909> now

here exactly we're gonna stop right now

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:02.980 
here exactly we're gonna stop right now
because<00:02:02.179> we<00:02:02.240> need<00:02:02.359> to<00:02:02.479> learn<00:02:02.630> a<00:02:02.659> little<00:02:02.899> bit

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
because we need to learn a little bit

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.269 
because we need to learn a little bit
here<00:02:03.170> obviously<00:02:03.679> again<00:02:03.859> our<00:02:03.979> serve<00:02:04.130> in<00:02:04.249> that

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:04.279 
here obviously again our serve in that

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:06.399 
here obviously again our serve in that
final<00:02:04.609> quarter<00:02:04.939> how<00:02:05.060> many<00:02:05.209> steps<00:02:05.719> are<00:02:06.079> on<00:02:06.319> the

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
final quarter how many steps are on the

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.559 
final quarter how many steps are on the
grind<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:06.889> clearly<00:02:07.490> it's<00:02:07.609> not<00:02:07.729> all<00:02:07.939> actual

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
grind and clearly it's not all actual

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.020 
grind and clearly it's not all actual
steps<00:02:08.840> no<00:02:09.170> there's<00:02:09.619> about<00:02:09.800> 2800<00:02:10.490> steps<00:02:10.759> on<00:02:10.940> the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
steps no there's about 2800 steps on the

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.370 
steps no there's about 2800 steps on the
grind<00:02:11.240> so<00:02:11.450> of<00:02:11.510> course<00:02:11.690> it's<00:02:11.959> a<00:02:12.050> quite<00:02:12.349> a

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
grind so of course it's a quite a

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.510 
grind so of course it's a quite a
workout

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
workout

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.280 
workout
like<00:02:14.300> I<00:02:14.360> was<00:02:14.540> saying<00:02:14.690> at<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.780> bottom<00:02:15.080> it's<00:02:15.230> a

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
like I was saying at the bottom it's a

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.600 
like I was saying at the bottom it's a
little<00:02:15.470> bit<00:02:15.560> more<00:02:15.680> of<00:02:15.740> a<00:02:15.800> gradual<00:02:16.160> incline<00:02:16.430> to

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
little bit more of a gradual incline to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.280 
little bit more of a gradual incline to
start<00:02:16.910> once<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.390> get<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.600> that<00:02:17.720> corner<00:02:18.020> mark

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
start once you get to that corner mark

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.200 
start once you get to that corner mark
halfway<00:02:18.740> mark<00:02:18.980> gets<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:19.550> little<00:02:19.730> bit<00:02:19.820> steeper

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
halfway mark gets a little bit steeper

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.120 
halfway mark gets a little bit steeper
there's<00:02:20.390> some<00:02:20.510> more<00:02:20.600> stairs<00:02:21.020> and<00:02:21.920> then<00:02:22.040> when

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
there's some more stairs and then when

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.500 
there's some more stairs and then when
you<00:02:22.190> get<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.370> this<00:02:22.430> point<00:02:22.640> of<00:02:22.790> course<00:02:23.030> it's<00:02:23.330> not

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
you get to this point of course it's not

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.150 
you get to this point of course it's not
even<00:02:23.810> quite<00:02:23.960> stairs<00:02:24.320> there's<00:02:24.620> some<00:02:24.710> rocks<00:02:24.920> you

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
even quite stairs there's some rocks you

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.130 
even quite stairs there's some rocks you
have<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.340> clamber<00:02:25.550> over<00:02:25.730> it's<00:02:26.090> it's<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.870> it's

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
have to clamber over it's it's a it's
