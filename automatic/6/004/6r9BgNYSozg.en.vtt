00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
keep in mind that food jacks usually are

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.240 
keep in mind that food jacks usually are
temporary<00:01:09.869> they're<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.619> period<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:11.010> time

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
temporary they're just a period of time

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.340 
temporary they're just a period of time
when<00:01:11.610> kids<00:01:11.880> are<00:01:12.060> going<00:01:12.360> very<00:01:12.510> rapidly<00:01:12.990> their

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
when kids are going very rapidly their

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.340 
when kids are going very rapidly their
taste<00:01:13.590> buds<00:01:13.680> are<00:01:13.979> changing<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.240> their<00:01:15.689> sense

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
taste buds are changing so their sense

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.010 
taste buds are changing so their sense
of<00:01:16.530> taste<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.070> very<00:01:17.220> acute<00:01:18.000> they<00:01:18.360> taste<00:01:18.689> things

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
of taste is very acute they taste things

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.160 
of taste is very acute they taste things
much<00:01:19.650> more<00:01:19.979> intensely<00:01:20.549> than<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:21.360> as<00:01:21.509> adults<00:01:21.810> do

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
much more intensely than we as adults do

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.929 
much more intensely than we as adults do
so<00:01:22.560> that's<00:01:22.890> something<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.250> want<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.580> keep<00:01:23.700> in

just make sure that you are offering

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.800 
just make sure that you are offering
different<00:01:28.500> things<00:01:28.979> also<00:01:29.759> keep<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.360> mind<00:01:30.390> that

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
different things also keep in mind that

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.899 
different things also keep in mind that

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
they are taller the portion size is very

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.999 
they are taller the portion size is very
small<00:02:02.310> as<00:02:03.299> they<00:02:03.479> do<00:02:03.540> start<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.140> older<00:02:04.530> get

to B grade school age the portion starts

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.499 
to B grade school age the portion starts
to<00:02:07.740> increase<00:02:08.099> somewhat<00:02:08.640> but<00:02:08.849> it's<00:02:08.970> still<00:02:09.239> not

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
to increase somewhat but it's still not

a<00:02:22.769> lot<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.519> concepts<00:02:24.030> are<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.209> same<00:02:24.329> the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
a lot of the concepts are the same the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.839 
a lot of the concepts are the same the
main<00:02:25.079> difference<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.829> that<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.310> protein<00:02:26.730> is

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
main difference is that the protein is

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.360 
main difference is that the protein is
coming<00:02:27.209> from<00:02:27.329> a<00:02:27.450> plant<00:02:27.750> source<00:02:27.840> as<00:02:28.319> opposed<00:02:29.220> to

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
coming from a plant source as opposed to

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.729 
coming from a plant source as opposed to
a<00:02:29.519> meat<00:02:29.879> source<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:31.019> just<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.349> couple<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.620> things

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
a meat source so just a couple of things

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.949 
a meat source so just a couple of things
to<00:02:31.950> keep<00:02:32.069> in<00:02:32.250> mind<00:02:32.489> when<00:02:32.790> raising<00:02:33.180> vegetarian
