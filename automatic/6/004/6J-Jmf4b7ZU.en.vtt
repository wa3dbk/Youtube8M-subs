00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.040
 hello gamer it's xxÃ¨me domaine 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.020
 I hope everything is fine with you 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.600
 perso at home it goes nickel 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.060
 so today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.820
 little tutorial that I will do at the same time 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.620
 on pc and on ps3 it's to see in 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.860
 done on a connection finally established a 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.440
 pc connection up to ps3 to be able to 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.260
 actually go to your pc from your 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.830
 ps3 then you will already need a 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.449
 software called ps3 media server 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:47.790
 so that will allow you to establish the 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:50.190
 connection and so is so here's one 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.030
 will start so you turn on already 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:58.020
 your ps3 and you will launch the only 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:02.010
 software just wait for them to get 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.989
 launch so do not worry I the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.540

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.430

 me for example I handed these two there 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.280
 who was on my desk so I copied 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.480

 you actually copy and copying 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:57.720
 directly on the ps3 so that copied it 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.859
 after you have it on your ps3 so 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.220
 it's the same for images and 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.829
