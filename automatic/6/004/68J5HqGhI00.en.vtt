this<00:01:24.330> physically<00:01:24.780> placed<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.619> centre<00:01:26.460> of

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
this physically placed in the centre of

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.940 
this physically placed in the centre of
London<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.020> clearly<00:01:28.290> makes<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.829> an

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.060 
London and so this clearly makes it an
ideal<00:01:29.040> platform<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:30.560> interacting<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.770> also
