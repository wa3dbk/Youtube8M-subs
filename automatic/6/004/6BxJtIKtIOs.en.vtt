00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello to all i'm going to show you 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.730
 today how to speed up and 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.870
 toey your mac 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.330
 several factors can lead to 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.620
 slowing down your computer too much 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.139
 open applications at the same time 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.849
 gone from ram and of course tons of 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.859
 duplicates that clutter your hard drive 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.750
 that's why the first thing to do 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.460
 is leaving all applications 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.480
 open 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.769
 you can also restarted 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.840
 regularly your computer 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.420
 some applications even once 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.529
 left still use memory 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.560
 only a restart of the computer 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.360
 allows to recover it to delete 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.660
 the duplicates you will need a 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.800
 software that does the work for you 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.500
 do not even imagine for a moment do this 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.690
 manually work the software that 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.890
 I used tied up it's the best 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.239
 file search software 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.579
 duplicates for mac that you can 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.739
 find it is the fastest the most 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.300
 expanded on and it is easy to 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.800
 use 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.379
 you can download it on www mcq 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.210
 up.com try the limited version 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.190
 Free 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.500
 once launched that's what they 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.390
 look like to run a search 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.760
 you have to choose the locations in 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.740
 which ones you want to search 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.890
 this can be any record or 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.119
 index even counted via the network 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.280
 he may also be sought in 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.619
 iphoto itunes libraries and aperture 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.759
 select the type of search 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.340
 searches are divided into ten 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.610
 collections are their type there at the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.110
 music photos apps 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.750
 but there is also research in the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.530
 emails the movies and the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.210
 pdf you can go into advanced mode and 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.829
 choose your own criteria so 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.259
 to run just about any of 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.310
 search that you can imagine 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.590
 I will look for faults to duplicate 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.759
 as an example the result 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.909
 will open in a new window 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.140
 which will look like this one thing that 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.970
 I really like in this program 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.700
 these two easily get them 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.290
 information about the elements found 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.270
 so you can quickly see them and 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.040
 display their path you can 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.990
 click the information button to 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.140
 view more information and a 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.399
 complete preview of the element 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.899
 you can manually drag 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.480
 elements that you want to manage in a 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.160
 manual basket 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.230
 remember also that tiger offers a 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.640
 automatic basket system that you 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.940
 will help to bring together the elements that 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.230
 you want to manage for example if you do not 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.030
 do not worry about where 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.770
 resident duplicate records you 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.780
 can directly removed from cart 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.239
 all the elements except an element for 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.010
 each group duplicate otherwise if you 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.900
 prefer to have specific files 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.950
 in your smart basket you 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.650
 can create a new one 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.060
 and he's giving birth to options will appear 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.180
 containing the specific criteria for 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.800
 each type of files for example you 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.380
 can decide to collect all the 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.209
 oldest images once 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.400

 copy them back up and burn them 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.049
 on a cd export the items found 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.280
 or substitute them with aliases this 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.380

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.840
