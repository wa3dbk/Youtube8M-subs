00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
off put it back on just to get into the

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.790 
off put it back on just to get into the
form<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.940> want<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:54.690> just<00:01:54.960> do<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.409> like

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
form you want you can just do it like

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.060 
form you want you can just do it like
this<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.690> when<00:01:57.690> you<00:01:57.780> want<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.140> fill<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.530> push

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
this so when you want that fill you push

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.950 
this so when you want that fill you push
up<00:01:59.690> and<00:02:00.690> adjust<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.670> want<00:02:02.940> up<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.780> cur

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
up and adjust and you want up just cur

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.880 
up and adjust and you want up just cur
if<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.290> push<00:02:04.590> down<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.090> guess<00:02:06.710> well<00:02:07.710> that's
