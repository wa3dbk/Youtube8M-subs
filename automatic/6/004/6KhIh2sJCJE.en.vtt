00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.370
 this knowledge center rightly told me that i was born on the show floor 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.369
 the robot has to cost them the entire race up to 12,000 if necessary 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.879
 be careful like the Swedish boat 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.369
 used protection that are all things that need two men 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.659
 so it ran 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:22.239
 may fall 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.239
 at some at some times 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.349
 but the system s to road safety is 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.090
 it is bustling the bus applies afterwards and there is nothing in between 

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:36.370
 one except here and there the tube that becomes British as a buzzword 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.330
 and derby narrowing and that widening and the air situation we have 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.810
 a warm voice in the symphony the folk music monkey and time must be dynamic 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.780
 well what do that cooperation until though transported I can send for all that 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.450
 Many countries live in the case of these points 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.519
 the operation of the combustion chamber there also leaked out during the broadcast 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.969
 so double 12 the gas that explodes 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.160
 then had all directions from it is a steward busy 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.380
 the escapes 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.720
 thereby increasing the speed of the gas 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.840
 we received belkin hasselaer and a vacuum 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.119
 but often come 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.990
 the butcher pressure so that draws all the air in, so it pulls 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.729
 someone is that 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:20.680
 recorded 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.010
 but the sky is also drawn by 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.670
 with that it is a natural way of being busy and getting tired of it 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.000
 timo withdrawn 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.370
 this gas pipeline gets grass play here 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.470
 it also exploded any editors 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.380
 if the system is over again and that is the fun and the 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.090
 van rompuy that was and we worked a specific one but also the name of 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.070
 the percent 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.360
 After having watched it according to all we have seen it is the diameter of 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.460
 this scholarship 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.890
 smaller by the diameter 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.070
 from December 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.700
 and 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.920
 that matter 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.750
 so put. with a pity that I already had the grass green along the british 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.210
 just too late outside 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.259
 the time was not there 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.640
 But then the first one comes to broaden contact and the story 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.999
 this broadening ensures that 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:15.269
 the circulation always in this direction the debate the diameter three international matches 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.770
 slows down the fast clearly has a cycling track 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:22.609
 lagerback 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.909
 because here 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:26.149
 I actually thought so 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:28.740
 according to pressure but have it printed 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.079
 the situation always becomes work and it immediately involves 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.360
 it is because of that 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.229
 it is the turn of most British people who go outside on Wednesday 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:37.739
 Mon longest day 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.879
 even more important point when I speak on a cargo bike that the ministry is in 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.319
 but in that city 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.310
 vandereycken 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.349
 it's just all possible 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.389
 and philips i have a little bit of kafka the anti was no longer performing ma
