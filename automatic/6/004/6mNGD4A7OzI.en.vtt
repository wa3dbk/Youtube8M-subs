which I didn't notice until far too late

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.240 
which I didn't notice until far too late
as<00:03:13.599> the<00:03:14.109> druid<00:03:14.319> started<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.680> run<00:03:14.829> away<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.159> was

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
as the druid started to run away it was

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.770 
as the druid started to run away it was
able<00:03:15.519> to<00:03:15.609> get<00:03:15.730> off<00:03:15.819> a<00:03:15.909> quick<00:03:16.120> hibernate<00:03:16.540> on<00:03:16.659> him

able to get off a quick hibernate on him
which<00:03:17.139> is<00:03:17.319> great<00:03:17.650> because<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.489> locks<00:03:18.699> the

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
which is great because it locks the

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.939 
which is great because it locks the
druid<00:03:19.209> in<00:03:19.329> place<00:03:19.599> for<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:19.989> full<00:03:20.199> ten<00:03:20.500> seconds

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
great we keep them in place and I run

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.110 
great we keep them in place and I run
back<00:03:41.730> over<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:43.160> make<00:03:44.160> sure<00:03:44.370> that<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.760> foul<00:03:44.940> pop

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120

is able to get on the druid for a little

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.920 
is able to get on the druid for a little
while<00:03:47.220> there<00:03:47.520> and<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:48.150> realized<00:03:48.330> that<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.630> need

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
while there and I realized that I need

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.000 
while there and I realized that I need
to<00:03:48.960> be<00:03:49.080> a<00:03:49.110> little<00:03:49.140> bit<00:03:49.380> more<00:03:49.530> careful<00:03:49.830> with<00:03:49.920> the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
to be a little bit more careful with the

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.760 
to be a little bit more careful with the
pet<00:03:50.190> there<00:03:50.430> it's<00:03:50.670> very<00:03:50.940> crucial<00:03:51.600> for<00:03:52.020> us<00:03:52.380> to<00:03:52.620> be

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
pet there it's very crucial for us to be

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.150 
pet there it's very crucial for us to be
able<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:53.300> make<00:03:54.300> sure<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.740> past<00:03:55.950> day<00:03:56.100> is

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
able to make sure that the past day is

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.970 
able to make sure that the past day is
alive<00:03:56.570> he's<00:03:57.570> very<00:03:57.600> integral<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.620> this<00:03:58.740> fight

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
alive he's very integral to this fight

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.500 
alive he's very integral to this fight
so<00:03:59.790> one<00:03:59.880> of<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.000> things<00:04:00.030> you're<00:04:00.209> going<00:04:00.300> to<00:04:00.360> see

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
so one of the things you're going to see

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.870 
so one of the things you're going to see
me<00:04:00.690> doing<00:04:01.140> is<00:04:01.380> ceasing<00:04:02.190> back<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.640> forth

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
me doing is ceasing back and forth

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.270 
me doing is ceasing back and forth
between<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.810> warrior<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.470> druid<00:04:04.920> based

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
between the warrior and the druid based

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.280 
between the warrior and the druid based
on<00:04:05.430> how<00:04:05.520> many<00:04:05.580> hots<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.360> opponents<00:04:06.959> have<00:04:07.110> on

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
on how many hots the opponents have on

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.380 
on how many hots the opponents have on
them<00:04:07.470> because<00:04:07.830> in<00:04:08.160> some<00:04:08.310> cases<00:04:08.580> it's<00:04:08.880> actually

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
them because in some cases it's actually

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.960 
them because in some cases it's actually
more<00:04:10.260> mana<00:04:10.560> efficient<00:04:11.040> for<00:04:11.430> me<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.850> use<00:04:11.940> a

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
more mana efficient for me to use a

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.660 
more mana efficient for me to use a
cyclone<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.720> deny<00:04:13.140> them<00:04:13.170> heels<00:04:13.950> than<00:04:14.430> it<00:04:14.550> is

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
cyclone and deny them heels than it is

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.720 
cyclone and deny them heels than it is
for<00:04:15.120> us<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.720> try<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:15.930> put<00:04:16.109> dps<00:04:16.470> on<00:04:16.680> them<00:04:16.859> one<00:04:17.640> of

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
for us to try to put dps on them one of

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.430 
for us to try to put dps on them one of
the<00:04:17.790> things<00:04:17.940> also<00:04:18.239> that<00:04:18.390> happens<00:04:18.870> here<00:04:19.260> is

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
the things also that happens here is

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.970 
the things also that happens here is
that<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:20.790> warrior<00:04:21.120> starts<00:04:21.480> putting

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
that the warrior starts putting

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.130 
that the warrior starts putting
hamstrings<00:04:22.980> and<00:04:23.130> such<00:04:23.340> on<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:24.210> puppies<00:04:24.870> so

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
hamstrings and such on the puppies so

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.080 
hamstrings and such on the puppies so
that<00:04:25.380> we're<00:04:25.620> actually<00:04:25.830> not<00:04:26.070> able<00:04:26.580> to<00:04:26.790> keep<00:04:26.940> up

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
with the druid it looks like the puppy

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.740 
with the druid it looks like the puppy
is<00:04:28.890> going<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.160> go<00:04:29.250> down<00:04:29.280> I<00:04:29.790> may<00:04:30.030> be<00:04:30.090> spending<00:04:30.660> a

one<00:04:44.940> of<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.090> things<00:04:45.210> we<00:04:45.390> started<00:04:45.690> doing

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
one of the things we started doing

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.480 
one of the things we started doing
especially<00:04:46.800> what<00:04:46.950> you're<00:04:47.100> there<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.430> the

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
higher brackets is hard summoning pepes

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.310 
higher brackets is hard summoning pepes
now<00:04:50.180> since<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.330> summon<00:04:51.660> takes<00:04:51.870> a<00:04:52.020> lot<00:04:52.169> of<00:04:52.200> time

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
now since the summon takes a lot of time

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
puppy that's still alive so it actually
