this piece up you know it's not too hard
but<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.210> could<00:00:42.450> do<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.660> but<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.110> think<00:00:43.379> today<00:00:43.530> it's

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
but I could do it but I think today it's

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.830 
but I could do it but I think today it's
it's<00:00:44.160> warming<00:00:44.610> up<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.090> raining<00:00:45.270> instead

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
it's warming up so it's raining instead

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.299 
it's warming up so it's raining instead
of<00:00:45.930> snowing<00:00:46.200> even<00:00:46.440> though<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:46.829> do<00:00:46.950> have<00:00:46.980> some

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
of snowing even though we do have some

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.760 
of snowing even though we do have some
ice<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> floor<00:00:48.030> over<00:00:48.360> here<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.079> thought

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
ice in the floor over here but I thought

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.029 
ice in the floor over here but I thought
I<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:50.390> just<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.539> appease<00:00:51.840> all<00:00:52.170> our<00:00:52.410> youtubers

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.410 
I just just to appease all our youtubers
and<00:00:53.219> keep<00:00:53.370> telling<00:00:53.699> me<00:00:53.760> what<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:53.969> ought<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.180> do

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
and also just to warm myself up a little

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.470 
and also just to warm myself up a little
bit<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.579> thought<00:00:56.850> I'd<00:00:56.969> kick<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.329> little

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480

there but this is all all you know done
up<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.490> everything<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:22.970> first<00:01:23.970> thing<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.210> got

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
up and everything and first thing I got

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.480 
up and everything and first thing I got
to<00:01:24.450> do<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.869> -<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.890> steering

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
to do with this - in is the steering

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.100 
to do with this - in is the steering
wheel<00:01:26.640> often<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.299> remember<00:01:27.659> while<00:01:27.869> back

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
wheel often I remember while back

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.200 
wheel often I remember while back
somebody<00:01:28.409> was<00:01:28.710> asking<00:01:28.920> me<00:01:29.189> how<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.460> do<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.970> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
somebody was asking me how to do that I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.270 
somebody was asking me how to do that I
got<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> steering<00:01:31.409> wheel<00:01:31.439> puller<00:01:31.770> if<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.040> need<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
got a steering wheel puller if I need it

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.980 
got a steering wheel puller if I need it
so<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.549> think<00:01:32.610> that's<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.240> what<00:01:33.720> I'm<00:01:33.810> going<00:01:33.960> to
