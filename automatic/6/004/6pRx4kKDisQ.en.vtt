do if cars is cars will never be able to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.399 
do if cars is cars will never be able to
get<00:01:11.340> fixed<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.630> you'll<00:01:12.810> never<00:01:12.869> be<00:01:13.200> able<00:01:13.260> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
get fixed like you'll never be able to

get fixed like you'll never be able to
repair<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> car<00:01:14.010> because<00:01:14.430> you're<00:01:14.610> probably

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
repair a car because you're probably

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.140

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
never be able to find a mechanic I think

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.060 
never be able to find a mechanic I think
cars<00:01:18.479> should<00:01:18.780> automatically<00:01:19.350> get<00:01:19.560> fixed<00:01:19.979> if

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
cars should automatically get fixed if

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.100 
cars should automatically get fixed if
you<00:01:20.189> park<00:01:20.490> them<00:01:20.640> here<00:01:20.939> without<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.330> mechanic<00:01:21.570> I

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
you park them here without a mechanic I

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.630 
you park them here without a mechanic I
