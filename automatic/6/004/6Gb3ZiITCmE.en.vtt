00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.629 

okay<00:00:00.690> so<00:00:00.750> this<00:00:00.989> video<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.709> showing<00:00:02.490> the

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
okay so this video is showing the

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.070 
okay so this video is showing the
difference<00:00:02.879> between<00:00:02.970> post<00:00:03.330> baster<00:00:03.720> format

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
difference between post baster format

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.080 
difference between post baster format
and<00:00:04.310> Euler<00:00:05.420> driven<00:00:06.560> de<00:00:07.560> forma<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.220> but<00:00:08.790> in<00:00:08.940> both

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
and Euler driven de forma so but in both

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.730 
and Euler driven de forma so but in both
cases<00:00:09.150> we're<00:00:09.690> using<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.990> same<00:00:10.200> blend<00:00:10.469> shape

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
cases we're using the same blend shape

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.220 
cases we're using the same blend shape
we're<00:00:11.309> just<00:00:11.519> using<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:12.059> different<00:00:12.240> method<00:00:12.599> to

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
we're just using a different method to

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.519 
we're just using a different method to
get<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:14.549> new<00:00:14.759> position<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.809> where<00:00:16.199> the

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
get the the new position of where the

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.680 
get the the new position of where the
blend<00:00:16.770> shape<00:00:16.949> should<00:00:17.130> fire<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:18.240> I'm<00:00:18.539> just

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
blend shape should fire so I'm just

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.240 
blend shape should fire so I'm just
going<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.900> give<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.109> an<00:00:19.230> example<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
going to give you an example of the the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.939 
going to give you an example of the the
way<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.430> we've<00:00:20.699> used<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.000> far<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.630> that's

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
way that we've used so far and that's

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.029 
way that we've used so far and that's
using<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.130> traditional<00:00:24.830> correcting<00:00:25.830> blend

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
using a traditional correcting blend

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.380 
using a traditional correcting blend
shape<00:00:26.250> which<00:00:26.400> we've<00:00:26.580> we've<00:00:26.910> used<00:00:27.150> with<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
shape which we've we've used with the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.800 
shape which we've we've used with the
extract<00:00:27.689> deltas<00:00:28.109> plugin<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.480> I'm<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.689> going

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
extract deltas plugin and I'm just going

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.870 
extract deltas plugin and I'm just going
to<00:00:30.869> hook<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.289> up<00:00:31.470> here<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:31.769> we<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.489> see<00:00:32.730> this

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
to hook this up here so we can see this

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.360 
to hook this up here so we can see this
is<00:00:33.030> what<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.649> what<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.950> mesh<00:00:35.130> looks

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
is what that this is what the mesh looks

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.620 
is what that this is what the mesh looks
like<00:00:35.579> around<00:00:35.790> here<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.180> particularly

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
like around here in particularly

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.049 
like around here in particularly
shoulder<00:00:37.200> area<00:00:37.469> looks<00:00:37.649> looks<00:00:37.980> okay<00:00:38.280> but<00:00:38.309> we

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
shoulder area looks looks okay but we

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.299 
shoulder area looks looks okay but we
can<00:00:39.210> get<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.510> bit<00:00:39.629> better<00:00:40.160> with<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
can get it a bit better with the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.010 
can get it a bit better with the
corrective<00:00:41.640> blend<00:00:41.850> shape<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.360> I'm<00:00:42.600> just<00:00:42.809> going

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
corrective blend shape so I'm just going

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.990 
corrective blend shape so I'm just going
to<00:00:43.079> unmute<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.739> guy<00:00:44.010> here<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.579> unmute

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
to unmute this guy here so unmute

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000 
to unmute this guy here so unmute
selected<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.170> see<00:00:46.410> there's<00:00:46.710> our

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
selected and you can see there's our

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.270 
selected and you can see there's our
change<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.360> mesh<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:48.780> far<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.350> select<00:00:49.649> that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
change in the mesh so far to select that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.880 
change in the mesh so far to select that
blend<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.879> there<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.570> go<00:00:51.660> select<00:00:51.930> node<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.860> can

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
blend in there and go select node we can

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.650 
blend in there and go select node we can
see<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.340> difference<00:00:53.610> between<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.059> blend<00:00:54.390> on

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
see the difference between that blend on

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.439 
see the difference between that blend on
and<00:00:54.870> off<00:00:55.250> there<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.579> I've<00:00:56.699> hooked<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.059> up<00:00:57.239> by

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
and off there and I've hooked this up by

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.410 
and off there and I've hooked this up by
row<00:00:57.510> driven<00:00:57.840> key<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.699> actual<00:01:00.059> arm

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
row driven key so that the actual arm

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.080 
row driven key so that the actual arm
when<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.050> comes<00:01:01.260> down<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.859> slowly<00:01:02.250> keys<00:01:02.879> that

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
when it comes down it slowly keys that

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.329 
when it comes down it slowly keys that
on<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.019> at<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.860> frame<00:01:05.070> one

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
on so you can see it at the frame one

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.120 
on so you can see it at the frame one
that<00:01:06.240> blend<00:01:06.450> shape<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:07.080> at<00:01:07.200> all<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.619> as

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that blend shape is not on at all and as

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.000 
that blend shape is not on at all and as
it<00:01:08.310> comes<00:01:08.490> down<00:01:09.290> you<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.470> see<00:01:10.710> over<00:01:10.890> there

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
it comes down you can see over there

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.100 
it comes down you can see over there
that<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.490> now<00:01:11.700> one<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.570> when<00:01:12.780> we've<00:01:12.960> hit

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
that it's now one and when we've hit

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.649 
that it's now one and when we've hit
this<00:01:13.260> nice<00:01:13.560> spot<00:01:13.860> now<00:01:14.670> that's<00:01:15.030> all<00:01:15.210> well<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
this nice spot now that's all well and

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.120 
this nice spot now that's all well and
good<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.200> working<00:01:16.560> exactly<00:01:16.770> how<00:01:17.070> we

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
good and it's working exactly how we

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.420 
good and it's working exactly how we
wanted<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> however<00:01:18.530> there<00:01:19.530> are<00:01:19.650> times<00:01:20.130> when

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
wanted to however there are times when

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.760 
wanted to however there are times when
this<00:01:20.580> falls<00:01:20.850> down<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:22.140> reason<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.650> this

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
this falls down and the reason for this

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.960 
this falls down and the reason for this
is<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:24.140> Euler<00:01:25.140> rotations<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.040> we<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.790> have

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
is that Euler rotations so we can have

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.819 
is that Euler rotations so we can have
lots<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.479> different<00:01:27.560> combinations<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.680> these

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
lots of different combinations of these

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.710 
lots of different combinations of these
numbers<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.729> exactly<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.270> same<00:01:30.479> angle

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
numbers and have exactly the same angle

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.660 
numbers and have exactly the same angle
and<00:01:31.350> I'm<00:01:31.710> going<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.920> show<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.250> requires

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
and I'm going to show you this requires

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.539 
and I'm going to show you this requires
a<00:01:33.170> real<00:01:34.170> knowledge<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.650> gimbal<00:01:35.070> lock<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.369> oil

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
a real knowledge of gimbal lock and oil

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.420 
a real knowledge of gimbal lock and oil
rotation<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:37.049> have<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> look<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.220> on

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
rotation so so have a look at that on

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.469 
rotation so so have a look at that on
the<00:01:38.549> web<00:01:38.729> if<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.570> can<00:01:39.829> and<00:01:41.240> what<00:01:42.240> I'm<00:01:42.299> going<00:01:42.420> to

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
the web if you can and what I'm going to

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.359 
the web if you can and what I'm going to
do<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.780> quickly<00:01:42.990> going<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.590> show<00:01:43.770> how<00:01:44.220> this

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
do is quickly going to show how this

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.429 
do is quickly going to show how this
works<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:44.939> we're<00:01:45.479> rotating<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.049> arm<00:01:46.290> around

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
works so we're rotating this arm around

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.889 
works so we're rotating this arm around
and<00:01:47.009> going<00:01:47.520> into<00:01:47.729> exactly<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.450> same<00:01:48.689> position

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
and going into exactly the same position

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.170 
and going into exactly the same position
and<00:01:49.409> now<00:01:50.009> what<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.460> see<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.119> all

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
and now what you can see is that all

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.800 
and now what you can see is that all
these<00:01:51.799> details<00:01:52.799> here<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.610> 180<00:01:53.880> negative<00:01:54.450> 180

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
these details here is 180 negative 180

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.179 
these details here is 180 negative 180
and<00:01:55.079> now<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.829> our<00:01:55.890> rotation<00:01:56.460> Z<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:57.030> 110

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
and now that our rotation Z is 110

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.069 
and now that our rotation Z is 110
rather<00:01:59.189> than<00:01:59.430> negative<00:01:59.670> 70<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.780> was<00:02:00.930> just

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
rather than negative 70 so if I was just

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.889 
rather than negative 70 so if I was just
to<00:02:01.200> scroll<00:02:02.070> back<00:02:02.100> here<00:02:02.520> watch<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.180> rotate<00:02:03.659> Z

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
to scroll back here watch this rotate Z

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.480 
to scroll back here watch this rotate Z
which<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.439> number<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.860> we're<00:02:05.040> using<00:02:05.250> to

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
which is the number that we're using to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.540 
which is the number that we're using to
drive<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.299> blend<00:02:06.540> shape<00:02:06.979> as<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.250> scroll<00:02:08.489> back

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
drive the blend shape as I scroll back

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.479 
drive the blend shape as I scroll back
it's<00:02:09.179> now<00:02:09.390> negative<00:02:09.810> 70<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.679> as<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.250> scroll

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
it's now negative 70 and as I scroll

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.840 
it's now negative 70 and as I scroll
forward<00:02:11.940> in

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
forward in

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.710 
forward in
now<00:02:13.000> at<00:02:13.210> 100<00:02:13.780> positive<00:02:14.230> 110<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:16.120> if<00:02:16.360> i<00:02:16.480> click

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
now at 100 positive 110 so if i click

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.350 
now at 100 positive 110 so if i click
just<00:02:17.470> here<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:18.220> can<00:02:18.370> see<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.820> difference<00:02:19.180> in

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
just here you can see the difference in

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.560 
just here you can see the difference in
the<00:02:19.540> poses<00:02:19.960> is<00:02:20.140> identical<00:02:20.860> but<00:02:21.580> with<00:02:21.880> one<00:02:22.150> the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
the poses is identical but with one the

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.900 
the poses is identical but with one the
blend<00:02:22.780> shape<00:02:23.020> is<00:02:23.320> firing<00:02:23.710> incoming<00:02:24.520> on<00:02:24.640> this

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
blend shape is firing incoming on this

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.180 
blend shape is firing incoming on this
is<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.120> corrective<00:02:25.570> and<00:02:25.750> with<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.440> other<00:02:26.620> the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
is the corrective and with the other the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.340 
is the corrective and with the other the
blend<00:02:27.430> shape<00:02:27.640> has<00:02:27.880> failed<00:02:28.210> to<00:02:28.510> fire<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.230> this

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
blend shape has failed to fire and this

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.290 
blend shape has failed to fire and this
is<00:02:29.530> because<00:02:29.890> this<00:02:30.100> rotate<00:02:30.580> Z<00:02:30.820> value<00:02:31.150> is

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
is because this rotate Z value is

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.240 
is because this rotate Z value is
actually<00:02:31.450> completely<00:02:32.080> different<00:02:32.590> rotation

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
actually completely different rotation

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.130 
actually completely different rotation
value<00:02:33.700> then<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.810> one<00:02:35.020> are<00:02:35.980> at<00:02:36.490> frame<00:02:36.820> 10<00:02:37.210> now

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
value then the one are at frame 10 now

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.410 
value then the one are at frame 10 now

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
this is Euler rotations guys this is how

Maya<00:02:40.870> works<00:02:41.200> by<00:02:41.470> default<00:02:41.860> with<00:02:42.010> these<00:02:42.190> numbers

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
Maya works by default with these numbers

there's<00:02:43.420> not<00:02:43.570> a<00:02:43.600> lot<00:02:43.870> we<00:02:43.990> can<00:02:44.110> do<00:02:44.260> about<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.560> now

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
there's not a lot we can do about it now

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.290 
there's not a lot we can do about it now
one<00:02:45.040> thing<00:02:45.190> is<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.490> could<00:02:45.610> just<00:02:45.670> go<00:02:45.940> back<00:02:46.090> and

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
one thing is you could just go back and

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.530 
one thing is you could just go back and
fix<00:02:46.570> this<00:02:46.750> up<00:02:46.810> if<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.590> are<00:02:47.800> animating<00:02:48.400> f<00:02:48.670> FK

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
fix this up if you are animating f FK

and<00:02:54.790> these<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.750> numbers<00:02:56.050> can<00:02:56.200> really<00:02:56.530> be

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
and these the numbers can really be

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.700 
and these the numbers can really be
quite<00:02:56.890> arbitrary<00:02:58.020> depending<00:02:59.020> on<00:02:59.140> how<00:02:59.500> they

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
quite arbitrary depending on how they

follow in the AI K so unfortunately a

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.050 
follow in the AI K so unfortunately a
lot<00:03:02.980> of<00:03:03.070> times<00:03:03.250> we<00:03:03.400> don't<00:03:03.580> really<00:03:03.760> have

in<00:03:19.540> things<00:03:19.750> like<00:03:19.810> shoulders<00:03:20.380> and<00:03:20.620> really

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
in things like shoulders and really

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.870 
in things like shoulders and really
joints<00:03:22.000> that<00:03:22.120> have<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.300> very<00:03:22.630> high<00:03:22.780> range

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880

degrees degrees of freedom but it still

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.660 
degrees degrees of freedom but it still
happens<00:03:28.210> so<00:03:29.010> particularly<00:03:30.010> in<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.250> shoulders

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
happens so particularly in the shoulders

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.330 
happens so particularly in the shoulders
where<00:03:30.880> we<00:03:31.000> always<00:03:31.270> notice<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:31.690> as<00:03:31.810> riggers<00:03:32.560> now

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340

what<00:03:33.670> I'm<00:03:33.760> going<00:03:33.910> to<00:03:33.940> do<00:03:34.090> here<00:03:34.390> is<00:03:34.540> come<00:03:34.780> down

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
what I'm going to do here is come down

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.540 
what I'm going to do here is come down
here<00:03:34.990> I'm<00:03:35.380> going<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.770> mute<00:03:35.980> this<00:03:36.100> again<00:03:36.400> by

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
here I'm going to mute this again by

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.660 
here I'm going to mute this again by
switching<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:37.030> off<00:03:37.650> on<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.770> Euler<00:03:39.100> rotation

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
switching it off on the Euler rotation

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.740 
switching it off on the Euler rotation
demo<00:03:39.970> so<00:03:40.720> let's<00:03:40.900> just<00:03:41.080> mute<00:03:41.290> that<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:43.600> I'm

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
demo so let's just mute that and I'm

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.020 
demo so let's just mute that and I'm
going<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:43.990> come<00:03:44.170> over<00:03:44.200> here<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:45.070> the<00:03:45.700> next

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
going to come over here to the next

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.760 
going to come over here to the next
we've<00:03:46.240> got<00:03:46.390> another<00:03:46.630> blend<00:03:47.110> shape<00:03:47.320> here<00:03:47.590> and

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
we've got another blend shape here and

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.450 
we've got another blend shape here and
this<00:03:48.370> one<00:03:48.550> here<00:03:48.580> is<00:03:49.000> are<00:03:49.360> being<00:03:49.840> driven<00:03:50.080> by<00:03:50.530> a

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
this one here is are being driven by a

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.330 
this one here is are being driven by a
pose<00:03:52.120> based<00:03:52.420> performance<00:03:52.600> so<00:03:53.410> if<00:03:53.950> we<00:03:54.160> go

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
pose based performance so if we go

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.120 
pose based performance so if we go
unmute<00:03:54.820> selected<00:03:55.270> now<00:03:55.480> you<00:03:56.350> can<00:03:56.500> see<00:03:56.710> that<00:03:56.920> I'm

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
unmute selected now you can see that I'm

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.130 
unmute selected now you can see that I'm
still<00:03:57.670> coming<00:03:57.850> down<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.420> our<00:03:58.540> blend<00:03:58.780> shape<00:03:58.960> is

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
still coming down and our blend shape is

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.560 
still coming down and our blend shape is
firing<00:03:59.410> as<00:03:59.650> it<00:03:59.800> always<00:03:59.950> was<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.610> we've<00:04:01.390> still

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
firing as it always was and we've still

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.360 
firing as it always was and we've still
got<00:04:01.720> our<00:04:01.870> weird<00:04:02.110> animation<00:04:02.800> that<00:04:03.100> we<00:04:03.190> have

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
got our weird animation that we have

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.300 
got our weird animation that we have
here<00:04:03.670> part<00:04:04.510> two<00:04:04.810> here<00:04:05.050> but<00:04:05.710> now<00:04:05.890> you'll<00:04:06.100> notice

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
here part two here but now you'll notice

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.940 
here part two here but now you'll notice
that<00:04:06.520> both<00:04:06.700> these<00:04:07.000> two<00:04:07.240> poses<00:04:07.810> have<00:04:08.080> identical

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
that both these two poses have identical

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.370 
that both these two poses have identical
blend<00:04:09.460> shapes<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:09.970> in<00:04:10.450> fact<00:04:10.630> if<00:04:10.810> we<00:04:10.960> go<00:04:11.230> in

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
blend shapes and in fact if we go in

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.200 
blend shapes and in fact if we go in
here<00:04:11.410> and<00:04:11.860> have<00:04:12.220> a<00:04:12.250> look

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
here and have a look

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.560 
here and have a look
select<00:04:13.810> that<00:04:13.960> note<00:04:14.170> again<00:04:14.970> you<00:04:15.970> can<00:04:16.120> see<00:04:16.359> that

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
select that note again you can see that

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.340 
select that note again you can see that
that<00:04:16.780> node<00:04:17.739> has<00:04:17.980> fired<00:04:19.109> in<00:04:20.109> both

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
that node has fired in both

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.530 
that node has fired in both
circumstances<00:04:20.590> and<00:04:21.370> it's<00:04:21.820> identically<00:04:22.510> the

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
circumstances and it's identically the

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.260 
circumstances and it's identically the
same<00:04:22.720> number<00:04:23.320> so<00:04:23.620> post<00:04:24.310> Essbase<00:04:24.850> deformers

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
same number so post Essbase deformers

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.220 
same number so post Essbase deformers

and<00:04:26.320> not<00:04:26.470> oil<00:04:26.680> rotations<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:27.550> it's<00:04:27.700> a<00:04:27.790> little

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
and not oil rotations and it's a little

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.310 
and not oil rotations and it's a little
bit<00:04:28.150> more<00:04:28.270> accurate<00:04:28.690> for<00:04:28.870> this<00:04:28.990> sort<00:04:29.200> of<00:04:29.230> a

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
bit more accurate for this sort of a

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.380 
bit more accurate for this sort of a
thing<00:04:29.350> so<00:04:29.940> unfortunately<00:04:30.940> it's<00:04:31.030> a<00:04:31.060> little<00:04:31.090> bit

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390

a<00:04:38.020> plugin<00:04:38.340> but<00:04:39.340> there's<00:04:39.520> a<00:04:39.580> way<00:04:39.700> that<00:04:39.850> we<00:04:39.910> can

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
a plugin but there's a way that we can

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.850 
a plugin but there's a way that we can
do<00:04:40.180> it<00:04:40.300> without<00:04:40.420> that<00:04:40.780> plug-in<00:04:41.020> so<00:04:41.470> I'm<00:04:41.740> going

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
do it without that plug-in so I'm going

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.220 
do it without that plug-in so I'm going
to<00:04:41.890> show<00:04:42.040> you<00:04:42.070> how<00:04:42.280> to<00:04:42.340> set<00:04:42.880> that<00:04:42.910> up<00:04:43.090> in<00:04:43.750> this

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
to show you how to set that up in this

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.980 
to show you how to set that up in this
in<00:04:44.890> this<00:04:45.220> in<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:45.940> following<00:04:46.120> lessons<00:04:46.660> and

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
in this in the following lessons and

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.640 
in this in the following lessons and
okay<00:04:47.860> let's<00:04:48.070> get<00:04:48.220> right<00:04:48.370> into<00:04:48.430> it
