00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
so what I've had to do is to use the

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.370 
so what I've had to do is to use the
mineralized<00:02:49.400> skinfinish<00:02:50.400> powder<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.870> even

out my skin tone and so it looks like
this<00:02:54.600> otherwise<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.470> does<00:02:55.769> a<00:02:55.800> bit<00:02:56.430> too<00:02:56.640> doc<00:02:56.850> if

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
this otherwise it does a bit too doc if

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.830
