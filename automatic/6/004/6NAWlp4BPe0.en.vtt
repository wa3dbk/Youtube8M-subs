00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
played night b4 night at the moment

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.080 
played night b4 night at the moment
though<00:01:14.710> can<00:01:14.950> go<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.160> c4<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.770> maybe<00:01:18.400> even<00:01:18.610> like

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
though can go to c4 and maybe even like

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.560 
though can go to c4 and maybe even like
to<00:01:19.240> d5<00:01:19.690> later<00:01:20.380> or<00:01:20.890> D<00:01:21.160> Saints<00:01:21.550> so<00:01:22.510> Bishop<00:01:22.780> e3

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
to d5 later or D Saints so Bishop e3

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.820 
to d5 later or D Saints so Bishop e3
here<00:01:25.680> because<00:01:26.680> both<00:01:26.920> played<00:01:27.550> Bishop<00:01:28.110> d4<00:01:29.110> again

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
here because both played Bishop d4 again

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.440 
here because both played Bishop d4 again
so<00:01:29.950> he's<00:01:30.040> relying<00:01:30.340> on<00:01:30.460> this<00:01:30.550> tactical<00:01:31.060> idea

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
so he's relying on this tactical idea

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.570 
so he's relying on this tactical idea
that<00:01:31.750> if<00:01:31.930> takes<00:01:32.260> takes<00:01:32.710> takes<00:01:32.860> there's<00:01:33.430> might

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
that if takes takes takes there's might

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.720 
that if takes takes takes there's might
see<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:34.090> back<00:01:34.780> off<00:01:34.960> comp<00:01:35.440> off<00:01:35.560> took<00:01:35.740> anyway<00:01:36.190> and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
see to back off comp off took anyway and

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.270 
see to back off comp off took anyway and
played<00:01:37.060> night<00:01:37.300> a<00:01:37.450> 2<00:01:37.800> so<00:01:38.800> this<00:01:38.980> is<00:01:39.130> also

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
played night a 2 so this is also

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.920 
played night a 2 so this is also
possible<00:01:39.930> Knight<00:01:40.930> takes<00:01:41.200> rook<00:01:41.590> tanks<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:42.930> it

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
possible Knight takes rook tanks and it

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.740 
possible Knight takes rook tanks and it
looks<00:01:44.860> so<00:01:45.130> white<00:01:45.370> slightly<00:01:45.909> better<00:01:46.090> out<00:01:46.540> the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
looks so white slightly better out the

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.040 
looks so white slightly better out the
opening<00:01:47.190> here<00:01:48.960> um<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:52.210> bishop<00:01:52.810> you<00:01:52.960> know

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
opening here um this bishop you know

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.600 
opening here um this bishop you know
might<00:01:53.290> be<00:01:53.530> a<00:01:53.800> problem<00:01:54.670> piece<00:01:55.090> if<00:01:56.010> if<00:01:57.010> black<00:01:57.430> did

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
might be a problem piece if if black did

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.980 
might be a problem piece if if black did
take<00:01:57.820> on<00:01:58.000> d<00:01:58.150> 595<00:01:59.020> there's<00:01:59.350> Queen<00:01:59.590> d4<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:00.990> then

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
take on d 595 there's Queen d4 and then

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.130

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
I think comp off he unfortunately or

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.339 
I think comp off he unfortunately or
when<00:05:23.360> he<00:05:23.449> played<00:05:23.690> his<00:05:23.810> movie<00:05:24.020> i<00:05:24.080> think<00:05:24.289> his

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
when he played his movie i think his

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.010 
when he played his movie i think his
flag<00:05:24.620> must<00:05:24.830> have<00:05:25.009> fallen<00:05:25.160> as<00:05:25.430> well<00:05:25.690> so<00:05:26.690> he<00:05:26.840> lost

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
flag must have fallen as well so he lost

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.860 
flag must have fallen as well so he lost
i<00:05:27.320> believe<00:05:27.800> on<00:05:27.949> time<00:05:28.280> but<00:05:29.270> he's<00:05:29.449> got<00:05:29.660> great

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
i believe on time but he's got great

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.320 
i believe on time but he's got great
position<00:05:30.289> here<00:05:30.530> and<00:05:30.849> it's<00:05:31.849> really<00:05:32.120> winning

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
position here and it's really winning

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.110 
position here and it's really winning
for<00:05:32.570> white<00:05:32.750> I<00:05:32.780> think<00:05:32.990> I<00:05:33.699> let's<00:05:34.699> have<00:05:34.789> a<00:05:34.820> look<00:05:35.000> at

dangerous<00:06:10.070> i<00:06:10.159> think<00:06:10.340> comfort<00:06:10.669> was<00:06:10.849> prepared

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
dangerous i think comfort was prepared

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.820 
dangerous i think comfort was prepared
to<00:06:11.570> sack<00:06:12.199> the<00:06:12.229> bishop<00:06:13.389> if<00:06:14.389> this<00:06:15.349> were<00:06:15.500> has<00:06:15.650> been

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
to sack the bishop if this were has been

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.409 
to sack the bishop if this were has been
relayed<00:06:16.130> correctly<00:06:16.610> I<00:06:16.639> think<00:06:16.789> I<00:06:17.120> think<00:06:17.330> this

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
relayed correctly I think I think this

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.450 
relayed correctly I think I think this
Bishop<00:06:17.810> sake<00:06:18.050> let's<00:06:18.530> have<00:06:18.650> a<00:06:18.740> quick<00:06:19.009> check<00:06:19.310> on

Bishop sake let's have a quick check on
that<00:06:19.610> actually<00:06:20.090> just<00:06:20.509> to<00:06:20.599> make<00:06:20.780> sure<00:06:20.810> if<00:06:21.669> d1

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 
that actually just to make sure if d1

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.629 
that actually just to make sure if d1
white<00:06:23.360> has<00:06:23.870> an<00:06:24.229> advantage<00:06:24.620> I<00:06:25.009> think<00:06:25.039> according

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 
white has an advantage I think according

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:28.300 
white has an advantage I think according
to<00:06:25.669> ribka<00:06:26.449> so<00:06:27.259> even<00:06:27.650> though<00:06:27.740> he's<00:06:27.860> like<00:06:28.039> piece

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310

Bishop<00:06:37.159> c2

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 
Bishop c2

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.240 
Bishop c2

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.250 
97 so that officially father's 19 c 5 90

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.270 
97 so that officially father's 19 c 5 90
95<00:06:44.960> so<00:06:45.960> if<00:06:46.230> that's<00:06:46.440> the<00:06:46.560> case<00:06:46.680> the<00:06:46.890> pawns<00:06:47.100> are

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
95 so if that's the case the pawns are

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.580
