00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.949 

okay<00:00:01.709> guess<00:00:02.700> this<00:00:02.909> would<00:00:03.120> be<00:00:03.270> part<00:00:03.629> 4<00:00:03.929> of

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
okay guess this would be part 4 of

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.579 
okay guess this would be part 4 of
solving<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.589> cube<00:00:04.799> so<00:00:05.580> I've<00:00:06.390> got<00:00:06.839> my<00:00:07.109> little

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
solving the cube so I've got my little

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.020 
solving the cube so I've got my little
cube<00:00:07.980> here<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:10.160> again<00:00:11.160> this<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.519> petrous

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
cube here and again this is the petrous

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.450 
cube here and again this is the petrous
method<00:00:12.420> next<00:00:13.110> thing<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.469> want<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.830> do<00:00:14.219> is

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
method next thing that I want to do is

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.029 
method next thing that I want to do is
turn<00:00:15.360> this<00:00:15.540> into<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.839> two<00:00:16.109> by<00:00:16.320> two<00:00:16.350> by<00:00:16.500> three

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
turn this into a two by two by three

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.400 
turn this into a two by two by three
that<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.250> can<00:00:17.460> hold<00:00:17.699> on<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.150> so<00:00:18.869> let's<00:00:19.170> say<00:00:19.380> I

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
that I can hold on to so let's say I

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.200 
that I can hold on to so let's say I
shoot<00:00:19.800> up<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.279> white<00:00:20.820> red<00:00:21.449> green<00:00:21.920> side<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.850> I

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
shoot up the white red green side so I

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.240 
shoot up the white red green side so I
need<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> white<00:00:24.840> red<00:00:25.080> green<00:00:25.109> just<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:25.980> happens

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
need a white red green just so happens

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.349 
need a white red green just so happens
that<00:00:26.720> that<00:00:27.720> corner<00:00:28.500> piece<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.949> there<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:30.029> it's

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
that that corner piece is there but it's

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.749 
that that corner piece is there but it's
not<00:00:30.560> facing<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.740> right<00:00:31.920> way<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.520> need

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
not facing the right way so I need

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.299 
not facing the right way so I need
cleaning<00:00:33.180> up<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.540> top<00:00:33.860> so<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.890> can<00:00:35.130> do

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
cleaning up on top so you can do

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.040 
cleaning up on top so you can do
anything<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.000> want<00:00:36.090> just<00:00:36.630> do<00:00:36.899> not

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
anything that you want just do not

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.430 
anything that you want just do not
destroy<00:00:37.710> your<00:00:38.280> little<00:00:38.550> cube<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.079> means<00:00:40.320> i

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
destroy your little cube so that means i

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.139 
destroy your little cube so that means i
have<00:00:40.469> only<00:00:40.800> three<00:00:41.129> degrees<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.430> freedom<00:00:41.910> so

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
have only three degrees of freedom so

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.180 
have only three degrees of freedom so
i'm<00:00:42.270> going<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.480> move<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.890> I'm<00:00:44.010> not

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
i'm going to move this and I'm not

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.369 
i'm going to move this and I'm not
destroying<00:00:44.670> my<00:00:44.910> cube<00:00:45.210> I'm<00:00:45.870> going<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.110> move<00:00:46.260> it

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
destroying my cube I'm going to move it

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.369 
destroying my cube I'm going to move it
again<00:00:46.500> I'm<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.820> move<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.149> back<00:00:48.480> I'm

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
again I'm going to move this back I'm

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.100 
again I'm going to move this back I'm
going<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.800> move<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.219> back<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.940> way<00:00:51.180> do<00:00:51.899> not

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
going to move it back this way do not

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.529 
going to move it back this way do not
destroy<00:00:52.590> your<00:00:52.800> cube<00:00:53.070> there<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.910> go<00:00:54.059> now<00:00:54.390> it's

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
destroy your cube there you go now it's

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.189 
destroy your cube there you go now it's
placed<00:00:54.930> correctly<00:00:56.059> now<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.559> need<00:00:58.559> white<00:00:59.280> green

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
placed correctly now I need white green

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.229 
placed correctly now I need white green
well<00:01:01.199> that's<00:01:01.559> here<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.789> facing<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
well that's here but it's facing the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.929 
well that's here but it's facing the
wrong<00:01:03.390> way<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.680> need<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.430> move<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.760> out<00:01:05.909> of

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
wrong way so I need to move it out of

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.170 
wrong way so I need to move it out of
the<00:01:06.119> way<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.080> way<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.200> do<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:09.030> can

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
the way so the way I do that is you can

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.070 
the way so the way I do that is you can
destroy<00:01:09.600> your<00:01:09.630> cube<00:01:10.130> momentarily<00:01:11.130> okay<00:01:12.080> move

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
destroy your cube momentarily okay move

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.749 
destroy your cube momentarily okay move
this<00:01:13.290> out<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.010> way<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:15.350> bring<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.500> back<00:01:16.759> ok

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
this out of the way and bring it back ok

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.789 
this out of the way and bring it back ok
make<00:01:18.659> sure<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.960> bring<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.320> back<00:01:19.500> otherwise

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
make sure you bring it back otherwise

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.030 
make sure you bring it back otherwise
you're<00:01:20.100> going<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.280> get<00:01:20.490> screwed<00:01:21.320> ok<00:01:22.320> now<00:01:22.979> I

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
you're going to get screwed ok now I

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.260 
you're going to get screwed ok now I
need<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.640> green<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:25.170> green<00:01:25.380> center<00:01:25.830> side

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
need the green on the green center side

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.520 
need the green on the green center side
so<00:01:27.270> three<00:01:27.600> degrees<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.900> freedom<00:01:28.320> don't

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
so three degrees of freedom don't

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.890 
so three degrees of freedom don't
destroy<00:01:28.890> your<00:01:29.070> cube<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.579> move<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.270> out<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
destroy your cube I move this out of the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.789 
destroy your cube I move this out of the
way<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.729> I<00:01:32.729> move<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.470> remember<00:01:34.470> i<00:01:34.500> have

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
way and I move it up remember i have

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.950 
way and I move it up remember i have
this<00:01:35.040> degree<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.460> freedom<00:01:35.759> here<00:01:36.240> because<00:01:36.689> my

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
this degree of freedom here because my

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.359 
this degree of freedom here because my
cube<00:01:37.650> does<00:01:38.130> not<00:01:38.340> touch<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:39.270> back<00:01:39.720> face<00:01:40.369> now

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
cube does not touch this back face now

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.639 
cube does not touch this back face now
here's<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.759> piece<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.090> want<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:43.049> same<00:01:43.350> thing<00:01:43.380> as

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
here's the piece I want so same thing as

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.319 
here's the piece I want so same thing as
before<00:01:43.799> break<00:01:44.790> your<00:01:45.000> cube<00:01:45.290> just<00:01:46.290> momentarily

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
before break your cube just momentarily

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.870 
before break your cube just momentarily
flip<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.540> around<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.579> then<00:01:50.579> bring<00:01:50.850> your

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
flip this around and then bring your

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.120 
flip this around and then bring your
cube<00:01:51.420> back<00:01:52.520> see<00:01:53.520> now<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.790> only<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.500> my<00:01:55.500> green

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
cube back see now I only have my green

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.090 
cube back see now I only have my green
red<00:01:56.399> left<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.600> look<00:01:57.899> around<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.590> where

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
red left so I look around for that where

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.030 
red left so I look around for that where
is<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.250> located<00:02:00.229> alright<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.380> happens<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:02.009> be

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
is it located alright it happens to be

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.950 
is it located alright it happens to be
here<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:03.259> this<00:02:04.259> back<00:02:04.710> face<00:02:05.119> well<00:02:06.119> if<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.719> move

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
here on this back face well if I move

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.740 
here on this back face well if I move
this<00:02:06.990> up<00:02:07.469> directly<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.879> can<00:02:08.910> see<00:02:09.209> it's<00:02:09.360> facing

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
this up directly you can see it's facing

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.610 
this up directly you can see it's facing
the<00:02:09.840> wrong<00:02:09.989> way<00:02:10.069> so<00:02:11.069> instead<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.459> doing<00:02:11.670> that

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
the wrong way so instead of doing that

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.890 
the wrong way so instead of doing that
I<00:02:12.680> will<00:02:13.629> bring<00:02:14.629> this<00:02:14.870> up<00:02:15.489> very<00:02:16.489> cool<00:02:16.790> now<00:02:17.629> same

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
I will bring this up very cool now same

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.390 
I will bring this up very cool now same
thing<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:18.140> did<00:02:18.200> before<00:02:18.409> but<00:02:18.739> on<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:18.980> other<00:02:19.099> side

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
thing I did before but on the other side

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.360 
thing I did before but on the other side
so<00:02:20.209> I'm<00:02:20.810> going<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.290> break<00:02:21.500> my<00:02:21.560> cube<00:02:22.040> apart

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
so I'm going to break my cube apart

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.660 
so I'm going to break my cube apart
momentarily<00:02:23.799> only<00:02:24.799> for<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.190> purpose<00:02:25.549> of

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
momentarily only for the purpose of

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.720 
momentarily only for the purpose of
moving<00:02:25.879> this<00:02:26.150> in<00:02:26.390> place<00:02:27.069> so<00:02:28.069> that<00:02:28.099> I<00:02:28.310> can<00:02:28.430> then

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
moving this in place so that I can then

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.149 
moving this in place so that I can then
bring<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:29.299> back<00:02:29.569> and<00:02:29.840> what<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:30.560> see<00:02:30.799> is<00:02:30.829> I

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
bring this back and what you see is I

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.710 
bring this back and what you see is I
have<00:02:31.310> created<00:02:31.579> my<00:02:32.030> two<00:02:32.750> by<00:02:32.900> two<00:02:32.959> by<00:02:33.110> three

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
have created my two by two by three

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.409 
have created my two by two by three
