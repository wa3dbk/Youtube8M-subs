00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
fifty-fifty I use about 3/4 of a block

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.509 
fifty-fifty I use about 3/4 of a block
of<00:02:24.780> plantation<00:02:25.409> soil<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.099> compressed

of plantation soil of the compressed

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.059 
of plantation soil of the compressed
block<00:02:26.870> so<00:02:27.870> that'll<00:02:28.319> tell<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.590> how<00:02:28.709> much<00:02:28.860> this

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
looking for is so it'll hold a tunnel

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.349

these<00:02:51.329> just<00:02:51.840> like<00:02:51.959> crappy<00:02:53.239> ziplock<00:02:54.239> in

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
these just like crappy ziplock in

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.460

looking for be able to make a tunnel and
have<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:43.620> not<00:03:43.769> collapse

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
have it not collapse

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.750 
have it not collapse

yes<00:03:57.400> and<00:03:57.640> see<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:57.880> little<00:03:58.090> granules<00:03:58.569> of<00:03:58.750> sand

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
yes and see the little granules of sand

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.930 
yes and see the little granules of sand
in<00:03:59.170> there<00:03:59.350> I<00:03:59.560> think<00:04:00.400> I'm<00:04:00.459> just<00:04:00.550> gonna<00:04:00.700> add<00:04:00.910> a

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
in there I think I'm just gonna add a

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.150 
in there I think I'm just gonna add a
little<00:04:01.300> bit<00:04:01.630> more<00:04:01.750> sand<00:04:02.730> just<00:04:03.730> to<00:04:03.910> be<00:04:04.000> sure

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
little bit more sand just to be sure

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.470 
little bit more sand just to be sure
that's<00:04:06.160> quite<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.370> lot<00:04:06.550> actually<00:04:06.760> but<00:04:07.150> whatever

I think that is good you can see the

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.340 
I think that is good you can see the
hole<00:04:16.269> I<00:04:16.299> made<00:04:16.540> right<00:04:16.750> there<00:04:16.780> I<00:04:19.169> believe<00:04:20.169> that

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
hole I made right there I believe that

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.190 
hole I made right there I believe that

I've<00:04:41.380> heard<00:04:41.680> anywhere<00:04:42.190> up<00:04:42.340> to<00:04:42.550> like<00:04:42.790> 72<00:04:43.450> hours

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
I've heard anywhere up to like 72 hours

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.230 
I've heard anywhere up to like 72 hours
which<00:04:44.680> i<00:04:44.800> think<00:04:44.860> is<00:04:45.100> a<00:04:45.130> really<00:04:45.760> long<00:04:46.120> time<00:04:46.560> but

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
which i think is a really long time but

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.520 
which i think is a really long time but
let's<00:04:49.240> hope<00:04:49.419> it<00:04:49.570> doesn't<00:04:49.750> take<00:04:49.990> cool<00:04:50.230> of<00:04:50.350> that

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
let's hope it doesn't take cool of that

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.500 
let's hope it doesn't take cool of that
long<00:04:50.800> cuz<00:04:51.610> that<00:04:51.760> wouldn't<00:04:52.030> be<00:04:52.090> good<00:04:54.150> but<00:04:55.150> they

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
long cuz that wouldn't be good but they

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.750 
long cuz that wouldn't be good but they
will<00:04:55.690> dig<00:04:55.930> around<00:04:56.050> and<00:04:56.560> just<00:04:57.130> make<00:04:57.280> sure<00:04:57.310> after

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
will dig around and just make sure after

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.750 
will dig around and just make sure after
you've<00:04:58.150> done<00:04:58.710> everything<00:04:59.710> you<00:04:59.979> need<00:05:00.190> you

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
you've done everything you need you

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.860 
you've done everything you need you
provide<00:05:01.090> them<00:05:01.210> with<00:05:01.300> good<00:05:01.510> nutrition<00:05:01.690> and<00:05:03.870> so

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
provide them with good nutrition and so

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.440 
provide them with good nutrition and so
they<00:05:05.110> can<00:05:05.440> get<00:05:06.280> back<00:05:06.430> to<00:05:06.580> good<00:05:06.790> health<00:05:06.820> fast

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
they can get back to good health fast

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
that's how to set up a laid bin for

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.650 
that's how to set up a laid bin for
female<00:05:16.570> chameleons<00:05:17.110> and<00:05:18.360> just<00:05:19.360> for<00:05:19.510> those<00:05:19.600> of

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
female chameleons and just for those of

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.800 
female chameleons and just for those of
you<00:05:19.870> to<00:05:19.990> know<00:05:20.140> even<00:05:20.710> if<00:05:21.450> you<00:05:22.450> do<00:05:22.750> not<00:05:23.070> breed

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
you to know even if you do not breed

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.930 
you to know even if you do not breed
females<00:05:25.810> are<00:05:26.080> fully<00:05:26.440> capable<00:05:26.710> and<00:05:27.310> will<00:05:27.700> most

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
females are fully capable and will most

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.090 
females are fully capable and will most
likely<00:05:28.530> lay<00:05:29.530> infertile<00:05:30.340> eggs<00:05:30.669> so<00:05:31.890> always<00:05:32.890> have

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
likely lay infertile eggs so always have

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.210 
likely lay infertile eggs so always have
one<00:05:33.310> of<00:05:33.430> these<00:05:33.520> on<00:05:33.760> hand<00:05:34.030> and<00:05:35.220> hopefully

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
one of these on hand and hopefully

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.820 
one of these on hand and hopefully
pre-mixed<00:05:37.090> and<00:05:37.240> the<00:05:37.810> way<00:05:37.900> you<00:05:37.960> know<00:05:38.229> to<00:05:38.289> put

pre-mixed and the way you know to put
them<00:05:38.919> in<00:05:39.039> here<00:05:39.070> is<00:05:39.430> if<00:05:40.000> they're<00:05:40.120> just<00:05:40.240> being

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
will provide her with some heat

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:11.730 
will provide her with some heat
as<00:06:09.499> long<00:06:09.710> she<00:06:09.949> needs<00:06:10.129> to<00:06:10.339> lay<00:06:10.520> them<00:06:10.759> and
