00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.420
 that is, these buttons are switched 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.950

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.170

 I can demonstrate not only there 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.400
 one caveat ie when you want 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:49.930

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:58.280

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:09.579

 see for yourself that everything is heard well 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:38.859
 By the way I want to say that the quality 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.560
 the sound is very good and so far the sound 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:45.579
 the difference is no different than side 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.980

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:52.780
 different sound quality is very good 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:55.540
 it suits me well 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.609
 connect it all possible i eat them and 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.989
 electrician skills there is nothing special 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.150
 we need to remove this result 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.439
 mannitol that is if a person can 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.530
 use a screwdriver for it without problems 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:08.769
 make and connect all the standard connectors 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.200
 no extra there is nothing 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.319
 modify to connect there 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.129
