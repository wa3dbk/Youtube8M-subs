put a game of this you know like caliber
or<00:01:38.400> whatever<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.759> would<00:01:38.850> call<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> way

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
or whatever you would call it on the way

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.350 
or whatever you would call it on the way
exclusively<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.310> way<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.729> that's<00:01:41.909> pretty<00:01:42.150> cool

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
exclusively to way so that's pretty cool

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.569 
exclusively to way so that's pretty cool
you<00:01:42.600> never<00:01:42.750> never<00:01:43.380> really<00:01:43.590> see<00:01:43.770> any<00:01:43.979> we

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
you never never really see any we

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.300 
you never never really see any we
exclusive<00:01:45.149> gameplays<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:46.040> games<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.280> should

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
exclusive gameplays but games I should

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.550 
exclusive gameplays but games I should
say<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.390> pretty<00:01:48.570> cool<00:01:48.840> I'm<00:01:49.049> liking<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
say but it's pretty cool I'm liking the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.340 
say but it's pretty cool I'm liking the
game<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.950> far<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:50.600> really<00:01:51.600> really<00:01:51.930> suck<00:01:52.200> at

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
game so far I just really really suck at

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.340 
game so far I just really really suck at
it<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.740> if<00:01:53.670> when<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:53.939> get<00:01:54.149> better<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:55.200> can

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
it so if when I get better you can

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.959 
it so if when I get better you can
expect<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.799> lot<00:01:55.920> better<00:01:56.159> gameplays<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.729> I

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
expect a lot better gameplays and I

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.149 
expect a lot better gameplays and I
probably<00:01:57.180> will<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> game<00:01:57.930> more<00:01:58.170> right

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
probably will like the game more right

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.760 
probably will like the game more right
now<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.610> died<00:02:00.090> about<00:02:00.600> 10<00:02:00.930> times<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.350> match<00:02:01.500> we're

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
now I died about 10 times a match we're

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.459 
now I died about 10 times a match we're
only<00:02:01.890> getting<00:02:02.100> about<00:02:02.310> 2<00:02:02.700> or<00:02:02.729> 3<00:02:02.880> kills<00:02:03.299> which<00:02:04.049> is

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
only getting about 2 or 3 kills which is

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.370 
only getting about 2 or 3 kills which is
pretty<00:02:04.770> horrible<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:06.329> really<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.049> really

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
pretty horrible but I really I really

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.900 
pretty horrible but I really I really
don't<00:02:07.590> enjoy<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.099> fact<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.610> there's<00:02:08.819> a

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
don't enjoy the fact that there's a

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.969 
don't enjoy the fact that there's a
spawn<00:02:09.450> delay<00:02:09.629> for<00:02:10.050> every<00:02:10.349> game<00:02:10.560> type<00:02:10.800> I

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
spawn delay for every game type I

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.080 
spawn delay for every game type I
believe

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
believe

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.880 
believe
but<00:02:12.690> what<00:02:12.900> are<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.019> gonna<00:02:13.110> do<00:02:13.290> about<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.709> you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
but what are you gonna do about it you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.009 
but what are you gonna do about it you
know<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.250> guess<00:02:14.730> if<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:15.000> die<00:02:15.060> too<00:02:15.269> many<00:02:15.569> times<00:02:15.810> I'm

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
know I guess if I die too many times I'm

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.270 
know I guess if I die too many times I'm
just<00:02:16.140> going<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.290> sit<00:02:16.500> there<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.709> wait<00:02:16.890> for<00:02:17.129> 10

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
just going to sit there and wait for 10

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.920 
just going to sit there and wait for 10
seconds<00:02:17.760> which<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.000> kind<00:02:18.269> of<00:02:18.330> annoying<00:02:18.569> but

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
seconds which is kind of annoying but

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.949

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.800 
sensitivity the shaking every time you
try<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.519> move<00:03:08.790> with<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.209> Wii<00:03:09.329> Remote<00:03:09.599> it's

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
try to move with the Wii Remote it's

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.319 
try to move with the Wii Remote it's
really<00:03:10.079> difficult<00:03:10.290> for<00:03:10.620> me<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:11.700> really<00:03:12.180> find

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
really difficult for me I really find

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.180 
really difficult for me I really find
that<00:03:12.599> it's<00:03:12.870> it's<00:03:13.319> pretty<00:03:13.590> hard<00:03:13.799> to<00:03:14.010> control

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
that it's it's pretty hard to control

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.460 
that it's it's pretty hard to control
your<00:03:14.489> movements<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.269> and<00:03:15.569> shoot<00:03:15.900> accurately

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
your movements and and shoot accurately

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.710 
your movements and and shoot accurately
with<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.709> Wii<00:03:16.799> Remote<00:03:17.069> I<00:03:17.280> did<00:03:18.209> change<00:03:18.480> around

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
with the Wii Remote I did change around

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.140 
with the Wii Remote I did change around
the<00:03:18.810> sensitivity<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.799> dead<00:03:20.489> zones<00:03:20.760> stuff

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
the sensitivity and the dead zones stuff

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.420 
the sensitivity and the dead zones stuff
like<00:03:21.329> that<00:03:21.540> but<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.260> mean<00:03:22.440> every<00:03:22.829> everything<00:03:23.190> I

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
like that but I mean every everything I

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.890 
like that but I mean every everything I
try<00:03:23.639> to<00:03:23.700> do<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.030> doesn't<00:03:24.329> really<00:03:24.450> work<00:03:24.720> out

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
try to do it doesn't really work out

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.509 
try to do it doesn't really work out
well<00:03:25.109> so<00:03:25.139> I<00:03:25.319> picked<00:03:25.590> up<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.829> massacre<00:03:26.310> back

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
well so I picked up a massacre back

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.059

there<00:03:27.019> here's<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.139> Wii<00:03:28.260> Remote<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.590> little<00:03:28.920> bit

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
there here's the Wii Remote a little bit

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.569 
there here's the Wii Remote a little bit
C<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.370> don't<00:03:29.819> really<00:03:30.060> like<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.450> shaking<00:03:31.579> that

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
C I don't really like the shaking that

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.759 
C I don't really like the shaking that
comes<00:03:32.910> it's<00:03:33.209> pretty<00:03:33.480> hard<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.780> move<00:03:34.109> left<00:03:34.470> from

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
comes it's pretty hard to move left from

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.229 
comes it's pretty hard to move left from
right<00:03:34.829> even<00:03:35.280> though<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:35.430> have<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.060> camera

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
is a different gun here I just bought

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.960 
is a different gun here I just bought
it's<00:03:43.079> pretty<00:03:43.380> cool<00:03:43.590> but<00:03:43.799> you<00:03:44.069> know<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.639> like<00:03:44.819> the

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
it's pretty cool but you know I like the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.490 
it's pretty cool but you know I like the
weapons<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.599> characters<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.169> stuff<00:03:46.319> but

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
weapons and the characters and stuff but

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.140 
weapons and the characters and stuff but
I<00:03:46.560> mean<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.859> controls<00:03:47.280> are<00:03:47.459> just<00:03:47.549> horrible<00:03:47.819> in

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
I mean the controls are just horrible in

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.569 
I mean the controls are just horrible in
my<00:03:48.209> opinion<00:03:48.720> so<00:03:49.130> you<00:03:50.130> know<00:03:50.250> for<00:03:50.430> future

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
my opinion so you know for future

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.280 
my opinion so you know for future

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
gameplays you guys may see me use the

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.379 
gameplays you guys may see me use the
classic<00:03:52.650> controller<00:03:52.769> only<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.609> that<00:03:53.669> is

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
classic controller only and that is

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:55.970 
classic controller only and that is
because<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:54.840> really<00:03:55.410> don't<00:03:55.560> like<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.859> Wii

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
because I really don't like the Wii

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.849
