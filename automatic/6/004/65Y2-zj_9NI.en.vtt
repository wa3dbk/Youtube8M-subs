00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.540

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.849
 a fire department team was 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.039

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.669
 of the bike and came came falling with the bike and 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.530
 rolling on the floor in front of my 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.239
 here you wanted the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.510
 first service out there he said 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.399
 at the time of the accident was to let him run 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.690
 I left the cell phone, said running to see 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.270
 how he was the money if 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.250
 to see if he was okay with it 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.620
 I was aware right? 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.270
 he talks a lot he said he talked 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.120
 I already talked to him already 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.250
 I called the fireman was now the Lord 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.590
 He could talk to him the reasons for the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.480
 what happened he fell off the bike he said 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.420
 was not hit a rock in the middle of the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.949
 issue number but at first I think 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.600
 that were the tire of the motorcycle 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.220
 he saw his tire 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.170
 I 'm supposed to test and I was 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.750
 running nÃ© pereira fired the firemen 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.360
 who found a boy face down with the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.340
 whole body grating and complaining of pain 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.560
 in the back it was immobilized and 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.970
 sent to the emergency room and was not 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.580
 found fracture 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.100
 we made the approach making it not 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.890
 identify any serious injury only 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.110
 lipo suffered this fall had some 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.630
 bruising and bruising 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.159
 fortunately there was no fracture to 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.939
 principle we can identify in the 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.070
 local 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.509
 but nevertheless in the face of injuries 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.150
 he presented there was done all the 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.610
 procedure is there in your 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.079
 mobilization approach to the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.310
 hospital so the doctor can make a 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.680
 better evaluation 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.299
 and if necessary take x-ray it to 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.920
 to identify any other injury 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.729
 that could not be identified in the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.740
 local 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.149
 we realize that this time is 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.380
 complicated is that there is 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.110
 moment that with south 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.909
 two vehicles and actor including others 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.740
 municipalities bringing rugged is a 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.860
 critical time is not this 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.929
 is we always talk that we have in 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.970
 critical times that the schedule of the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.830
 the morning staff is working on the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.900
 and one in the afternoon when the 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.569
 staff is leaving work to this 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.720
 lunch time boy, he went 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.840
 until the company to leave his wife was 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.120
 returning and ended up having unhappiness 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.810
 the front tire of your bike and 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.239
 to burst 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.950
 was what ended up causing this fall 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.630
 by this, all caution are little 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.160
 that's why we always talk right 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.920
 as much as you're walking there 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.739
 within the allowed speed 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.810
 with all the safety equipment is 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.310
 can happen these fatalities is to do 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.780
 a new involvement of him with no 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.760
 other type of vehicle 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.590
 no animal crossed in front of her but 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.420
 had the tire misfortune ends 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.000
 bursting out so he was with the 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.829
 helmet so this also helped 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.870
 enough if he had not been there with the 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.410
 minimum safety level could have been a 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.410
 worse situation
