left them in the milk for half an hour

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.610 
left them in the milk for half an hour
or<00:06:02.480> anything<00:06:02.720> but<00:06:02.900> they<00:06:03.080> sit<00:06:03.320> there<00:06:03.350> in<00:06:03.560> the

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
or anything but they sit there in the

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.300 
or anything but they sit there in the
milk<00:06:03.800> for<00:06:03.920> a<00:06:03.950> little<00:06:04.070> bit<00:06:04.190> and<00:06:04.340> they<00:06:04.880> get<00:06:05.090> a

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310

little<00:06:07.310> bit<00:06:07.520> saturated<00:06:08.180> I<00:06:08.240> guess<00:06:08.420> is<00:06:08.570> the<00:06:08.660> best

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
little bit saturated I guess is the best

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.630 
little bit saturated I guess is the best
way<00:06:08.990> to<00:06:09.050> put<00:06:09.230> it<00:06:09.290> but<00:06:09.530> they<00:06:09.980> never<00:06:10.130> go<00:06:10.310> soft

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:10.640 
way to put it but they never go soft

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.550 
way to put it but they never go soft
they<00:06:10.850> never<00:06:11.030> go<00:06:11.180> soggy<00:06:11.480> they<00:06:11.990> stay<00:06:12.260> nice<00:06:12.500> and

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
they never go soggy they stay nice and

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.920
