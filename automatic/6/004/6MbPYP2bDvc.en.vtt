00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.289
 hi all guys today there are those 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.240
 with a new tutorial because it is me 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.450
 happened so many times to find myself in 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.130
 difficulty when I needed to 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.150
 install way wanted to install 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.160
 fashions because there are so many methods 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.460
 disagreeing with each other and however it is 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.230
 hard to know which to use I 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.239
 today I will explain what I use 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.920
 and what I think is the best 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.550
 the one with which most of the 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.890
 fashions on compatible then before 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.640
 everything is a fashion a mod 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.619
 is a series of point class files that 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.790
 add features to the game 

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:59.290
 of minecraft the main way to 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.239
 install a mod would insert 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.820
 directly the files in the game of 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.950
 minecraft how to do this 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.930
 so now I'm using a mac 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.979
 then explain to me that I will explain the 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.689
 procedure for mac 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.439
 then I'll explain also the one for windows 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:17.500
 which is very simple from lion onwards 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.890
 must do go in the finder go go to 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.530
 folder then you have to make this mark 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:30.280
 that you do with others if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:35.530
 now I will get it or what excuse me ok 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:42.670
 write library no I will be waiting 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:44.350
 then excuse me then obviously I 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.090
 now I don't remember the slightest 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:56.470
 as it is alt alt 5 little discreet others 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:58.270
 five slash free go on TV enter 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.229
 in the library in previous versions 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.260
 there was no need 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.780
 and instead from lion on you have to do this 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.340
 application support minecraft these 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.830
 are all your data 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.250
 Enter the file in the bean folder 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:16.629
 minecraft punto jar rename it point 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.779
 zip the zip note and open it in this 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:21.340
 case the opera with winzip mac you see 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:22.220
 these are all the files they make 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.740
 work but 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.360
 at this point what needs to be done 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.390
 program we will support to install the 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.450
 monde schiave minecraft forges in practice 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.970
 it is a fashion, it is also a mod that 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.610
 simplifies the achievement of fashions 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.710
 classes or not are saved here 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.070
 let's take all these point class files 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.750
 see it all download from minecraft 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.810

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.010
 a folder that must be deleted mi times 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.990
 it is written in uppercase of the et if not 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.160

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.709
 of minecraft one of the fashions 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.390
 at this point we can close here 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.100
 I had saved myself, I advise you to save 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:12.080
 the minecraft folder for not wanting to do 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:16.600

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.140
 let's wait 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.959

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.730
 go no minecraft folder 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.790
 balance of the folders that I already have that 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.690
 cormo'ns mods are added and then all 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.280
 do these here to install new fashions 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.799
 first of all check that they are 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.060
 compatible with forces because some fashion 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.160
 they need other programs and 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.930
 so you ca n't use them if they are 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.850
 compatible with strength want to take 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.840
 now to the water what those who 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:12.380
 before I used the cia a copy let's go 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.750
 however in the mods folder we remember 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.000
 they usually give you instructions 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.239
 along with fashions up to some goals 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.140
 must be inserted in kore mods others go 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.540
 inserted in Msgr 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:27.100
 at this point you have finished is really 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:31.720
 very simple you see do so 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.720

 do nothing but put fashion signs 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.530
 which makes a box folder for the PCA a lot 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.770
 the simpler you have to go to start 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:09.140
 and below write percentage 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.200

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.690
 folder you will find a folder called 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.250
 precisely minecraft is at that point the 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.140
 the procedure becomes the same he does not 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:24.410

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:26.990
 and do the same things in practice well 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.970
 I hope I have been helpful to you 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.870

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:35.800
