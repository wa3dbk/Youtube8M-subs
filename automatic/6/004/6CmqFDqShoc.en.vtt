00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.309 
there's two key theories behind you all
these<00:04:06.290> things<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:08.000> know<00:04:08.090> foods<00:04:08.479> are<00:04:08.750> just<00:04:08.780> one

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
these things you know foods are just one

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.619 
these things you know foods are just one
step<00:04:09.650> with<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.400> step<00:04:10.729> beyond<00:04:11.120> that<00:04:11.299> he's

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
step with the step beyond that he's

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.360 
step with the step beyond that he's
actually<00:04:11.840> micro<00:04:12.409> electricity<00:04:13.190> in

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
actually micro electricity in

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.270 
actually micro electricity in
frequencies<00:04:14.349> and<00:04:15.349> I'll<00:04:15.500> get<00:04:15.680> into<00:04:15.829> some<00:04:15.949> of

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
frequencies and I'll get into some of

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.129 
frequencies and I'll get into some of
that<00:04:16.370> stuff<00:04:16.699> because<00:04:17.060> actually<00:04:17.599> I<00:04:17.630> don't<00:04:17.840> know

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
that stuff because actually I don't know

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.649 
that stuff because actually I don't know
everything<00:04:18.560> about<00:04:18.829> it<00:04:19.220> but<00:04:19.459> these<00:04:20.209> things<00:04:20.419> are

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:20.659 
everything about it but these things are

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:23.589 
everything about it but these things are
secrets<00:04:21.079> of<00:04:21.229> Secrets<00:04:21.739> but<00:04:21.970> there<00:04:22.970> probably<00:04:23.389> is

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
secrets of Secrets but there probably is

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.020 
secrets of Secrets but there probably is
a<00:04:23.630> combination<00:04:24.440> is<00:04:24.560> something<00:04:25.010> that<00:04:25.849> can

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
a combination is something that can

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.170 
a combination is something that can
actually<00:04:26.389> make<00:04:26.599> people<00:04:26.990> live<00:04:28.180> ridiculous

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
actually make people live ridiculous

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.330 
actually make people live ridiculous
amounts<00:04:29.630> of<00:04:29.690> time<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.260> beyond<00:04:30.650> all<00:04:30.979> the<00:04:31.130> time

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
amounts of time and beyond all the time

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.909 
amounts of time and beyond all the time
and<00:04:32.030> I<00:04:32.180> know<00:04:32.240> people<00:04:32.780> be<00:04:32.900> very<00:04:32.930> interested<00:04:33.830> to

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
and I know people be very interested to

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.490 
and I know people be very interested to
hear<00:04:34.039> about<00:04:34.159> that

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
hear about that

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.280 
hear about that
no<00:04:35.890> doubt<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:36.730> simple<00:04:37.150> one<00:04:37.330> a<00:04:37.510> cheap<00:04:37.810> one<00:04:38.050> in

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
no doubt the simple one a cheap one in

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.460 
no doubt the simple one a cheap one in
an<00:04:38.500> ancient<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:39.010> proven<00:04:39.340> one<00:04:39.550> is<00:04:40.150> alfalfa<00:04:40.930> the

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
an ancient and proven one is alfalfa the

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.790 
an ancient and proven one is alfalfa the
father<00:04:41.980> of<00:04:42.160> all<00:04:42.430> foods
