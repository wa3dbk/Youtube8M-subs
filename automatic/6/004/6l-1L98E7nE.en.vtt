00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.639
 hi there, this is project 1 video car market 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.590
 all car owners 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.570
 sooner or later they come up with an idea 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.210
 helped me the engine compartment is not 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.830
 did the motor help me here but with all 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.380
 There is an opinion that this is not 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.470
 safe now let's discuss now 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.199
 is it a safe moment to wash the motor on 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.359
 in fact, in the engine wash there are many 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.910
 there are pluses for example the engine is dirty 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.910
 yes then it may be 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.250
 oil spots like oil changed 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.670
 somewhere a little oil spilled yes and 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.110
 so it remained on the motor theoretically 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.850
 how could she catch fire but 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.489
 in practice this is rarely the case 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.980
 less oil stains due to heat 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.620
 motor can third as it stands out 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.489
 smell and plus may still be slight 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.649
 smoke plus everything 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:58.250
 dirt mixes with this oil and thatâ€™s all 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.020
 it could get on some kind of electro 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.420
 items there electrical equipment yes and 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.850
 disable the whole thing plus ko 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.039
 around the dirty engine she can 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.729
 overheating thereby will be elevated 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:13.759
 wear some parts here on clean 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.429
 engines will see some kind of olives 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.529
 mortgages yes if they appear plus ko 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:20.299
 everything is just honest with clean 

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:22.130
 engine compartment nicer 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.229
 work here but nonetheless 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.329
 machine manufacturers they recommend 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.399
 do this for various reasons yes 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.570
 despite the fact that here basically how 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.490
 everything seems to be like 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.530
 for waterproofing given nevertheless 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.620
 100 percent guarantee no what 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.960
 water can go anywhere 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.460
 it's done yes sometimes close 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.280
 engine air filter yes and just 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.740
 high pressure water jet here 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.560
 all washed maybe there special 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.600
 chemistry watered then wash off the pressure 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.369
 very big water 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.790
 get there where it gets and then not 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.340
 you need here therefore if you have a gasoline 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.170
 motor up here like to think you need 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.660
 do you even need it to be 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.010
 motor here if to a lesser extent as if 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.590
 problems may arise with the old 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.950
 like a diesel engine there everything is simpler 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.170
 and we are in principle its possible probability 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.800
 some kind of breakdown it is but less than 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.190
 gasoline engine on all car washes 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.480
 Now this service is offered but 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.700
 it is written everywhere we do not carry 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.220
 responsibility for any possible 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.580
 the problem of damage that's actually 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.060
 it's not right if you suddenly washed 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.370
 motor and something suddenly happened you 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.680
 must write a claim to this 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.769
 car wash if they suddenly do not respond 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.769
 either they just refuse yes then you 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.350
 need to make an expert opinion and 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.019
 You can apply for this car wash 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.920
 then you should be reimbursed in principle 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:06.160
 your damage is why wash or not wash 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.680
 decide to personally I in their 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.720
 cars my engine no matter how no 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.630
 very often there a couple of times a year but not 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.220
 less I do it here when the motor washed 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.400
 I start the engine right away 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.410
 he works right there because of his heat all 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.410
 evaporates to dry well at least 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.260
 I was never a problem with that was not here 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.060
 maybe like a conversation right there 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.920
 out of nowhere appeared yes someone 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.930
 Apparently there were problems but nonetheless I 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.540
 The problem of such not experienced therefore 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.230
 decide on it all thanks for
