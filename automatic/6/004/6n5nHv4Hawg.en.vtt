00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 Hello dear friends we are today 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.520
 let's talk in the next knives which was 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.370
 given for review but all besko 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.290
 knife shop blade remote from today 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.480
 the same almost rare on her 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.030
 knife from the Swiss company zinger 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.400
 which no longer exists is called 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:23.789
 this foot items knife biker 37 such 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.609
 Here is the Hungarian box all this is visible 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.970
 now a great rarity but 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.580
 less 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.969
 a rather specific purpose 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.000
 this leg of the subject knife 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:38.309
 it is still quite easy to buy 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.290
 if anything you need i want right away 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.170
 say that the review for me personally will 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.300
 pretty difficult because i 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.180
 well let's say so with the bikes 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.420
 constantly have no business so let's 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.789
 let's say something like this 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.199
 I will list the appointment of all 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.780
 tools just because I'm afraid 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.609
 make a mistake but honestly read here 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.289
 here the instruction is now just in the frame I 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.969
 I do not want you these tools 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.220
 show signs of appointment which I 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.040
 some minimal knowing course I will name 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.530
 but some tools I just can 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.090
 show that this is some kind of specific 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.590
 bicycle keys for some 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.330
 various elements of designs 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.490
 bike looks like this lining 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.900
 drawn such a Swiss bike 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.259
 such a cross on the other hand is nothing 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.810
 There is no lining here such now with 3d such 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.060
 profile they are used and companies 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.500
 victorinox is now in the production of those 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.240
 models on which they were given 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.189
 some of their new, they also became 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.409
 they use nice 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.150
 so pretty bulky 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.409
 multitool 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.979
 which I understand is intended to replace 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.780
 all bicycle keys cyclist 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.780
 let's see how much it weighs 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.790
 176 grams huge so small 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.610
 As far as I understand, in principle, well, another 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.940
 country if it is completely exhausting 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.840
 needs of the cyclist must 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.220
 quite a bit he month 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.750
 but, all the same, it’s clear that 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.100
 here is not exclusively cycling so 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.690
 let's say the subject we can immediately see 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.289
 that there is such a nail file 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.600
 + this corner for cleaning nails 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.370
 so basically this tip can 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.750
 pick something up if it's necessary 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.930
 traditional tool also 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.890
 corkscrew here is quite 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.600
 traditional but need to be set when i 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.980
 picked up want to say my 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.140
 look and somewhat inconvenient to use 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.890
 that the proposition is not positioned by 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.470
 one edge, that is, with such a thickness 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.060
 just multitool let's say this is not 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.530
 the most convenient that u pro let's say there 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.910
 also train 3 which now has frames 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.970
 enjoys that the format will be significantly 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.410
 more convenient here but nevertheless because of them 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.180
 you can generally use it somehow 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.730
 Unlike the wheel, in principle, no 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.900
 it is of course wine with cycling 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.180
 hikes well for me personally not very 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.230
 combined oh well I always screwdriver 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.180
 on the test preferred and such here 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.239
 sweep it difference and it doesn't even 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.980
 sweep know made it difficult to say it 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.690
 what is it not sewed i mean it is like 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.430
 this is still cooked too in this than there 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.560
 Can I have a sharp Iranian as usual 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.660
 sweep this thing has no gonna 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.070
 lie why so because I did not know it was 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.060
 would be curious if someone knows right away 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.570
 let's take a closer look at what else 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.459
 there is such a traditional Hungarian 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.970
 opener for cans she 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.459
 does not look like an opener 2 3 Knox 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.989
 can see too but to me 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.670
 known geometry quite working with 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:30.140
 the other side is naturally traditional 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.220
 same hungarian bottle opener for 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.700
 Bottles combined Saturn all quite 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.700
 understandably 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:46.030
 Here is such a key Allen Well 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.499
 put yourself in the working position 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.969
 may well somehow he 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:50.650
 quite powerful work here just 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:52.180
 very convenient to its location 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.129
 big hand i really can 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.450
 make a big effort to 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:04:00.389
 it is enough to simply fold 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.389
 fold shines shrouded small 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:11.829
 Here are such a very convenient small 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:14.560
 passatizhi I understand that I love the nut 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.060
 which happens by bicycle with the help 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.130
 those nude pliers can somehow 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.310
 clasp the dough will be necessary 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.919
 but not surely not very powerful it them in 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.810
 him and they are quite enough for such 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.770
 work separately here here is such 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.289
 specific key which 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.580
 removed completely 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.830
 so you can remove here as if to eat 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.410
 several minimum specific 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.180
 sizes of some bicycle nuts to 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.770
 the list is something like we will provide the network 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.889
 cyclists devices in more detail 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.570
 it knows who is as if invested in 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.070
 general multitul so here so we call 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.110
 bicycle key from my childhood 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.759
 what subjects were so roughly called in 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.930
 principle reference is why the rest 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.330
 delirium that it is easily removed on 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.270
 protect themselves so well, no matter how general 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:03.400
 multitool since deer i want to say 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:05.050
 that the knife is naturally new for a long time nobody 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.490
 he didn’t open it between the buttons 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.930
 please break in the frame so all 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.570
 slightly open of all this is quite open 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.710
 here's another specific too 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.820
 bike key here even 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.780
 drawn by this enjoy and 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.810
 special little 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.229
 It avoids the different sizes here is such a 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.229
 key 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:29.119
 Phillips screwdriver, a small but 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:30.889
 such a full night so let 's say 

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:34.399
 that would prefer a bigger one 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:36.949
 screwdriver so she was 

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:41.349
 instead that steam on this knife made me 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.349
 like this, of course, the traditional blade 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:45.649
 our company wenger blades were here 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:47.329
 I will also say about this format 

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:49.549
 honestly so it's better than nothing but 

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:51.229
 Of course , let's cut them, let's say products 

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:53.089
 it is generally not clear how that is just 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.409
 so how do we deal with him again 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:56.360
 subject knife then still here 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.309
 must be Janusz's as if, in principle, 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.079
 I understand the instrument to you all 

00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:02.539
 showed which is present in this knife 

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:03.739
 my overall impression here will be to say 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.599
 quite difficult because we 

00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:07.639
 dealing with such a specific narrowly 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.349
 niche tool so i was 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.849
 very curious to me the opinion of those who have 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.499
 on a bicycle as much as any you would 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:14.629
 I would like to have such a thing because 

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:16.099
 I honestly understand that 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:18.019
 these items are sold very, very 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:20.869
 bad ie we are dealing with some kind of 

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:22.219
 here is a rarity but nevertheless 

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:26.149
 the sale is already pretty 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:27.800
 Well, for a long time , I don’t know, I don’t know what else 

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:29.979
 say the impression is honest by them because 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.689
 that i don't use such things myself 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:34.009
 kind of hobbies I hope that you 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:36.759
 it was interesting thank you very much for 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:36.759
 view bye
