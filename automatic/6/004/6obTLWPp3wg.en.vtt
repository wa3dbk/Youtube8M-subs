00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.750
 incredible history and precisely 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.630
 We have more information from the web 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.909
 because the little one is called sailor catler 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.520
 7 years old and it was the only 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.580
 survivor of this plane crash 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.470
 in kentucky usa and already said initially 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.080
 to the emergency services that already 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.020
 he thought his sisters sisters and cousins 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.509
 they were dead but maybe not 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.000
 I was more than sleeping between 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.479
 debris said the police according to 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.479
 report from the washington website 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.479
 times 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.670
 well we are precisely connected with 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.560
 celia with celia mendoza of the voice of 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.990
 america with whom we are going to expand a 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.110
 little this story because the little one the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.970
 little one would have walked more than one 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.030
 kilometer is like that would be what is the 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.260
 information we have about her 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.450
 understood the girl could have 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.060
 fractured an arm and after that the 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.040
 plane turns and falls obviously in this 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.620
 desert place among a forest 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.450
 completely dark she tried to 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.420
 wake up your parents to your sister 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.910
 older as well as her 14- year-old cousin 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.220
 but without any luck he succeeded 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.110
 wake up she desperately wanted to search 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.250
 help and according to what it says in it 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.260
 He leaves the plane with only shorts 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.060
 with a shirt I only had one 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.310
 half bet since they came from the 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.140
 florida and it was not very sheltered we are 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.210
 talking about the temperatures were 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.370
 around 0 degrees centigrade 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.950
 when the girl was in this forest 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.800
 dark say that she tried to catch 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.200
 a branch to light as it was very 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.330
 dark but still could not do it there 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.040
 is when he starts walking until 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.140
 comes to this man's house to 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.510
 It seemed like it took about half an hour 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.490
 walking to get to this 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.650
 house when it saw the light and hit the 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.530
 door this man obviously surprised 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.570
 He saw the little girl and of course she 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.830
 He said that they had been in an accident 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.780
 airplane 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.120
 and obviously his parents were 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.580
 unconscious only the hope of 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.350
 they were alive insure was what 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.480
 that motivated her to keep walking and 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.820
 keep looking for someone who 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.620
