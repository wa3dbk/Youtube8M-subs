that sparkle send me is but they're not
too<00:03:00.920> big<00:03:01.989> this<00:03:02.989> this<00:03:03.319> way<00:03:04.000> depth<00:03:05.000> wise<00:03:05.359> are<00:03:05.780> you

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
too big this this way depth wise are you

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.520 
too big this this way depth wise are you
know<00:03:06.409> so<00:03:06.650> this<00:03:06.799> is<00:03:06.829> wizz<00:03:07.629> length<00:03:08.629> width<00:03:09.170> and

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
know so this is wizz length width and

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.009 
know so this is wizz length width and
depth<00:03:10.209> because<00:03:11.209> i<00:03:11.420> can<00:03:11.569> fit<00:03:11.720> them<00:03:11.780> both

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
depth because i can fit them both

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.559 
depth because i can fit them both
perfectly<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:12.920> with<00:03:13.489> other<00:03:13.700> with<00:03:14.090> other<00:03:14.299> type

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
perfectly and with other with other type

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.470 
perfectly and with other with other type
due<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.109> heatsink<00:03:16.069> and<00:03:16.129> fan<00:03:16.219> combo<00:03:17.000> or<00:03:17.239> too

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
due to the heatsink and fan combo or too

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.289 
due to the heatsink and fan combo or too
big<00:03:17.750> or<00:03:18.019> too<00:03:18.220> close<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.370> each<00:03:19.489> other<00:03:19.609> so<00:03:20.030> and

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
big or too close to each other so and

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.289 
big or too close to each other so and
they<00:03:20.389> have<00:03:20.540> no<00:03:20.689> cover<00:03:20.930> so<00:03:21.200> i'll<00:03:21.470> be<00:03:21.620> hitting

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
they have no cover so i'll be hitting

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.490 
they have no cover so i'll be hitting
somewhere<00:03:23.299> on<00:03:23.450> this<00:03:23.599> side<00:03:23.659> and<00:03:23.900> I<00:03:24.319> ain't

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
somewhere on this side and I ain't

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.500 
somewhere on this side and I ain't
really<00:03:24.709> like<00:03:24.859> that<00:03:25.010> with<00:03:25.189> the<00:03:25.280> GTS<00:03:25.730> 250<00:03:26.030> s<00:03:26.299> or

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
really like that with the GTS 250 s or

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.509 
really like that with the GTS 250 s or

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
both in there because the the dual

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.530 
both in there because the the dual
flying<00:03:36.549> heatsink<00:03:37.549> fan<00:03:37.639> combo<00:03:38.209> were<00:03:38.359> way<00:03:38.510> too

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
flying heatsink fan combo were way too

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.390 
flying heatsink fan combo were way too
big<00:03:38.959> to<00:03:38.989> be<00:03:39.230> put<00:03:39.590> together<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:40.129> then<00:03:40.220> I<00:03:40.310> had
