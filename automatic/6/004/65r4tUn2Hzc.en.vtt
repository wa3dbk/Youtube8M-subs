50 and there's 40 coming into the new
s60<00:00:50.930> think<00:00:51.930> comparing<00:00:52.290> the<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.370> championship

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
s60 think comparing the the championship

s60 think comparing the the championship
in<00:00:53.940> Sweden<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.330> Australia<00:00:54.450> is<00:00:54.960> quite

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
in Sweden and Australia is quite

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.320 
in Sweden and Australia is quite
different<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:56.100> Sweden<00:00:56.520> Mooseport<00:00:56.700> is<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> much

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
different in Sweden Mooseport is a much

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.970 
different in Sweden Mooseport is a much
smaller<00:00:57.600> sport<00:00:57.989> but<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.500> think<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> biggest

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
smaller sport but I think the biggest

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.619 
smaller sport but I think the biggest
thing<00:00:59.220> in<00:00:59.430> Australia's<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> soup

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
thing in Australia's that the soup

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.540 
thing in Australia's that the soup
commercial<00:01:00.870> means<00:01:01.350> really<00:01:01.770> strong<00:01:02.190> we<00:01:02.340> have<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
commercial means really strong we have a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.490 
commercial means really strong we have a
great<00:01:02.879> championship<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.750> base<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.199> image

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
great championship to base the image

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.320 
great championship to base the image
around<00:01:04.739> with<00:01:05.009> racing<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.910> I<00:01:05.970> think<00:01:06.150> that's

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
around with racing and I think that's

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.540 
around with racing and I think that's
the<00:01:06.509> beauty<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.380> course<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.860> Australia's

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
the beauty of the course in Australia's

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.820 
the beauty of the course in Australia's
really<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.270> muscle<00:01:09.479> car<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.990> big<00:01:10.170> v8<00:01:10.380> and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
really it's a muscle car is a big v8 and

really it's a muscle car is a big v8 and
as<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.160> racing<00:01:11.580> person<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.149> am<00:01:12.330> really<00:01:12.960> like

you<00:02:42.720> always<00:02:42.870> get<00:02:43.230> all<00:02:43.439> the<00:02:43.590> enthusiasts

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
you always get all the enthusiasts

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.490 
you always get all the enthusiasts
people<00:02:44.519> coming<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.299> and<00:02:45.540> asking<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.049> for

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
people coming in and asking you for

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.050 
people coming in and asking you for
why<00:02:46.680> don't<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:46.980> do<00:02:47.099> performance<00:02:47.610> parts<00:02:47.879> what

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
why don't you do performance parts what

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.550 
why don't you do performance parts what
it<00:02:48.180> helped<00:02:48.689> them<00:02:48.780> with<00:02:48.959> their<00:02:49.110> cars<00:02:49.319> and

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
it helped them with their cars and

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.110 
it helped them with their cars and
things<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:49.829> that<00:02:50.069> so<00:02:50.340> we<00:02:50.730> coined<00:02:50.970> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
things like that so we coined the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.940 
things like that so we coined the
question<00:02:51.480> what<00:02:51.629> would<00:02:51.750> happen<00:02:52.079> if<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.799> race

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
question what would happen if the race

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.729 
question what would happen if the race
engineers<00:02:53.519> actually<00:02:53.790> got<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.299> make<00:02:54.739> their

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
engineers actually got to make their

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.429 
engineers actually got to make their
dream<00:02:56.040> version<00:02:56.459> out<00:02:56.609> of<00:02:56.849> a<00:02:56.879> road<00:02:57.480> car<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:57.989> that

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
dream version out of a road car and that

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:14.429 
dream version out of a road car and that
process<00:02:58.680> has<00:02:59.010> taken<00:02:59.189> us<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.790> this<00:02:59.909> car

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:18.520 

this<00:03:15.439> car<00:03:15.709> behind<00:03:15.950> us<00:03:16.129> is<00:03:16.430> an<00:03:16.610> s60<00:03:17.150> t6<00:03:17.540> this

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
this car behind us is an s60 t6 this

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.559 
this car behind us is an s60 t6 this
particular<00:03:18.829> model<00:03:19.129> will<00:03:19.430> be<00:03:19.549> pretty<00:03:19.879> rare<00:03:20.390> in

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
particular model will be pretty rare in

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.119 
particular model will be pretty rare in
Australia<00:03:20.989> there's<00:03:21.349> only<00:03:21.560> only<00:03:21.860> going<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.069> be

Australia there's only only going to be

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.640 
Australia there's only only going to be
a<00:03:22.159> few<00:03:22.370> hundred<00:03:22.730> of<00:03:22.790> them<00:03:23.030> one<00:03:23.989> for<00:03:24.200> part<00:03:24.500> is

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
a few hundred of them one for part is

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.280 
a few hundred of them one for part is
the<00:03:24.829> Alain<00:03:25.129> suspension<00:03:25.790> at<00:03:26.060> this<00:03:26.269> car<00:03:26.480> has<00:03:26.599> 80%

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
the Alain suspension at this car has 80%

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.199 
the Alain suspension at this car has 80%
stiffer<00:03:27.920> springs<00:03:28.310> than<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.670> standard<00:03:29.090> or

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
stiffer springs than the standard or

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.849 
stiffer springs than the standard or
design<00:03:29.569> car<00:03:29.870> but<00:03:30.290> it's<00:03:30.439> still<00:03:30.650> a<00:03:30.709> very

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859

so these cars are developed by us but

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.090 
so these cars are developed by us but
built<00:04:50.550> in<00:04:50.730> the<00:04:50.910> Volvo<00:04:51.090> factory<00:04:51.540> the<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.770> rebel
