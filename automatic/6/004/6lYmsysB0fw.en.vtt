00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.749
 we tried to do this earlier this week but as you see he does 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:20.210
 it just can't be there so I start to incur costs associated with one 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.260
 backlog of the 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.179
 Bert van Marwijk on reports that the internal bustle 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.660
 no because I didn't play the game, that's pretty serious actually 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:30.659
 it's been a lot of toppers lately that I do yes 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.280
 but i have seen you can not play well with my pc hate real in it 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.329
 September from 7 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.960
 that the plays for every game that you can get I know you when you get there 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.739
 the slopes and you have to dream at more property goes to japan the presale start 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.440
 that must also be because you will never happen because 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.580
 the ticket is an alv aller between 800 and 1000 euros I have seen a letter no 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.490
 way joseph the music in the plague basically pekela questions also don't happen 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.839
 and the pit I can sometimes 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.090
 ds 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.170
 The rates that were the best, yes, were the perfect opportunity to get acquainted 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.580
 with sending the coster to him too much for knowledge and 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.210
 who with his mother shame on you eat a limited audience ever 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.479
 and I think it is better to use that is also being changed 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:15.460
 would cost 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.540
 spiritual successor 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.770
 the first four percent natural and partly part 3 4 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.740
 and to the first 2 that procedure and find it not done very well 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.950
 that nevertheless came out at times 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.160
 and games from other games were so then you see the story of mysticism 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.870
 summary proceedings I say I go myself I think because I don't know 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.560
 mister not full because with them then drink 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.030
 yes on the 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.030
 the bloody and the city say a kind of video compilation of the first part one 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.050
 similar 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.100
 if it hurts how it hurts yes that's certainly five months now come in even better 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.439
 that rate is no more meaningful 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.270
 the two buildings go on the winter games 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.729
 well i have been to japan a few times so i'm just that game too 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.030
 play 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.460
 it is actually to shorten the sun power 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.440
 yes 3 i have people to watch and 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.770
 the were normal again 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.989
 texts balloon with profit yes 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.309
 but yes that I think it's a bit 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.719
 that that has the reservoir that is right and that is the cost 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:22.029
 feels a bit like past the first generation of western soldiers that is it 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:25.079
 not so crazy that you don't know if I come here when the 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.339
 developments 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:29.730
 there really is because if you can see its at 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.829
 yes that the personal shopper the fair way 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.129
 and before that are brought and you really know nothing is coming but there are 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.349
 also just moments and that unfortunately Hofland have something to do with this story 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.020
 is told between two dolls 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.880
 the export is on some lazy to keep giving no hefty about the attitude of 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:47.809
 ap a bit 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:51.679
 moderately translated there was how is that told because 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:55.109
 from the mood itself index took in the property sum those activities 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.959
 the uci 2 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.149
 what makes every year is just being 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.050
 yes I am uneven of that is no sense to go japan 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.800
 after that is a shame because there are also just a lot of great moments game for boats 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.659
 established is best friend 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:16.430
 and you always go to us and you go as the tough all the costs of school 5 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.389
 something that is 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:18.950
 the boss fights the press 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.720
 it's going to put the software just to attack in the blocks in it 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.969
 tilt and 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:27.329
 yes that way trying to survive the unions want 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.839
 has the koestraat 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:34.049
 story so also good 7 yes it can just be his main character on one 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.769
 good way put laughing gas I think 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.439
 the matter in itself especially if you are and may be in addition to the fact 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:45.519
 that a tough guest sector fall yes a human side he cares a racist 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.099
 for an orphanage 7 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.469
 and that also comes very far 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:53.920
 save the revenue from the best way to improve costs 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.639
 describe is the 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.420
 from that ag si already from hollywood 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.739
 fishermen just did everything they made when it was one thing 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.399
 and they have all nailed the state of family film such a yes 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:10.710
 absolutely zeewolde are nicely included 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.499
 year that is also our eyes just tough action super cool 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:19.169
 and then you go to other places after a beast house and then 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.239
 you have to go there for kids 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.349
 to deliver 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.449
 sometimes you go government determines that 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.270
 things didier let the story sink a bit and see what 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.750
 Your next steps are there so a child does not say the opportunity at all 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:33.860
 order bakas so but you must also do it or 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.819
 help help help were the first and mountain or roads that is sad because that is 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.819
 this now it's all true hello 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.759
 the 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.550
 sounds 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.020
 very exciting it now talks hope again 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.009
 that was a bit too, he actually jade the black page 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:56.419
 it from the course that we just stuff that 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.930
 who are just less so, yes 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.930
 that plan is going to land calves at the same time that other things console 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.699
 according to just a lot 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.759
 do things in in Tokyo all funny well i have bolder proof 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.509
 can speak 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:14.149
 nice evening drinking darts and yes that is just a wink from teitsma 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.770
 many people have someone for example 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.920
 Ford sprung year because parallel runs to the day more than later 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.719
 again on a question that guests can use 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:29.529
 the tukkers in the team agree that he did play 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:30.830
 failed 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.680
 two languages ​​have that great open world to debate at the truth of god 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.280
 mainz that people human people just need to do certain things 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.950
 osn 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.950
 says marijn to enrich your character 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:46.320
 this often concerns the story h 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.680
 one it is quite fascinating enough it is just as exciting that it is a benefit 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.100
 receive years to train no that respect you just see that that's typical 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.240
 females the place though hudaydah 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.879
 the party's pursuit is also called 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:03.219
 that thing in those that other games have as it says of stee 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:04.889
 the fall 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.960
 a family friendships because important for that careers 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:11.199
 previously known 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.360
 I'll make that up again 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.189
 nice again but it is clear that the cliffs are fair 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:19.189
 I also have to play it two rounds as a player 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:25.099
 if it is the season in between it is dark and you can think of that 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:26.729
 little play would happen 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.379
 you can live that makes it takes some getting used to for change 

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:32.809
 you can just ask the city 

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:36.860
 thereby the previous quarter the cost that is his special game you 

00:06:36.859 --> 00:06:39.099
 must be a bit of a struggle with the plans 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:43.029
 which is mainly due to those who bite these home childish moments 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.839
 but 

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:47.519
 j will also be rewarded with those beautiful cups in skoft ibm 

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:48.949
 in the basic fights and 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:52.669
 it is a special game that bothered two things 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:54.249
 has slightly less good things 

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:56.719
 that's why I finally come to the numbers 

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:57.459
 from seven to eleven
