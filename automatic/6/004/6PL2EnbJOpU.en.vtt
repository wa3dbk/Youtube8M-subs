then to soften up the brown underneath
the<00:04:55.370> lower<00:04:55.550> lash<00:04:55.790> line<00:04:56.060> I<00:04:56.210> just<00:04:56.390> ran<00:04:56.600> a<00:04:56.810> wee<00:04:56.990> bit

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
the lower lash line I just ran a wee bit

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.080 
the lower lash line I just ran a wee bit
of<00:04:57.200> the<00:04:57.530> midas<00:04:57.710> gold<00:04:58.160> on<00:04:58.670> a<00:04:58.700> blending<00:04:59.060> brush

along<00:04:59.570> the<00:04:59.780> edge<00:04:59.930> using<00:05:00.590> a<00:05:00.890> sigma<00:05:01.340> blending

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
along the edge using a sigma blending

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.340 
along the edge using a sigma blending
brush<00:05:01.910> I<00:05:02.060> started<00:05:02.450> to<00:05:02.540> build<00:05:02.690> up<00:05:02.870> more<00:05:03.110> of<00:05:03.140> the

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
brush I started to build up more of the

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.710 
brush I started to build up more of the
deep<00:05:03.800> forest<00:05:04.130> brown<00:05:04.730> into<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.450> crease

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
deep forest brown into the crease

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.690 
deep forest brown into the crease
creating<00:05:06.560> more<00:05:06.740> depth<00:05:07.100> than<00:05:07.220> a<00:05:07.400> little<00:05:07.550> bit

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
creating more depth than a little bit

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.730 
creating more depth than a little bit
more<00:05:07.910> drama<00:05:08.270> just<00:05:08.540> to<00:05:08.720> make<00:05:08.900> it<00:05:08.930> a<00:05:09.230> little<00:05:09.530> bit

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
more drama just to make it a little bit

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.920 
more drama just to make it a little bit
more<00:05:09.950> intense<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:10.610> then<00:05:10.640> because<00:05:11.570> I<00:05:11.600> wanted

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
more intense and then because I wanted

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.260 
more intense and then because I wanted
to<00:05:12.020> keep<00:05:12.140> the<00:05:12.320> overall<00:05:12.740> warmth<00:05:13.190> in<00:05:13.460> the<00:05:13.520> colors

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
to keep the overall warmth in the colors

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.750 
to keep the overall warmth in the colors
for<00:05:14.630> the<00:05:14.780> eyes<00:05:14.930> I<00:05:15.350> went<00:05:15.620> with<00:05:15.860> a<00:05:15.890> brown<00:05:16.280> gel

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
for the eyes I went with a brown gel

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.090 
for the eyes I went with a brown gel
eyeliner<00:05:17.210> rather<00:05:17.570> than<00:05:17.780> black<00:05:18.050> applying<00:05:18.890> this
