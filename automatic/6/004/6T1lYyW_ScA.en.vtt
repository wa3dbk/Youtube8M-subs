newer the better and you just tell by

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.080 
newer the better and you just tell by
just<00:00:48.020> kind<00:00:48.140> of<00:00:48.260> you<00:00:48.920> know<00:00:48.949> moving<00:00:49.910> it<00:00:50.030> around

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
just kind of you know moving it around

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.150 
just kind of you know moving it around
making<00:00:50.510> sure<00:00:50.629> it<00:00:50.840> moves<00:00:51.050> pretty<00:00:51.500> fluidly

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
because that can determine how well it

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.009 
because that can determine how well it
will<00:00:55.219> be<00:00:55.309> able<00:00:55.429> to<00:00:56.800> to<00:00:57.800> spread<00:00:58.269> so<00:00:59.269> you<00:00:59.329> want<00:00:59.840> a

like this you're just going to drag them
and<00:01:36.260> you're<00:01:36.980> going<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:37.130> place<00:01:37.430> it<00:01:37.460> on<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:38.320> on

and you're going to place it on the on

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.320 
and you're going to place it on the on
the<00:01:39.500> surface<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.100> you're<00:01:40.850> just<00:01:41.030> going<00:01:41.240> to

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
the surface and you're just going to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.450 
the surface and you're just going to
take<00:01:41.750> your<00:01:41.960> index<00:01:42.200> finger<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:42.890> use<00:01:43.820> that<00:01:44.060> to

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
take your index finger and use that to

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.160 
take your index finger and use that to
determine<00:01:46.460> how<00:01:47.270> many<00:01:47.330> cards<00:01:47.720> you<00:01:48.140> are

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
determine how many cards you are

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.720 
determine how many cards you are
allowing<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.610> fan<00:01:52.610> out<00:01:53.620> so<00:01:54.620> another<00:01:55.370> key

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
allowing to fan out so another key

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.920 
allowing to fan out so another key
component<00:01:55.910> of<00:01:56.330> this<00:01:56.450> is<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:57.350> surface<00:01:58.190> you<00:01:58.670> use

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
component of this is the surface you use

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.190 
component of this is the surface you use
I'm<00:01:59.930> using<00:02:00.290> a<00:02:00.650> mat<00:02:01.400> it's<00:02:01.670> kind<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:01.970> like<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.210> felt

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
I'm using a mat it's kind of like a felt

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.270 
I'm using a mat it's kind of like a felt
a<00:02:04.160> a<00:02:04.250> felt<00:02:04.760> mat<00:02:05.680> you<00:02:06.680> want<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:06.950> do<00:02:07.040> it<00:02:07.190> on

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
a a felt mat you want to do it on

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.800 
a a felt mat you want to do it on
something<00:02:07.670> like<00:02:07.850> a<00:02:08.569> carpet<00:02:09.470> like<00:02:10.480> this<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:11.629> have

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
something like a carpet like this I have

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.310 
something like a carpet like this I have
this<00:02:12.079> pad

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
this pad

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.520 
this pad
so<00:02:13.710> you<00:02:14.430> want<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.730> do<00:02:14.820> something<00:02:15.270> where<00:02:15.720> it's

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
so you want to do something where it's

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.340 
so you want to do something where it's
not<00:02:16.650> like<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.950> slippery<00:02:17.580> surface<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.050> cards

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
not like a slippery surface so the cards

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.710 
not like a slippery surface so the cards
are<00:02:19.530> left<00:02:19.800> fan<00:02:20.160> if<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.520> do<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.760> on<00:02:20.880> say<00:02:21.510> like<00:02:21.690> a

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
are left fan if you do it on say like a

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.390 
are left fan if you do it on say like a
kitchen<00:02:22.110> table<00:02:22.290> it's<00:02:22.770> going<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.040> be<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.130> lot

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
kitchen table it's going to be a lot

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.520 
kitchen table it's going to be a lot
harder<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:24.020> especially<00:02:25.020> when<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.260> want<00:02:25.440> to

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
harder and especially when you want to

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.280 
harder and especially when you want to
do<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.940> flipping<00:02:26.940> part<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.900> right<00:02:28.110> here

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
do the flipping part this right here

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.850 
do the flipping part this right here
which<00:02:28.410> I'll<00:02:28.560> get<00:02:28.680> into<00:02:28.740> um<00:02:29.900> that's<00:02:30.900> pretty

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
which I'll get into um that's pretty

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.560 
which I'll get into um that's pretty
much<00:02:32.040> not<00:02:32.340> possible<00:02:32.820> when<00:02:33.030> you're<00:02:33.270> on<00:02:33.510> a

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
much not possible when you're on a

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.520 
much not possible when you're on a
slippery<00:02:34.320> surface<00:02:35.450> so<00:02:36.450> one<00:02:36.990> more<00:02:37.140> time<00:02:37.170> let<00:02:37.500> me

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
slippery surface so one more time let me

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.130 
slippery surface so one more time let me
just<00:02:37.590> go<00:02:37.860> over<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.250> two<00:02:38.940> fingers<00:02:39.300> pinky<00:02:39.810> index

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
just go over the two fingers pinky index

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.040 
just go over the two fingers pinky index
and<00:02:40.950> thumb<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:41.880> you're<00:02:42.480> just<00:02:42.630> going<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.810> kind

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
and thumb and you're just going to kind

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.450 
and thumb and you're just going to kind
of<00:02:44.030> go<00:02:45.030> along<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.630> as<00:02:46.590> usual<00:02:46.860> just<00:02:47.130> kind<00:02:47.400> of

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
of go along and as usual just kind of

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.270 
of go along and as usual just kind of
want<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.640> release<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.330> spread<00:02:48.630> apart<00:02:48.900> your

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
want to release and spread apart your

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.310 
want to release and spread apart your
your<00:02:50.280> thumb<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.360> your<00:02:51.570> three<00:02:51.960> fingers<00:02:52.290> and

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
your thumb and your three fingers and

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.080 
your thumb and your three fingers and
then<00:02:52.740> just<00:02:53.130> want<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.400> go<00:02:53.520> along<00:02:53.760> maintaining

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
then just want to go along maintaining

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.830 
then just want to go along maintaining
steady<00:02:54.600> pressure<00:02:54.870> with<00:02:55.650> your<00:02:55.680> index<00:02:56.040> finger

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
steady pressure with your index finger

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.150 
steady pressure with your index finger
so<00:02:57.840> here's<00:02:58.050> what<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.440> ribbon<00:02:58.680> spread<00:02:58.830> looks

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
so here's what the ribbon spread looks

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.580 
so here's what the ribbon spread looks
like<00:02:59.340> from<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.940> performers<00:03:00.480> angle<00:03:00.900> I've<00:03:01.350> got

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
like from the performers angle I've got

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.380 
like from the performers angle I've got
my<00:03:01.710> thumb<00:03:01.920> on<00:03:02.100> bottom<00:03:02.430> my<00:03:02.580> three<00:03:02.850> fingers<00:03:03.030> on

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
my thumb on bottom my three fingers on

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.930 
my thumb on bottom my three fingers on
top<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:03.840> my<00:03:03.990> index<00:03:04.380> finger<00:03:04.680> on<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.890> side<00:03:05.100> so

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
top and my index finger on the side so

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.460 
top and my index finger on the side so
I'm<00:03:06.060> just<00:03:06.300> going<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.540> this<00:03:06.930> is<00:03:07.080> without<00:03:07.200> my

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
I'm just going to this is without my

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.710 
I'm just going to this is without my
finger<00:03:07.770> of<00:03:07.830> my<00:03:07.950> index<00:03:08.490> finger<00:03:08.790> I'm<00:03:09.000> just<00:03:09.480> going

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
finger of my index finger I'm just going

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.420 
finger of my index finger I'm just going
to<00:03:09.870> spread<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.560> cards<00:03:10.590> out<00:03:10.920> like<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:11.190> and

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
to spread the cards out like that and

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.850 
to spread the cards out like that and
you<00:03:11.490> can<00:03:11.940> see<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.420> have<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.200> basic<00:03:13.380> spread<00:03:13.710> but

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
you can see I have the basic spread but

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.380 
you can see I have the basic spread but
I<00:03:13.890> don't<00:03:14.070> have<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.430> consistency<00:03:15.090> that<00:03:15.120> I'm

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
I don't have the consistency that I'm

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.290 
I don't have the consistency that I'm
looking<00:03:15.480> for<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.560> use<00:03:17.160> my<00:03:17.370> index<00:03:17.640> finger<00:03:18.000> to

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
looking for so I use my index finger to

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.750 
looking for so I use my index finger to
kind<00:03:18.570> of<00:03:18.630> allow<00:03:18.900> as<00:03:19.200> much<00:03:19.860> pressure<00:03:20.190> as<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.520> want

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
kind of allow as much pressure as I want

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.080 
kind of allow as much pressure as I want
and<00:03:21.110> I<00:03:22.110> push<00:03:22.620> down<00:03:22.830> on<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:23.070> cards<00:03:23.490> and<00:03:23.850> I<00:03:23.910> use

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
and I push down on the cards and I use

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.300 
and I push down on the cards and I use
my<00:03:24.240> index<00:03:24.510> finger<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.110> release<00:03:25.680> as<00:03:25.860> many<00:03:26.040> cards

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
my index finger to release as many cards

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.800 
my index finger to release as many cards
as<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.490> want<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:28.140> get<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.470> nice<00:03:28.760> consistent

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
as I want and I get that nice consistent

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.730 
as I want and I get that nice consistent
fan<00:03:31.610> so<00:03:32.840> basically<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:34.020> want<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.290> just<00:03:34.440> move

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
fan so basically you want to just move

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.190 
fan so basically you want to just move
at<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.130> nice<00:03:36.830> even<00:03:37.830> pace<00:03:38.460> and<00:03:38.840> get<00:03:39.840> all<00:03:40.050> the

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
at a nice even pace and get all the

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.620 
at a nice even pace and get all the
cards<00:03:40.500> down<00:03:40.710> using<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.730> same<00:03:41.970> pressure<00:03:42.300> the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
cards down using the same pressure the

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.540 
cards down using the same pressure the
same<00:03:42.810> speed<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.890> will<00:03:44.130> get<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.400> that

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
same speed and that will get you that

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.510 
same speed and that will get you that
nice<00:03:44.790> consistent<00:03:45.390> spread<00:03:46.020> so<00:03:46.830> once<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.100> have

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
nice consistent spread so once you have

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.300 
nice consistent spread so once you have
fooled<00:03:47.910> around<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.600> mastered<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.800> basics

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
fooled around and mastered the basics

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.510 
fooled around and mastered the basics
spread<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:51.570> next<00:03:51.930> part<00:03:52.470> is<00:03:52.740> basically<00:03:53.310> just

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
spread the next part is basically just

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.300 
spread the next part is basically just
keep<00:03:54.240> on<00:03:54.420> playing<00:03:54.690> around<00:03:54.960> and<00:03:55.320> kind<00:03:56.160> of

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
keep on playing around and kind of

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.580 
keep on playing around and kind of
getting<00:03:56.670> used<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.060> do<00:03:57.630> some<00:03:57.870> cool

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
getting used to it do some cool

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.480 
getting used to it do some cool
different<00:03:58.710> shapes<00:03:59.130> can<00:04:00.060> do<00:04:00.300> the<00:04:00.960> classic<00:04:01.590> work

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
different shapes can do the classic work

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.960 
different shapes can do the classic work
like<00:04:02.790> that<00:04:02.820> you<00:04:03.300> could<00:04:03.870> do<00:04:04.050> wavy<00:04:04.620> lines<00:04:04.980> it's

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
like that you could do wavy lines it's

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.330 
like that you could do wavy lines it's
very<00:04:06.270> cool<00:04:06.570> what<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:06.900> can<00:04:07.080> create<00:04:07.740> with<00:04:08.040> this

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
very cool what you can create with this

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.640 
very cool what you can create with this
simple<00:04:08.670> spread<00:04:08.940> but<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.720> next<00:04:09.959> part<00:04:10.200> of<00:04:10.410> this

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
simple spread but the next part of this

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.380 
simple spread but the next part of this
is<00:04:11.570> creating<00:04:12.570> that<00:04:12.600> wave<00:04:13.050> that<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:14.390> cards

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
is creating that wave that the cards

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.800 
is creating that wave that the cards
flipping<00:04:15.780> over<00:04:16.100> which<00:04:17.100> makes<00:04:17.400> this<00:04:17.609> this<00:04:18.510> move

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
flipping over which makes this this move

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.740 
flipping over which makes this this move
so<00:04:19.170> much<00:04:19.290> better<00:04:20.060> so<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.120> do<00:04:21.359> that<00:04:21.390> you're

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
so much better so to do that you're

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.450 
so much better so to do that you're
going<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:21.930> want<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.229> get<00:04:22.320> a<00:04:22.380> nice<00:04:22.680> consistent

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
going to want to get a nice consistent

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.370 
going to want to get a nice consistent
spread

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
spread

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.160 
spread
going<00:04:24.620> to<00:04:24.740> take<00:04:24.890> your<00:04:25.160> thumb<00:04:25.640> and<00:04:25.700> index<00:04:26.420> and

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
going to take your thumb and index and

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.470 
going to take your thumb and index and
middle<00:04:27.680> finger<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:28.280> right<00:04:29.240> where<00:04:29.390> you

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
middle finger and right where you

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.330 
middle finger and right where you
started<00:04:29.930> with<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.200> with<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.890> spread<00:04:31.190> you're

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
started with the with the spread you're

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.290 
started with the with the spread you're
going<00:04:31.460> to<00:04:31.520> start<00:04:31.910> there

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
going to start there

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.330 
going to start there
lift<00:04:32.900> up<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.200> first<00:04:33.410> few<00:04:33.590> cards<00:04:33.980> and<00:04:34.160> just

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
lift up the first few cards and just

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.100 
lift up the first few cards and just
kind<00:04:34.520> of<00:04:34.640> tip<00:04:35.030> it<00:04:35.150> over<00:04:35.240> just<00:04:35.510> like<00:04:35.630> that<00:04:35.750> and

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
kind of tip it over just like that and

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.830 
kind of tip it over just like that and
you<00:04:36.890> want<00:04:37.100> to<00:04:37.190> kind<00:04:37.280> of<00:04:37.460> send<00:04:37.670> it<00:04:37.760> hard<00:04:38.030> so<00:04:38.600> that

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
you want to kind of send it hard so that

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.710 
you want to kind of send it hard so that
it<00:04:38.960> finishes<00:04:39.410> if<00:04:39.590> you<00:04:40.130> do<00:04:40.850> too<00:04:41.120> lightly<00:04:41.540> you'll

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
it finishes if you do too lightly you'll

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.230 
it finishes if you do too lightly you'll
notice<00:04:42.080> that<00:04:42.520> maybe<00:04:43.520> it<00:04:43.730> won't<00:04:43.880> make<00:04:44.000> it<00:04:44.150> all

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
notice that maybe it won't make it all

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.000 
notice that maybe it won't make it all
the<00:04:44.270> way<00:04:44.360> through<00:04:44.480> and<00:04:45.020> you<00:04:45.530> have<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.770> press

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
the way through and you have to press

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.530 
the way through and you have to press
down<00:04:46.040> a<00:04:46.220> little<00:04:46.400> harder<00:04:46.790> and<00:04:46.970> it'll<00:04:47.120> get<00:04:47.210> stuck

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
down a little harder and it'll get stuck

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.860 
down a little harder and it'll get stuck
in<00:04:47.780> that<00:04:48.020> doesn't<00:04:48.770> look<00:04:48.950> too<00:04:49.010> good<00:04:49.250> so<00:04:49.870> I'll

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
in that doesn't look too good so I'll

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.070 
in that doesn't look too good so I'll
give<00:04:51.110> it<00:04:51.200> a<00:04:51.260> nice<00:04:51.440> hard<00:04:51.740> push<00:04:52.100> and<00:04:52.850> it<00:04:53.810> should

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
give it a nice hard push and it should

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.000 
give it a nice hard push and it should
make<00:04:54.350> it<00:04:54.380> through<00:04:54.740> and<00:04:56.080> then<00:04:57.080> you<00:04:57.290> can<00:04:57.590> kind<00:04:57.950> of

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
make it through and then you can kind of

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.250 
make it through and then you can kind of
just<00:04:58.070> scoop<00:04:58.550> it<00:04:58.700> up<00:04:58.820> with<00:04:59.450> your<00:04:59.630> left<00:04:59.900> hand<00:05:00.050> if

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
just scoop it up with your left hand if

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.760 
just scoop it up with your left hand if
you're<00:05:00.380> a<00:05:00.410> righty

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
you're a righty

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.550 
you're a righty
when<00:05:01.310> you<00:05:01.430> send<00:05:01.670> it<00:05:01.760> back<00:05:01.790> so<00:05:02.360> do<00:05:03.320> a<00:05:03.350> nice

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
when you send it back so do a nice

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.480 
when you send it back so do a nice
one-two<00:05:04.160> and<00:05:04.550> scoop<00:05:05.500> to<00:05:06.500> catch<00:05:06.800> it<00:05:06.980> and<00:05:07.100> send

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
one-two and scoop to catch it and send

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.280 
one-two and scoop to catch it and send
it<00:05:07.580> back<00:05:07.640> you're<00:05:08.510> going<00:05:08.690> to<00:05:08.810> want<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.080> take

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
send it back so that's another really

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.950 
send it back so that's another really
cool<00:05:22.520> effect<00:05:22.760> and<00:05:22.970> like<00:05:23.330> I<00:05:23.480> said<00:05:23.540> you<00:05:23.750> can<00:05:23.870> play

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
cool effect and like I said you can play

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.870 
cool effect and like I said you can play
around<00:05:24.170> with<00:05:24.350> the<00:05:24.440> different<00:05:24.640> shapes<00:05:25.640> and

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
around with the different shapes and

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.850 
around with the different shapes and
then<00:05:26.080> experiment<00:05:27.080> waves<00:05:27.320> like<00:05:27.530> that<00:05:27.710> it

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
then experiment waves like that it

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.000 
then experiment waves like that it
creates<00:05:28.250> a<00:05:28.310> pretty<00:05:28.490> cool<00:05:28.640> wave<00:05:29.110> and<00:05:30.110> yeah<00:05:30.770> just

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
creates a pretty cool wave and yeah just

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.150 
creates a pretty cool wave and yeah just
have<00:05:31.160> a<00:05:31.190> lot<00:05:31.790> of<00:05:31.820> fun<00:05:32.030> with<00:05:32.180> this<00:05:32.270> it's<00:05:32.480> a<00:05:32.570> very

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
have a lot of fun with this it's a very

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.850 
have a lot of fun with this it's a very
cool<00:05:34.160> way<00:05:34.430> to<00:05:34.870> just<00:05:35.870> show<00:05:36.020> the<00:05:36.050> cards<00:05:36.560> and<00:05:36.740> have

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
cool way to just show the cards and have

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.130 
cool way to just show the cards and have
the<00:05:37.010> spectator<00:05:37.430> select<00:05:37.730> them<00:05:37.850> another<00:05:38.690> way<00:05:38.900> of

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
the spectator select them another way of

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.920 
the spectator select them another way of
doing<00:05:39.290> the<00:05:39.500> wave<00:05:39.680> is<00:05:39.980> by<00:05:40.570> taking<00:05:41.570> at<00:05:41.810> the

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
doing the wave is by taking at the

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.380 
doing the wave is by taking at the
bottom<00:05:42.170> card<00:05:42.410> and<00:05:43.070> you<00:05:43.160> can<00:05:43.280> kind<00:05:43.490> of<00:05:43.580> just<00:05:43.760> go

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
bottom card and you can kind of just go

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.940 
bottom card and you can kind of just go
along<00:05:44.600> the<00:05:44.660> top<00:05:44.840> of<00:05:45.200> the<00:05:45.440> cards<00:05:45.710> just<00:05:45.770> like

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
along the top of the cards just like

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.900 
along the top of the cards just like
that<00:05:46.220> and<00:05:46.540> another<00:05:47.540> thing<00:05:47.780> you<00:05:47.810> can<00:05:47.990> do<00:05:48.170> is<00:05:48.910> you

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
that and another thing you can do is you

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.160 
that and another thing you can do is you
can<00:05:50.090> do<00:05:50.210> that<00:05:50.240> go<00:05:51.430> across<00:05:52.510> grab<00:05:53.510> another<00:05:53.840> card
