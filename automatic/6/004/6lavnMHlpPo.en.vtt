00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello everyone how are you listening to them 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.299
 I ask a little thing to you not to them 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.220
 happens that many times the wedges are 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.650
 they were as yellowish as a 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.380
 very ugly unsightly color that does not look 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.049
 nothing good and truth are like nails 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.289
 what an essential part of having a good 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.600
 presentation and good hygiene but I 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.850
 I understand that it is many times on the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.039
 of our work by part of 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.570
 different factors that we have to 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.060
 have handle that we have to handle 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.070
 different chemical substances or 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.570
 different things and nails do that 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.030
 they are getting yellow for us 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.890
 time in the case of girls and ones 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.960
 of other guys out there so well 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.300
 daring they paint their nails all the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.700
 time then that also means that 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.890
 the nails were turning yellow 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.590
 chemicals that contain the glazes and 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.719
 mainly those the enamel of this 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.440
 nail color very intense colors 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.789
 intense gaudy are those that make 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.829
 that the nails get a lot more 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.140
 yellow with time but not 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.090
 be 20 do not worry in this video I 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.050
 I have a homemade solution 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.860
 and very effective to help dismantle 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.780
 the yellow nails but remember that no 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.850
 it's a miracle that it's not going to work either 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.530
 the first time you have to be constant 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.979
 you have to do it you have to do it until 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.810
 that we see improvements in our nails like this 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.150
 that what we are going to need is well 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.280
 simple we always have it at home all 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.590
 time and if you do not have it you should 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.720
 have it because it is an ingredient that you 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.869
 it serves for many things in this case we 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.369
 will serve to remove the nails 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:41.280
 and I mean oxygenated water is 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.740
 economic me for this huge jar so 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.830
 just pay like 68 cents 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.860
 here in the USA in economical pharmacies 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.460
 we're going to need this in the first 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.920
 part and cotton hits ok what are we going to 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.259
 to look, nothing else is washing your hands 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.100
 as usual and we are going to 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.560
 wet a cotton ball with hydrogen peroxide and 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.390
 what we are going to do is pass it all and 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.910
 each one of our nails ok ones 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.570
 few minutes there all each 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.120
 good good good good well good all 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.770
 each one of our nails but some 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.480
 five minutes I think we're going to walk 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:24.220
 massaging them in all our wedges 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.620
 once we have done that already in all 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.690
 our nails the second part of this 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.140
 of this treatment is that we are going to 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.420
 need a cup of hot water and the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.510
 we are going to put in a container what 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.570
 big enough and we're going to put it 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.250
 likewise three quarters here can 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.190
 see that there are three rooms where the 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.910
 three quarters here you can see that they are 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.460
 three quarts of hydrogen peroxide and the 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.870
 let's put together with the hot water 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.000
 nothing more carefully because if the water 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.250
 it's very hot you can burn the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.030
 with careful and we are going to submerge is not 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.880
 submerge forgiveness our hands as per 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.760
 approximately 5 to 10 minutes a 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.260
 maximum in the hot water mixture and 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.930
 oxygenated water ok 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.060
 this we are going to repeat some two or 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.610
 three times a week until we look 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.860
 improvement will see that with the passage of time 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.890
 the nails are going to return to a color 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.379
 white are going to look spectacular and 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.690
 then if you are going to be able to wear a glaze 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:31.220
 a super super mannequin very well is 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.010
 a treatment that comes very well to 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.870
 the men who work in the field the 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.450
 that are mechanical or that have to 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.370
 work in the garden all that 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.560
 recommendable girls do it to your boy 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.069
 once a week and they'll see what's going to 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.099
 have great nails ok tell me 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.780
