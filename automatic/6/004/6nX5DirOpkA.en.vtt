I walked all the way to the top of the

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.460 
I walked all the way to the top of the
tower<00:06:40.700> thinking<00:06:41.180> the<00:06:41.270> flag<00:06:41.510> was<00:06:41.720> there<00:06:41.990> he

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
bottom found the flag took it and then

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.090 
bottom found the flag took it and then
went<00:06:46.580> around<00:06:46.760> the<00:06:46.910> outskirts<00:06:47.320> again<00:06:48.320> and<00:06:48.890> i

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
went around the outskirts again and i

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.980 
went around the outskirts again and i
went<00:06:49.370> in<00:06:49.460> through<00:06:49.670> the<00:06:49.760> back<00:06:49.910> of<00:06:49.940> my<00:06:50.120> base<00:06:50.420> and

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
went in through the back of my base and

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.420 
went in through the back of my base and
the<00:06:51.320> best<00:06:51.530> part<00:06:51.650> about<00:06:51.740> it<00:06:51.920> is<00:06:52.100> is<00:06:52.250> that<00:06:52.400> i

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.430 
the best part about it is is that i

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.280 
the best part about it is is that i
missed<00:06:52.760> the<00:06:53.030> place<00:06:53.690> we<00:06:53.840> were<00:06:53.930> supposed<00:06:54.230> to

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.290 
missed the place we were supposed to

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.070 
missed the place we were supposed to
flip<00:06:54.470> the<00:06:54.710> wool<00:06:54.890> in<00:06:55.040> twice<00:06:55.310> cuz<00:06:56.090> i<00:06:56.180> was<00:06:56.870> at<00:06:56.990> the

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
flip the wool in twice cuz i was at the

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.390 
flip the wool in twice cuz i was at the
bottom<00:06:57.440> and<00:06:57.560> then<00:06:57.710> i<00:06:57.770> thought<00:06:57.920> it<00:06:58.070> was<00:06:58.130> at<00:06:58.280> the

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
bottom and then i thought it was at the

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.010 
bottom and then i thought it was at the
top<00:06:58.610> and<00:06:58.850> then<00:06:58.970> it<00:06:59.120> wasn't<00:06:59.480> actually<00:06:59.660> in<00:06:59.930> the

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020 
top and then it wasn't actually in the

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:15.290 
top and then it wasn't actually in the
middle

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.330
