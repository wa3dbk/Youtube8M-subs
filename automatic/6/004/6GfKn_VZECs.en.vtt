00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 welcome to our boys edition us 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.970
 do it today and I have to 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.000
 me now at the beginning 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.469
 excuse me because I'm starting 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.559
 The week announced that we are today 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.839
 a topmodel candidate of the current 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.430
 Season has it as you see 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.080
 not by what it is that they 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.390
 About half an hour before the show 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.119
 has canceled what she can do nothing but 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.630
 your agency one one management in 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.250
 cling klumpp ultimately want yes 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.480
 they do not want them here now 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.450
 women is available 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.230
 probably but pay nothing or 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.770
 maybe also to the sample can 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.530
 no idea 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.230
 that's why initially maybe off for 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.730
 claudia or ill and his see are 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.670
 conquered and I still have betty at the start 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.410
 is free this holiday accurate and can 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.140
 On the way I will go in Cologne 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.670
 and yes you can start right away 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.039
 now that we are synonymous with topmodel 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.239
 we will be there for the final live 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.610
 be a ticket completely from 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.160
 co-workers and nice reception for 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.219
 hold on to our last 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.210
 video then no doubt 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.080
 right now now what today 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.310
 So today it happened 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.810
 bioethical and I have to say that 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.060
 I found it cool because there was his 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.590
 last year not so no there was 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.590
 first intake not and secondly if it 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.030
 even without the candidates 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.580
 had a choice with whom they want together 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.200
 mares and quasi this pre-casting 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.479
 year you in the role of the jury 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.510
 do not put in so intensely now 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.370
 how the gis is doing 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.220
 but it costs to decide for yourself 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.170
 I found a super earth and me 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.170
 believe that was also very good at the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.930
 girls and yes at least the shooting gave 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.360
 something like that, I believe that I do 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.820
 would give him 2,008 in the third echelon where 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.950
 the ones they are today themselves 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.810
 yes, a shooting with guys on the beach 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.360
 and I always find that cool because 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.460
 am not because still surprised how 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.990
 how problematic that we are so girls 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.170
 that somehow they somehow 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.450
 little in lima will not be there 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.120
 there was also this season now 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.120
 not such a big deal my friend 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.860
 Look at me on the staggering before 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.600
 and they know that could be up to us 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.980
 to come out there but we think far 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.640
 I was not the feeling that I 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.640
 already exemplary 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.140
 yes, but they have done quite well 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.980
 which irritates me a bit 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.440
 heidi always your parents 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.520
 somehow with the set but has and go 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.520
 for the food to go 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.170
 but I'm really surprised that 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.060
 Parents because they always told me that 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.959
 the mother to care for the children 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.580
 that I realized that she too 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.650
 melanie hafner logically but if the 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.730
 parents can leave their often contact the 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.600
 Do not worry about the kids at all 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.790
 That's not possible 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.129
 but they will 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.569
 Maybe the day will be there 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:58.969
 do not also defend dear 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:03.319
 that nothing does not show here 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:07.939
 i would not say own ears were 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:10.930
 that which I did not like so much 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.930
 I also go to school 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:17.930
 which I did not like so much 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.060
 this one is spinning in the desert 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.950
 was quite amusing as Lisa did that 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.720
 But I'm generally not that 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.760
 fan of this pseudo spectacle 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.250
 I do not like training this way you see 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.569
 I have that completely again 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.790
 displaced and also switched to as 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.799
 which was somehow white 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.319
 no competition no job and no 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.689
 two injured job chair chosen 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.730
 So what was just soja? 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:44.480
 provides you times through times 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.510
 each other in front of the lisa who has them 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.590
 has packed so that it is a father you 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.419
 had out if this English 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.810
 knowledge or this english smoker 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.810
 Not 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:58.579
 it is such a thing too 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.650
 it gave me the unit a bit 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.470
 and that's not because most of them 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.290
 things then reminds me of the meadows 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.329
 the luise for two at that body 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.889
 clearly vote yes if the sensor for 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.479
 me metro both say I think so 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:15.379
 warmly for the the these 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:16.780
 nothing was pretty 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.730
 The league will not be a career 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.190
 how does it go afterwards in the cosmetics studio or 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:26.570
 is already here nails paint 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.220
 or something in cosmetics for the fashion 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.400
 week and save if this too 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.480
 if over found the set in the church 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.620
 I really cool it we would have too 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.550
 already a few years ago but times 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.560
 This tutorial expensive kurt Kreiler but 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.780
 what he now the designers in the end 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.600
 He sat forward 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.340
 if they are so rainy now 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.150
 according to the motto the designers mix 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.610
 that with 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.610
 but in the end again with language 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:06.380
 but yes that besides wedding application that 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:08.930
 I actually found it 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.880
 not really so but my god 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.170
 the driver to heart man had the 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.810
 Woman and I are also happy for him 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:17.060
 help those seriously not have eyes 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.060
 he okay now maybe we can 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.600
 you want that from the cities fast 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.250
 win may say the money 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.860
 no stupid so maybe that sounds 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:33.640
 also very close that you do not open 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.640
 bread so it was romantic i think so 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:41.930
 make a video 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:44.930
 yes yes yes 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.090
 the first flight like yes I can exactly 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.590
 very sweet but not me 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.750
 believe the decision was right lisa 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.780
 easy for the quote and 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.680
 but if I'm a bit tonner with 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.680
 last third long as the 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.600
 entertainment i am just fine i 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:05.990
 I would also like to have a great face 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.200
 Very young, mega something me 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:16.760
 It's a bit irritating that they are so 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:18.200
 unbelievable violence has so yes leather that way 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.060
 incredible space for everyone now 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.530
 animal lovers come now because they are so 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.780
 cried and I thought so girl 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.190
 It's not a win in the end 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.930
 And that is so every week so now 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.250
 always he would go again concept 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.260

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.360
