00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
at the body just similar to thermography

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.430 
at the body just similar to thermography
where<00:04:34.610> she's<00:04:34.910> looking<00:04:35.420> for<00:04:35.750> areas<00:04:36.290> that

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
where she's looking for areas that
