00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
smartphone of with that kind of battery

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.920 
smartphone of with that kind of battery
you<00:03:18.750> would<00:03:18.930> expect<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.500> battery<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.160> Las

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
you would expect the battery to Las

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.870 
you would expect the battery to Las
relatively<00:03:21.930> for<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.290> long<00:03:22.560> time<00:03:22.860> maybe<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.280> day

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
relatively for a long time maybe a day

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.940 
relatively for a long time maybe a day
or<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.860> maybe<00:03:25.860> I<00:03:26.330> i<00:03:27.330> don't<00:03:27.900> know<00:03:28.050> maybe<00:03:28.260> like<00:03:28.530> 20

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
or so maybe I i don't know maybe like 20

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.120 
or so maybe I i don't know maybe like 20
hours<00:03:28.980> but<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:31.410> first<00:03:31.650> day<00:03:31.830> has<00:03:31.980> been

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.040 
hours but I the first day has been
really<00:03:32.490> disappointing<00:03:33.180> in<00:03:33.300> terms<00:03:33.330> of<00:03:33.780> battery

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
really disappointing in terms of battery

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.310

still I didn't get a good battery life
well<00:04:36.330> hopefully<00:04:36.480> what<00:04:36.930> time<00:04:37.200> I'll<00:04:37.380> get<00:04:37.560> used

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
well hopefully what time I'll get used

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.580 
well hopefully what time I'll get used
to<00:04:37.950> it<00:04:38.040> and<00:04:38.310> somehow<00:04:39.180> i<00:04:39.630> would<00:04:39.900> get<00:04:40.080> good

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
to it and somehow i would get good
