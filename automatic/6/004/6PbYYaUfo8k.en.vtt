using him first of all I'm gonna say I

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.619 
using him first of all I'm gonna say I
didn't<00:00:34.039> really<00:00:34.190> like<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:34.969> first<00:00:35.360> couple<00:00:35.600> of

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
didn't really like the first couple of

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:36.880 
didn't really like the first couple of
games<00:00:35.780> even<00:00:36.050> he<00:00:36.200> felt<00:00:36.410> like<00:00:36.500> a<00:00:36.590> bit<00:00:36.800> of<00:00:36.829> a

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
games even he felt like a bit of a

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.410 
games even he felt like a bit of a
strange<00:00:37.219> player<00:00:37.460> because<00:00:37.730> he's<00:00:37.820> ball<00:00:38.030> control

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
strange player because he's ball control

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.869 
strange player because he's ball control
his<00:00:38.660> dribbling<00:00:38.930> was<00:00:39.020> really<00:00:39.350> good<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:39.879> but

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
his dribbling was really good and but

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.400 
his dribbling was really good and but
then<00:00:41.030> I<00:00:41.090> actually<00:00:41.239> researched<00:00:41.840> into<00:00:42.110> a<00:00:42.140> little

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
then I actually researched into a little

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.260 
then I actually researched into a little
bit<00:00:42.530> and<00:00:42.620> it<00:00:42.739> turns<00:00:43.370> out<00:00:43.520> that<00:00:43.579> you<00:00:43.850> used<00:00:44.090> to<00:00:44.180> be

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
bit and it turns out that you used to be

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.020 
bit and it turns out that you used to be
a<00:00:44.300> right-back<00:00:44.750> or<00:00:44.960> a<00:00:44.989> left-back<00:00:45.410> and<00:00:45.680> I

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
a right-back or a left-back and I

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.490 
a right-back or a left-back and I
remember<00:00:47.030> that<00:00:47.629> used<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:47.899> be<00:00:47.960> right<00:00:48.170> back<00:00:48.289> or<00:00:48.469> I

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
remember that used to be right back or I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.500 
remember that used to be right back or I
left<00:00:48.649> back<00:00:48.859> it's<00:00:49.640> got<00:00:49.730> really<00:00:49.969> good<00:00:50.059> marking

as<00:00:56.120> you<00:00:56.210> would<00:00:56.300> expect<00:00:56.359> from<00:00:56.719> an<00:00:56.899> 87<00:00:57.559> overall

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
as you would expect from an 87 overall

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.840 
as you would expect from an 87 overall
defender<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:58.969> and<00:00:59.899> I<00:01:00.739> I've<00:01:01.370> never<00:01:01.579> really

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
defender and and I I've never really

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.490 
defender and and I I've never really
seen<00:01:02.030> many<00:01:02.239> defenders<00:01:02.780> from<00:01:02.989> Morocco<00:01:03.230> but

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
seen many defenders from Morocco but

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.899 
seen many defenders from Morocco but
this<00:01:03.649> guy<00:01:03.800> seems<00:01:03.829> to<00:01:04.160> be<00:01:04.250> an<00:01:04.309> absolute<00:01:04.640> tank

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
this guy seems to be an absolute tank

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.280 
this guy seems to be an absolute tank
he's<00:01:05.089> got<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.330> perfect<00:01:05.479> were<00:01:05.810> rates<00:01:06.080> for<00:01:06.259> a

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
he's got the perfect were rates for a

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.010 
he's got the perfect were rates for a
defender<00:01:06.710> in<00:01:06.740> my<00:01:06.950> position<00:01:07.189> in<00:01:07.369> my<00:01:07.580> ear<00:01:07.820> in<00:01:08.689> my

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
defender in my position in my ear in my

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.050 
defender in my position in my ear in my
opinion<00:01:09.229> he's<00:01:09.979> got<00:01:10.159> a<00:01:10.280> medium<00:01:10.610> attacking<00:01:10.939> wear

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
opinion he's got a medium attacking wear

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.249 
opinion he's got a medium attacking wear
rate<00:01:11.210> had<00:01:11.420> defensive<00:01:11.780> workrate<00:01:11.930> so<00:01:12.170> that

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
rate had defensive workrate so that

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.690 
rate had defensive workrate so that
means<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:12.680> majority<00:01:12.979> of<00:01:13.009> the<00:01:13.100> time<00:01:13.250> he<00:01:13.520> is

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
means the majority of the time he is

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.270 
means the majority of the time he is
defensive<00:01:14.299> although<00:01:15.170> I<00:01:15.200> did<00:01:15.710> go<00:01:15.860> on<00:01:15.890> a<00:01:16.009> couple

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
defensive although I did go on a couple

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.069 
defensive although I did go on a couple
of<00:01:16.369> runs<00:01:16.610> with<00:01:16.939> him<00:01:17.150> just<00:01:17.329> to<00:01:17.479> try<00:01:17.659> and<00:01:17.689> you

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
of runs with him just to try and you

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:19.810 
of runs with him just to try and you
know<00:01:18.110> score<00:01:18.770> a<00:01:18.799> couple<00:01:18.979> goals<00:01:19.369> and<00:01:19.640> he

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
know score a couple goals and he

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.520 
know score a couple goals and he
actually<00:01:19.939> pulls<00:01:20.270> out<00:01:20.420> one<00:01:20.630> amazing<00:01:21.290> shot

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
actually pulls out one amazing shot

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.289 
actually pulls out one amazing shot
unfortunately<00:01:21.740> it<00:01:22.220> doesn't<00:01:22.400> go<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:22.670> got

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
unfortunately it doesn't go in got

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.670 
unfortunately it doesn't go in got
really<00:01:23.600> high<00:01:23.750> interceptions<00:01:24.259> as<00:01:24.409> well<00:01:24.560> so

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
really high interceptions as well so

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.960 
really high interceptions as well so
he's<00:01:24.829> really<00:01:25.009> good<00:01:25.250> we're<00:01:25.610> gonna<00:01:25.700> look<00:01:25.850> at

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
he's really good we're gonna look at

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.910 
he's really good we're gonna look at
those<00:01:26.090> interceptions<00:01:26.509> now<00:01:26.840> I've<00:01:27.200> labeled<00:01:27.710> it

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
those interceptions now I've labeled it

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.219 
those interceptions now I've labeled it
under<00:01:28.030> interceptions<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:29.119> blocking<00:01:29.899> because

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
under interceptions and blocking because

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.980 
under interceptions and blocking because
I<00:01:30.470> basically<00:01:31.369> see<00:01:31.759> interceptions<00:01:32.329> as<00:01:32.509> putting

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
I basically see interceptions as putting

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.749 
I basically see interceptions as putting
yourself<00:01:33.470> in<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.649> right<00:01:33.799> place<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:34.399> he<00:01:34.640> was

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
yourself in the right place and he was

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.520 
yourself in the right place and he was
in<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:34.939> right<00:01:35.060> place<00:01:35.119> a<00:01:35.509> lot<00:01:35.780> of<00:01:35.899> the<00:01:36.049> time<00:01:36.259> I

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
in the right place a lot of the time I

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.240 
in the right place a lot of the time I
used<00:01:37.070> a<00:01:37.159> minute<00:01:37.369> 34<00:01:37.970> 35<00:01:38.509> to<00:01:38.930> with<00:01:39.350> Campanaro

thing that I noticed with him he's got
really<00:02:04.039> if<00:02:04.579> some<00:02:04.759> reason<00:02:05.000> he<00:02:05.060> just<00:02:05.119> seems<00:02:05.479> to

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
really if some reason he just seems to

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.899 
really if some reason he just seems to
reach<00:02:05.990> really<00:02:06.649> foul<00:02:06.920> of<00:02:07.070> his<00:02:07.189> sliding<00:02:07.549> tackles

reach really foul of his sliding tackles
which<00:02:08.030> is<00:02:08.360> really<00:02:08.960> good<00:02:09.170> for<00:02:09.260> a<00:02:09.350> defender<00:02:09.710> to

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
which is really good for a defender to

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.610 
which is really good for a defender to
have<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:10.270> comparative<00:02:11.270> Campanaro<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:12.290> would

seemed to be that little bit better for

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.650 
seemed to be that little bit better for
me<00:02:30.650> probably<00:02:31.430> because<00:02:31.670> he<00:02:31.940> cost<00:02:32.180> about<00:02:32.420> fifty

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
me probably because he cost about fifty

me probably because he cost about fifty
que<00:02:32.990> les<00:02:33.320> and<00:02:33.680> for<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.070> 50k<00:02:34.640> you're<00:02:34.790> getting

que les and for that 50k you're getting

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.170 
que les and for that 50k you're getting
the<00:02:35.090> exact<00:02:35.420> same<00:02:35.600> player<00:02:35.870> anyway<00:02:36.260> but<00:02:37.180> looking
