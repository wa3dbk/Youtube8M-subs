00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:08.490
 good afternoon guys I'm here for today 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:12.840
 show the difference of series 7 of 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.730
 Professional kitchenaid with series 5 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.510
 I have this series 5 I think it will do 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:25.920
 some three years it is already 5 that the abom 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.730
 her five-quarters vessel and is the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:37.410
 new is from 7 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:41.219
 you can not see 71 follow the same design 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:46.820
 all of them but it makes a good difference 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.820
 size and in the engine structure 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.200
 I'll call new 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.289
 and I'll call 5 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:44.119
 their mechanism has changed 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:56.600
 You can see it as soon as you open it. 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:56.600
 even the new series continues American 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:04.020
 personal products do not do not do not 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.869
 other products 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.590
 do you think the new processor is not 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.280
 American and had even some criticisms 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.280
 about this 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:24.120
 the professional series she has this part 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.239
 for you lift the bowl one thing 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.630
 also changed the design of the two 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.630
 scouts 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:42.260
 So we see that this is who he is. 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.320
 different 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:53.310
 this is the round eye to the nation in 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:57.480
 I did not make a difference and beat up 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:01.049
 new it can make it clear in 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.190
 snow blends very fast very fast 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.110
 fast 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.890
 other players remain the same 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.890
 way 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.000
 the difference is this here now this is the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.870
 how commercial is it they can not 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.260
 there are values 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.450
 they will not stand dark of 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.920
 hook 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:30.420
 to be continued 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:34.239
 the same way and for series 5 I had the 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.780
 ticket blade he has the fantasies 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.280
 silicone and it will scrape on the canister 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.650
 one thing that caught my attention 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:49.560
 it is also the weight of the scouts 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:57.840
 If I take this old one here I have 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:04:01.750
 150 and three grams against the weight of the new 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:06.459
 540 grams is too heavy 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:13.480
 the others are very heavy and one thing 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:22.570
 also that giving a lot of difference is the 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:27.039
 phase size and managed to 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:30.070
 to make three kilos of flour in the tauÃ¡ 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:33.639
 in bread 3 pounds and in the old 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:37.050
 give a compliment to practically 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:41.560
 does not fall within more because if the Al 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:45.910
 we compare side by side so the 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.580
 people see a lot of difference 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:56.490
 she gets much more space at is 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:58.919
 compared to him so very satisfied 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.590
 with both 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:07.020
 the mpu the wall here for accessories 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.020
 continue the same way 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:13.150
 fit all the accessories you from 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:17.110
 the first one that had neide they fit 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:20.590
 here another question is also that they 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.949
 do not advertise the new one as having a motor 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.020
 1.3 hp 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:29.380
 only that in addition to the 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:33.510
 researching it does not have 1.3 hp of 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:36.670
 power it can deliver up to 1.1.3 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:43.690
 but it is 0.5 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:49.000
 5 hp it has 500 watts is less than 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:52.060
 Series 6 Series 6 has 600 watts and this 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.200
 yes she has 475 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:06:00.250
 so they decreased the rate of 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:02.890
 washington increased strength to the 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:06.280
 Your battery managed to last longer. 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:09.160
 the gear inside it the box is a 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.770
 motor drives that have no connections 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.320
 is an armored box deed here we 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:20.290
 you can see the connections between the motor and 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:23.650
 the gears but fantastic and it's that 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:26.320
 question will evolve by improving this 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:29.790
 but the team is silent 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.790
 the maximum speed 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:37.120
 if you want to make some very dough 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.600
 heavy it makes a little more noise 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.790
 so as you weigh dough you hear 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:47.200
 a little more noise but it's not a thing 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:50.110
 more absurd this one here is for you give 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.830
 the noise that is here is what it is going 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.830
 to deliver 100 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:18.039
 so a mixer show and for who 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:23.379
 knows but knows that the one who has the 

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:24.610
 Bowling that takes the bowl to head here 

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:27.610
 above is fixed 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:34.180
 so I have a fixed body this new 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:36.970
 weighs almost 14 kilos and this ancient stone 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:39.069
 around 12 

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.080
 I think it's more or less that way they are. 

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:44.250
 Well, they do not move at all. 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:51.039
 when you are not making very heavy dough 

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:52.870
 very good in a few days will come in 

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:53.860
 holidays will make some recipes for 

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.090
 you 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.090
 See you
