00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.110 

UFC<00:00:11.759> 2010<00:00:12.450> feels<00:00:13.290> way<00:00:13.830> different<00:00:14.250> than<00:00:14.280> 2009

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
UFC 2010 feels way different than 2009

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.330 
UFC 2010 feels way different than 2009
that's<00:00:15.570> because<00:00:15.839> we<00:00:15.960> sped<00:00:16.289> everything<00:00:16.710> up<00:00:16.890> we

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
that's because we sped everything up we

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.010 
that's because we sped everything up we
didn't<00:00:17.520> just<00:00:17.550> accelerate<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.330> animations<00:00:18.840> we

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
didn't just accelerate the animations we

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.870 
didn't just accelerate the animations we
actually<00:00:19.320> reanimated<00:00:19.859> all<00:00:20.039> 12,000<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.820> the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
actually reanimated all 12,000 and the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.090 
actually reanimated all 12,000 and the
animations<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.539> game<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.920> went

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
animations in the game and we went

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.679 
animations in the game and we went
through<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.640> took<00:00:23.880> out<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.300> know<00:00:24.390> very

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
through and took out you know very

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.019 
through and took out you know very
specific<00:00:25.170> frames<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.740> make<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.010> flow<00:00:26.519> smoother

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
specific frames to make it flow smoother

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.939 
specific frames to make it flow smoother
and<00:00:27.240> transition<00:00:28.080> into<00:00:28.199> other<00:00:28.380> move<00:00:28.590> smoother

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
and transition into other move smoother

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.780 
and transition into other move smoother
we<00:00:29.550> also<00:00:29.699> added<00:00:29.970> some<00:00:30.119> positions<00:00:30.779> swaying<00:00:31.790> all

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
we also added some positions swaying all

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.400 
we also added some positions swaying all
kinds<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.210> other<00:00:33.329> elements<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.020> game<00:00:34.170> just

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
kinds of other elements to the game just

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.930 
kinds of other elements to the game just
to<00:00:34.500> make<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.649> more<00:00:34.890> well-rounded<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.850> feels

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
to make it more well-rounded so it feels

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.760 
to make it more well-rounded so it feels
like<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.149> much<00:00:36.570> richer<00:00:36.840> fuller<00:00:37.200> experience

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
like a much richer fuller experience

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.799 
like a much richer fuller experience
when<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.920> play<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.700> do<00:00:38.850> some<00:00:39.120> motion<00:00:39.420> capture

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
when you play we do some motion capture

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.389 
when you play we do some motion capture
but<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.110> mainly<00:00:40.260> around<00:00:40.649> what<00:00:41.070> happens

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
but it's mainly around what happens

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.979 
but it's mainly around what happens
outside<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.030> Octagon<00:00:42.450> or<00:00:42.719> during<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
outside of the Octagon or during the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.330 
outside of the Octagon or during the
introductions<00:00:43.530> once<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.920> get<00:00:44.040> into<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
introductions once you get into the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.590 
introductions once you get into the
nitty-gritty<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.760> fighting<00:00:45.180> there's<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.480> much

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
nitty-gritty of fighting there's so much

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600 
nitty-gritty of fighting there's so much
branching<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:46.680> not<00:00:46.860> really<00:00:47.100> effective<00:00:47.309> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
branching it's not really effective to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.600 
branching it's not really effective to
do<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> mocap<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.780> branching<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.950> we'll

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
do a mocap of that branching so we'll

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.639 
do a mocap of that branching so we'll
get<00:00:50.700> him<00:00:50.850> will<00:00:51.030> videotape<00:00:51.600> people<00:00:52.170> doing<00:00:52.500> it

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
get him will videotape people doing it

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.590 
get him will videotape people doing it
and<00:00:52.770> then<00:00:53.370> we'll<00:00:53.489> hand<00:00:53.789> key<00:00:54.090> all<00:00:54.420> that

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and then we'll hand key all that

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.000 
and then we'll hand key all that
animation

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.420 

trying<00:00:58.429> to<00:00:58.579> turn<00:00:58.879> over

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.250 

this<00:01:02.430> year<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.940> 2010<00:01:03.660> we've<00:01:03.930> actually<00:01:04.080> added

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
this year in 2010 we've actually added

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.200 
this year in 2010 we've actually added
some<00:01:04.559> more<00:01:04.620> modes<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.160> the<00:01:05.250> game<00:01:05.430> for<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
some more modes to the game for the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.240 
some more modes to the game for the
single<00:01:06.450> player<00:01:06.630> as<00:01:07.530> well<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> couple<00:01:08.070> of

single player as well as a couple of

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.530 
single player as well as a couple of
online<00:01:09.680> expansions<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:12.060> first<00:01:12.210> mode<00:01:12.450> we

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
like a arcade ladder mode you start at

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.950 
like a arcade ladder mode you start at
the<00:01:17.760> bottom<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.150> division<00:01:18.510> you<00:01:18.660> work<00:01:18.840> your

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
the bottom of the division you work your

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.719 
the bottom of the division you work your
way<00:01:19.020> through<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.619> division<00:01:19.800> of<00:01:20.010> Fighters<00:01:20.369> if

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
way through the division of Fighters if

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.090 
way through the division of Fighters if
you<00:01:21.210> actually<00:01:21.500> obtain<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> belt<00:01:22.800> in<00:01:22.950> that

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
you actually obtain the belt in that

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.830 
you actually obtain the belt in that
division<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.580> unlock<00:01:23.850> another<00:01:24.210> mode<00:01:24.510> called

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
division we unlock another mode called

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.630 
division we unlock another mode called
title<00:01:25.140> defense<00:01:25.470> mode<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.490> like<00:01:26.610> a

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
title defense mode and this is like a

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.030 
title defense mode and this is like a
survival<00:01:27.270> mode<00:01:27.390> one<00:01:28.350> loss<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.560> you're<00:01:28.800> done

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
survival mode one loss and you're done

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.130 
survival mode one loss and you're done
right<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.390> don't<00:01:30.570> heal<00:01:30.900> completely

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
right and you don't heal completely

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.690 
right and you don't heal completely
between<00:01:31.770> each<00:01:31.890> fight<00:01:32.100> because<00:01:32.369> each<00:01:32.490> bite

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
between each fight because each bite

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.100 
between each fight because each bite
happens<00:01:33.030> every<00:01:33.270> three<00:01:33.600> months<00:01:33.869> or<00:01:33.960> whatever

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
happens every three months or whatever

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.260 
happens every three months or whatever
so<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.830> don't<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.310> enough<00:01:35.399> time<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.880> get<00:01:36.060> all

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
so you don't have enough time to get all

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.520 
so you don't have enough time to get all
your<00:01:36.330> health<00:01:36.690> back<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.050> got<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.290> very
