00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
if the ball is higher you can have

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:48.420 
if the ball is higher you can have

if the ball is

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.070 
if the ball is
hi<00:01:50.040> then<00:01:50.820> your<00:01:51.030> whole<00:01:51.300> body<00:01:51.600> will<00:01:51.810> need<00:01:51.900> to

hi then your whole body will need to

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.429 
hi then your whole body will need to
lift<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.590> adjust

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
the angle of your racket will need

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.630 
the angle of your racket will need
adjusting

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
adjusting

having<00:02:01.640> your<00:02:01.729> racket<00:02:02.149> face<00:02:02.179> too<00:02:02.689> closed<00:02:03.109> will

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
having your racket face too closed will

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.990 
having your racket face too closed will
send<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.039> ball<00:02:04.189> into<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.579> net

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
send the ball into the net

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.999 
send the ball into the net
so<00:02:05.390> you'll<00:02:05.570> generally<00:02:05.990> have<00:02:06.259> to<00:02:06.409> open<00:02:06.890> the

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
so you'll generally have to open the

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.460 
so you'll generally have to open the
face<00:02:07.159> of<00:02:07.369> your<00:02:07.520> racket<00:02:07.549> to<00:02:08.479> counter<00:02:09.019> the

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:16.969 
opening your racquet face will usually

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.270 
opening your racquet face will usually
mean<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.569> ball<00:02:17.750> travels<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:18.409> a<00:02:18.620> higher<00:02:18.920> arc

over<00:02:19.549> the<00:02:19.849> net<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.299> you'll<00:02:20.810> need<00:02:21.019> this

over the net and you'll need this

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:30.990 
over the net and you'll need this
