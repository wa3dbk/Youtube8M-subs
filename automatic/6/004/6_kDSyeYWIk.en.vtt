00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
 let us hear the cherry here in our 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.140
 the topic is 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:11.990
 oven means we set the temperature 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.299
 we are about 40 degrees that's 40 and 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.359
 let her first stand then 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:23.990
 temperature gradually just divide up 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:27.269
 50 60 degrees and she will have an oven 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.890
 let it be worth drying well with the teacher 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.520
 use see in the kitchen anyway 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:39.300
 miller center malenechko backfilled 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:42.390
 so a good thing is drying mushrooms on 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.320
 realistically if the terms are only 2 white well 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.360
 here at the river is also good, he wants stuffing 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.090
 for pies with dry because we 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.770
 consider it so well when drying we take into account 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.110
 that we first talk to the oven and then 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.489
 we lay down on the dryer now this time first 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.420
 40 degrees and then began writing 700 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.480
 with ears of nights 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.350
 bitch will pass the wrong network mode 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.549
 already almost pour ready black already 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.340
 Remained enough here ours 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.770
 bird cherry dried and before I just change it 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.080
 in places 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:26.159
 We were put to the bottom and top 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:28.470
 the bottom I put see an example and so Putin 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.540
 for example stood down you rearranged 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:37.009
 tiers 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:37.009
 rearranged almost everything is ready 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.270
 dictation let's see what we have here 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:57.799
 you see 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.689
 in the oven, the berry clings to the base just 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.210
 now take and just customizer 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.789
 add this one from the oven at least 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:13.099
 I set so to do a bowl 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:17.959
 used the oven like that 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:20.540
 ajar such fishing on the dryer much 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.010
 everything turns out better so I will 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.340
 pour the dryer 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.940
 can look and think white fungus he 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.870
 led me 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.610
 and this is 8 aspen birds so aspen birds 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:37.280
 privileges cause black mushroom to see 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:41.569
 some kind of young biologically complete 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.989
 see 2 then this is our high population 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.780
 from there to him the name of the child at home I 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.950
 like a guy diligently clico brut and they 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.440
 blacker 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.380
 so by still the engine of the coast 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.139
 it blows up a black white mushroom see 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.519
 like a golden kitten almost 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.519
 obtained by drying
