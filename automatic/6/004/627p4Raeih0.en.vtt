this<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.140> really<00:00:22.350> cool<00:00:22.500> because<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.890> allows

this is really cool because it allows

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
the record eclipse completely blows

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.209 
the record eclipse completely blows
rhinos<00:00:33.510> roar<00:00:33.840> buff<00:00:34.410> ability<00:00:34.829> out<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
rhinos roar buff ability out of the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.069 
rhinos roar buff ability out of the
water<00:00:35.489> when<00:00:35.850> standing<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.300> certain<00:00:36.630> rays<00:00:36.840> of

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
water when standing in certain rays of

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.930 
water when standing in certain rays of
light<00:00:37.110> as<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.680> can<00:00:37.800> give<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.190> upwards<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.730> four

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
light as it can give you upwards of four

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.090 
light as it can give you upwards of four
times<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.450> damage<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:40.079> roar<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.860> offer

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
times the damage that roar can offer

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.619 
times the damage that roar can offer
however<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.000> kind<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.420> catch

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
however that is kind of the catch

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.000 
however that is kind of the catch
because<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.410> be<00:00:43.500> standing<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
because you have to be standing in the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.590 
because you have to be standing in the
light<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.340> get<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.610> buff<00:00:44.820> but<00:00:45.090> if<00:00:45.390> you're

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
light to get the buff but if you're

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.020 
light to get the buff but if you're
using<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.260> or<00:00:47.039> you're<00:00:47.219> using<00:00:47.370> mirage<00:00:47.730> in

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
using this or you're using mirage in

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.819 
using this or you're using mirage in
void<00:00:48.329> maps<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.930> stuff<00:00:49.020> like<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.500> which<00:00:49.680> is

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
void maps and stuff like that which is

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.290 
void maps and stuff like that which is
the<00:00:49.920> harder<00:00:50.160> content<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> game<00:00:50.789> anyways

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
the harder content in the game anyways

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.569 
the harder content in the game anyways
there<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.899> light<00:00:52.199> everywhere<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> void<00:00:53.370> so

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
there is light everywhere in the void so

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.189 
there is light everywhere in the void so
it<00:00:53.699> never<00:00:53.850> really<00:00:53.969> comes<00:00:54.480> up<00:00:54.629> as<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> problem

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
it never really comes up as a problem

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.779 
it never really comes up as a problem
and<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.739> kind<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.949> brings<00:00:56.160> me<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.489> my<00:00:56.730> next

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
and that kind of brings me to my next

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.729 
and that kind of brings me to my next
point<00:00:57.059> because<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> actual<00:00:58.050> range<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
point because the actual range on the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.729 
point because the actual range on the
effect<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.250> again<00:00:59.640> only<00:00:59.910> five<00:01:00.359> meters<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.109> once

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
effect is again only five meters so once

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.349 
effect is again only five meters so once
again<00:01:01.859> we<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.219> kind<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.579> really<00:01:02.910> low<00:01:03.059> range

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
again we have kind of a really low range

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.660 
again we have kind of a really low range
base<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.199> affected<00:01:04.979> by<00:01:05.129> power<00:01:05.369> range

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
base but it is affected by power range

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.000 
base but it is affected by power range
so<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:06.119> scale<00:01:06.630> up<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.960> little<00:01:07.380> bit<00:01:07.560> with

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
so you can scale up a little bit with

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.530 
so you can scale up a little bit with
the<00:01:08.130> stretch<00:01:08.369> mode<00:01:08.580> however<00:01:08.909> again<00:01:09.270> i<00:01:09.299> don't

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the stretch mode however again i don't

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.240 
the stretch mode however again i don't
really<00:01:09.689> recommend<00:01:10.020> using<00:01:10.290> over<00:01:10.619> extended<00:01:11.100> as

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
really recommend using over extended as

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.070 
really recommend using over extended as
it<00:01:11.640> won't<00:01:11.729> scale<00:01:12.090> very<00:01:12.390> much<00:01:12.570> off<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.780> 5

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
it won't scale very much off the 5

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.840 
it won't scale very much off the 5
meters<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.439> you'll<00:01:13.680> lose<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.159> bunch<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.610> power

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
meters and you'll lose a bunch of power

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.270 
meters and you'll lose a bunch of power
strength<00:01:15.299> which<00:01:15.900> isn't<00:01:16.680> really<00:01:16.799> good<00:01:17.100> if

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
strength which isn't really good if

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.980 
strength which isn't really good if
that's<00:01:17.490> kind<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.060> whole<00:01:18.210> point<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
that's kind of the whole point of the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.230 
that's kind of the whole point of the
build<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:20.100> kind<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:20.549> narrow<00:01:21.030> in

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
build so it's kind of really narrow in

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.850 
build so it's kind of really narrow in
its<00:01:21.390> use<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:21.869> only<00:01:22.170> gonna<00:01:22.380> be<00:01:22.590> really

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
its use it's only gonna be really

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.580 
its use it's only gonna be really
effective<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.729> like<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> defensive<00:01:24.750> style<00:01:25.020> map

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
effective in like a defensive style map

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.560 
effective in like a defensive style map
where<00:01:25.979> you're<00:01:26.100> all<00:01:26.250> grouped<00:01:26.759> together<00:01:26.939> it's

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
where you're all grouped together it's

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.030 
where you're all grouped together it's
gonna<00:01:27.659> be<00:01:27.810> really<00:01:27.930> hard<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.320> pub<00:01:28.530> setting<00:01:28.860> to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
gonna be really hard in a pub setting to

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.410 
gonna be really hard in a pub setting to
but<00:01:29.280> one<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.490> best<00:01:29.700> examples<00:01:30.210> i<00:01:30.299> could

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
but one of the best examples i could

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.630 
but one of the best examples i could
think<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:30.960> really<00:01:31.229> fun<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.680> buffing<00:01:32.310> up<00:01:32.430> a

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
think of this really fun is buffing up a

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.120 
think of this really fun is buffing up a
mesa<00:01:33.000> which<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.810> standing<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.259> top<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.890> pot

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
mesa which is standing on top of a pot

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.130 
mesa which is standing on top of a pot
in<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.400> tea<00:01:35.579> for<00:01:35.790> defense<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.450> was<00:01:36.780> getting<00:01:36.990> like

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
in a tea for defense I was getting like

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.710 
in a tea for defense I was getting like
crazy<00:01:37.560> numbers<00:01:38.159> with<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> actual<00:01:39.329> Mesa

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
crazy numbers with the actual Mesa

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.260 
crazy numbers with the actual Mesa
like<00:01:39.979> 21k<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.310> absolutely<00:01:41.790> wiping

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
like 21k just absolutely wiping

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.960 
like 21k just absolutely wiping
everything<00:01:42.390> up<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.259> wave<00:01:43.590> 20<00:01:43.979> even<00:01:44.220> 30<00:01:44.250> so

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
everything up to like wave 20 even 30 so

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.940 
everything up to like wave 20 even 30 so
it<00:01:45.090> kind<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.329> makes<00:01:45.570> her<00:01:45.840> ultimate<00:01:46.439> viable

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
it kind of makes her ultimate viable

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.899 
it kind of makes her ultimate viable
because<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.250> thing<00:01:47.430> always<00:01:47.610> kind<00:01:47.880> of

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
because the thing always kind of

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.819 
because the thing always kind of
complained<00:01:48.329> about<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.600> ability<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.680> it

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
complained about that ability is that it

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.770 
complained about that ability is that it
only<00:01:49.979> does<00:01:50.159> 5k<00:01:50.460> which<00:01:50.880> does<00:01:51.119> not<00:01:51.390> by<00:01:51.600> any<00:01:51.630> means

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
only does 5k which does not by any means

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.999 
only does 5k which does not by any means
scale<00:01:52.259> into<00:01:52.560> late-game

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
scale into late-game

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.499 
scale into late-game
now<00:01:53.369> modding<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.759> gonna<00:01:53.939> be<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> little<00:01:54.299> bit

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
now modding is gonna be a little bit

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.910 
now modding is gonna be a little bit
tricky<00:01:54.960> though<00:01:55.259> for<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.680> bill<00:01:55.829> because

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
tricky though for the bill because

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.200 
tricky though for the bill because
you're<00:01:56.100> gonna<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.640> basically<00:01:56.820> give

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
you're gonna have to basically give

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.690 
you're gonna have to basically give
something<00:01:57.719> up<00:01:57.930> I've<00:01:58.799> chose<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.340> give<00:01:59.460> up<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
something up I've chose to give up the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.670 
something up I've chose to give up the
natural<00:01:59.850> talent<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.509> really<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.200> mod<00:02:01.409> on

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
natural talent I really like the mod on

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.560 
natural talent I really like the mod on
Mirage<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.399> since<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.939> build<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.420> really

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
Mirage but since the build is really

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.630 
Mirage but since the build is really
about<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:03.990> getting<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.680> buff<00:02:04.979> off<00:02:05.310> it's

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
about just getting that buff off it's

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.920 
about just getting that buff off it's
not<00:02:05.880> really<00:02:06.149> necessary<00:02:06.630> because<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.840> won't

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
not really necessary because you won't

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.839 
not really necessary because you won't
be<00:02:07.079> using<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.469> prism<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:08.129> often<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.819> that

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
be using a prism that often in that

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.999 
be using a prism that often in that
sense<00:02:09.420> however<00:02:10.140> all<00:02:10.349> these<00:02:10.500> problems<00:02:10.860> would

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
sense however all these problems would

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.940 
sense however all these problems would
be<00:02:11.039> solved<00:02:11.550> though<00:02:11.670> if<00:02:11.849> we<00:02:11.970> did<00:02:12.150> get<00:02:12.330> anime

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
be solved though if we did get anime

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.589 
be solved though if we did get anime
to<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.160> slot<00:02:13.400> hint<00:02:13.790> hint<00:02:14.000> but<00:02:14.239> anyways

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
to the slot hint hint but anyways

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.510 
to the slot hint hint but anyways
regardless<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.349> that<00:02:15.560> basically<00:02:16.129> the<00:02:16.280> build

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
regardless of that basically the build

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.339 
regardless of that basically the build
is<00:02:16.819> I<00:02:16.849> have<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.180> crime<00:02:17.420> continuity<00:02:17.930> on<00:02:18.050> for<00:02:18.260> my

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
is I have a crime continuity on for my

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.530 
is I have a crime continuity on for my
duration<00:02:18.860> of<00:02:19.010> course<00:02:19.250> I'm<00:02:19.819> only<00:02:20.030> running<00:02:20.269> to

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
duration of course I'm only running to

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.470 
duration of course I'm only running to
power<00:02:20.840> strength<00:02:21.200> mods<00:02:21.470> blind<00:02:21.860> rage<00:02:22.069> and

power strength mods blind rage and
transient<00:02:23.480> fortitude<00:02:23.930> as<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.140> didn't<00:02:24.620> feel

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
transient fortitude as I didn't feel

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.470 
transient fortitude as I didn't feel
there<00:02:24.950> was<00:02:25.010> any<00:02:25.129> room<00:02:25.550> for<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.819> intensify<00:02:26.300> and

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
there was any room for the intensify and

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.180 
there was any room for the intensify and
this<00:02:26.840> is<00:02:27.019> more<00:02:27.260> than<00:02:27.379> enough<00:02:27.500> power<00:02:27.620> strength

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
this is more than enough power strength

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.699 
this is more than enough power strength
to<00:02:28.400> get<00:02:28.519> you<00:02:28.640> through<00:02:28.849> lots<00:02:29.720> of<00:02:29.900> ways<00:02:30.080> like<00:02:30.380> 30

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
works as a good defensive mod because

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.670 
works as a good defensive mod because
the<00:02:56.209> flow<00:02:56.450> is<00:02:56.480> scaling<00:02:56.989> up<00:02:57.079> your<00:02:57.230> energy<00:02:57.560> to

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
the flow is scaling up your energy to

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.710 
the flow is scaling up your energy to
450<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:58.819> it'll<00:02:58.940> give<00:02:59.060> you<00:02:59.150> more<00:02:59.180> effective

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
450 so it'll give you more effective

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.990 
450 so it'll give you more effective
health<00:02:59.930> than<00:03:00.380> doing<00:03:00.680> a<00:03:00.739> bite<00:03:00.920> outta<00:03:01.130> mod<00:03:01.430> +<00:03:01.790> I

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
health than doing a bite outta mod + I

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.819 
health than doing a bite outta mod + I
don't<00:03:02.239> run<00:03:02.599> this<00:03:02.750> I<00:03:03.140> don't<00:03:03.380> run<00:03:03.500> this<00:03:03.620> build

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
don't run this I don't run this build

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.050 
don't run this I don't run this build
against<00:03:04.099> infested<00:03:04.579> or<00:03:04.670> anything<00:03:04.849> like<00:03:05.000> that

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
against infested or anything like that

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.809 
against infested or anything like that
primarily<00:03:05.870> so<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:06.950> just<00:03:07.340> felt<00:03:07.489> it<00:03:07.640> worked

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
primarily so I just felt it worked

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:08.920 
primarily so I just felt it worked
really<00:03:08.150> good<00:03:08.329> for<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:08.599> but<00:03:08.720> if<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:08.870> are

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
really good for that but if you are

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.449 
really good for that but if you are
running<00:03:09.019> infested<00:03:09.530> definitely<00:03:09.950> throw<00:03:10.099> on<00:03:10.220> the

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
running infested definitely throw on the

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.430 
running infested definitely throw on the
vitality<00:03:10.940> mod<00:03:11.390> then<00:03:11.810> after<00:03:12.049> that<00:03:12.170> all<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.380> got

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
vitality mod then after that all you got

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.020 
vitality mod then after that all you got
to<00:03:12.560> do<00:03:12.650> is<00:03:12.769> throw<00:03:13.069> on<00:03:13.099> a<00:03:13.280> stretch<00:03:13.519> mod<00:03:13.760> just<00:03:13.910> to

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
to do is throw on a stretch mod just to

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.059 
to do is throw on a stretch mod just to
get<00:03:14.120> your<00:03:14.239> range<00:03:14.510> up<00:03:14.750> just<00:03:15.170> below<00:03:15.410> 10<00:03:15.680> meters

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
get your range up just below 10 meters

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.220 
get your range up just below 10 meters
there<00:03:16.310> which<00:03:16.819> is<00:03:17.030> fine<00:03:17.239> though<00:03:17.750> not<00:03:18.079> much

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
there which is fine though not much

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.870 
there which is fine though not much
really<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.680> has<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:18.980> be<00:03:19.069> set<00:03:19.310> other<00:03:19.489> than<00:03:19.700> that

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
really it has to be set other than that

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.720 
really it has to be set other than that
it's<00:03:20.060> simple<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.720> effective<00:03:21.079> and<00:03:21.590> it<00:03:22.340> really

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
it's simple and effective and it really

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.970 
it's simple and effective and it really
has<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.000> lot<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.450> potential<00:03:23.840> like<00:03:24.200> I<00:03:24.350> expect<00:03:24.859> to

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
has a lot of potential like I expect to

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.740 
has a lot of potential like I expect to
see<00:03:25.010> this<00:03:25.489> being<00:03:25.700> used<00:03:25.790> in<00:03:26.150> any<00:03:26.389> kind<00:03:26.510> of

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
see this being used in any kind of

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.650 
see this being used in any kind of
defensive<00:03:27.260> mission<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.859> if<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:28.670> did<00:03:28.910> get<00:03:29.630> a

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
defensive mission and if it did get a

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.120 
defensive mission and if it did get a
little<00:03:29.810> bit<00:03:29.930> of<00:03:30.049> a<00:03:30.109> range<00:03:30.350> buff<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:30.769> would<00:03:30.980> be

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
little bit of a range buff it would be

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.430 
little bit of a range buff it would be
more<00:03:31.400> viable<00:03:31.730> in<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.180> survival<00:03:32.569> style<00:03:32.989> mission

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
more viable in a survival style mission

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.949 
more viable in a survival style mission
because<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:34.400> range<00:03:34.700> is<00:03:35.000> pretty<00:03:35.269> minimal<00:03:35.480> but

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
because the range is pretty minimal but

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.330 
because the range is pretty minimal but
if<00:03:36.109> you<00:03:36.260> do<00:03:36.440> have<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.680> bunch<00:03:36.920> of<00:03:36.980> people<00:03:37.220> on

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
if you do have a bunch of people on

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.650 
if you do have a bunch of people on
comms<00:03:37.609> and<00:03:37.790> you're<00:03:37.940> really<00:03:38.120> coordinated<00:03:38.600> you

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
comms and you're really coordinated you

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.300 
comms and you're really coordinated you
could<00:03:38.810> still<00:03:39.049> make<00:03:39.230> it<00:03:39.350> work<00:03:39.380> to<00:03:39.590> a<00:03:39.620> point<00:03:39.920> but

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
could still make it work to a point but

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.949 
could still make it work to a point but
I'm<00:03:40.430> just<00:03:40.639> like<00:03:40.819> I<00:03:40.970> don't<00:03:41.030> know<00:03:41.209> this<00:03:41.389> 5<00:03:41.660> meter

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
I'm just like I don't know this 5 meter

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.599 
I'm just like I don't know this 5 meter
range<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.500> everything<00:03:42.799> it<00:03:42.920> just<00:03:42.950> seems<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.459> bit

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
range and everything it just seems a bit

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.280 
range and everything it just seems a bit
problematic<00:03:43.880> to<00:03:44.269> me<00:03:44.329> but<00:03:44.540> anyways<00:03:44.810> that's<00:03:45.139> my

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
problematic to me but anyways that's my

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.020 
problematic to me but anyways that's my
opinion<00:03:45.650> definitely<00:03:46.310> let<00:03:46.639> me<00:03:46.670> know<00:03:46.790> if<00:03:46.940> you
