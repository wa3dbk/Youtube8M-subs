 only a small part of the problem of Russians 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.820

 At the meeting, the press is criticized for 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.909
 heightened the situation and the growth of riza for the fact that 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.900
 take out Russian holidaymakers 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.489

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.180
 there is no goal that every day 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.489

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.390

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:49.029
 this week, Sharm el-Sheikh flew around 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:51.339
