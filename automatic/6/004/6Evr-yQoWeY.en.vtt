about is securing your work I've taught

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.689 
about is securing your work I've taught
a<00:00:21.779> lot<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.050> woodworking<00:00:22.230> classes<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.220> I've

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
a lot of woodworking classes and I've

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.160 
a lot of woodworking classes and I've
watched<00:00:23.939> students<00:00:24.420> who<00:00:24.539> aren't<00:00:24.720> quite

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
watched students who aren't quite

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.140 
watched students who aren't quite
familiar<00:00:26.010> or<00:00:26.160> comfortable<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.789> portable

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
familiar or comfortable with portable

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.720 
familiar or comfortable with portable
power<00:00:27.359> tools<00:00:27.720> doing<00:00:28.410> some<00:00:28.619> funky<00:00:29.160> stuff<00:00:29.189> and

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
power tools doing some funky stuff and

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.429 
power tools doing some funky stuff and
it<00:00:29.820> just<00:00:30.090> kind<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.660> creeps<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.050> out<00:00:31.080> because

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
it just kind of creeps you out because

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.560 
it just kind of creeps you out because
you<00:00:31.679> want<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.920> make<00:00:32.099> sure<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.940> your<00:00:33.150> fingers

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
you want to make sure that your fingers

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.170 
you want to make sure that your fingers
never<00:00:34.140> get<00:00:34.379> in<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.530> way<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.220> cutter<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
never get in the way of a cutter so the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.280 
never get in the way of a cutter so the
first<00:00:36.420> thing<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.629> we're<00:00:36.809> gonna<00:00:36.900> look<00:00:37.080> at

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
first thing that we're gonna look at

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.010 
first thing that we're gonna look at
here<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:38.030> routing<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.210> edge<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.750> board

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
here is routing the edge of a board

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.080 
here is routing the edge of a board
we're<00:00:40.230> gonna<00:00:40.320> run<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> profiling<00:00:41.610> bid<00:00:41.760> all<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
we're gonna run a profiling bid all the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.450 
we're gonna run a profiling bid all the
way<00:00:42.210> around<00:00:42.540> all<00:00:42.870> four<00:00:43.170> edges<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.309> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
way around all four edges and so the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.000 
way around all four edges and so the
easiest<00:00:44.850> way<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.530> is<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
easiest way to do that is to have the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.389 
easiest way to do that is to have the
work<00:00:47.399> secured<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> non-skid<00:00:49.590> surface<00:00:49.920> like

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
work secured on a non-skid surface like

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.580 
work secured on a non-skid surface like
I've<00:00:50.579> got<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.570> what<00:00:52.199> we'll<00:00:52.289> be<00:00:52.320> able<00:00:52.469> to

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
I've got here and what we'll be able to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.040 
I've got here and what we'll be able to
do<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.920> set<00:00:53.160> our<00:00:53.280> work<00:00:53.520> up<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.360> those<00:00:54.510> pads<00:00:54.809> and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
do is set our work up on those pads and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.099 
do is set our work up on those pads and
what's<00:00:55.559> cool<00:00:55.829> about<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:57.109> because

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
what's cool about this is that because

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.160 
what's cool about this is that because
those<00:00:58.289> are<00:00:58.440> non-skid<00:00:59.539> the<00:01:00.539> work<00:01:00.750> isn't<00:01:00.960> going

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
those are non-skid the work isn't going

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.889 
those are non-skid the work isn't going
to<00:01:01.289> move<00:01:01.440> when<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.800> route<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.899> additionally

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
to move when I route on it additionally

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.020 
to move when I route on it additionally
I<00:01:04.110> don't<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.680> any<00:01:04.830> hold<00:01:05.070> downs<00:01:05.309> going<00:01:05.580> this

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
I don't have any hold downs going this

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.210 
I don't have any hold downs going this
way<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.509> it's<00:01:07.140> gonna<00:01:07.259> let<00:01:07.500> me<00:01:07.619> go<00:01:07.770> all<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.190> way

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
way so it's gonna let me go all the way

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.010 
way so it's gonna let me go all the way
around<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> perimeter<00:01:09.149> and<00:01:09.180> one<00:01:09.600> fluid

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
around the perimeter and one fluid

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.389 
around the perimeter and one fluid
motion<00:01:10.319> that's<00:01:10.679> going<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> give<00:01:11.039> me<00:01:11.190> better

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
motion that's going to give me better

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.440 
motion that's going to give me better
results<00:01:11.880> rather<00:01:12.479> than<00:01:12.810> clamp<00:01:13.709> it<00:01:13.920> route<00:01:14.610> get

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
results rather than clamp it route get

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.270 
results rather than clamp it route get
to<00:01:15.569> the<00:01:15.660> clamp<00:01:15.929> move<00:01:16.289> the<00:01:16.500> clamp<00:01:16.740> blah<00:01:17.009> blah

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
to the clamp move the clamp blah blah

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.070 
to the clamp move the clamp blah blah
blah<00:01:17.490> blah<00:01:17.729> second<00:01:18.390> verse<00:01:18.539> same<00:01:18.569> as<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.990> first

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
blah blah second verse same as the first

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.080 
blah blah second verse same as the first
so<00:01:19.770> let<00:01:19.920> me<00:01:19.950> show<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.160> how<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.550> works<00:01:20.789> with

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
so let me show you how this works with

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.540 
so let me show you how this works with
our<00:01:21.240> work<00:01:21.420> secured<00:01:21.869> up<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.319> those<00:01:22.550> non-skid

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
our work secured up on those non-skid

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:59.120 
our work secured up on those non-skid
pads

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.800 

so<00:02:00.130> again<00:02:00.370> a<00:02:00.550> couple<00:02:00.730> great<00:02:01.030> attributes<00:02:01.570> here

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
so again a couple great attributes here

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.350 
so again a couple great attributes here
the<00:02:02.380> work<00:02:02.590> stays<00:02:02.950> put<00:02:03.280> it's<00:02:03.940> in<00:02:04.120> a<00:02:04.180> position

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
the work stays put it's in a position

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.140 
the work stays put it's in a position
where<00:02:04.810> I<00:02:04.840> can<00:02:05.050> easily<00:02:05.530> work<00:02:05.710> on<00:02:05.950> it<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.610> it's

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
where I can easily work on it and it's

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.820 
where I can easily work on it and it's
on<00:02:07.300> those<00:02:07.450> non-skid<00:02:08.050> pads<00:02:08.289> that<00:02:08.470> hold<00:02:08.649> it<00:02:08.770> in

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
on those non-skid pads that hold it in

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.980 
on those non-skid pads that hold it in
place<00:02:08.979> I'm<00:02:09.490> gonna<00:02:09.759> take<00:02:10.000> this<00:02:10.270> mechanism<00:02:10.600> off

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
place I'm gonna take this mechanism off

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.090 
place I'm gonna take this mechanism off
of<00:02:11.170> here<00:02:11.320> and<00:02:11.470> we'll<00:02:11.620> move<00:02:12.160> on<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.340> another<00:02:12.610> one

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
of here and we'll move on to another one

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.270 
of here and we'll move on to another one
a<00:02:14.540> biscuit<00:02:15.540> joiner<00:02:15.600> is<00:02:16.140> really<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:16.770> great<00:02:17.070> way

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
a biscuit joiner is really a great way

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.670 
a biscuit joiner is really a great way
to<00:02:17.520> assemble<00:02:17.940> components<00:02:18.570> one<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.470> things

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
to assemble components one of the things

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.980 
to assemble components one of the things
I<00:02:19.830> hate<00:02:20.130> seeing<00:02:20.520> is<00:02:20.820> when<00:02:21.000> somebody<00:02:21.330> tries<00:02:21.720> to

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
I hate seeing is when somebody tries to

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.260 
I hate seeing is when somebody tries to
secure<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.680> work<00:02:22.860> with<00:02:23.130> one<00:02:23.340> hand<00:02:23.670> while

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
secure the work with one hand while

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.760 
secure the work with one hand while
they're<00:02:24.450> cutting<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.930> biscuit<00:02:25.260> slot<00:02:25.560> with<00:02:25.740> the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
they're cutting a biscuit slot with the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.130 
they're cutting a biscuit slot with the
other<00:02:25.980> not<00:02:26.400> at<00:02:26.550> all<00:02:26.670> safe<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.630> other<00:02:27.660> thing

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
other not at all safe the other thing

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.840 
other not at all safe the other thing
that<00:02:28.170> we<00:02:28.560> really<00:02:28.860> rely<00:02:29.130> on<00:02:29.160> with<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.550> biscuit

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
that we really rely on with the biscuit

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.330 
that we really rely on with the biscuit
joiner<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.360> if<00:02:30.840> you're<00:02:31.110> registering<00:02:31.770> off<00:02:32.070> the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
joiner is if you're registering off the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.700 
joiner is if you're registering off the
bottom<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.000> machine<00:02:33.330> we<00:02:34.260> want<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.560> make

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
bottom of the machine we want to make

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.100 
bottom of the machine we want to make
sure<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.610> wood<00:02:35.850> is<00:02:35.880> really<00:02:36.450> securely

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
sure that the wood is really securely

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.680 
sure that the wood is really securely
held<00:02:37.440> down<00:02:37.740> so<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.550> registration<00:02:39.060> surface

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
held down so that registration surface

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.720 
held down so that registration surface
is<00:02:39.870> consistent<00:02:40.530> from<00:02:40.800> part<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.190> part<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.550> part

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
is consistent from part to part to part

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.850 
is consistent from part to part to part
so<00:02:42.390> in<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.690> case<00:02:42.960> what<00:02:43.200> we<00:02:43.320> really<00:02:43.590> want<00:02:43.770> to

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
so in this case what we really want to

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.700 
so in this case what we really want to
do<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.250> get<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.790> hold<00:02:45.120> down<00:02:45.360> in<00:02:45.540> place<00:02:45.810> that's

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
do is get a hold down in place that's

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.110 
do is get a hold down in place that's
going<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.040> secure<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.550> work<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.000> going

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
going to secure the work this is going

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.220 
going to secure the work this is going
to<00:02:48.180> buy<00:02:48.330> me<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.540> couple<00:02:48.810> of<00:02:48.930> different<00:02:49.200> things

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
to buy me a couple of different things

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.920 
to buy me a couple of different things
one<00:02:49.770> my<00:02:50.430> work<00:02:50.640> is<00:02:50.850> now<00:02:51.000> nice<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:51.420> solid<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:51.900> I

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
one my work is now nice and solid so I

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.870 
one my work is now nice and solid so I
don't<00:02:52.110> have<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.320> have<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.500> hand<00:02:52.740> there<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.580> I

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
don't have to have a hand there to I

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.550 
don't have to have a hand there to I
know<00:02:54.270> that<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.690> bottom<00:02:55.020> of<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.170> wood<00:02:55.290> is

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
know that the bottom of the wood is

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.370 
know that the bottom of the wood is
right<00:02:56.490> down<00:02:56.730> on<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.000> tabletop<00:02:57.360> making<00:02:58.260> sure

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
right down on the tabletop making sure

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.990 
right down on the tabletop making sure
that<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.680> reference<00:02:58.890> surface<00:02:59.520> is<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.790> same

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
that that reference surface is the same

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:34.240 
that that reference surface is the same
from<00:03:00.270> component<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.870> component

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.619 

so<00:03:35.250> my<00:03:35.370> lesson<00:03:35.730> for<00:03:35.879> you<00:03:36.000> out<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.269> this<00:03:36.389> is

so my lesson for you out of this is

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.410 
so my lesson for you out of this is
using<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.530> biscuit<00:03:37.889> joiner<00:03:38.120> make<00:03:39.120> sure<00:03:39.269> that

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
using a biscuit joiner make sure that

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.420 
using a biscuit joiner make sure that
your<00:03:39.569> work<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.959> secure<00:03:40.379> make<00:03:40.950> sure<00:03:41.129> that<00:03:41.280> your

your work is secure make sure that your
reference<00:03:41.639> surfaces<00:03:42.359> are<00:03:42.569> uniform<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.439> we're

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
reference surfaces are uniform and we're

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.949 
reference surfaces are uniform and we're
gonna<00:03:44.310> get<00:03:44.549> good<00:03:44.730> results<00:03:45.239> and<00:03:45.420> keep<00:03:45.810> your

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959

finger safe
next<00:03:49.170> thing<00:03:49.290> we're<00:03:49.410> gonna<00:03:49.530> have<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.710> look<00:03:49.890> at

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
next thing we're gonna have a look at

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.430 
next thing we're gonna have a look at
here<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.400> routing<00:03:51.240> a<00:03:51.330> date<00:03:51.570> Oh<00:03:51.600> across<00:03:52.230> this

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
here is routing a date Oh across this

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.380 
here is routing a date Oh across this
piece<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.800> plywood<00:03:53.010> common<00:03:53.670> operation<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.270> do

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
piece of plywood common operation to do

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.750 
piece of plywood common operation to do
with<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.540> handheld<00:03:54.930> router<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.920> in<00:03:56.310> this<00:03:56.490> case

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
with a handheld router and in this case

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.430 
with a handheld router and in this case
I<00:03:56.940> need<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> couple<00:03:57.480> things<00:03:57.600> to<00:03:57.810> happen<00:03:57.960> I<00:03:58.230> want

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
I need a couple things to happen I want

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.100 
I need a couple things to happen I want
to<00:03:58.530> make<00:03:58.680> sure<00:03:58.710> that<00:03:59.370> I<00:03:59.670> can<00:04:00.240> cantilever<00:04:00.870> my

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
to make sure that I can cantilever my

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.520 
to make sure that I can cantilever my
work<00:04:01.350> off<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.980> bench<00:04:02.550> because<00:04:03.540> my<00:04:03.720> fence<00:04:04.350> on

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
work off the bench because my fence on

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.080 
work off the bench because my fence on
my<00:04:04.620> router<00:04:04.830> is<00:04:04.980> going<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.220> call<00:04:05.400> for<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.700> and

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
my router is going to call for that and

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.880 
my router is going to call for that and
I<00:04:06.540> want<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.780> make<00:04:06.930> sure<00:04:07.140> that<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.470> material

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
I want to make sure that the material

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.800 
I want to make sure that the material
doesn't<00:04:08.190> creep<00:04:08.490> at<00:04:08.790> all<00:04:08.940> while<00:04:09.390> I'm<00:04:09.600> routing

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
doesn't creep at all while I'm routing

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.990 
doesn't creep at all while I'm routing
it<00:04:10.140> so<00:04:10.740> in<00:04:10.920> this<00:04:11.040> case<00:04:11.310> we're<00:04:11.520> gonna<00:04:11.610> get<00:04:11.790> some

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
it so in this case we're gonna get some

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.080 
it so in this case we're gonna get some
lateral<00:04:12.390> pressure<00:04:12.720> on<00:04:13.050> it<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:14.670> what<00:04:14.880> this

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
lateral pressure on it and what this

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.960 
lateral pressure on it and what this
piece<00:04:15.360> cantilevered<00:04:16.230> then<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:16.920> can<00:04:17.130> also<00:04:17.310> ride

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
piece cantilevered then I can also ride

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.630 
piece cantilevered then I can also ride
my<00:04:18.180> fence<00:04:18.450> out<00:04:18.690> here<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:19.620> here's<00:04:20.340> how<00:04:20.430> that's

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
my fence out here and here's how that's

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:47.060 
my fence out here and here's how that's
going<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:20.850> look

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.760 

so<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:48.220> moral<00:04:48.520> of<00:04:48.760> the<00:04:48.850> story<00:04:48.880> for<00:04:49.510> me<00:04:49.570> is<00:04:49.990> I

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
so the moral of the story for me is I

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.440 
so the moral of the story for me is I
really<00:04:51.190> want<00:04:51.370> you<00:04:51.520> to<00:04:51.580> start<00:04:51.970> with<00:04:52.120> 10<00:04:52.419> and

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
really want you to start with 10 and

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.300 
really want you to start with 10 and
quit<00:04:52.870> with<00:04:53.050> 10<00:04:53.290> I<00:04:53.320> want<00:04:53.560> to<00:04:53.680> make<00:04:53.830> sure<00:04:54.070> that

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
quit with 10 I want to make sure that

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.640 
quit with 10 I want to make sure that
