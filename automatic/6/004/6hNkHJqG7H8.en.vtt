00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.100
 of lamps said you would not have seen a 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.050
 lamp hanging out in the corner by chance 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.690
 she looks like she looks a bit like 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.840

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.219
 empty lamp but it is very important 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.520
 for me you do not see that a little 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.620
 strange but 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.500
