 developer of the first Russian 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.359
 processors elbrus released on their 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.890
 the basis of the first batch of candy bars why 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.570
 companies sister took us 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.820
 computer knows rather military 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.040
 state institutions because they are customers 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.199
 but stanislav course lady uploaded 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.830
 Russian companies and understand why because 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.359
 that he is practically invulnerable in this 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.340
 The enclosure also features protection against 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.849
 unauthorized access using 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.039
 card type Russian means safe speech 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.170
 about the computer sparrow engineer not without 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.170
 pride shows how it works 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.329
 brainchild without downloading graphic russian 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.860
 music candy bar supports touch 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.620
 screen based operating system 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.840
 linux familiar office applications too 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.180
 work but a simple word document is already 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.140
 makes the car think and he is now 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.440
 translates word format in which 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.850
 document launched its standard 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.980
 not very fast in 10 seconds 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.230
 launched the main thing that in the heart of it 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.230
 computer russian processor elbrus 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.770
 the processor is based on our own 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.170
 architecture, that is, it is not x86 and frequency 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.939
 500 megahertz before our process we have 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.820
 corresponding performance 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.049
 somewhere around 2 gigahertz mdina 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.659
 cpu there core 2 duo and intel 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.500
 the motherboard is also called its 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.509
 mona club 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.130
 these computers are for military 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.500
 and government agencies so exactly 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.229
 components not the most resounding elbrus 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.420
 mono cube and k but the main thing is that they all 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.680
 own-made chips company 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.110
 intel is nice but for 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.119
 strategic facilities are no good 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.860
 who his really not until the end 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.049
 opened they know because skinny 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.970
 such in the legs and here is some 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.860
 security silver itself is absolutely 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.539
 different situation here everything is transparent but 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.700
 for us this is only the first but very 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.409
 sure step the processor works without 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.390
 errors are not the most powerful and 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.759
 produced by outdated technology but 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.770
 but its architecture that makes it 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.880
 invulnerable to malware 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.319
 this architecture 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.480
 the user is almost completely 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.880
 protected from 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.130
 most hacker attacks play around 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.140
 three-dimensional games on this fm yet 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.210
 it turns out on the customer she cubase 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.580
 elbrus toys and not needed first 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.500
 a batch of 40 computers for the future 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.480
 customers processor power promise 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.640
 increase 4 times and move 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.660
