things<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.789> your<00:00:17.940> defense<00:00:18.330> are<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:18.750> good

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
things that your defense are so good

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.800 
things that your defense are so good
that<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.380> receive<00:00:20.220> multiple<00:00:20.670> attacks<00:00:21.240> by

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
that you receive multiple attacks by

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.810 
that you receive multiple attacks by
multiple<00:00:22.380> people<00:00:22.410> because<00:00:22.949> your<00:00:23.130> defense<00:00:23.580> are

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
multiple people because your defense are

so good and to prevent people to loot

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.950 
so good and to prevent people to loot
you<00:00:26.369> multiple<00:00:26.760> times<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.359> simple<00:00:27.840> solution

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
you multiple times the simple solution

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.990 
you multiple times the simple solution
is<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.470> take<00:00:28.740> out<00:00:28.920> your<00:00:29.070> town<00:00:29.340> hall<00:00:29.609> out<00:00:29.789> of

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
is to take out your town hall out of

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.530 
is to take out your town hall out of
your<00:00:30.179> base<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.660> let<00:00:31.380> anyone<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.430> defeat<00:00:33.390> it

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
your base and let anyone to defeat it

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.990 
your base and let anyone to defeat it
almost<00:00:33.989> instantaneously<00:00:34.800> make<00:00:35.640> sure<00:00:35.670> there's

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
almost instantaneously make sure there's

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.790 
almost instantaneously make sure there's
no<00:00:36.210> hole<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.860> middle<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.300> base<00:00:39.300> and

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
no hole in the middle of the base and

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.170 
no hole in the middle of the base and
just<00:00:40.800> put<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.399> replace<00:00:41.820> one<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
just put and replace one of the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.330 
just put and replace one of the
buildings<00:00:42.540> over<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.320> hole<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:43.980> nobody

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
buildings over that hole so that nobody

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.150 
buildings over that hole so that nobody
can<00:00:44.910> drop<00:00:45.899> troops<00:00:46.200> right<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> center<00:00:47.129> of

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
can drop troops right in the center of

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.459 
can drop troops right in the center of
the<00:00:47.430> base<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.180> that's<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.989> that's<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the base and that's it that's the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.319 
the base and that's it that's the
solution<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:50.039> how<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.430> prevent<00:00:50.789> people<00:00:51.180> to

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
solution on how to prevent people to

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.959 
solution on how to prevent people to
attack<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.230> multiple<00:00:52.829> times<00:00:52.980> because<00:00:53.280> your

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
attack you multiple times because your

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.569 
attack you multiple times because your
base<00:00:54.180> defense<00:00:54.629> are<00:00:54.870> too<00:00:55.079> good<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.590> now<00:00:56.160> but

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
base defense are too good and now but

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.209 
base defense are too good and now but
the<00:00:56.789> result<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:58.320> safely<00:00:58.620> go<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> sleep

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the result is I can safely go to sleep

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.729 
the result is I can safely go to sleep
and<00:00:59.460> do<00:00:59.879> not<00:01:00.030> need<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.300> wake<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.809> check<00:01:01.289> as

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
and do not need to wake up and check as

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.880 
and do not need to wake up and check as
multiple<00:01:02.309> attacks<00:01:02.940> okay<00:01:03.840> next<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
multiple attacks okay next is the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.700 
multiple attacks okay next is the
strategy<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.420> wall<00:01:06.659> breakers<00:01:07.110> I'm<00:01:07.530> gonna

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
strategy on the wall breakers I'm gonna

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.190 
strategy on the wall breakers I'm gonna
teach<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.220> how<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.900> utilize<00:01:09.900> wall

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200

teach you on how to utilize wall
breakers<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.680> brick<00:01:10.920> two<00:01:11.340> layers<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.880> war<00:01:12.150> just

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
breakers to brick two layers of war just

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.020 
breakers to brick two layers of war just
like<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.900> try<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.590> select<00:01:14.040> base<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.820> have

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
like this try to select base that have

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.249 
like this try to select base that have
very<00:01:15.810> close<00:01:16.110> holes<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.460> see<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> holes

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
very close holes you can see the holes

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.390 
very close holes you can see the holes
right<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.619> top<00:01:19.830> side<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.369> see

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
right on the top side you can see

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.130 
right on the top side you can see
there's<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.030> whole<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.570> treat<00:01:21.780> deploy

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
there's this whole I can treat deploy

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.499 
there's this whole I can treat deploy
troops<00:01:22.200> right<00:01:22.740> there<00:01:23.009> choose<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> location<00:01:24.210> i

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
troops right there choose a location i

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.020 
troops right there choose a location i
can<00:01:24.750> drop<00:01:25.259> troops<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:26.520> troops<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.880> i'm

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
can drop troops the troops that i'm

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.240 
can drop troops the troops that i'm
going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.299> deploy<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.110> cover<00:01:28.470> my<00:01:28.950> wall

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
going to deploy is to cover my wall

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.010 
going to deploy is to cover my wall
breakers<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.420> wall<00:01:30.540> breakers<00:01:30.869> will

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
breakers so that the wall breakers will

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.319 
breakers so that the wall breakers will
not<00:01:31.200> be<00:01:31.439> shot<00:01:31.740> down<00:01:31.950> by<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.280> archer<00:01:32.850> tower<00:01:33.030> and

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
not be shot down by the archer tower and

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.170 
not be shot down by the archer tower and
a<00:01:33.390> wizard<00:01:33.780> let<00:01:34.380> me<00:01:34.530> take<00:01:35.100> put<00:01:35.400> some<00:01:35.579> cover<00:01:35.880> and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
a wizard let me take put some cover and

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.899 
a wizard let me take put some cover and
my<00:01:36.659> wall<00:01:37.140> breakers<00:01:37.500> one<00:01:38.189> ball<00:01:38.369> breakers<00:01:38.729> and

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
my wall breakers one ball breakers and

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.940 
my wall breakers one ball breakers and
can<00:01:39.329> break<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.750> if<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> lubricant<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.710> spray

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
can break this if the lubricant is spray

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.859 
can break this if the lubricant is spray
high<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.369> do<00:01:41.549> not<00:01:41.700> move<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.880> finger<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.509> drop

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
high and do not move a finger and drop

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.990 
high and do not move a finger and drop
another<00:01:43.439> wall<00:01:43.829> breakers<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.700> see

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
another wall breakers and you can see

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.090 
another wall breakers and you can see
that<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.420> wall<00:01:45.810> breakers<00:01:46.200> actually<00:01:46.530> go<00:01:46.770> right

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
that the wall breakers actually go right

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.010 
that the wall breakers actually go right
through<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.549> hole<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.750> how<00:01:48.990> you

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
through the hole and this is how you

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.340 
through the hole and this is how you
break<00:01:49.590> two<00:01:50.040> layers<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.670> war<00:01:50.939> right<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.960> that's

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
break two layers of war right so that's

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.289 
break two layers of war right so that's
it<00:01:52.470> for<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.829> strategy<00:01:53.579> thank<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.939> very<00:01:54.149> much

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
it for this strategy thank you very much

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.389 
it for this strategy thank you very much
