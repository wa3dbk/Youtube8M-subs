00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.919 

I<00:00:01.340> thought<00:00:02.340> I'd<00:00:02.520> make<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:02.730> short<00:00:03.179> update<00:00:03.419> video

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
I thought I'd make a short update video

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.900 
I thought I'd make a short update video
about<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.970> 1989<00:00:05.970> Yamaha<00:00:06.450> model<00:00:06.810> for<00:00:06.990> 200<00:00:07.910> I

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
about the 1989 Yamaha model for 200 I

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.709 
about the 1989 Yamaha model for 200 I
just<00:00:09.660> got<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:10.190> few<00:00:11.190> more<00:00:11.370> mods<00:00:11.610> done<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:12.450> like

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
just got a few more mods done to it like

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.150 
just got a few more mods done to it like
I<00:00:13.219> got<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.400> recoil<00:00:14.849> off<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:16.109> 1985<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.039> put

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
I got the recoil off that 1985 and put

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.150 
I got the recoil off that 1985 and put
it<00:00:17.250> on<00:00:17.369> here<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.869> I<00:00:18.869> had<00:00:19.050> there's<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.949> little

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
it on here and I had there's a little

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.340 
it on here and I had there's a little
thing<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.400> that's<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.449> shaft<00:00:21.960> in<00:00:22.170> there

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
thing that that's on the shaft in there

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.439 
thing that that's on the shaft in there
and<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.800> had<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.039> get<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.490> from<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.910> trimodal

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
and I had to get that from the trimodal

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.630 
and I had to get that from the trimodal
engine<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.529> put<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.980> there<00:00:26.099> too<00:00:26.279> because

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
engine and put that on there too because

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.210 
engine and put that on there too because
it's<00:00:26.849> special<00:00:27.480> for<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.900> recoil<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.439> mine

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
it's special for the recoil and mine

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.500 
it's special for the recoil and mine
didn't<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.760> because<00:00:30.000> mine<00:00:30.179> was<00:00:30.210> not

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
didn't have that because mine was not

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.530 
didn't have that because mine was not
really<00:00:31.430> intended<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.669> recoil<00:00:33.120> on<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.360> but

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
really intended to have recoil on it but

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.240 
really intended to have recoil on it but
they<00:00:34.140> didn't<00:00:34.410> change<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.710> motor<00:00:34.890> design

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
they didn't change the motor design

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.060 
they didn't change the motor design
enough<00:00:35.489> for<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.820> not<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.969> fit<00:00:36.590> so<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.620> got<00:00:37.950> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
enough for it not to fit so I got the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.979 
enough for it not to fit so I got the
recoil<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.550> there<00:00:38.700> now<00:00:38.820> which<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:39.840> nice

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
recoil on there now which is really nice

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.950 
recoil on there now which is really nice
because<00:00:40.730> now<00:00:41.730> it'll<00:00:41.940> start<00:00:41.969> even<00:00:42.690> when<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
because now it'll start even when the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.650 
because now it'll start even when the
batteries<00:00:43.800> are<00:00:43.950> dead<00:00:44.210> hopefully<00:00:45.210> anyway

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
batteries are dead hopefully anyway

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.690 
batteries are dead hopefully anyway
should<00:00:46.590> at<00:00:46.739> least<00:00:46.829> I'm<00:00:47.160> starting<00:00:47.489> for<00:00:47.610> what

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
should at least I'm starting for what

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.150 
should at least I'm starting for what
anyway<00:00:47.940> even<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.300> winter<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.039> I'll<00:00:50.039> just

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
anyway even in the winter so I'll just

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.250 
anyway even in the winter so I'll just
show<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.430> quick<00:00:50.760> here

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:18.749 

got<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> good<00:00:55.620> pull<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.070> thing<00:00:56.309> scared

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.800 

and<00:01:21.640> many<00:01:22.640> of<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:22.970> might<00:01:23.180> notice<00:01:23.540> that<00:01:23.570> the

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
and many of you might notice that the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.260 
and many of you might notice that the
motor<00:01:23.960> has<00:01:24.140> a<00:01:24.170> ticking<00:01:24.560> sound<00:01:24.590> which<00:01:25.040> is<00:01:25.270> the

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
motor has a ticking sound which is the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.029 
motor has a ticking sound which is the
valves<00:01:26.630> apparently<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:27.409> I<00:01:27.440> need<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:27.799> get<00:01:27.890> them

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
valves apparently so I need to get them

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:29.830 
valves apparently so I need to get them
adjusted<00:01:28.130> but<00:01:28.670> now<00:01:28.820> that<00:01:29.000> I<00:01:29.030> have<00:01:29.240> that<00:01:29.509> repair

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
adjusted but now that I have that repair

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.389 
adjusted but now that I have that repair
manual<00:01:30.259> for<00:01:30.289> it<00:01:30.649> I<00:01:30.860> can<00:01:31.399> do<00:01:31.549> that<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:33.399> another

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
manual for it I can do that and another

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.460 
manual for it I can do that and another
thing<00:01:34.549> I<00:01:34.759> did<00:01:34.939> was<00:01:35.119> take<00:01:35.539> off<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:35.899> headlight<00:01:36.080> I

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
thing I did was take off the headlight I

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.170 
thing I did was take off the headlight I
don't<00:01:37.250> really<00:01:37.430> like<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.789> look<00:01:37.970> of<00:01:38.060> that

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
don't really like the look of that

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.330 
don't really like the look of that
headlight<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:38.899> there's<00:01:39.259> so<00:01:39.530> many<00:01:39.770> wires<00:01:40.100> and

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
headlight and there's so many wires and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.540 
headlight and there's so many wires and
that<00:01:40.430> stupid<00:01:40.700> thing<00:01:41.090> I<00:01:41.300> mean<00:01:42.020> I<00:01:42.350> had<00:01:43.009> there

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
that stupid thing I mean I had there

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.680 
that stupid thing I mean I had there
were<00:01:43.610> so<00:01:43.759> many<00:01:43.850> wires<00:01:44.149> in<00:01:44.330> there<00:01:44.450> that<00:01:44.569> they

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
were so many wires in there that they

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.169 
were so many wires in there that they
kept<00:01:44.899> the<00:01:45.170> connections<00:01:45.649> kept<00:01:45.860> failing

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
kept the connections kept failing

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.309 
kept the connections kept failing
because<00:01:47.179> I<00:01:47.240> didn't<00:01:47.479> put<00:01:47.600> it<00:01:47.659> in<00:01:47.690> there<00:01:47.840> exactly

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
because I didn't put it in there exactly

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.410 
because I didn't put it in there exactly
right<00:01:48.890> which<00:01:49.190> is<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.549> real<00:01:49.819> ripoff<00:01:50.210> so<00:01:50.360> I'm

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
right which is a real ripoff so I'm

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.520 
right which is a real ripoff so I'm
gonna<00:01:50.509> be<00:01:50.659> doing<00:01:50.690> something<00:01:51.140> else<00:01:51.259> with<00:01:51.440> the

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
gonna be doing something else with the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.770 
gonna be doing something else with the
headlight<00:01:53.020> so<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:55.130> also<00:01:55.569> you<00:01:56.569> might<00:01:56.720> notice

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
headlight so and also you might notice

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.940 
headlight so and also you might notice
that<00:01:57.140> I<00:01:58.030> turned<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.330> front<00:02:00.229> tires<00:02:00.440> the<00:02:00.830> other

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
that I turned the front tires the other

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.710 
that I turned the front tires the other
way<00:02:01.390> so<00:02:02.799> it's<00:02:03.799> a<00:02:03.890> little<00:02:04.039> bit<00:02:04.250> wider<00:02:04.369> now<00:02:04.759> it's

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
way so it's a little bit wider now it's

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.169 
way so it's a little bit wider now it's
probably<00:02:05.869> about<00:02:06.170> three<00:02:07.179> three-and-a-half

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
probably about three three-and-a-half

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.749 
probably about three three-and-a-half
inches<00:02:08.690> wider<00:02:08.899> actually<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:09.769> it<00:02:10.369> gives<00:02:10.549> it<00:02:10.700> a

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
inches wider actually and it gives it a

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.850 
inches wider actually and it gives it a
little<00:02:10.910> more<00:02:11.060> stability<00:02:11.390> not<00:02:12.230> that<00:02:12.410> much<00:02:12.620> but

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
little more stability not that much but

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.849 
little more stability not that much but
it<00:02:13.730> doesn't<00:02:14.090> really<00:02:14.209> interfere<00:02:14.480> with<00:02:14.859> doing

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:15.859 
it doesn't really interfere with doing

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.310 
it doesn't really interfere with doing
bicycles<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.549> stuff<00:02:16.760> but<00:02:17.260> it's<00:02:18.260> just

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
bicycles and stuff but it's just

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.599 
bicycles and stuff but it's just
something<00:02:18.590> kind<00:02:18.859> of<00:02:18.920> neat<00:02:19.070> to<00:02:19.190> do<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.489> it

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:19.609 
something kind of neat to do to it

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.900 
something kind of neat to do to it
anyway<00:02:20.380> anyway<00:02:21.380> there's<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.680> couple<00:02:22.430> more<00:02:22.700> mods

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
anyway anyway there's a couple more mods

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
does not give it spark so it cranks and

everything<00:02:50.720> but<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.950> didn't<00:02:52.190> get<00:02:52.250> spark<00:02:52.720> so

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720

I'm<00:02:54.019> and<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.500> just<00:02:54.980> assumed<00:02:55.310> make<00:02:55.430> a<00:02:55.459> video<00:02:55.760> when

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
I'm and I just assumed make a video when

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.860 
I'm and I just assumed make a video when
I<00:02:56.000> actually<00:02:56.739> get<00:02:57.739> spark<00:02:58.160> so<00:02:58.549> then<00:02:59.510> I'll<00:02:59.660> try<00:02:59.840> to

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
I actually get spark so then I'll try to

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.900 
I actually get spark so then I'll try to
start<00:03:00.140> it<00:03:00.260> when<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:00.500> when<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.280> get<00:03:01.459> spark<00:03:01.760> with

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
start it when I when I get spark with

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.360 
start it when I when I get spark with
that<00:03:02.090> then<00:03:02.359> I'll<00:03:02.450> try<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.660> start<00:03:02.989> it<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:03.370> make

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370
