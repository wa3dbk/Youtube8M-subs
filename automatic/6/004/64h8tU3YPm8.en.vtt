ribbon<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.510> think<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.170> should<00:01:04.619> be<00:01:04.650> a

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
ribbon but I think that this should be a

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.109 
ribbon but I think that this should be a
little<00:01:04.920> bit<00:01:05.129> more<00:01:05.280> rustic<00:01:05.460> which<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.939> why<00:01:06.090> I

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
little bit more rustic which is why I

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.770 
little bit more rustic which is why I
like<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.510> look<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.290> kitchen<00:01:07.409> twine<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:08.780> do

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
like the look of the kitchen twine I do

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.719 
like the look of the kitchen twine I do
a<00:01:09.900> double<00:01:10.260> loop<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.979> can<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> single<00:01:11.490> loop

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
a double loop you can do a single loop

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.179 
a double loop you can do a single loop
or<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.299> do<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> bow<00:01:12.830> there's<00:01:13.830> no<00:01:13.979> wrong<00:01:14.159> answer

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
or you do a bow there's no wrong answer

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.550 
or you do a bow there's no wrong answer
there<00:01:15.350> just<00:01:16.350> try<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.770> or<00:01:16.890> not<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:18.560> then

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
there just try it it or not and then

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.920 
there just try it it or not and then
snip<00:01:20.009> off<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.310> ends<00:01:21.119> leaving<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.720> little

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
snip off the ends leaving just a little

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.360 
snip off the ends leaving just a little
bit<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.439> looks<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:23.009> cute<00:01:23.549> little
