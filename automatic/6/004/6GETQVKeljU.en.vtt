percent of our time but their point is

percent of our time but their point is
that<00:01:12.150> each<00:01:12.390> time<00:01:12.630> there's<00:01:12.840> an<00:01:12.960> interruption

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that interruption if that happens and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.469 
that interruption if that happens and
mass<00:01:21.360> across<00:01:21.810> thousands<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.470> people<00:01:22.850> we<00:01:23.850> say

mass across thousands of people we say

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.300 
mass across thousands of people we say
that<00:01:24.689> productivity<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.740> up<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.130> it

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
that productivity is going up but it

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.190 
that productivity is going up but it
seems<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:26.939> not<00:01:27.149> because<00:01:27.899> we're<00:01:28.079> all

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
seems like it's not because we're all

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.719 
seems like it's not because we're all
less<00:01:28.439> than<00:01:28.740> because<00:01:28.890> we're<00:01:29.100> constantly<00:01:29.399> in<00:01:29.670> a

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
less than because we're constantly in a

less than because we're constantly in a
state<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:30.030> interruption<00:01:30.539> I<00:01:30.630> think<00:01:30.929> that<00:01:30.960> the

state of interruption I think that the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.539 
state of interruption I think that the
best<00:01:31.289> decision<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.859> the<00:01:31.979> most<00:01:32.159> informed

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
best decision is the most informed

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.219 
best decision is the most informed
decisions<00:01:32.939> particularly<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.659> very<00:01:33.840> complex

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
decisions particularly in a very complex

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.169 
decisions particularly in a very complex
world<00:01:34.439> come<00:01:34.740> from<00:01:34.770> stepping<00:01:35.579> back<00:01:35.850> from<00:01:35.999> the

world come from stepping back from the

world come from stepping back from the
data<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:37.140> find<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.530> moment<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.890> meaning<00:01:38.280> and

data to find a moment of meaning and

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.109 
data to find a moment of meaning and
then<00:01:39.060> give<00:01:39.479> your<00:01:39.630> answer<00:01:39.780> by<00:01:40.909> created<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:41.999> my

then give your answer by created in my

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.580 
then give your answer by created in my

way<00:05:18.030> should<00:05:18.360> we<00:05:18.510> do<00:05:18.660> it<00:05:18.780> that<00:05:18.960> way<00:05:19.139> and<00:05:19.320> not

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
way should we do it that way and not

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.529 
way should we do it that way and not
just<00:05:19.979> have<00:05:20.160> their<00:05:20.280> voices<00:05:20.490> squash<00:05:21.000> down<00:05:21.300> in

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
just have their voices squash down in

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.060 
just have their voices squash down in
any<00:05:21.660> one<00:05:21.810> session<00:05:22.229> even<00:05:22.440> the<00:05:22.710> most<00:05:22.830> junior

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
any one session even the most junior

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.550 
any one session even the most junior
person<00:05:23.490> is<00:05:23.610> become<00:05:23.970> that's<00:05:24.900> a<00:05:25.050> firm<00:05:25.229> that<00:05:25.410> has

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
person is become that's a firm that has

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.740 
person is become that's a firm that has
and<00:05:25.889> practices<00:05:26.820> reflection<00:05:27.360> a<00:05:27.419> little<00:05:27.660> bit

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
and practices reflection a little bit

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.379 
and practices reflection a little bit
more<00:05:27.930> than<00:05:28.200> most<00:05:28.470> I<00:05:28.740> think<00:05:29.400> most<00:05:29.820> books<00:05:30.090> today

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
more than most I think most books today

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.750 
more than most I think most books today
extolled<00:05:30.930> the<00:05:31.050> virtues<00:05:31.139> of<00:05:31.530> moving<00:05:32.160> faster<00:05:32.610> of

extolled the virtues of moving faster of

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.730 
extolled the virtues of moving faster of
getting<00:05:33.690> further<00:05:33.900> on<00:05:34.139> the<00:05:34.229> treadmill<00:05:34.620> of

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
getting further on the treadmill of

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.560 
getting further on the treadmill of
deeper<00:05:35.340> connectivity<00:05:35.910> and<00:05:36.060> that<00:05:36.210> has<00:05:36.389> its

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
deeper connectivity and that has its

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.210 
deeper connectivity and that has its
place<00:05:36.750> I'm<00:05:36.960> not<00:05:37.110> going<00:05:37.289> to<00:05:37.349> lie<00:05:37.470> I<00:05:37.500> make<00:05:37.800> no

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.129 
place I'm not going to lie I make no

sped up so much of our life but very few

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.050 
sped up so much of our life but very few
books<00:05:43.410> actually<00:05:43.860> make<00:05:44.070> the<00:05:44.250> argument<00:05:44.460> to

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
books actually make the argument to

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.700 
books actually make the argument to
figure<00:05:45.419> out<00:05:45.570> how<00:05:45.780> to<00:05:45.840> use<00:05:46.080> what<00:05:46.320> I<00:05:46.349> call<00:05:46.410> this

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
figure out how to use what I call this

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.190 
figure out how to use what I call this

and the consequences are high how much
think<00:06:04.020> time<00:06:04.199> did<00:06:04.380> you<00:06:04.470> do<00:06:04.620> before<00:06:04.949> the<00:06:05.310> meeting

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
think time did you do before the meeting

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.310 
think time did you do before the meeting
when<00:06:06.120> you<00:06:06.150> get<00:06:06.389> into<00:06:06.539> the<00:06:06.720> meeting<00:06:06.990> is<00:06:07.110> there<00:06:07.289> a

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
when you get into the meeting is there a

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.050 
when you get into the meeting is there a
set<00:06:07.530> of<00:06:07.620> ground<00:06:07.800> rules<00:06:07.979> that<00:06:08.430> govern<00:06:08.880> the

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
set of ground rules that govern the

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.150 
set of ground rules that govern the
dialogue<00:06:09.570> and<00:06:09.840> the<00:06:09.930> structure<00:06:10.410> of<00:06:10.440> it<00:06:10.650> what<00:06:11.039> is

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
dialogue and the structure of it what is

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.189 
dialogue and the structure of it what is
dialogue<00:06:11.669> most<00:06:12.389> people<00:06:12.720> don't<00:06:12.810> even<00:06:12.930> have<00:06:13.169> a

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
dialogue most people don't even have a

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.709 
dialogue most people don't even have a
definition<00:06:13.680> for<00:06:13.830> it<00:06:14.159> so<00:06:14.280> my<00:06:14.430> book<00:06:14.640> is<00:06:15.180> attempts

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:15.719 
definition for it so my book is attempts

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.659 
definition for it so my book is attempts
to<00:06:15.930> not<00:06:16.469> only<00:06:16.620> give<00:06:16.860> examples<00:06:17.430> of<00:06:17.520> that

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
to not only give examples of that

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:18.030 
to not only give examples of that
because<00:06:17.789> I

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 
because I

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.950 
because I
people<00:06:18.310> learn<00:06:18.430> by<00:06:18.580> storytelling<00:06:19.240> but<00:06:19.810> to

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
people learn by storytelling but to

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.780 
people learn by storytelling but to
figure<00:06:20.230> out<00:06:20.350> ways<00:06:20.560> that<00:06:20.830> you<00:06:20.860> can<00:06:21.190> steal<00:06:21.490> and

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:21.790 
figure out ways that you can steal and

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.100 
figure out ways that you can steal and
take<00:06:22.000> some<00:06:22.210> of<00:06:22.300> these<00:06:22.390> techniques<00:06:22.780> and<00:06:22.990> bring

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
take some of these techniques and bring

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.720 
take some of these techniques and bring
it<00:06:23.200> back<00:06:23.230> into<00:06:23.500> your<00:06:23.770> organization<00:06:24.010> that's
