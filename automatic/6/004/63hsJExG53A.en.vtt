00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
yeah a lot of I didn't even have time to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.830 
yeah a lot of I didn't even have time to
jump<00:01:03.320> out<00:01:03.440> of<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:03.620> tank<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.540> seen<00:01:05.540> this<00:01:05.659> I'm

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
doing almost like what I did in the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.320 
doing almost like what I did in the
first<00:01:08.150> operation<00:01:08.900> everything<00:01:09.140> video<00:01:10.330> I'm

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
first operation everything video I'm

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.350 
first operation everything video I'm
gonna<00:01:11.510> spawn<00:01:11.870> in<00:01:12.140> is<00:01:12.290> medic<00:01:12.680> now<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.880> if<00:01:14.060> I<00:01:14.180> can

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
gonna spawn in is medic now and if I can

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.240 
gonna spawn in is medic now and if I can
get<00:01:14.570> far<00:01:14.869> enough<00:01:15.170> into<00:01:15.380> their<00:01:15.590> base<00:01:15.770> I'm<00:01:16.100> going

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
get far enough into their base I'm going

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.180 
get far enough into their base I'm going
to<00:01:16.340> jump<00:01:16.580> out<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:16.940> tank<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:17.920> see<00:01:18.920> how<00:01:19.040> much

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
to jump out of the tank and see how much

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.950 
to jump out of the tank and see how much
damage<00:01:19.460> I<00:01:19.700> can<00:01:19.759> do<00:01:20.060> see<00:01:20.330> they're<00:01:20.479> not<00:01:20.660> really

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
damage I can do see they're not really

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.590 
damage I can do see they're not really
expecting<00:01:21.680> to<00:01:21.890> have<00:01:22.119> infantry<00:01:23.119> to<00:01:23.210> deal<00:01:23.390> with

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
expecting to have infantry to deal with

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.980 
expecting to have infantry to deal with
it's<00:01:23.810> all<00:01:23.960> going<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.170> be<00:01:24.229> hostile<00:01:25.130> tanks<00:01:25.900> so<00:01:26.900> as

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
it's all going to be hostile tanks so as

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.780 
it's all going to be hostile tanks so as
soon<00:01:27.140> as<00:01:27.259> this<00:01:27.440> tank<00:01:27.770> respawns<00:01:28.340> in<00:01:30.640> that's<00:01:31.640> why

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
soon as this tank respawns in that's why

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.580 
soon as this tank respawns in that's why
medic<00:01:32.119> is<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:32.450> effective<00:01:33.020> when<00:01:33.140> if<00:01:33.410> you're

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
medic is so effective when if you're

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.859 
medic is so effective when if you're
actually<00:01:34.039> managed<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:34.759> infiltrate<00:01:35.240> that<00:01:35.630> base

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
actually managed to infiltrate that base

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.300 
actually managed to infiltrate that base
they're<00:01:36.110> all<00:01:36.200> going<00:01:36.320> to<00:01:36.380> be<00:01:36.440> anti-tank<00:01:37.100> I'm

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
they're all going to be anti-tank I'm

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.370 
they're all going to be anti-tank I'm
sure<00:01:37.520> maybe<00:01:37.820> sniper

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.359 

come<00:01:42.380> on<00:01:42.530> spawn<00:01:42.979> then<00:01:44.020> even<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.369> allied

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
come on spawn then even a allied

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.100 
come on spawn then even a allied
artillery<00:01:46.729> piece<00:01:47.180> is<00:01:47.360> rolling<00:01:47.750> up<00:01:47.899> that's

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
artillery piece is rolling up that's

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.170 
artillery piece is rolling up that's
when<00:01:48.259> you<00:01:48.380> know<00:01:48.590> that<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.550> other<00:01:49.670> side<00:01:49.789> is

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
when you know that the other side is

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.060 
when you know that the other side is
finished<00:01:50.570> when<00:01:50.780> your<00:01:50.930> artillery<00:01:51.320> pieces<00:01:51.770> are

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
finished when your artillery pieces are

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.800 
finished when your artillery pieces are
already

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.930 

that's<00:01:55.500> pretty<00:01:55.710> much<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.100> last<00:01:56.280> thing<00:01:56.700> anyone

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
that's pretty much the last thing anyone

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.359 
that's pretty much the last thing anyone
wants<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.420> take<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:58.740> they're<00:01:58.950> really<00:01:59.130> slow<00:01:59.520> so

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
wants to take and they're really slow so

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.590 
wants to take and they're really slow so
you<00:02:02.369> know<00:02:02.549> I'm<00:02:02.700> definitely<00:02:02.970> not<00:02:03.299> going<00:02:03.479> to

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
you know I'm definitely not going to

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.440 
you know I'm definitely not going to
turn

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
is probably gonna be over pretty quickly

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.559 
is probably gonna be over pretty quickly
