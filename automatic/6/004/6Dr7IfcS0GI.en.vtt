it in two fingers before i pluck and
that<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:35.960> feel<00:02:36.850> it<00:02:37.850> felt<00:02:38.300> like<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:38.540> went<00:02:38.750> too<00:02:38.900> far

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
that I feel it felt like I went too far

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.830

and<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.680> palm<00:02:39.890> came<00:02:40.190> into<00:02:40.430> play<00:02:40.610> that<00:02:40.880> I

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
didn't think I add anything that thing I

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.030 
didn't think I add anything that thing I
might<00:02:43.760> have<00:02:43.940> two<00:02:44.180> near<00:02:44.450> misses<00:02:44.680> two<00:02:45.680> or<00:02:45.830> three

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
might have two near misses two or three

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.590

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
so then they had to go back and do it

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.460 
so then they had to go back and do it
again<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:48.260> make<00:02:48.290> sure<00:02:48.470> i<00:02:48.620> get<00:02:48.860> them<00:02:48.950> in<00:02:49.100> pitbull
