for the under 2.5 here it's going to be

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.340 
for the under 2.5 here it's going to be

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
interesting especially because Olivier

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.260

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
Champions League midweek where you would

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.819 
Champions League midweek where you would
have<00:01:39.689> thought<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> jury<00:01:40.079> would<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.380> more<00:01:40.710> of

have thought the jury would have more of

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.460 
have thought the jury would have more of
a<00:01:40.890> chance<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.759> without<00:01:42.509> him<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.079> definitely

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
a chance I without him that definitely

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.420 
a chance I without him that definitely
don't<00:01:43.649> seem<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:43.979> as<00:01:44.009> much<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
don't seem to be as much of a

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.789 
don't seem to be as much of a
goalscoring<00:01:44.909> fret<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.479> as<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.350> saw<00:01:46.470> them<00:01:46.619> not

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
goalscoring fret and as we saw them not

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.960 
goalscoring fret and as we saw them not
too<00:01:46.979> reliable<00:01:47.130> from<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.610> penalty<00:01:47.820> spot

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
too reliable from the penalty spot

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.170 
too reliable from the penalty spot
either<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.780> under<00:01:49.710> 2.5<00:01:50.220> has<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> reasonable

Arsenal minus 2 I think that's a little
bit<00:02:16.470> too<00:02:16.709> ambitious<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:17.430> think<00:02:18.120> it's<00:02:18.420> going<00:02:18.660> to

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
bit too ambitious I think it's going to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.320 
bit too ambitious I think it's going to
take<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.170> very<00:02:19.379> very<00:02:20.099> good<00:02:20.459> team<00:02:20.849> performance

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
take a very very good team performance
