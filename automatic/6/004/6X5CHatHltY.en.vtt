Sun<00:00:35.399> stuff<00:00:35.670> like<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.870> decided<00:00:37.410> to

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
Sun stuff like that so I decided to

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.990 
Sun stuff like that so I decided to
create<00:00:37.770> some<00:00:38.010> lowlights<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.550> have<00:00:38.640> some<00:00:38.850> fun

different<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.739> my<00:00:40.860> hair<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.670> thought<00:00:41.879> you

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
different to my hair and I thought you

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.400

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.500 
guys can see that that's how I see my
lair<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.670> what<00:03:01.819> I'm<00:03:01.910> going<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.090> be<00:03:02.180> doing<00:03:02.300> is

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
lair and what I'm going to be doing is

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.330 
lair and what I'm going to be doing is
cutting<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.989> extension<00:03:03.560> into<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:03.860> layer<00:03:04.070> and

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
cutting the extension into the layer and

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.250 
cutting the extension into the layer and
I'm<00:03:05.180> going<00:03:05.239> to<00:03:05.510> be<00:03:05.630> shaping<00:03:05.989> my<00:03:06.769> extensions<00:03:07.430> so

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
I'm going to be shaping my extensions so

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.509 
I'm going to be shaping my extensions so
then<00:03:09.260> we<00:03:09.410> kind<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:09.650> get<00:03:09.769> kind<00:03:10.010> of<00:03:10.100> like<00:03:10.250> this

looking to see where the how am I I'm
looking<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:24.650> see<00:03:24.799> how<00:03:24.920> my<00:03:25.070> layers<00:03:25.310> are<00:03:25.519> going

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
looking to see how my layers are going

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.910 
looking to see how my layers are going
my<00:03:26.239> layers<00:03:26.510> are<00:03:26.690> obviously<00:03:27.079> curving<00:03:27.590> in<00:03:27.739> like

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
my layers are obviously curving in like

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.789 
my layers are obviously curving in like
this<00:03:28.420> and<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.630> want<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.959> extension<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.560> follow

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
this and I want the extension to follow

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.020 
this and I want the extension to follow
my<00:03:31.040> curves<00:03:31.340> of<00:03:31.579> my<00:03:31.700> layers<00:03:32.560> so<00:03:33.850> we're<00:03:34.850> going<00:03:34.940> to

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
my curves of my layers so we're going to

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.380 
my curves of my layers so we're going to
be<00:03:35.090> cutting<00:03:35.239> it<00:03:35.480> like<00:03:36.320> this<00:03:36.940> make<00:03:37.940> sure<00:03:37.970> that

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
be cutting it like this make sure that

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.560 
be cutting it like this make sure that
that's<00:03:38.959> all<00:03:39.230> your<00:03:39.410> extension<00:03:40.010> yep<00:03:40.489> and<00:03:40.880> you're

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
that's all your extension yep and you're

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.300 
that's all your extension yep and you're
going<00:03:41.660> to<00:03:41.720> take<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.900> scissor<00:03:44.620> and<00:03:45.620> you're<00:03:46.190> just

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
going to take a scissor and you're just

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:58.480 
going to take a scissor and you're just
going<00:03:46.549> to<00:03:46.609> cut

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.040 

so<00:03:59.490> once<00:03:59.640> you<00:03:59.730> have<00:03:59.820> the<00:03:59.910> basis<00:04:00.300> of<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:00.510> cut<00:04:00.750> is

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
so once you have the basis of the cut is

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.290 
so once you have the basis of the cut is
you<00:04:01.170> guys<00:04:01.260> since<00:04:01.470> he's<00:04:01.650> angled<00:04:02.070> it's<00:04:02.880> going<00:04:03.210> to

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
you guys since he's angled it's going to

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.970 
you guys since he's angled it's going to
be<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.450> little<00:04:03.540> bit<00:04:03.720> harsh<00:04:03.990> and<00:04:04.320> you're<00:04:04.860> going

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
be a little bit harsh and you're going

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.910 
be a little bit harsh and you're going
to<00:04:05.100> want<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.570> cut<00:04:06.570> in<00:04:06.750> words<00:04:06.990> to<00:04:07.230> kind<00:04:07.470> of<00:04:07.530> again

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
to want to cut in words to kind of again

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:18.710 
to want to cut in words to kind of again
give<00:04:10.920> it<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:11.130> layer<00:04:11.370> effect

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.840 

so<00:04:19.320> you<00:04:19.410> can<00:04:19.680> kind<00:04:19.860> of<00:04:19.920> see<00:04:19.980> it<00:04:20.160> in<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.370> hair<00:04:20.610> of

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
so you can kind of see it in the hair of

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.520 
so you can kind of see it in the hair of
course<00:04:21.450> you<00:04:21.660> want<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.900> go<00:04:22.019> ahead<00:04:22.230> and<00:04:22.410> take<00:04:22.470> a

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
course you want to go ahead and take a

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.140 
course you want to go ahead and take a
flat<00:04:22.830> iron<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.220> kind<00:04:23.400> of<00:04:23.490> curve<00:04:23.670> it<00:04:23.790> in<00:04:23.910> so<00:04:24.090> I

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
flat iron and kind of curve it in so I

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.670 
flat iron and kind of curve it in so I
can<00:04:24.300> match<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.840> rest<00:04:24.990> of<00:04:25.170> your<00:04:25.260> layers<00:04:25.470> or

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
can match the rest of your layers or

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.620 
can match the rest of your layers or
else<00:04:25.800> is<00:04:25.920> going<00:04:26.070> to<00:04:26.100> stick<00:04:26.370> out<00:04:26.580> all<00:04:26.730> weird<00:04:26.910> but

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
else is going to stick out all weird but

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.610 
else is going to stick out all weird but
I'm<00:04:27.690> going<00:04:27.840> to<00:04:27.900> leave<00:04:28.020> that<00:04:28.050> for<00:04:28.290> now<00:04:28.320> while<00:04:28.590> I

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
I'm going to leave that for now while I

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.190 
I'm going to leave that for now while I
go<00:04:28.890> ahead<00:04:28.980> and<00:04:29.130> create<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.460> new<00:04:29.640> one<00:04:29.990> so<00:04:30.990> again

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
go ahead and create a new one so again

going<00:04:41.940> to<00:04:42.000> follow<00:04:42.210> my<00:04:42.450> layers

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.260 

see<00:04:50.410> that<00:04:50.560> they<00:04:50.650> end<00:04:50.830> around<00:04:51.190> here<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:54.270> then
