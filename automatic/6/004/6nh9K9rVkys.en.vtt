00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
mentally and mechanically first time

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.030 
mentally and mechanically first time
with<00:00:49.970> the<00:00:50.060> movie<00:00:50.360> first<00:00:51.320> time<00:00:51.530> with<00:00:51.739> Tim<00:00:51.950> oh

good mix between everything we can still
go<00:01:06.110> past<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.590> off-road<00:01:06.979> but<00:01:07.220> you<00:01:07.369> will<00:01:07.520> can

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
go past the off-road but you will can

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.270 
go past the off-road but you will can
also<00:01:07.850> go<00:01:08.090> fast<00:01:08.390> on<00:01:08.630> on<00:01:09.170> gravel<00:01:09.680> on<00:01:09.830> twisting

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.880 

we<00:01:48.880> have<00:01:49.060> all<00:01:49.330> our<00:01:49.390> advantage<00:01:49.990> one<00:01:50.620> of<00:01:50.770> those

we have all our advantage one of those

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.130 
we have all our advantage one of those
ones<00:01:51.190> is<00:01:51.400> the<00:01:51.430> system<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.270> inflate<00:01:52.870> and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
ones is the system to inflate and

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.790 
ones is the system to inflate and
deflate<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:54.670> tires<00:01:54.940> from<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:56.020> inside<00:01:56.380> that

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
deflate the tires from the inside that

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.850 
deflate the tires from the inside that
is<00:01:57.010> the<00:01:57.370> job<00:01:57.610> from<00:01:57.940> from<00:01:58.900> t-mo<00:01:59.140> maybe<00:01:59.470> you<00:01:59.650> can

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
is the job from from t-mo maybe you can

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.410 
is the job from from t-mo maybe you can
explain<00:01:59.980> a<00:02:00.220> little<00:02:00.460> bit<00:02:00.610> more<00:02:00.820> how<00:02:01.060> does<00:02:01.270> it

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
explain a little bit more how does it

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.660 
explain a little bit more how does it
work<00:02:01.630> it's<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.410> quite<00:02:02.800> nice<00:02:03.010> system<00:02:03.430> so<00:02:03.610> you

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
work it's a quite nice system so you

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.340 
work it's a quite nice system so you
don't<00:02:03.880> need<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.060> stop<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:04.750> reduce<00:02:05.050> tire

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
don't need to stop it to reduce tire

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.160 
don't need to stop it to reduce tire
pressure<00:02:06.150> because<00:02:07.150> you<00:02:07.330> place<00:02:07.600> we<00:02:07.750> can<00:02:07.900> do<00:02:08.050> it

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
pressure because you place we can do it

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.230 
pressure because you place we can do it
from<00:02:08.350> inside<00:02:08.380> while<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.460> are<00:02:09.580> driving<00:02:09.700> so<00:02:10.149> you

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
from inside while you are driving so you

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.500 
from inside while you are driving so you
don't<00:02:10.479> lose<00:02:10.660> any<00:02:10.899> time

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510
