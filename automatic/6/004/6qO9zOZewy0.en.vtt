00:00:02.898 --> 00:00:10.703
 Because this Sunday, all eyes on the WWE Universe, will be facing the Royal Rumble. 

00:00:10.703 --> 00:00:18.178
 This Sunday in Phoenix Arizona or watching at home the world will know what I already know. 

00:00:18.178 --> 00:00:26.363
 This Sunday I'm going to win the Royal Rumble! 

00:00:26.363 --> 00:00:33.971
 John, I have to say, partner, this was a very bizarre, creative and passionate disciple. 

00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:40.562
 But I think you're wrong, partner. Because the man who will win the Royal Rumble this year, 

00:00:40.562 --> 00:00:42.904
 is the same as last year. 

00:00:42.904 --> 00:00:47.188
 It will be a simple case of deja vu, because I will ... 

00:00:48.255 --> 00:00:51.110
 What are you talking about, partner? 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.524
 "I'm here to say we're going to win the Royal Rumble." - And no one has time for that. 

00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:07.702
 I did not come here to dance, or to speak of deja vu, and I could not. 

00:01:07.702 --> 00:01:16.376
 I came here to tell everyone that you are looking at the man who will win the Royal Rumble. 

00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:34.974
 I'll be short and thick. I'm going to win the Royal Rumble, 

00:01:34.974 --> 00:01:45.225
 and I'll be in the main event of Wrestlemania again because I'm The Miz, and I'm ... 

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:56.018
 Can you believe all those people talking about who will win the Royal Rumble match? 

00:01:56.018 --> 00:02:05.150
 I was thinking about it too, that's irrelevant, since everyone knows I'm going to win the Royal Rumble. 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.384
 No, I'm going to win. 

00:02:07.384 --> 00:02:08.954
 - I'll. - I'll. 

00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:09.875
 - I'll. - I'll. 

00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:10.737
 - I'll. - I'll. 

00:02:10.737 --> 00:02:12.236
 - I'll. - I'll. 

00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:28.474
 You're all wrong, because United States Champion Antonio Cesaro will win the Royal Rumble. 

00:02:28.474 --> 00:02:38.458
 And I want you to know that I'm going to dedicate my victory this Sunday to my house when I'm not at home, 

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:43.231
 the USA. 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:08.451
 Do you really think that you will win the Royal Rumble? 

00:03:08.451 --> 00:03:16.774
 You may just be delirious, but it's worth it. 

00:03:16.774 --> 00:03:25.870
 A 3MB member will record his name in the story after winning the Royal Rumble. 

00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:32.976
 The question is: What do you think of that, baby? 

00:03:33.664 --> 00:03:36.638
 - Wait a minute, look! - Here we go! 

00:03:37.044 --> 00:03:39.997
 Fighters who will be at the Royal Rumble right here ... 

00:03:40.398 --> 00:03:46.078
 This is not the Royal Rumble, but that's what we'll have in the future. 

00:03:46.078 --> 00:03:49.680
 It's a preview of the Royal Rumble here on Monday Night Raw. 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.088
 All those fighters in a big mess here in San Jose. 

00:03:55.088 --> 00:04:03.439
 And we've talked before, all the fighters who enter the Royal Rumble, find and feel deep in their hearts, 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:05.449
 that they will win the bout. 

00:04:05.782 --> 00:04:09.634
 It's each for you at Royal Rumble, it's like it happened now. 

00:04:09.634 --> 00:04:13.169
 You are eliminated as you pass the highest rope and your feet touch the ground. 

00:04:13.574 --> 00:04:16.596
 It's going to be like this on Sunday during the Royal Rumble. 

00:04:16.596 --> 00:04:19.793
 - It's people everywhere. - Men being thrown all over the place. 

00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:31.231
 Fighters being thrown all over the place. 

00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:34.310
 It is each for itself. 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:42.116
 The main event at Wrestlemania will go to the winner of the Royal Rumble.
