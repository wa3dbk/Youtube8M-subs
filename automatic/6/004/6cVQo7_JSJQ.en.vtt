00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.870
 ask them what they would do in the case of 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.969
 that they come to offer a position 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.710

 say a raquetazo in the congress 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.710

 thinking about it then logan I tell you in case 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.310
 interesting could be for example if 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.590
 you want to scare away the rats 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.179
 congress that best of a lioness 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.299

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.299
 cat 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:56.659

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.890
 Leona doing dressed like not 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.340
 I can stop imagining short but a 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.340
 minimum 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.210
 alejandro vos is a guy that now good 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.130
 you are hitting very hard in the 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.720
 television with everything with your programs and 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.790
 surely good with all the acceptance 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.810
 what do you have with people I imagine that you 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.090
 They will have made a proposal to 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.880
 politicians did you ever think to go into 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.520
 politics or doing something in politics 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.650
 proposals yes several and at the time 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.540
 it had happened to me to be able to do something in 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.040
 holy faith but you know how you get in but 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.480
 you never know how you go out is preferable 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.760
 follow what you do and not get involved 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.800
 in water difficult to get out of position if you go out 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.780
 you go bankrupt liquidated the truth that 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.060
 I was thinking, I say Alejandro in the 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.800
 policy that slogan could have could 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.740
 be for example honesty seriousness 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.630
 mines alejandro fantino if it is a 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.100
 interesting proposal I tell you something 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.480
 have come a lot of politicians from 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.430
 loose animals now when the 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.500
 ass of the gallardo all type is finished 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.480
 of ideology you saw what the crow said 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.460
 larroque in narcos socialismo bueno 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.870
 we would be a social ass and I 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.460
 I imagine in the room a quorum is missing 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.170
 stay calm call another is a 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.060
 collective of mine us to the record 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.890
 postcard raises the hand by on the key 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.020
 press the button to you it fits some 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.840
 doubt that we bring 45 asses of those 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.939
 patriotic 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.519
 that would be no more the suitcase of 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:21.680
 senate would be the asses of the cenacle of 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.090
 senate vote this law and you are going to have 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.290
 what a flower of quilombo because 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.450
 suitcases will not talk and the girls 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.280
 these speak I see you so you think 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.870
 that this note is one more note for me not 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.030
 I know nothing else when I do my campaign 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.769
 politics in holy faith I will help a lot 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.540
 dark the noise to the truck the motorbikes of 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:39.200
 the boys 16 are in total 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.079
 then he was right the bullshit is 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.810
 with us we are winners 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.670
 now you must seriously think about getting 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.060
 the government 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.829
 I do not know 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.870
 have you ever thought about introducing 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.510
 political office or maybe some politician 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.260
 who offered to have some charge 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:02.709
 politician who offers you something 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.709
 politician 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.270
 think about presenting me with a political position 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.040
 the idea that the bed can rice and 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.660
 we say you had to push for a law 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.310
 what would you like the 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.310
 argentina equalization of buenos aires or 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.900
 something that from direct panelists has to 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.090
 be drivers and noteros to 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.980
 nonstop drivers pointed 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.120
 but they are helping the country to the people 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:29.010
 because the dew soul policy is 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.780
 wants to benefit first and good in addition 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.210
 I believe that your role that we have fulfilled 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.780
 that society is perfect dew sos 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.640
 crack in yours do not change that 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.810
 is the panelist could be worse 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.910
 politics and much worse as walking well 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.070
 very well you are here in this event of 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.350
 Tiger an event that helps a little 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.300
 municipality a somewhat politicized event 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.860
 in part how we see you with politics 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.440
 what relationships with this policy 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.060
 in this life the issue goes through the 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.710
 partisanship or not have you ever been 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.040
 offered to do politics or be in some 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.040
 Market Stall 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:10.400
 but if you get to introduce me 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.470
 happens for example to violence close 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.510
 of the contribution to corrupt politicians 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:20.380
 close the contribution to insecurity 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:23.180
 closing of the contribution the closing of the trousers 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:27.370
 for example, modify with another 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.370
 I could say no to tongo if to the thong 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
 above 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.650
 on the river bank you can turn off two 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.650
 cameras because it was frosty 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.690
 eye I loved you after you bandaged me 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.130
 the video that you post on some page 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.050
 where you were interested in politics maybe 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.850
 do things for people a job 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.070
 politician have you ever been called to 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.410
 do something they have never called me to 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.490
 to do nothing, it never interested me either 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.590
 yes 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.849
 to do things for the other if we went to 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.500
 see what he was thinking yoshimar no longer 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:10.940
 you want to launch a candidacy was 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.340
 thinking the slogan for example could 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.380
 be if you're tired that politicians 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:21.289
 give it to you at least vote more fachero 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:24.229

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:36.349
 little bit of subject I would like to ask you 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.090

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:43.039
 very much attention to see if you can not 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:45.560
 explain this I always do not know if we can 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:49.849
 say clearly but clarion is clear 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:53.319

 published under the theme that Marian will 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:03.400
 it's like having a special touch 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:11.620
 really 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:15.710
 that if you see it is not a hurricane 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:19.670
 that an aroma never eclipses the sun 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:27.160
