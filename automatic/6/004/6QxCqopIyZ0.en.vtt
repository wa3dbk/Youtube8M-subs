00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.599
 and it always has a video for you 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.710
 simply explains how 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.650
 pass a migration 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.460
 because I noticed that by selling 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.260
 my turkey buddies 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.119
 some people were a little 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
 lost at that level so here I go 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.900
 explain everything you need to know 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.109
 also that she stuff choose for her 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.590
 character to have a maximum pod 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.730
 because when we buy 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.090
 resources in match times we miss 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.550
 a little pop to go back then times 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.710
 teeth in the service 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.129
 so here to migrate it costs 9000 to 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.160
 green and you can gray me one 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.570
 monthly and cons so by 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.860
 example if you have for example on a 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.899
 other server to buy such or 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.910
 such thing you go there you have to create 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.350
 another bubble on another account for 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.090
 come back the next week 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.019
 or wait a month usually have 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.330
 recreated a mule to be able to return 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.939
 so to know that when you go to me 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.290
 create your bank is not transferred 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.250
 for those who migrate 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.409
 definitive other than trade there is that 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.659
 your inventory and your inventory of 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.189
 dragodinde your less merchants all 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.100
 what you have about the character who 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.930
 and transferred to the present terminal 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.850
 in your workbench at 6 and taiwan equipped 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.710
 are transferred to the camas have transferred 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.960
 the equipped objects are transferred 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.119
 your inventory and transfer the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.799
 thomas certifications automatically 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.329
 banked and like this 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.159
 elio of the servers they are not 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.200
 transferred so think about selling them 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.420
 your bank is not transferred because 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.780
 it is there because it is related to 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.200
 servers which means dragodindes 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.119
 who are in certificates as has by 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.549
 example if I migrate all these 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.380
 Dragoturkey they will be destroyed 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.540
 will land in my bank but if I have 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.890
 no other characters to create on 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.829
 server with this tale they will be 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.170
 destroyed and to migrate its dragodinde 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.329
 you have to put them in step I you 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.330
 showed where is what they are doing 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.500
 very little breeding 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.610
 you just have to put your 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.190
 give here in the tables that's what 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.770
 will allow you to keep them 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.710
 on our server so you are limited 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:26.150
 at 250 and a dragodinde by transfer 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.470
 so 259 plus one that team and so 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.510
 for those who give a lot of friends 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.260
 I advise you a strap of stats 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.970
 say it's simple stadiums says this 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.090
 are the emeralds something where the 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.660
 plums something that are at 6100 pod 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.610
 maximum and could fill it with 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.270
 resources or else so here we go 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:50.330
 to put 6100 friend already more 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:53.150
 it takes for in order to be able to 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.070
 how is it called to migrate times from 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.580
 level 21 so suddenly I connected a 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.560
 mule 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.800
 I prepared the migration stuff 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.190
 on top of it we go right away 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.190
 see together 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.220
 I hope I am not mistaken 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.770
 person a red 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.930
 it seems to me that no no no no 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.110
 am not deceived 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.130
 the joy features that I do not know 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.690
 not everything goes up to me I want to do 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.530
 bushing boost 26 but hey it's not 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.430
 necessarily climb pod computation for 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.239
 the character 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.090
 he advises you care Saturday night yop 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:35.239
 for the landing force it's the 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.709
 best classes and you put everything 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.690
 in force to see friends because a 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.670
 force gives five buddies that you know 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.489
 maybe not all so there I have everything 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.880
 stuff that is I think it's not 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.140
 necessarily more optimized but not bad 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.180
 with just family and you put 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.440
 a village that gives for example 1100 pod 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.769
 so that makes you over 1100 plus the 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.820
 mates of the monkland character arrives at 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:04.100
 2416 oups over 1400 we will say that 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.160
 you can see 9600 pod for 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.269
 transfer so this is a boot him you 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.920
 can dawn to loud if you 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.860
 want a red belt all that 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.920
 give 500 pod a bag of the little adventurer 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.419
 it can even go up to 202 rings 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.570
 fortifying and 22 strength 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.240
 I think it can be 27 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.350
 a blade of horses on karni exists 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.760
 two clinch that are better but 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.490
 the conditions are not necessarily 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.820
 optimal whose cola to a moving cap 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.350
 all obviously 50 force and a china 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.740
 chami who gives strength 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.230
 which is not bad either so here 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.170
 and you can also if you miss 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.970
 really pod and you have a big 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:47.920
 bnf to do on you can you 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:50.320
 buy auction houses bakers 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.030
 a candy that gives 50 strong I do not know 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.580
 if one who gives without strength does not seem 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.230
 not ready we may have it gives 100 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.230
 strong I know more exactly 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:08.050
 then no it happens without power 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:11.100
 I can not see it but I'm sure 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.360
 that sweets then they are open there 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.000
 no it's not the pralines we have them 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.950
 Frogs are thus gives 50 strength that you 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.670
 makes fifty 250 pod 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:25.570
 in addition what is sometimes necessary this 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:30.160
 I have already used it and I 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:37.780
 believe that lollipops I believe 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:39.820
 that she gives we will test together to 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.310
 give how much 50 strong is not so much 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.860
 to take a lollipop in fact I think not 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.880
 we can cumulate a candy so 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.800
 here you can take a lollipop 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.300
 that will give you 50 strong - are the 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.250
 secrets that 6000 cases me blow that you 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.940
 makes more pod 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:58.690
 which is not a refusal either huh 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:01.510
 suddenly wait I calculate and suddenly 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:07.420
 6100 there one of over 1100 the familiar 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:08.650
 over 3200 we even reach the 10400 all 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.310
 at the time it was not taken into account the 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.900
 bumper age 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.650
 unfortunately this level there can not be 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:18.820
 not put two trophies of the coup 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.080
 all these boxes are empty at the very least 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.520
 really there are very very few 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.919
 people who could afford that 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:28.100
 if you have planned to migrate not 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.930
 definitely but temporarily with 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.430
 a mule and you have to go back to 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.710
 unless you do not use manes 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.430
 axis is the only one of the office that you 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.960
 will give pod 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.419
 but hey it's really for cases 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.850
 extremes I doubt that you are interested 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:46.509
 for those who watch the video in all 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:49.400
 case so here I hope that this little 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:51.199
 video I taste anchored 9000 is not 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.780
 excessive no this cost of 7 million there 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:55.250
 the 7 million back so 14 million 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.720
 migration on certain items you 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.639
 can you make 4 5 million dollars 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.810
 it depends after me I do not know 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.260
 too must turn to the 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.270
 people doing the most 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.760
 So that's all for this little girl 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.229
 video to help you transfer your 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.699
 characters because I noticed that 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:11.300
 you have some people had 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:13.490
 need 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.110
 during migrations, in particular for 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.130
 dragonnades so on this one I 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.130
 soon for us to go
