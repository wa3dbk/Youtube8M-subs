here's<00:00:01.199> a<00:00:01.260> question<00:00:01.650> we<00:00:01.770> all<00:00:01.920> need<00:00:02.280> answered

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
here's a question we all need answered

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.360 
here's a question we all need answered
how<00:00:03.120> do<00:00:03.179> lifestyle<00:00:03.899> changes<00:00:04.529> affect<00:00:05.069> cancer

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
how do lifestyle changes affect cancer

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.780 
how do lifestyle changes affect cancer
remission<00:00:06.020> starting<00:00:07.020> with<00:00:07.140> dietary<00:00:07.790> well

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.419 
remission starting with dietary well
diet<00:00:09.120> plays<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.480> such<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.080> crucial<00:00:10.620> role<00:00:10.800> because

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
diet plays a such a crucial role because

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.079 
diet plays a such a crucial role because
you<00:00:12.150> depend<00:00:12.690> on<00:00:13.130> nutrients<00:00:14.130> these<00:00:14.790> are<00:00:14.969> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
you depend on nutrients these are the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.029 
you depend on nutrients these are the
nutrients<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.839> you're<00:00:16.020> not<00:00:16.230> deriving<00:00:16.650> from

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
nutrients that you're not deriving from

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.429 
nutrients that you're not deriving from
the<00:00:17.250> air<00:00:17.430> even<00:00:18.180> though<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.600> air<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.230> the

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
the air even though the air is the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.010 
the air even though the air is the
biggest<00:00:19.890> supply<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.490> nutrients<00:00:21.090> people<00:00:21.840> don't

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
biggest supply of nutrients people don't

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.080 
biggest supply of nutrients people don't
even<00:00:22.199> think<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.619> way<00:00:22.890> well<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.670> air<00:00:23.850> is

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
even think that way well the air is

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.009 
even think that way well the air is
comprised<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.320> carbon<00:00:26.160> oxygen<00:00:26.640> hydrogen<00:00:27.269> and

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
comprised of carbon oxygen hydrogen and

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.529 
comprised of carbon oxygen hydrogen and
nitrogen<00:00:28.230> now<00:00:29.220> these<00:00:29.369> four<00:00:29.670> molecules<00:00:30.210> make

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
nitrogen now these four molecules make

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.780 
nitrogen now these four molecules make
up<00:00:30.750> all<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.380> vegetation<00:00:32.040> all<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.550> things

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
up all the vegetation all the things

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.080 
up all the vegetation all the things
that<00:00:33.000> we<00:00:33.180> eat<00:00:33.210> ER<00:00:33.840> if<00:00:34.020> you're<00:00:34.290> vegetarian<00:00:34.640> so<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
that we eat ER if you're vegetarian so a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.799 
that we eat ER if you're vegetarian so a
plant<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:37.380> avocado<00:00:37.890> has<00:00:38.790> some<00:00:39.090> protein<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.660> it

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
plant in avocado has some protein in it

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.630 
plant in avocado has some protein in it
so<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.140> carbon<00:00:40.530> oxygen<00:00:40.860> hydrogen<00:00:41.040> and

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
so it's carbon oxygen hydrogen and

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.330 
so it's carbon oxygen hydrogen and
nitrogen<00:00:42.110> typical<00:00:43.110> carbohydrates<00:00:43.890> carbon

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
nitrogen typical carbohydrates carbon

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.590 
nitrogen typical carbohydrates carbon
oxygen<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.969> hydrogen

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
oxygen and hydrogen

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.619 
oxygen and hydrogen
so<00:00:46.050> they<00:00:46.350> combine<00:00:46.950> they<00:00:47.700> are<00:00:47.820> literally<00:00:48.090> taken

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
so they combine they are literally taken

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.229 
so they combine they are literally taken
from<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.989> air<00:00:49.200> they<00:00:49.829> are<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> presence<00:00:51.149> of

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
from the air they are in the presence of

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.750 
from the air they are in the presence of
sunlight<00:00:51.480> converted<00:00:52.289> into<00:00:52.760> carbohydrates

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
sunlight converted into carbohydrates

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.869 
sunlight converted into carbohydrates
which<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.180> eat<00:00:54.410> and<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.620> get<00:00:55.829> some<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.699> know

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
which you eat and you get some you know

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.299 
which you eat and you get some you know
nutrients<00:00:57.629> or<00:00:57.809> some<00:00:58.020> minerals<00:00:58.469> from<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> soil

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
nutrients or some minerals from the soil

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.939 
nutrients or some minerals from the soil
but<00:00:59.969> that's<00:01:00.180> about<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.350> most<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
but that's about it so most of the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.500 
but that's about it so most of the
nutrients<00:01:02.340> come<00:01:02.579> from<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.879> air<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.480> breathe

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
nutrients come from the air we breathe

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.960 
nutrients come from the air we breathe
in<00:01:04.170> carbon<00:01:04.619> oxygen<00:01:05.070> hydrogen<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.850> nitrogen

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
in carbon oxygen hydrogen and nitrogen

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.850 
in carbon oxygen hydrogen and nitrogen
and<00:01:06.540> our<00:01:07.229> body<00:01:07.500> converts<00:01:08.040> those<00:01:08.340> into

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
and our body converts those into

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.219 
and our body converts those into
proteins<00:01:10.860> amino<00:01:11.430> acids<00:01:12.060> okay<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.479> every<00:01:12.960> amino

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
proteins amino acids okay so every amino

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.770 
proteins amino acids okay so every amino
acid<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.830> made<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.189> these<00:01:14.369> four<00:01:14.640> molecules<00:01:15.210> so

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
acid is made of these four molecules so

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.410 
acid is made of these four molecules so
our<00:01:16.140> body<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.710> mostly<00:01:17.450> protein<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:19.100> water

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
our body is mostly protein and water

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.289 
our body is mostly protein and water
okay<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.450> when<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.320> make<00:01:22.560> our<00:01:22.830> protein<00:01:23.369> we

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
okay so when we make our protein we

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.539 
okay so when we make our protein we
don't<00:01:24.509> need<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.930> eat<00:01:25.110> protein<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.950> example<00:01:25.979> we

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
don't need to eat protein for example we

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.060 
don't need to eat protein for example we
make<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.119> literally<00:01:27.780> by<00:01:28.110> breathing<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.740> air

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
make it literally by breathing in air

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.120 
make it literally by breathing in air
that's<00:01:30.030> why<00:01:30.210> I've<00:01:30.420> not<00:01:30.659> eaten<00:01:30.840> protein<00:01:31.380> for<00:01:31.680> 35

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
that's why I've not eaten protein for 35

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.340 
that's why I've not eaten protein for 35
years<00:01:32.159> I'm<00:01:32.579> still<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.090> okay<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:33.990> you're

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
years I'm still here okay so you're

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.200 
years I'm still here okay so you're
saying<00:01:34.530> that's<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.950> big<00:01:35.159> dietary<00:01:35.700> change<00:01:36.000> right

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
saying that's a big dietary change right

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.140 
saying that's a big dietary change right
big<00:01:36.390> big<00:01:36.840> one<00:01:37.049> that's<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.890> huge<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.430> because

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
big big one that's a huge one because

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.890 
big big one that's a huge one because
there's<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.930> study<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
there's a study the

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.290 
there's a study the
it's<00:01:42.900> called<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.620> China<00:01:43.890> Study<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.970> there

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
it's called the China Study and there

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.190 
it's called the China Study and there
are<00:01:45.390> many<00:01:45.630> many<00:01:45.900> studies<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.380> show<00:01:47.370> that<00:01:48.200> not

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
are many many studies that show that not

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.460 
are many many studies that show that not
eating<00:01:49.440> meat<00:01:50.160> your<00:01:51.030> animal<00:01:51.690> products<00:01:52.320> or

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
eating meat your animal products or

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.360 
eating meat your animal products or
animal<00:01:52.590> proteins<00:01:53.370> will<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:55.230> reduce<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.980> risk

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
animal proteins will you reduce the risk

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.820 
animal proteins will you reduce the risk
of<00:01:56.490> cancer<00:01:56.760> dramatically<00:01:57.720> there<00:01:58.170> are<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.680> many

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
of cancer dramatically there are so many

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.810 
of cancer dramatically there are so many
studies<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.850> have<00:01:59.880> been<00:02:00.480> for<00:02:00.840> decades<00:02:01.740> now<00:02:02.010> so

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
studies you have been for decades now so

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.980 
studies you have been for decades now so
it's<00:02:03.150> not<00:02:03.360> something<00:02:03.900> that<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.530> make<00:02:04.920> up<00:02:05.990> it's

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
it's not something that I make up it's

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.840 
it's not something that I make up it's
written<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.530> my<00:02:07.740> book<00:02:07.770> now<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.399> can<00:02:08.580> see<00:02:08.760> the

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
written in my book now you can see the

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.150 
written in my book now you can see the
references<00:02:09.420> they<00:02:10.320> are<00:02:10.380> all<00:02:10.590> there

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
references they are all there

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.700 
references they are all there
so<00:02:11.610> diet<00:02:12.060> plays<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.450> huge<00:02:12.780> role<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.380> now<00:02:13.530> with

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
so diet plays a huge role and now with

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.080 
so diet plays a huge role and now with
the<00:02:13.830> new<00:02:13.860> study<00:02:14.310> from<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.580> National

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
the new study from the National

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.750 
the new study from the National
Institute<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.510> cancer<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.580> 550,000<00:02:17.580> people

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
Institute of cancer and 550,000 people

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.590 
Institute of cancer and 550,000 people
showed<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.800> risk<00:02:20.459> of<00:02:20.640> dying<00:02:20.910> from<00:02:21.060> any

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
showed that the risk of dying from any

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.320 
showed that the risk of dying from any
kind<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.260> disease<00:02:22.590> by<00:02:22.800> not<00:02:23.010> eating<00:02:23.370> meat<00:02:23.610> here

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
kind of disease by not eating meat here

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.620 
kind of disease by not eating meat here
is<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:25.260> know<00:02:25.320> dramatically<00:02:26.310> lower<00:02:26.670> than<00:02:27.390> the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
is you know dramatically lower than the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.170 
is you know dramatically lower than the
people<00:02:27.840> who<00:02:27.990> eat<00:02:28.080> like<00:02:28.530> 25<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.430> 20<00:02:29.790> percent

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
people who eat like 25 to 20 percent

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.720 
people who eat like 25 to 20 percent
increased<00:02:30.840> risk<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:31.290> dying<00:02:31.530> from<00:02:31.800> cancer<00:02:32.400> or

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
increased risk of dying from cancer or

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.120 
increased risk of dying from cancer or
heart<00:02:32.880> disease<00:02:33.000> or<00:02:33.390> other<00:02:33.510> illnesses<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.830> diet

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
heart disease or other illnesses so diet

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.390 
heart disease or other illnesses so diet
plays<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> huge<00:02:35.670> role<00:02:36.060> when<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:37.230> eat<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:38.160> meal

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
plays a huge role when you eat the meal

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.610 
plays a huge role when you eat the meal
times<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.480> eat<00:02:39.660> your<00:02:39.840> biggest<00:02:40.200> meal<00:02:40.410> in

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
times if you eat your biggest meal in

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.160 
times if you eat your biggest meal in
the<00:02:40.770> evening<00:02:41.340> like<00:02:41.700> most<00:02:42.000> people<00:02:42.450> nowadays<00:02:42.630> do

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
the evening like most people nowadays do

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.920 
the evening like most people nowadays do
because<00:02:43.620> it's<00:02:43.770> convenient<00:02:44.360> they<00:02:45.360> clock<00:02:45.720> up

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
because it's convenient they clock up

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.320 
because it's convenient they clock up
their<00:02:46.140> gastrointestinal<00:02:46.800> tract<00:02:47.430> they<00:02:48.030> have<00:02:48.300> a

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
their gastrointestinal tract they have a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.020 
their gastrointestinal tract they have a
lot<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.920> decomposing<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.070> decomposed<00:02:50.400> foods

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
lot of decomposing and decomposed foods

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.060 
lot of decomposing and decomposed foods
in<00:02:51.300> their<00:02:51.450> intestines<00:02:51.750> rotting<00:02:52.410> foods<00:02:52.800> that

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
in their intestines rotting foods that

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.520 
in their intestines rotting foods that
then<00:02:53.610> become<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.120> source<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.660> poisoning<00:02:55.290> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
then become a source of poisoning the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.340 
then become a source of poisoning the
body<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:56.430> again<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.880> have<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.320> cause<00:02:58.320> of

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
body and again you have the cause of

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.750 
body and again you have the cause of
cancer<00:02:59.510> eating<00:03:00.709> your<00:03:01.709> sweet<00:03:02.070> foods<00:03:02.430> you

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
cancer eating your sweet foods you

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.820 
cancer eating your sweet foods you
sugary<00:03:03.120> foods<00:03:03.480> processed<00:03:04.140> foods<00:03:04.410> highly

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
sugary foods processed foods highly

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.610 
sugary foods processed foods highly
refined<00:03:05.220> foods<00:03:05.690> sugar<00:03:06.690> itself<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.410> now

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
refined foods sugar itself is now

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.610 
refined foods sugar itself is now
recognized<00:03:08.370> as<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.640> cancer<00:03:09.120> producing<00:03:09.630> food<00:03:09.900> so

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
recognized as a cancer producing food so

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.410 
recognized as a cancer producing food so
because<00:03:11.070> it<00:03:11.190> shuts<00:03:11.370> down<00:03:11.519> that<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.120> immune

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
because it shuts down that the immune

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.470 
because it shuts down that the immune
system<00:03:12.920> literally<00:03:13.920> shuts<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:14.670> down<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.269> lot

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
system literally shuts it down so a lot

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.020 
system literally shuts it down so a lot
of<00:03:15.510> kids<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:16.200> lot<00:03:16.410> of<00:03:16.530> children<00:03:17.040> develop

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
of kids a lot of children develop

kinds of junk food or they are their

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.580 
kinds of junk food or they are their
least<00:03:38.940> put<00:03:39.180> sugar<00:03:39.420> in<00:03:39.660> baby<00:03:40.049> food

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
least put sugar in baby food

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.140 
least put sugar in baby food
thank<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.040> doing<00:03:41.489> that<00:03:41.640> but<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:41.850> probably

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
thank you doing that but you probably

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.470 
thank you doing that but you probably
put<00:03:42.690> high<00:03:43.350> fructose<00:03:43.709> corn<00:03:44.010> syrup<00:03:44.370> in<00:03:44.760> yes<00:03:45.180> yeah

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
put high fructose corn syrup in yes yeah

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.199 
put high fructose corn syrup in yes yeah
refined<00:03:45.959> sugars<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.769> again<00:03:47.130> they<00:03:47.730> go<00:03:47.940> right

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
refined sugars and again they go right

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.210 
refined sugars and again they go right
into<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.780> bloodstream<00:03:49.019> from<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.800> stomach

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
into the bloodstream from the stomach

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.330 
into the bloodstream from the stomach
and<00:03:50.760> the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
and the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.300 
and the
you<00:03:51.690> produce<00:03:52.690> insulin<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.590> insulin<00:03:53.709> when<00:03:54.220> you

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
you produce insulin and insulin when you

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.490 
you produce insulin and insulin when you
make<00:03:54.459> much<00:03:54.730> insulin<00:03:55.269> you<00:03:55.959> are<00:03:56.140> putting

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
make much insulin you are putting

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.920 
make much insulin you are putting
yourself<00:03:56.860> at<00:03:57.069> big-time<00:03:57.670> at<00:03:58.000> risk<00:03:58.330> for<00:03:58.720> cancer

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
yourself at big-time at risk for cancer

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.380 
yourself at big-time at risk for cancer
because<00:03:59.769> insulin<00:04:00.310> is<00:04:00.670> a<00:04:00.700> cancer<00:04:01.209> producing

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
because insulin is a cancer producing

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.890 
because insulin is a cancer producing
hormone<00:04:02.200> if<00:04:02.470> you<00:04:02.620> make<00:04:02.830> too<00:04:03.010> much<00:04:03.220> so<00:04:04.090> that's

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
hormone if you make too much so that's

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.500 
hormone if you make too much so that's
why<00:04:05.290> there<00:04:05.709> are<00:04:05.920> so<00:04:06.250> many<00:04:06.370> cancers<00:04:07.060> when

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
why there are so many cancers when

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.470 
why there are so many cancers when
people<00:04:07.930> do<00:04:08.500> it<00:04:08.590> with<00:04:08.799> refined<00:04:09.610> carbohydrates

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
people do it with refined carbohydrates

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.309 
people do it with refined carbohydrates
like<00:04:11.349> flour<00:04:11.920> you<00:04:12.430> know<00:04:12.519> yes<00:04:13.000> are<00:04:13.299> your<00:04:13.780> white

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
like flour you know yes are your white

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.710 
like flour you know yes are your white
flour<00:04:14.650> products<00:04:15.280> which<00:04:15.849> also<00:04:16.239> have<00:04:16.389> so<00:04:16.600> many

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
flour products which also have so many

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.349 
flour products which also have so many
chemicals<00:04:17.410> in<00:04:17.560> them<00:04:17.769> they're<00:04:17.949> more<00:04:18.359> 95

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
chemicals in them they're more 95

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.200 
chemicals in them they're more 95
chemicals<00:04:20.109> now<00:04:20.320> in<00:04:20.530> white<00:04:20.769> flour<00:04:21.070> so<00:04:21.910> it's

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
chemicals now in white flour so it's
