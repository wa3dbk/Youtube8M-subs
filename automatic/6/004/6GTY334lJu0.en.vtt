00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.089
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.679
 unboxing video by arielle the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:14.040
 mermaid the collector's edition where 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.000
 all three parts of ariel on both 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.460
 are united 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.570
 in another video I have too 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:27.090
 already the single diamond edition of 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:30.900
 the little mermaid presented with 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:35.219
 the slipcase and so on and here you go 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:39.809
 it's about the collector's edition now 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:43.440
 first to the cover here looks ariel 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.610
 a bit different with a little more 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:51.690
 make-up I find here on the diamond 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.180
 they actually print a copy 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:01.230
 better from that we have to constantly then one 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.820
 bit artistic and that is 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.330
 well done, here it is 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.100
 that on the slipcase not that vsk logo 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.950
 printed on it but that's one 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.799
 super sticker is there as well 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.210
 on the packaging then another 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.950
 sticker strictly limited with 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.400
 background information and pages there are 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.990
 now for the emergence of ariel only this 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:33.150
 no disney blu ray toro is 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:36.860
 then imprinted a website as well 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.860
 you actually see it on the shelf 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.200
 we once money supply woman 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.630
 once from now on two longing for the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.630
 sea ​​and once arjen woman chooses one 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:56.490
 looks a bit illogical because you're here 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.530
 might get the feeling well so then 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.170
 they are apparently the individual 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.790
 airways the discs in there 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.170
 up here it was as if then so the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.170
 Gates 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.310
 be there 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.310
 but it's not the case so behind 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.780
 on it again all the descriptions 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:24.989
 all the mermaid and the wife to 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:28.480
 first time for ray 3d discs in total 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.930
 also very nice here is the first one 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.959
 organization of the first film with 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:41.760
 it is lenovo is general to 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.760
 technical data and services extras 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:53.140
 and then we come to the inner life here 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:57.280
 you can see the slipcase again and here 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:05.620
 Now you can see that it is a little book 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:07.299
 acts as the exclusive castle that you 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.870
 Do not even mess with it 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:14.650
 Designation from the disney masterpiece 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:21.940
 if you have it all up we have 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:24.220
 that's the first time it's like that 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.390
 that you press on it in the middle 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:36.700
 and we trigger and discreet 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:39.970
 background shows that and here 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.049
 we come to the special feature that is 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.049
 here several pages 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.660
 and they can be good throughout 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:57.160
 first a bit of text to the emergence 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.000
 by ariel what the artists did that 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:04.690
 to have 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:07.950
 to the music and so on then comes throw 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.950
 drawings by ariel 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.000

00:04:42.909 --> 00:05:06.339

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:15.969
 King 2 is there then by Ursula only 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:20.050
 a lonely way of god i know 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:23.279
 the hot percent estimate that the 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.279
 movie brings manager see 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.900
 musicians 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:40.419
 and served the two are up 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:48.479
 one is then here to the other films 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:48.479
 on the side then out company 2 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:06:09.210
 and Arielle like everything started mine 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:13.710
 will appear then again the 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:20.099
 description of the films on the back of it 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:22.349
 ever the sketches drawings in the 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:25.340
 time we have the same thing again 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:25.340
 on the slipcase 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:42.190
 yes, in general, that pretty well done 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.920
 book if you wish that that 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.840
 land is still given to other topics 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.260
 would have or maybe only 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.260
 will give 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:59.020
 drawings are very beautiful too 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.950
 thicker paper does not look very thin 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.950
 and father right 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:15.110
 yes the shooter even the lightning again 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.450
 does not have that again somehow 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:24.260
 is just kept more discreet then 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:26.030
 unlike the diamond edition and 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:33.650
 he is not still somewhere then 

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:38.750
 coined or so of course because of 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:42.200
 maybe I have to help too 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:45.310
 I noticed at least there 

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.520
 hold no disney movies &amp; more quotas 

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:50.510
 found 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:52.790
 but actually he is in the disney 

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:56.450
 movies and more catalog also included 

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:59.690
 that's why you have to because then 

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:02.150
 write and say yes I have the 

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.890
 bought theory once the collector's 

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.030
 edition 

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:07.790
 I would like to have the points 

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:10.370
 then you usually get that too 

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:12.200
 Well written it is so that you can 

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.980
 because then the bill again 

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.560
 must send 

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:18.070
 Thank you for watching and have fun 

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.070
 when collecting
