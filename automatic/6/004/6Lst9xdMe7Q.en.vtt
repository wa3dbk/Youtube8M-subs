00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.120
 but it should be no more 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.849
 here if you take and and bend it on 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.500
 body arrows just hands and start it 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.750
 on hit his shank he shouldn't 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.760
 his step should not hit him 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.000
 This is the first neck should not endow 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.000
 and grab the body the noise of his shank for 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.760
 the fact that he did not break it so what if 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.860
 flying it strains turns out 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.380
 a little bit 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.060
 Lenin forest is here there is a runner 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.390
 warps a little bit here in this 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.820
 side here so here and he here this part 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.680
 lower he will strive constantly if 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.310
 he is prone to this and is chosen wrong 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.420
 excessive backlash, he will hit 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.420
 the edge of the shank and will break and 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.540
 what is fraught with what is fraught with 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.880
 sooner or later it can wedge 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:02.320
 inside there will be flacs bully 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.330
 and it will start to jam so well 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.390
 correctly approach and to the choice of runner kati 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.580
 currency in the free chandelier on the body of the arrow 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.530
 and I you when due to all these moments from 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.750
 frequent wedging 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.290
 wedging shank and since i 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.390
 apply 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.910
 very powerful materials on the runners 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.350
 news on the shank usually such 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.510
 valuable titanium shanks themselves 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:32.120
 light titanium runner I apply 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.860
 squirrels without and hydra brake that's for sure 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.400
 same runner but without this hydro 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.670
 a brake 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.970
 but still I checked it necessarily 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.840
 wear on 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:48.040
 I look and I surely look 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.890
 very easy when removed from the roll 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.470
 such pairing mates serve me 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.410
 over the years 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.000
 one of the masters in my understanding 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.160
 probably this is moon for everyone 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.790
 gunsmiths Miroshnichenko Viktor 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.020
 Pavlovich 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:10.360
 he did all his life and does at least 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.860
 As far as I know does pairing 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.600
 shock without a guide tormaz that is to him 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.500
 put and just shock 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:22.160
 squirrel just shock the only thing he 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.280
 on the shank shock parts here 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.620
 makes a chamfer 45 degrees removes and on 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.130
 the shank ah he also chamfer 45 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.700
 degrees or put a hot washer 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.340
 in front 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.819
 if you do the main component 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.439
 shanks make it from brass and 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.909
 a hot puck ahead so 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:46.170
 the impact area will increase 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:48.939
 I also love very much walking in runes and 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.709
 it never had any problems never 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.430
 there was no jamming unlike 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.209
 of application 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.579
 even with good runner materials with 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:02.049
 hydro brake so I am not applying them 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:05.409
 runners wednesday but definitely 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:11.260
 advise not to apply to all can not if 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:13.900
 you are using duralumin cast runner 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.780
 from titanium which is unknown to you titans 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.209
 there are also different buzz words titan she 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.810
 may be labeled in this 10 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.549
 honestly stabbed paper director or 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.700
 like paper is not very easy like duralumin and 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:31.090
 it may be there in this 20 in this 22 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:35.760
 these are very durable hot titans and when 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:40.109
 this light is different things and if 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.650
 shank material unknown or weak 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:46.840
 need applies polyurethanes vdm forex 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.459
 different and you can use hydrating 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.650
 beliefs can use batons 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.680
 soviet 3d gray the only thing i'm talking about 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.349
 said it must look and very 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.599
 choose wisely 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:02.690
 mate check that the slider is on 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:06.660
 Benelux superfluous than correctly went 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:12.210
 collision with a shank means generally 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:16.230
 whole we watched the harpoon until it 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:19.560
 the group is not yet this workpiece with us and 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:23.160
 master cut shank 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:27.110
 made our chosen grandson 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:32.970
 which we will bind 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:35.270
 there is a shank rather there is a beetle with 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.750
 huge angle from either 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.389
 I am a supporter not to make very large angles 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.980
 here to some extent here are some 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.630
 masters make very very big 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.880
 unnecessarily large bend angle in my 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.700
 understanding what this means is that what 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.130
 I am glad is fraught with a flash drive if 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.790
 very powerful big fish coming 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.290
 bending moment this way here 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.169
 bends you here this gang he 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.370
 just turning inside out 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:05.990
 rivet stand on not stand 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:10.440
 here it is the part here this part of the box 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.280
 if he is too bent away from the body 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.800
 brine on 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.460
 here is such here we are 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.340
 Rome and saved shoulder growling stop and with 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.479
 us remains reliable also here 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.650
 Be sure to master Andrei made to me 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.740
 Andrew Clement 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.990
 he has already done at my request under 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.640
 polished here on anyway if 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.740
 this is not done even by the master i this 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.479
 I always do this part myself always and 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.380
 be sure to smooth out the rivets 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:42.810
 Now this part of the whole is all smoothed 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.840
 so that it has the smallest 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.000
 resistance 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:51.030
 still in the future will stand here 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.270
 it's already a bit later fairing so 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.170
 called fairing what it looks like 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.170
 I'll show you now
