00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:08.750
 Very rare 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:10.040
 Exhibition to the amazon make a bid for the goods of Yahoo! Auctions in and is not Cyber is in this video 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:16.039
 Say Then 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:22.310
 There is a method of Yahoo auction research, but this Yahoo auction research is very effective. 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.710
 It is a cyber brain setting method that I want you to practice, but there is one point that you have to be careful with only one 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.650
 There 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.619
 stay 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:36.520
 That is not limited to cd and dvd games, but all products will be targeted 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:38.890
 This time specifically about what you need to be careful with a certain dvd 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.260
 I think I want to talk 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:50.120
 This time kisses my dvd new 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.120
 First of all we will click on a product. 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:01:01.760
 If you do so, the product name is written here, but only this product name bids 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:06.950
 Or if it makes a successful bid, it may misunderstand and stock it. 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:09.980
 I can understand if you slide down to say what it means, but here 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:14.720
 There is a part called product description 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:20.750
 I know that I am looking at here, I'm I'm wrote that imports 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:22.130
 So this product will find that it's overseas copy goods 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:28.100
 initially 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:31.670
 Kedomo to say this imports I'm easy to understand the best if you put it in the product name 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:37.550
 Most sellers have such a description 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:42.080
 This is clearly stated only at the item description 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.930
 Let's look at other exhibitors more easily 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.630
 It is here right now 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.380
 Next look at this 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.150
 I understand that you look at the item description here too 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:59.260
 Here also wrote that imports 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:04.870
 However, in the case of this exhibitor, it is written as a regular version here 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:10.410
 The regular version is originally made in Japan, in the case of this Kisumai 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:16.800
 What is made in Japan is called domestic regular edition 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:21.650
 The possibility of the copy scene is very high because this product is written here with imported products 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:26.670
 Well It is this part to say more 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:32.430
 And Please note the difference between accessories Nasco like 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:38.580
 Ko-yume- chan is not the regular version, so please give me a refund 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:41.580
 If you have specified that please note that even if there is a difference in the specification, such as when you return it 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.410
 It is said this way and it is an escape way 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:50.480
 I am judging that it is making 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:56.150
 A possibility that you will be referred to as would be bad not to confirm it has also changed the imports here 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:58.310
 Because there is also such a product description is very important, so be sure to check 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:04.849
 Please give me 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:12.440
 If you sell such a product at Amazon etc., a complaint comes from you 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:15.040
 Bad ratings will be added and trust will be lost at a stretch . Further Amazon sellers id 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:20.200
 There is also a risk of being deleted 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:27.420
 Therefore, purchasing and selling such copy products is a very dangerous act. 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:32.530
 Because it can be prevented by firmly confirming this product description 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:35.280
 So this is also a product not covered by Cyle 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.230
 Let's look at other products 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.560
 This is writing domestic shipping free shipping 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:46.150
 Try it and click here 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.150
 Take a look at the item description 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:56.250
 In the case of this item, it will be exhibited at a cheap start because it is what I got a friend 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:00.330
 As it is written that it is not overseas shipment 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:06.180
 How to check in this case 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:08.580
 Of course I think that you can understand if you look up to a while ago , but the possibility of copy goods is extremely high 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.530
 It is expensive 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:17.420
 You want to buy and sell products without risk 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:22.460
 Of course, this alone can not be judged 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.660
 In such a case, it is called the information of this exhibitor that I want you to check absolutely 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:32.170
 I will 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:32.170
 As this seller's information evaluation has the evaluation details and so on, click here 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:42.310
 Then there are only 17 very good ratings and 2 very bad ratings 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.950
 Click this details 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:56.360
 I have a bad rating with the same dvd, this comment by this seller 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.040
 I have got a friend in, but the seller is 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.930
 In the seat 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:06.870
 Another overtly copy died and was copy a scene that has become a Intertainment 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:16.320
 We have gotten a bad summoned to say that I 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:19.030
 So, this exhibitor fakes it like a regular product in the form of having this product to a friend 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.110
 Not even overseas shipping 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:27.180
 Write in a dragon style 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:31.960
 As for the escape way, it is not put the word that it is genuine 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:37.840
 I think it's a very malicious seller 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:43.810
 When you research a product and judge by c, there are also such sellers 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:48.930
 Firmly explain the item and the seller's information 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.930
 Please make sure to check these two places 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:57.310
 This is a point to note when purchasing Yahoo! Auctions, so when you are purchasing this video 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.760
 advantage 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:05.680
 Exhibitor Information and Item Description 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:12.100
 I think that you should definitely confirm these two 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:18.470
 By consciously checking two points, your rating will not be worse . 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:23.050
 I think if you can practice consciously to protect you 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.050
 See you next time on the video
