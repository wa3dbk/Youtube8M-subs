00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
the movie on the big screen but I think

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.270 
the movie on the big screen but I think
it<00:02:24.000> would<00:02:24.090> be<00:02:24.150> cool<00:02:24.359> to<00:02:24.420> see<00:02:24.629> it<00:02:24.840> happen<00:02:25.319> on<00:02:25.500> the

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
it would be cool to see it happen on the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.089 
it would be cool to see it happen on the
TV<00:02:26.549> show<00:02:26.579> my<00:02:26.879> only<00:02:27.090> big<00:02:27.959> gripe<00:02:28.439> is<00:02:28.469> that<00:02:28.680> it's

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
TV show my only big gripe is that it's

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.190 
TV show my only big gripe is that it's
like<00:02:29.519> you<00:02:29.730> take<00:02:29.909> about<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.120> movie<00:02:30.659> they<00:02:31.019> could

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
like you take about a movie they could

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.929 
like you take about a movie they could
even<00:02:31.319> get<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.650> CGI<00:02:32.129> right<00:02:32.430> what<00:02:32.639> makes<00:02:32.819> you

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
even get the CGI right what makes you

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.490 
even get the CGI right what makes you
think<00:02:32.969> they're<00:02:33.209> gonna<00:02:33.269> get<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.480> CGI<00:02:33.840> right<00:02:34.170> for

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
think they're gonna get a CGI right for

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.559 
think they're gonna get a CGI right for
