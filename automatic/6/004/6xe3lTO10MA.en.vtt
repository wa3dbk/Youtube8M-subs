of<00:02:17.560> ebay<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.660> mean<00:02:19.930> they're<00:02:20.290> really<00:02:20.530> cheap<00:02:20.740> I

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
of ebay so I mean they're really cheap I

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.830 
of ebay so I mean they're really cheap I
mean<00:02:21.100> you<00:02:21.220> can<00:02:21.310> see<00:02:21.490> them<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.820> price<00:02:22.540> kind<00:02:22.750> of

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
mean you can see them the price kind of

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.900 
mean you can see them the price kind of
fluctuates<00:02:23.320> a<00:02:23.380> little<00:02:23.620> bit<00:02:23.770> when<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:24.700> bid

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.490 
fluctuates a little bit when you bid
usually<00:02:25.330> get<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.480> better<00:02:25.690> deal<00:02:25.960> than<00:02:26.020> if<00:02:26.380> you

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
usually get a better deal than if you

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.930 
usually get a better deal than if you

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
it is forbidden but I've been playing

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.410 
it is forbidden but I've been playing
the<00:02:46.630> game<00:02:46.780> for<00:02:47.020> almost<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.800> decade<00:02:47.920> now<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.670> I

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.090 
know the cards come on and off the list
and<00:02:51.670> eventually<00:02:52.330> fish<00:02:53.200> board<00:02:53.530> will<00:02:53.709> probably

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
and eventually fish board will probably

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.790 
and eventually fish board will probably
come<00:02:54.280> off<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.640> list<00:02:54.880> maybe<00:02:55.300> not<00:02:55.540> next<00:02:56.320> format

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
come off the list maybe not next format

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.000 
come off the list maybe not next format
maybe<00:02:57.700> not<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.060> format<00:02:58.390> after<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.840> but<00:02:59.590> you

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
maybe not the format after that but you

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.770 
maybe not the format after that but you
know<00:03:00.100> two<00:03:00.220> years<00:03:00.820> if<00:03:01.060> this<00:03:01.090> car<00:03:01.390> comes<00:03:01.540> off<00:03:01.750> the

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
know two years if this car comes off the

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.020 
know two years if this car comes off the
list<00:03:02.170> they<00:03:02.740> get<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:02.980> holographic<00:03:03.430> version<00:03:03.910> is

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
list they get the holographic version is

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.670 
list they get the holographic version is
going<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.240> be<00:03:04.330> very<00:03:04.540> hard<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.110> extremely

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
going to be very hard and extremely

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.520 
going to be very hard and extremely
expensive<00:03:06.209> so<00:03:07.209> for<00:03:07.600> those<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:07.780> us<00:03:08.050> that<00:03:08.110> are<00:03:08.350> in

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
expensive so for those of us that are in

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.710 
expensive so for those of us that are in
the<00:03:08.770> game<00:03:08.980> for<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.459> long<00:03:09.760> haul<00:03:09.790> but<00:03:10.420> have<00:03:10.540> been

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
the game for the long haul but have been

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.900 
the game for the long haul but have been
in<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.959> game<00:03:11.110> for<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.380> long<00:03:11.590> haul<00:03:11.670> this<00:03:12.670> is

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
in the game for the long haul this is

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.300 
in the game for the long haul this is
kind<00:03:13.090> of<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.270> wise<00:03:13.450> investment<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:14.950> mean<00:03:15.280> if

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
kind of a wise investment so I mean if

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.530 
kind of a wise investment so I mean if
you're<00:03:15.519> one<00:03:15.640> of<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.790> people<00:03:15.910> that<00:03:16.180> are<00:03:16.239> just

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
you're one of the people that are just

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.540 
you're one of the people that are just
in<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:16.989> out<00:03:17.080> this<00:03:17.860> is<00:03:17.980> probably<00:03:18.160> not<00:03:18.310> going<00:03:18.459> to

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
in and out this is probably not going to

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.240 
in and out this is probably not going to
ring<00:03:18.730> so<00:03:18.910> much<00:03:19.060> true<00:03:19.390> you<00:03:19.600> but<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:21.100> know<00:03:21.220> for

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
ring so much true you but you know for

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.560 
ring so much true you but you know for
those<00:03:21.519> of<00:03:21.580> us<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:21.820> have<00:03:21.970> been<00:03:22.120> around<00:03:22.209> for<00:03:22.420> a

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
those of us that have been around for a

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.509 
those of us that have been around for a
while<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:23.739> know<00:03:23.769> you<00:03:23.890> see<00:03:24.220> that<00:03:24.430> eventually

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
while you know you see that eventually

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.840 
while you know you see that eventually
everything<00:03:25.510> comes<00:03:25.959> on<00:03:26.320> off<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.220> you<00:03:27.610> know<00:03:27.730> the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
everything comes on off the you know the

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
everything comes on off the you know the
list<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.750> know<00:03:28.870> maybe<00:03:29.110> in<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:30.280> year<00:03:30.310> so<00:03:30.870> fish

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
list you know maybe in a year so fish

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.050 
list you know maybe in a year so fish
board<00:03:32.170> might<00:03:32.320> get<00:03:32.470> limited<00:03:32.739> to<00:03:32.980> one<00:03:33.220> if<00:03:33.519> you

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
board might get limited to one if you

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.610 
board might get limited to one if you

to once it got released in gold people

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.940 
to once it got released in gold people
started<00:03:53.080> realizing<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.560> there's<00:03:53.739> a<00:03:53.799> good

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
started realizing that there's a good

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.560 
started realizing that there's a good
chance<00:03:54.190> that<00:03:54.430> he<00:03:54.519> may<00:03:54.670> come<00:03:54.850> off<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.120> list<00:03:55.360> and

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
chance that he may come off the list and

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.420 
chance that he may come off the list and
