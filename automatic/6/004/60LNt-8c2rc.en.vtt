00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.750
 Hi, guys and girls, how are you? 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.219
 I am expensive and welcome to my channel 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.460
 after a week that I take from 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.660
 vacation sessions very sabbatical week 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.840
 I needed to rest and I ask you 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.359
 apologies for having them abandoned and 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.509
 well let's continue one more time with black ops 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:33.230
 2 finally finally not strange now 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:37.220
 unless the truth I needed to climb 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.370
 a gameplay of these rings and that's why 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.860
 today I bring a very peculiar game 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.199
 some have already left comments 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.690
 of today we were in a game hack hey 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.839
 what happened was that he had put his 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.210
 name subscribed by chanel is not 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:56.110
 remains of songs and well it turns out that 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.730
 is that I have a friend is an acquaintance 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.590
 that the written boy is famous and is 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.880
 famous famous girl has a channel 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.510
 youtube here I will leave them in the 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.190
 description and well he told me hey 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.790
 I have a surprise 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.840
 get to play with me such added a 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.490
 account and such and was with room and also 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.430
 and nothing and it says good to me you have to 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.020
 I do not know what a new stunner 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:29.380
 agreement that was and I changed alarm and 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.810
 as well as they see it very rare green and put me 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.040
 to be immortal to have infinite bullets 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.700
 although now there are no bullets 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.119
 infinite 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.610
 but I do not know but what weird and 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:44.719
 end of the game that super speed 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:48.469
 or something like that the truth to see I know that I 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:52.610
 will attack and we will transfer lions 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:54.429
 but do not see it on the bad side because 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:01.840
 I did not do it as a bitch or anything 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:01.840
 simply match with this friend 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.550
 and I never played me a hack game 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.170
 sincerely and nothing started playing and the 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.990
 true see let's see let's talk 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.760
 because this issue creates a lot of revolution 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.790
 I'm not used to and know that 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.550
 I had never done it before, that is, it has not 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.270
 never cheated so to speak for 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.640
 that we are very clear 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.140
 I had a lot of fun because I'm going to deny the 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.600
 systems I passed the pipe so it is not 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.670
 it can not kill and it happens and it's that bitch 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.790
 some 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:43.290
 in short that is a total joke 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.689
 and have you ever told me that 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.400
 that I was going to the dark side clear 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.870
 that no last dark command is not 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.489
 that this is to the dark side but good 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.170
 or for tastes the colors each one 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.689
 has his own opinion about how 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.670
 a game is played and the things that are 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.260
 they can do in a game 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.270
 neither do you remember that all the 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.230
 games go to hackers sometimes here 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.090
 that is as very insistent the thing but 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.820
 why you not ever ever had 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.730
 tried that way so different and 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.620
 peculiar to play that I know you're going to 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.110
 saying something that is very creepy is 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.500
 that you are with good advantage if it is true 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.110
 but because I tried it if you ever 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.970
 because as many times as you are 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.670
 tired of seeing the same countryman son of 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.170
 your mother in the same corner waiting for you 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.710
 to kill you seven times I'm 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.230
 trying to dry you a good game and 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.020
 now strong is to remove in this way and 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:43.060
 say good now like all christ here 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:46.250
 because it is that these are the ovaries of 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.670
 hold on to stupid people in this game 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.920
 and that's the main reason why 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.410
 I decided to get good that they put me on 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.090
 hack and be able to play very quiet 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.500
 then you have noticed us but to 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.890
 throughout the game I met with 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.630
 a boy who is on the other side and who 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.750
 is and I can not kill that boy either 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:13.330
 he is also a friend of ceutÃ­ cmos for what 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.330
 and I was also with hack 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.079
 and well I do not know what else to say the boys 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.479
 I want you to leave me a very opinion 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.940
 Sincere very real because I know that one 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.100
 start saying with that morality is that 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.720
 I would never play a game to what 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.449
 zach style are horrible is that they are what 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.669
 worse but put yourself in the other in the other 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.470
 side and think about it today is that 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.229
 they also have their funny side is that 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.660
 sometime to prove that it goes through 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.039
 try not but nothing happens or they are 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.389
 and that in many moments with balls 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.889
 because we have someone who 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.570
 wants to take out a nuclear you already take in 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.949
 the beautiful game but the same thing happened to me 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.260
 to me when I'm trying to get my 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.840
 pretty part and I see someone with the lct 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:55.160
 with a search engine there is me there 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:58.400
 waiting for when spam and then 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.720
 good is the thin one that left them a 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.720
 more time in year 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.740
 each a game to the game as it gives the 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.150
 win that is more than clear everyone is 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.780
 you buy it to do what you want and the 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.759
 it is not because there buy them as 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.310
 they get their methods to get the 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:19.510
 I'm not going 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.880
 to sentence anyone here why 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.830
 because it's like that because just as I do not 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.120
 I can tell a person jacket that 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.950
 be removed from the fucking corner where 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.140
 the whole game is not going to be a 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.940
 hacker to remove all the things that 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.440
 has to take a few games 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.470
 cool for you to hold your meetings with 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.390
 colleagues and look less what time that if 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.249
 this already with the super speed is a 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:43.709
 Madness seriously is crazy and chasm 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:46.319
 there were already moments that could not even 

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:47.939
 hit another good thing to comment on 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:50.099
 the game had a boy who was 

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:50.939
 all the time we sent messages covered if 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.099
 you did not hack 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:55.199
 when you bet that it would burst you 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:57.839
 that was destroying you I do not know what you should not 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.459
 have no girlfriend or boyfriend and I like 

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:02.129
 thank you because the real people 

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:04.409
 simple a lot but I do not know what 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:06.749
 get sending your messages total that 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:10.799
 I killed him seven times and he got pissed 

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:13.739
 more or I do not know in the end that that's the other 

00:06:10.799 --> 00:06:15.869
 friendly face of the hacks that people get 

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:17.999
 piss off because you're going with a 

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:20.239
 huge advantage if it is also worth another 

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:24.599
 thing I want to say I know that the nuclear 

00:06:20.239 --> 00:06:26.369
 in this game evidently as one 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:29.489
 I will get a nuclear one if I am 

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:30.940
 either immortal or have extreme health 

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:32.650
 do not say it 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.409
 in 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:40.849
 so then that 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:42.379
 guys I'm playing like that and if it was 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:44.449
 the feelings of someone initial 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:46.519
 never imagined that doing this I'm sorry 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:49.219
 it really was not something planned it was 

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:51.559
 what is what on the fly I thought 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:53.899
 very curious and I said good because we're not going 

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:55.909
 to try it and so I can tell my 

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:58.659
 guys and the mystics that such form 

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:58.659
 experience with hack 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:04.639
 I say that and I really mean it 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:05.629
 heart I had a lot of fun is not something that 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:07.999
 I 'm going to do 

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:10.610
 commonly because if I bought the 

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:12.620
 games to play normal as with the 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.699
 advantages that makes you good with everything 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.059
 everything should be played 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:19.789
 Sincerely but respect to whoever wants 

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:22.550
 hack and who wants to put point 

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:23.920
 they are billions of millions and 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.570
 good 

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.430
