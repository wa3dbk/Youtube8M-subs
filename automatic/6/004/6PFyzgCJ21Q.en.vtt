think<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.600> has<00:01:30.689> more<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.049> do<00:01:31.200> with<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:32.009> being

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
think that has more to do with it being

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.950 
think that has more to do with it being
a<00:01:32.369> Microsoft<00:01:32.850> exclusive<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:33.540> having<00:01:33.840> that

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
a Microsoft exclusive but having that

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.050 
a Microsoft exclusive but having that
high<00:01:34.110> school<00:01:34.409> gap<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.740> also<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> big<00:01:35.490> factor<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
high school gap is also a big factor and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.819 
high school gap is also a big factor and
those<00:01:36.150> two<00:01:36.360> factors<00:01:36.780> led<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> game's

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
those two factors led to the game's

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.770 
those two factors led to the game's
popularity<00:01:38.040> kind<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.850> dying<00:01:39.060> down<00:01:39.270> especially

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
popularity kind of dying down especially

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.080 
popularity kind of dying down especially
here<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.200> YouTube<00:01:40.740> destiny<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.670> another<00:01:41.880> game

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
here on YouTube destiny is another game

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.490 
here on YouTube destiny is another game
that<00:01:42.299> seems<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.689> have<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> bit<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.259> higher

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that seems to have a bit of a higher

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.020 
that seems to have a bit of a higher
skill<00:01:43.860> gap<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.369> seems<00:01:44.700> from<00:01:44.820> what<00:01:44.909> I

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
skill gap and it seems from what I

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.399 
skill gap and it seems from what I
played<00:01:45.360> during<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> beta<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.200> skill

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
played during the beta that the skill

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.380 
played during the beta that the skill
gap<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.680> destiny<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.250> much<00:01:47.610> higher<00:01:47.909> than<00:01:48.149> Call

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
gap in destiny is much higher than Call

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.420 
gap in destiny is much higher than Call
of<00:01:48.420> Duty<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.710> think<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.369> be

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
of Duty and I think it's going to be

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.010 
of Duty and I think it's going to be
interesting<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.909> see<00:01:51.119> if<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.600> ultimately

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
interesting to see if that ultimately

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.499 
interesting to see if that ultimately
hurts<00:01:52.320> Destiny's<00:01:52.799> popularity<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:54.270> few

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
hurts Destiny's popularity and a few

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.060 
hurts Destiny's popularity and a few
months<00:01:54.600> down<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.899> road<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.200> few<00:01:55.409> months<00:01:55.619> after

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
months down the road a few months after

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.160 
months down the road a few months after
its<00:01:56.250> release<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.969> hope<00:01:57.450> not<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.899> am<00:01:57.990> really

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
its release I hope not I am really

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.139 
its release I hope not I am really
looking<00:01:58.290> forward<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.770> destiny<00:01:59.219> but<00:01:59.939> by<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
looking forward to destiny but by the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.700 
looking forward to destiny but by the
time<00:02:00.329> advanced<00:02:00.659> warfare<00:02:01.079> comes<00:02:01.320> out<00:02:01.469> that

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
time advanced warfare comes out that

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.620 
time advanced warfare comes out that
might<00:02:02.009> make<00:02:02.310> destiny<00:02:02.820> fade<00:02:03.030> away<00:02:03.210> once<00:02:03.390> again

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
might make destiny fade away once again

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.899 
might make destiny fade away once again
I<00:02:03.840> hope<00:02:04.320> that's<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.920> case<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.460> don't<00:02:05.549> think

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
I hope that's not the case I don't think

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.910 
I hope that's not the case I don't think
it<00:02:06.329> will<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.659> my<00:02:06.810> prediction<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.590> destiny

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
it will be my prediction is that destiny

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.460 
it will be my prediction is that destiny
will<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.099> as<00:02:08.789> popular<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.929> probably<00:02:10.080> slightly

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
will be as popular and probably slightly

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.720 
will be as popular and probably slightly
more<00:02:10.619> popular<00:02:11.129> than<00:02:11.310> game

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
more popular than game

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.399 
more popular than game
like<00:02:11.819> battlefield<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.599> halo<00:02:12.900> when<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.200> comes

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
like battlefield and halo when it comes

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.890 
like battlefield and halo when it comes

to the YouTube scene at least and now

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.199 
to the YouTube scene at least and now
coming<00:02:16.230> full<00:02:16.440> circle<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:17.040> advanced<00:02:17.489> warfare<00:02:17.970> I

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
coming full circle to advanced warfare I

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.420 
coming full circle to advanced warfare I
had<00:02:19.080> somewhat<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.620> an<00:02:19.709> epiphany<00:02:19.950> when<00:02:20.190> it

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
had somewhat of an epiphany when it

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.580 
had somewhat of an epiphany when it
comes<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.849> these<00:02:21.000> annoying<00:02:21.659> newbie<00:02:22.200> features

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
comes to these annoying newbie features

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.259 
comes to these annoying newbie features
in<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.950> Call<00:02:23.129> of<00:02:23.159> Duty<00:02:23.430> series<00:02:23.670> I'm<00:02:24.060> not

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
in the Call of Duty series I'm not

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.210 
in the Call of Duty series I'm not
exactly<00:02:24.540> sure<00:02:24.690> when<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.110> realized<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.739> but<00:02:26.010> it

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
exactly sure when I realized this but it

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.559 
exactly sure when I realized this but it
was<00:02:26.340> right<00:02:26.640> around<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.000> time<00:02:27.209> of<00:02:27.239> the

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
was right around the time of the

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.119 
was right around the time of the
advanced<00:02:27.930> warfare<00:02:28.410> multiplayer<00:02:28.590> reveal

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129

advanced warfare multiplayer reveal
livestream<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.180> basically<00:02:30.390> just<00:02:30.629> realized

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
livestream and I basically just realized

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.009 
livestream and I basically just realized
or<00:02:32.190> maybe<00:02:32.370> remember<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.299> was<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.569> better<00:02:33.780> word

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
or maybe remember it was a better word

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.630 
or maybe remember it was a better word
that<00:02:34.049> I<00:02:34.260> remember<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.860> these<00:02:35.010> features<00:02:35.250> in

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
that I remember that these features in

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.490 
that I remember that these features in
Call<00:02:35.819> of<00:02:35.849> Duty<00:02:36.180> are<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.540> reason<00:02:36.870> call<00:02:37.049> duty<00:02:37.260> is

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
Call of Duty are the reason call duty is

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.100 
Call of Duty are the reason call duty is
so<00:02:37.769> successful<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.549> maybe<00:02:39.420> more<00:02:39.660> importantly

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
so successful and maybe more importantly

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.600 
so successful and maybe more importantly
for<00:02:40.290> me<00:02:40.410> personally<00:02:40.620> it's<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.220> reason<00:02:41.519> why

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
for me personally it's the reason why

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.430 
for me personally it's the reason why
bad<00:02:41.909> players<00:02:42.269> will<00:02:42.599> continue<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.140> play<00:02:43.260> the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
bad players will continue to play the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.440 
bad players will continue to play the
game<00:02:43.470> which<00:02:44.280> will<00:02:44.459> allow<00:02:44.670> me<00:02:44.879> to<00:02:44.910> keep<00:02:45.269> getting

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
game which will allow me to keep getting

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.860 
game which will allow me to keep getting
crazy<00:02:46.170> fun<00:02:46.739> exciting<00:02:47.340> gameplays<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.360> when<00:02:48.840> I

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
crazy fun exciting gameplays and when I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.750 
crazy fun exciting gameplays and when I
say<00:02:49.049> remember<00:02:49.260> it's<00:02:49.769> just<00:02:50.099> that<00:02:50.310> because<00:02:50.489> it's

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
say remember it's just that because it's

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.640 
say remember it's just that because it's
not<00:02:50.879> like<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.180> didn't<00:02:51.480> know<00:02:51.660> why<00:02:51.959> Call<00:02:52.260> of<00:02:52.290> Duty

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
not like I didn't know why Call of Duty

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.530 
not like I didn't know why Call of Duty
has<00:02:52.829> and<00:02:53.099> probably<00:02:53.400> always<00:02:53.579> will<00:02:53.730> be<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.209> pretty

features<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:19.109> think<00:03:19.680> at<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.859> end<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.099> day

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
features I think at the end of the day

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.920 
features I think at the end of the day
it<00:03:20.519> comes<00:03:20.700> down<00:03:20.849> to<00:03:21.090> just<00:03:21.239> having<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:21.690> right

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
it comes down to just having that right

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.780 
it comes down to just having that right
balance<00:03:22.139> and<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.560> think<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:22.919> lot<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.609> will

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
balance and I think a lot of that will

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.909 
balance and I think a lot of that will
come<00:03:23.819> post-launch<00:03:24.630> as<00:03:24.840> well<00:03:25.019> so<00:03:25.349> hopefully
