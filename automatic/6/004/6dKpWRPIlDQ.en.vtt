you're<00:00:43.920> looking<00:00:44.100> at<00:00:44.160> an<00:00:44.219> 11.6<00:00:45.090> inch<00:00:45.210> notebook

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
you're looking at an 11.6 inch notebook

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.930 
you're looking at an 11.6 inch notebook
so<00:00:45.780> forget<00:00:46.020> about<00:00:46.050> your<00:00:46.320> ten<00:00:46.670> ten<00:00:47.670> point<00:00:47.850> two

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
so forget about your ten ten point two

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.340 
so forget about your ten ten point two
inch<00:00:48.090> notebooks<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.539> our<00:00:48.660> screens<00:00:49.079> are<00:00:49.200> too

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
inch notebooks that our screens are too

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.959 
inch notebooks that our screens are too
small<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.649> they<00:00:49.710> only<00:00:49.800> give<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.100> 600<00:00:50.879> lines

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
small and they only give you 600 lines

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.209 
small and they only give you 600 lines
of<00:00:51.120> resolution<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.989> one<00:00:52.230> has<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.590> very<00:00:52.620> very

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
of resolution this one has a very very

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.840 
of resolution this one has a very very
nice<00:00:53.510> 1366<00:00:54.510> by<00:00:54.690> 768<00:00:55.649> resolution<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.730> they'll

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
nice 1366 by 768 resolution so they'll

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.540 
nice 1366 by 768 resolution so they'll
do<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> 720p<00:00:57.899> video<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.949> little<00:00:58.980> bit<00:00:59.370> bigger

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
do a 720p video it's a little bit bigger

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.910 
do a 720p video it's a little bit bigger
now<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.359> also<00:01:00.510> means<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.140> graphics<00:01:01.590> on

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
now it also means that the graphics on

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.950 
now it also means that the graphics on
netbooks<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.550> usually<00:01:02.789> terrible<00:01:03.180> they<00:01:03.750> had<00:01:03.870> to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
netbooks is usually terrible they had to

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.090 
netbooks is usually terrible they had to
up<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.260> graphics<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> little<00:01:04.650> bit<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.010> they

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
up the graphics a little bit and they

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.179 
up the graphics a little bit and they
did<00:01:05.549> you're<00:01:06.030> getting<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.270> GMA<00:01:06.659> 4500<00:01:07.170> M<00:01:07.619> HD

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
did you're getting the GMA 4500 M HD

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.880 
did you're getting the GMA 4500 M HD
chipset<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.180> will<00:01:09.330> let<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.630> some<00:01:09.900> HD

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
chipset so that will let you do some HD

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.880 
chipset so that will let you do some HD
videos<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:12.119> not<00:01:12.330> only<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.439> graphics

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
videos and it's not only the graphics

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.740 
videos and it's not only the graphics
and<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> screen<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.580> got<00:01:14.700> an<00:01:14.880> upgrade<00:01:15.420> you

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
and the screen that got an upgrade you

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.770 
and the screen that got an upgrade you
also<00:01:16.189> get<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.400> very<00:01:17.790> very<00:01:17.850> nice<00:01:18.060> processor<00:01:18.630> it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
also get a very very nice processor it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.920 
also get a very very nice processor it
is<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.110> ultra<00:01:19.409> low<00:01:19.530> voltage<00:01:19.560> Intel<00:01:20.330> su-30<00:01:21.330> 500

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
is the ultra low voltage Intel su-30 500

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.260 
is the ultra low voltage Intel su-30 500
so<00:01:22.530> that's<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.770> very<00:01:23.009> very<00:01:23.250> nice<00:01:23.369> 1.4<00:01:24.000> gigahertz

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
so that's a very very nice 1.4 gigahertz

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.760 
so that's a very very nice 1.4 gigahertz
now<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.570> think<00:01:24.720> all<00:01:24.900> 1.4<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:25.439> slow<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
now you think all 1.4 it's slow and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.170 
now you think all 1.4 it's slow and
Adams<00:01:26.009> 1.6<00:01:26.520> well<00:01:26.700> I'll<00:01:26.759> tell<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:26.939> what<00:01:27.060> this

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
Adams 1.6 well I'll tell you what this

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.050 
Adams 1.6 well I'll tell you what this
is<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> real<00:01:27.509> processor<00:01:27.900> actually<00:01:28.860> works<00:01:29.820> it

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
is a real processor actually works it

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.539 
is a real processor actually works it
does<00:01:30.299> things<00:01:30.509> Adams<00:01:31.350> are<00:01:31.470> cool<00:01:31.650> sure<00:01:32.430> they

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
does things Adams are cool sure they

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.280 
does things Adams are cool sure they
only<00:01:32.579> burn<00:01:32.909> for<00:01:32.970> watts<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.720> they're<00:01:34.110> all

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
only burn for watts and they're all

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.749 
only burn for watts and they're all
efficient<00:01:34.770> but<00:01:34.950> they're<00:01:35.100> slow<00:01:35.340> they're

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
efficient but they're slow they're

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.249 
efficient but they're slow they're
boring<00:01:35.970> you're<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> netbook<00:01:36.810> sometimes<00:01:37.140> you

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
boring you're on a netbook sometimes you

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.080 
boring you're on a netbook sometimes you
get<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.409> little<00:01:37.619> bit<00:01:37.710> upset<00:01:37.799> at<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.280> speed<00:01:38.520> this

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
get a little bit upset at the speed this

is<00:04:30.270> actually<00:04:30.480> how<00:04:30.810> efficient<00:04:31.200> it's<00:04:31.290> very

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
is actually how efficient it's very

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.050 
is actually how efficient it's very
impressive<00:04:32.070> now<00:04:32.160> first<00:04:32.610> of<00:04:32.730> all<00:04:32.820> you<00:04:32.910> have<00:04:33.030> the

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
it's gonna conserve more energy and you

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.450 
it's gonna conserve more energy and you
have<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:38.690> 4400<00:04:39.690> milliamp<00:04:40.560> fear<00:04:40.710> our<00:04:40.920> battery
