00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
watch the replay it just sneaks under

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.220 
watch the replay it just sneaks under
his<00:04:42.850> arm<00:04:43.030> and<00:04:43.210> that's<00:04:43.450> what<00:04:43.600> drives<00:04:43.780> me<00:04:44.020> nuts

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
his arm and that's what drives me nuts

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.130

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
with this play and that's going to end

blazing<00:05:08.560> I<00:05:08.620> was<00:05:08.740> trying<00:05:08.920> to<00:05:08.950> find<00:05:09.100> someone

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
blazing I was trying to find someone

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.220 
blazing I was trying to find someone
else<00:05:09.610> but<00:05:10.090> there<00:05:10.210> really<00:05:10.450> is<00:05:10.690> no<00:05:10.840> one<00:05:10.960> else<00:05:11.020> got

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
else but there really is no one else got

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.590 
else but there really is no one else got
by<00:05:11.590> that<00:05:11.740> center<00:05:11.980> back<00:05:12.130> position<00:05:12.550> and<00:05:12.700> this

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
by that center back position and this

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
by that center back position and this
move<00:05:13.930> would<00:05:14.110> really<00:05:14.740> just<00:05:14.770> kill<00:05:15.730> our<00:05:16.000> defense

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
move would really just kill our defense

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.930 
move would really just kill our defense
absolutely<00:05:17.620> no<00:05:17.860> strength<00:05:18.220> here<00:05:18.460> and<00:05:18.670> it

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
absolutely no strength here and it

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.480 
absolutely no strength here and it
doesn't<00:05:19.150> help<00:05:19.330> with<00:05:19.540> a<00:05:19.570> goalie<00:05:19.870> leg<00:05:20.110> form<00:05:20.490> so

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
doesn't help with a goalie leg form so

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.670 
doesn't help with a goalie leg form so
we're<00:05:21.640> playing<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:22.330> top<00:05:22.630> club<00:05:23.290> in<00:05:23.530> the

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680

Barclays Premier League Tottenham a win

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.600 
Barclays Premier League Tottenham a win

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.190 
obviously would be great at I would be
great<00:05:27.880> but<00:05:28.120> I<00:05:28.360> mean<00:05:28.600> obviously<00:05:28.930> that's<00:05:29.140> not

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
great but I mean obviously that's not

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.230
