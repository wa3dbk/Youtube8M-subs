00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.880
 Vienna 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.230
 all people 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.390
 I am lying more 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.390
 I'm 16 years old and I'm going to high school in tenth grade 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.730
 I have one kickboxing and handball play 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.470
 but today I do not want to introduce a hobby 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.470
 but because I tell something about the Nile along Germany 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.680
 that camper might be funny 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.560
 But it is a very important topic for us 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.850
 you learn the most important at school 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.210
 To avoid garbage 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.250
 to protect our environment 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.660
 but since you do not have to go he meant 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.950
 Everything that arises anyway must be separated 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.950
 how it works in Germany temporally today 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.470
 in our house foreign bio waste 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.770
 Garbage for the yellow sack 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.060
 residual waste 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.970
 and of course old paper 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.700
 from Claas 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.770
 The bio-waste can affect the rural areas on the compost pile 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.630
 in the city there is a bio bin for it 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.450
 the Rottweiler one for example food leftovers 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.580
 clicked later 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.880
 or oct 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.880
 in the yellow bag and packaging and in front of them 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.030
 The residual waste includes all strongly represented as for example 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.350
 Vacuum cleaner bag or cage 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.440
 Old paper and glass Sandmann drive out 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.440
 but it is not picked up by the garbage collection 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.550
 you have to bring it to collection points in your place 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.290
 Of course, old paper is all on paper 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.770
 the old newspapers 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.190
 cardboard boxes 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.190
 and so on 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.210
 However, soon you will be clear for yourself 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.210
 such as plants and sausage counter 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.960
 twice a month and where mothers are not advertised 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:15.429

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:16.689
 Message 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.689
 drove to a landfill 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:23.220
 even there 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.519
 September the very much waste can be recycled through it 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:35.729
 that protects the environment and saves money because Euro penalty 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.039
