00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
stuff on the inside so this first

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.400 
stuff on the inside so this first
impression<00:00:35.630> of<00:00:35.660> this<00:00:35.780> watch<00:00:36.020> is<00:00:36.200> it<00:00:36.320> is

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
impression of this watch is it is

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.850 
impression of this watch is it is
actually<00:00:36.920> a<00:00:37.220> little<00:00:37.700> bit<00:00:37.790> on<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.030> small<00:00:38.270> side

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
actually a little bit on the small side

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.280 
actually a little bit on the small side
the<00:00:39.860> case<00:00:40.400> dimension<00:00:40.940> here<00:00:41.240> is<00:00:41.330> 41

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
the case dimension here is 41

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.370 
the case dimension here is 41
millimeters<00:00:42.830> and<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:43.760> thickness<00:00:44.090> is<00:00:44.480> just<00:00:44.810> 12

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
millimeters and the thickness is just 12

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.350 
millimeters and the thickness is just 12
millimeters<00:00:45.950> so<00:00:46.160> it's<00:00:46.610> actually<00:00:47.000> it's<00:00:47.150> not<00:00:47.300> a

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
millimeters so it's actually it's not a

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.330 
millimeters so it's actually it's not a
big<00:00:47.630> watch<00:00:47.870> I'll<00:00:48.260> slip<00:00:48.500> it<00:00:48.590> on<00:00:48.680> my<00:00:48.830> wrist<00:00:49.070> so

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
big watch I'll slip it on my wrist so

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.830 
big watch I'll slip it on my wrist so
that<00:00:49.370> you<00:00:49.550> can<00:00:49.730> just<00:00:49.880> see<00:00:50.090> how<00:00:50.210> it<00:00:50.360> looks<00:00:50.570> there

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
that you can just see how it looks there

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.170 
that you can just see how it looks there
and<00:00:51.050> obviously<00:00:51.950> the<00:00:52.250> bracelet<00:00:52.640> isn't<00:00:52.790> sized

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
and obviously the bracelet isn't sized

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.120 
and obviously the bracelet isn't sized
appropriately<00:00:53.420> for<00:00:54.080> me<00:00:54.200> but<00:00:54.410> you<00:00:54.560> can<00:00:54.740> see

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
appropriately for me but you can see

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.360 
appropriately for me but you can see
that<00:00:55.340> it's<00:00:56.030> not<00:00:56.270> an<00:00:56.480> oversized<00:00:56.960> face<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:57.680> if

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
that it's not an oversized face and if

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.840 
that it's not an oversized face and if
you<00:00:58.850> have<00:00:59.120> a<00:00:59.150> larger<00:00:59.660> wrist<00:00:59.900> or<00:01:00.110> a<00:01:00.140> larger<00:01:00.530> hand

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
you have a larger wrist or a larger hand

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.760 
you have a larger wrist or a larger hand
you<00:01:01.850> might<00:01:02.030> actually<00:01:02.270> just<00:01:02.840> consider<00:01:03.590> the

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
you might actually just consider the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.079 
you might actually just consider the
fact<00:01:03.980> that<00:01:04.100> this<00:01:04.280> watch<00:01:04.489> might<00:01:04.790> look<00:01:04.940> a<00:01:05.059> bit

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
fact that this watch might look a bit

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.750 
fact that this watch might look a bit
small<00:01:05.540> on<00:01:05.570> your<00:01:05.990> wrist<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:06.470> that<00:01:06.680> was<00:01:07.280> a<00:01:07.310> first

small on your wrist so that was a first

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.240 
small on your wrist so that was a first

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
unidirectional ratcheting bezel so you

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.830 
unidirectional ratcheting bezel so you
can<00:01:40.909> hear<00:01:41.120> that<00:01:41.270> click<00:01:41.630> click<00:01:41.870> click<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:43.840> then

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
we've also got a sapphire crystal that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.570 
we've also got a sapphire crystal that
Hamiltons<00:01:48.260> used<00:01:48.500> here<00:01:48.799> for<00:01:48.830> extra<00:01:49.220> scratch

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
Hamiltons used here for extra scratch

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.880 
Hamiltons used here for extra scratch
resistance<00:01:50.180> and<00:01:50.420> of<00:01:51.200> course<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.560> watch<00:01:51.710> is

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
resistance and of course the watch is

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.480 
also water resistant up to 100 meters so
it<00:01:55.190> could<00:01:55.369> be<00:01:55.490> suitable<00:01:55.670> for<00:01:55.940> diving<00:01:56.350> because

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
this watch uses higher-end components

back here give you a little jostle this
automatic<00:02:09.740> movement<00:02:10.099> is<00:02:10.160> powered<00:02:10.610> by<00:02:10.640> the

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
automatic movement is powered by the

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:11.650 
automatic movement is powered by the
movement<00:02:11.330> of

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
movement of

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.360 
movement of
your<00:02:11.750> wrists<00:02:12.290> natural<00:02:12.860> movement<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.250> your

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
your wrists natural movement of your

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.520 
your wrists natural movement of your
wrist<00:02:13.640> but<00:02:14.240> it's<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.570> higher-end<00:02:14.780> component

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
wrist but it's a higher-end component

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.560 
wrist but it's a higher-end component
and<00:02:15.680> therefore<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.370> cost<00:02:16.610> on<00:02:16.850> this<00:02:17.000> watch<00:02:17.270> is

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
and therefore the cost on this watch is

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.530 
and therefore the cost on this watch is
higher<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.950> higher<00:02:19.910> than<00:02:20.150> some<00:02:20.270> of<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.420> other

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
higher is higher than some of the other

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.870 
higher is higher than some of the other
Hamilton's<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:21.490> that's<00:02:22.490> something<00:02:22.760> to

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
Hamilton's so that's something to

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.460 
Hamilton's so that's something to
consider<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:25.540> also<00:02:26.540> if<00:02:26.840> we<00:02:27.020> look<00:02:27.050> at<00:02:27.380> the
