00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
a in a way it was kind of disappointing

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.620 
a in a way it was kind of disappointing
you<00:02:43.710> know<00:02:43.770> they<00:02:43.950> they<00:02:44.070> were<00:02:44.160> both<00:02:44.450> data<00:02:45.450> they

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
you know they they were both data they

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.030 
you know they they were both data they
both<00:02:45.810> weren't<00:02:46.020> like<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:46.410> their<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.590> game<00:02:46.740> it

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
both weren't like on their a game it

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.020 
both weren't like on their a game it
looked<00:02:47.190> like<00:02:47.280> but<00:02:47.490> it<00:02:47.580> was<00:02:47.610> exceeding<00:02:48.000> I

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
looked like but it was exceeding I

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.520 
looked like but it was exceeding I
wasn't<00:02:48.240> exciting<00:02:48.570> back<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:48.870> forth<00:02:49.020> fight<00:02:49.260> I

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
wasn't exciting back and forth fight I

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.710 
wasn't exciting back and forth fight I
think<00:02:50.250> he<00:02:50.340> could<00:02:50.490> have<00:02:50.580> won<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.940> fight<00:02:51.120> he

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
think he could have won the fight he

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.420 
think he could have won the fight he
kind<00:02:51.960> of<00:02:52.020> got<00:02:52.680> out<00:02:52.740> gave<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.100> to<00:02:53.190> him<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.370> the
