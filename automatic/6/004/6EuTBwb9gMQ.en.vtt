00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
she'll start to run around crazily and

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.500 
she'll start to run around crazily and
it's<00:00:50.340> kind<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.610> annoying<00:00:50.820> when<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.149> happens

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
it's kind of annoying when that happens

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.959 
it's kind of annoying when that happens
so<00:00:54.710> yeah<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.829> took<00:00:55.860> me<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> couple<00:00:56.190> times<00:00:56.489> when

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
so yeah it took me a couple times when

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.490 
so yeah it took me a couple times when
he<00:00:57.059> has<00:00:57.239> two<00:00:57.420> eyes<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> think<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> hardest

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
he has two eyes I think it's the hardest

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.900 
he has two eyes I think it's the hardest
to<00:00:58.649> hit<00:00:58.770> his<00:00:58.920> eyes<00:00:59.100> because<00:00:59.489> he<00:00:59.609> will<00:00:59.760> not<00:00:59.789> use

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910

certain point where all of them are at

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.300 
certain point where all of them are at
that<00:01:48.450> same<00:01:48.780> level<00:01:49.080> of<00:01:49.830> around<00:01:50.130> him<00:01:52.310> it's

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
that same level of around him it's

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.230 
that same level of around him it's
easier<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.790> hit<00:01:53.880> him<00:01:54.030> now<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.930> third<00:01:56.119> yeah<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.950 
third time they'll all have little
energy<00:01:59.130> things<00:01:59.580> around<00:01:59.790> them<00:01:59.940> so<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.810> won't

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
energy things around them so you won't

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.210 
energy things around them so you won't
be<00:02:01.049> able<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.320> hit<00:02:01.440> on<00:02:01.590> with<00:02:01.680> these<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:02.039> just

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
be able to hit on with these you just

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.190 
be able to hit on with these you just
pull<00:02:02.399> them<00:02:02.460> off<00:02:02.580> with<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.820> Guster<00:02:03.149> arm<00:02:03.270> now

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
pull them off with the Guster arm now

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.779 
pull them off with the Guster arm now
when<00:02:04.409> he<00:02:04.500> uses<00:02:04.649> his<00:02:04.770> laser<00:02:05.070> beam<00:02:05.280> attack<00:02:05.549> it's

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
when he uses his laser beam attack it's

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.260 
when he uses his laser beam attack it's
much<00:02:06.030> easier<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.450> hit<00:02:06.659> him<00:02:06.810> because<00:02:07.910> well<00:02:08.910> I

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
much easier to hit him because well I

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.170 
much easier to hit him because well I
mean<00:02:10.170> they<00:02:11.160> moved<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.610> side<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.060> they're

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
mean they moved to the side and they're

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.420 
mean they moved to the side and they're
standing<00:02:12.600> right<00:02:12.870> there<00:02:12.900> for<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:14.250> like

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
standing right there for you just like

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.340 
standing right there for you just like
that<00:02:15.620> so<00:02:16.620> get<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.010> last<00:02:17.220> one<00:02:17.430> off<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:18.030> him<00:02:18.660> and

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.199 

there<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.590> go<00:02:22.620> now<00:02:23.190> hit<00:02:23.489> his<00:02:23.580> eye<00:02:23.730> he<00:02:24.060> might

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
there you go now hit his eye he might

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.870 
there you go now hit his eye he might
like<00:02:24.510> teleport<00:02:25.019> once<00:02:25.200> or<00:02:25.350> twice<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.880> think

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
like teleport once or twice I think

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.790 
like teleport once or twice I think
third<00:02:27.300> time<00:02:27.480> he<00:02:27.569> teleports<00:02:28.080> once<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.709> then

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
third time he teleports once and then

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.229 
third time he teleports once and then
the<00:02:28.890> fourth<00:02:29.160> time<00:02:29.220> he<00:02:29.430> teleports<00:02:29.880> twice<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:31.200> on

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
the fourth time he teleports twice so on

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.820 
the fourth time he teleports twice so on
next<00:02:33.239> time<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.900> didn't<00:02:34.350> know<00:02:34.410> this<00:02:34.560> but<00:02:34.709> you

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
next time and I didn't know this but you

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.229 
next time and I didn't know this but you
could<00:02:34.980> actually<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:35.459> can<00:02:35.640> actually<00:02:35.790> use<00:02:36.090> your

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
could actually you can actually use your

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.640 
could actually you can actually use your
quest<00:02:36.450> jar<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.750> get<00:02:36.870> rid<00:02:37.019> of<00:02:37.049> the<00:02:37.230> flames<00:02:37.500> I

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
quest jar to get rid of the flames I

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.460 
quest jar to get rid of the flames I
tried<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:37.920> later<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.459> I<00:02:38.489> got<00:02:38.519> hit<00:02:38.850> because<00:02:39.840> I

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
tried that later and I got hit because I

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.580 
tried that later and I got hit because I
wasn't<00:02:41.400> doing<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.840> know<00:02:42.870> enough<00:02:43.200> but<00:02:43.230> I

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
wasn't doing it you know enough but I

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.009 
wasn't doing it you know enough but I
guess<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.040> can<00:02:44.340> do<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.640> tried<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.630> come<00:02:45.750> over

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
guess you can do that tried to come over

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.560 
guess you can do that tried to come over
here<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.380> use<00:02:47.250> my<00:02:47.280> Gus<00:02:47.640> jar<00:02:47.850> at<00:02:47.970> one<00:02:48.090> point<00:02:48.329> and

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
here and use my Gus jar at one point and

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:56.860 
here and use my Gus jar at one point and
they<00:02:48.660> hit<00:02:48.810> me<00:02:49.340> because<00:02:51.110> I'm<00:02:52.110> dumb<00:02:52.440> but<00:02:53.250> anyways

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.319 

um<00:02:58.070> like<00:02:59.070> I<00:02:59.190> said<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.430> laser<00:02:59.609> beam<00:02:59.850> is<00:03:00.060> the

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
um like I said the laser beam is the

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.979 
um like I said the laser beam is the
best<00:03:00.510> time<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.870> hit<00:03:00.989> his<00:03:01.109> eyes<00:03:01.320> because<00:03:02.989> let's

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
best time to hit his eyes because let's

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.690 
best time to hit his eyes because let's
just<00:03:04.260> see<00:03:04.590> right<00:03:04.769> there<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.100> try<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.340> but<00:03:05.670> I

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
just see right there and try to but I

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.650 
just see right there and try to but I
missed<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.480> maybe<00:03:07.200> start<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.680> run<00:03:07.920> around

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
missed it so maybe start to run around

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.640 
missed it so maybe start to run around
because<00:03:09.660> especially<00:03:09.930> when<00:03:10.260> he<00:03:10.350> moves<00:03:10.530> across

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
because especially when he moves across

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.500 
because especially when he moves across
with<00:03:11.040> them<00:03:11.130> because<00:03:11.220> it's<00:03:11.340> very<00:03:11.579> easy<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.090> just

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
with them because it's very easy to just

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.840 
with them because it's very easy to just
dodged<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:14.090> so

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.300 

and<00:03:18.030> then<00:03:18.570> just<00:03:18.720> stand<00:03:19.020> right<00:03:19.110> there<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:20.040> of

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
and then just stand right there and of

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.970 
and then just stand right there and of
course<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.640> got<00:03:20.760> hit<00:03:20.910> by<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.060> fireball<00:03:21.510> again<00:03:21.980> so

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
course I got hit by a fireball again so

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.770 
course I got hit by a fireball again so
yeah<00:03:23.220> like<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.490> said<00:03:23.520> that<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:23.970> am<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.600> most

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
yeah like I said that I am the most

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.870 
yeah like I said that I am the most
proud<00:03:25.080> most<00:03:25.500> trouble<00:03:25.890> with<00:03:25.920> this<00:03:26.280> form

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
proud most trouble with this form

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.020 
proud most trouble with this form
actually<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:28.280> um<00:03:29.280> so<00:03:31.190> just<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.640> let<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:32.880> know

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
actually so um so just to let you know

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.300 
actually so um so just to let you know
that's<00:03:34.020> just<00:03:34.140> me<00:03:34.470> though<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.950> guys<00:03:35.040> might

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
that's just me though you guys might

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.890 
that's just me though you guys might
think<00:03:35.340> it's<00:03:35.670> easier<00:03:36.180> see<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.600> fourth<00:03:36.840> time

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
think it's easier see the fourth time

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.770 
think it's easier see the fourth time
yeah<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:37.890> then<00:03:38.490> there<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.850> go<00:03:38.970> now<00:03:39.270> on<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.750> a

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
yeah and then there you go now on to a

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.990 
yeah and then there you go now on to a
second<00:03:40.230> form<00:03:42.950> this<00:03:43.950> one<00:03:44.190> is<00:03:44.340> quite<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.790> bit

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
second form this one is quite a bit

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.050 
second form this one is quite a bit
easier<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:46.050> mean<00:03:46.290> quite<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:47.090> its<00:03:48.140> you'll<00:03:49.140> see<00:03:50.060> it

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
easier I mean quite a its you'll see it

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.650 
easier I mean quite a its you'll see it
to<00:03:51.330> me<00:03:51.480> anyways<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:54.090> probably<00:03:54.270> won't<00:03:54.510> take

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
to me anyways you probably won't take

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.870 
to me anyways you probably won't take
too<00:03:54.690> much<00:03:54.990> damage<00:03:55.050> it<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.920> part<00:03:56.610> about<00:03:56.730> this

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
too much damage it the part about this

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.420 
too much damage it the part about this
is<00:03:56.940> that<00:03:57.120> it's<00:03:57.450> just<00:03:57.690> annoying<00:03:58.050> because<00:03:59.010> you

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
is that it's just annoying because you

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.490 
is that it's just annoying because you
have<00:03:59.610> to<00:03:59.820> copy<00:04:00.450> yourself<00:04:00.690> you<00:04:01.110> can<00:04:01.260> see<00:04:01.410> his

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
have to copy yourself you can see his

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.950 
have to copy yourself you can see his
eyes<00:04:01.650> don't<00:04:01.980> point<00:04:02.280> your<00:04:02.400> arrows<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:03.000> it's

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
eyes don't point your arrows and it's

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.540 
eyes don't point your arrows and it's
going<00:04:04.110> to<00:04:04.170> be<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.320> random<00:04:04.710> pattern<00:04:04.890> each<00:04:05.190> time

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
going to be a random pattern each time

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.690 
going to be a random pattern each time
on<00:04:06.030> his<00:04:06.270> eyes<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:07.230> first<00:04:07.470> one<00:04:07.650> however<00:04:08.460> will

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
on his eyes the first one however will

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.880 
on his eyes the first one however will
always<00:04:09.210> be<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.570> four<00:04:09.810> on<00:04:09.960> the<00:04:10.080> bottom<00:04:10.380> so<00:04:10.650> just

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
always be the four on the bottom so just

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.770 
always be the four on the bottom so just
remember<00:04:11.040> that<00:04:11.250> now<00:04:12.120> it's<00:04:12.270> nice<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:12.570> have<00:04:12.660> the

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780

remember that now it's nice to have the
droid<00:04:13.020> butterfly<00:04:13.470> but<00:04:14.160> yeah<00:04:14.990> because<00:04:15.990> you<00:04:16.260> can

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
droid butterfly but yeah because you can

droid butterfly but yeah because you can
shoot<00:04:16.500> arrows<00:04:16.680> faster<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.690> it's<00:04:18.690> also<00:04:18.840> nice

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
shoot arrows faster and it's also nice

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.440 
shoot arrows faster and it's also nice
to<00:04:19.110> have<00:04:19.350> that<00:04:19.530> speedy<00:04:19.950> you<00:04:20.430> know<00:04:20.549> charged<00:04:21.150> up

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
to have that speedy you know charged up

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.080 
to have that speedy you know charged up
thing<00:04:21.660> so<00:04:22.230> once<00:04:22.410> you<00:04:22.530> kill<00:04:23.070> them<00:04:23.190> all<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:23.880> just

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
thing so once you kill them all you just

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.720 
thing so once you kill them all you just

want to start / in a design now those
little<00:04:27.380> energy<00:04:28.380> things<00:04:28.680> or<00:04:28.890> whatever<00:04:29.040> they

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
little energy things or whatever they

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.120 
little energy things or whatever they
are<00:04:30.260> you<00:04:31.260> can<00:04:31.410> actually<00:04:31.710> hit<00:04:31.830> them<00:04:31.980> with<00:04:32.100> your

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
are you can actually hit them with your

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.030 
are you can actually hit them with your
sword<00:04:32.520> and<00:04:32.760> then<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.240> sparks<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.470> can<00:04:34.710> but

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
sword and then the sparks you can but

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.430 
sword and then the sparks you can but
you<00:04:35.280> see<00:04:35.640> the<00:04:35.760> second<00:04:36.090> one<00:04:36.120> here<00:04:36.450> was<00:04:36.660> all<00:04:36.990> on

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
you see the second one here was all on

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.030 
you see the second one here was all on
the<00:04:37.560> right<00:04:37.710> side<00:04:37.980> so<00:04:38.340> you<00:04:38.370> just<00:04:38.730> copy<00:04:38.970> that<00:04:39.300> and

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
the right side so you just copy that and

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.650 
the right side so you just copy that and
it's<00:04:41.040> really<00:04:41.430> easy<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.790> die<00:04:42.000> do<00:04:42.060> most<00:04:42.420> of<00:04:42.510> his

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
it's really easy to die do most of his

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.510 
it's really easy to die do most of his
attacks<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.560> thing<00:04:43.740> that<00:04:43.860> I<00:04:43.890> hate<00:04:44.160> about<00:04:44.370> them

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
attacks the thing that I hate about them

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
know charging up he's just a really

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.780 
know charging up he's just a really
annoying<00:04:53.430> part<00:04:53.970> instead<00:04:54.540> of<00:04:55.550> you<00:04:56.550> know<00:04:56.580> it's

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
annoying part instead of you know it's

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.030 
annoying part instead of you know it's
let<00:04:57.030> it's<00:04:57.150> less<00:04:57.800> less<00:04:59.030> hard<00:05:00.030> more<00:05:00.630> annoying

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
let it's less less hard more annoying

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.970 
let it's less less hard more annoying
really<00:05:02.270> alright<00:05:03.270> so<00:05:03.390> the<00:05:03.510> second<00:05:03.930> one<00:05:04.050> the

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
really alright so the second one the

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.890 
really alright so the second one the
first<00:05:05.010> time<00:05:05.340> I<00:05:05.370> did<00:05:05.580> this<00:05:05.610> it<00:05:05.820> was<00:05:05.850> on<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.300> left

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
first time I did this it was on the left

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.900 
first time I did this it was on the left
side<00:05:07.110> but<00:05:07.410> you'll<00:05:07.710> see<00:05:07.890> it'll<00:05:08.100> be<00:05:08.280> blue<00:05:08.610> and

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
side but you'll see it'll be blue and

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.120 
side but you'll see it'll be blue and
it'll<00:05:09.630> make<00:05:09.750> a<00:05:09.780> weird<00:05:10.140> noise<00:05:10.350> of<00:05:10.590> it<00:05:10.680> isn't<00:05:10.800> so

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
it'll make a weird noise of it isn't so

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.860 
it'll make a weird noise of it isn't so
there's<00:05:11.580> all<00:05:11.790> on<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:11.970> bottom<00:05:12.300> I<00:05:12.480> think<00:05:12.810> the

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
there's all on the bottom I think the

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.340 
there's all on the bottom I think the
bottom<00:05:13.140> is<00:05:13.200> the<00:05:13.260> easiest<00:05:13.590> just<00:05:13.860> because

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
bottom is the easiest just because

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.190 
bottom is the easiest just because
he<00:05:14.740> doesn't<00:05:15.040> really<00:05:15.220> go<00:05:15.460> down<00:05:15.580> there<00:05:15.790> much<00:05:16.200> so

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
he doesn't really go down there much so

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.490 
he doesn't really go down there much so
and<00:05:18.510> I<00:05:19.510> think<00:05:19.750> you<00:05:19.810> only<00:05:19.960> need<00:05:20.140> to<00:05:20.230> hit<00:05:20.380> him

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
and I think you only need to hit him

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.700 
and I think you only need to hit him
like<00:05:20.790> once<00:05:21.790> with<00:05:22.120> all<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.510> eyeballs<00:05:22.870> to<00:05:23.020> let

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
like once with all the eyeballs to let

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.340 
like once with all the eyeballs to let
that<00:05:23.920> happen<00:05:24.280> so<00:05:24.700> the<00:05:25.450> next<00:05:25.600> time<00:05:25.780> was<00:05:25.990> all<00:05:26.170> on

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
that happen so the next time was all on

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.110 
that happen so the next time was all on
the<00:05:26.440> left<00:05:26.650> side<00:05:26.830> I<00:05:27.190> don't<00:05:27.490> think<00:05:27.520> I<00:05:27.700> had<00:05:27.820> any

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
the left side I don't think I had any

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.150 
the left side I don't think I had any
right<00:05:28.600> here<00:05:28.870> that<00:05:29.020> was<00:05:29.110> on<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:29.350> bottom<00:05:29.500> but<00:05:30.040> it

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
right here that was on the bottom but it

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.450 
right here that was on the bottom but it
that<00:05:30.640> does<00:05:30.820> happen<00:05:31.090> so<00:05:32.040> this<00:05:33.040> is<00:05:33.220> annoying

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
that does happen so this is annoying

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.920 
that does happen so this is annoying
because<00:05:33.730> he<00:05:33.970> made<00:05:34.150> me<00:05:34.300> calm<00:05:34.480> people<00:05:34.660> with

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
because he made me calm people with

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.140 
because he made me calm people with
those<00:05:35.080> parts<00:05:35.530> and<00:05:36.430> one<00:05:36.550> nice<00:05:36.730> thing<00:05:36.760> is<00:05:37.120> that

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
those parts and one nice thing is that

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.700 
those parts and one nice thing is that
he'll<00:05:37.570> never<00:05:37.720> close<00:05:38.050> those<00:05:38.290> eyes<00:05:38.730> so<00:05:39.730> like<00:05:40.710> you

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
he'll never close those eyes so like you

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.800 
he'll never close those eyes so like you
know<00:05:41.740> if<00:05:42.100> you<00:05:42.400> take<00:05:42.610> too<00:05:43.030> long<00:05:43.210> to<00:05:43.270> do<00:05:43.510> it<00:05:43.630> if

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
know if you take too long to do it if

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.450 
know if you take too long to do it if
the<00:05:44.050> his<00:05:44.170> eyes<00:05:44.320> will<00:05:44.500> stay<00:05:44.650> open<00:05:44.680> you<00:05:45.340> know
