00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.220
 ah 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.260
 and now all such kids chalets 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.119
 you are after a week with a lot 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.710
 theory and a lot of study let's give it a 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.150
 little bit of action to the channel at last 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.650
 straight in the chest I love the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.300
 shotguns especially to throw some 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.740
 laughs never to play seriously and it's that 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.060
 It is also very easy to kill with 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.380
 she knows that with having an uncle to 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.270
 five meters and shots more or less 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.380
 where is it since you kill it but there is a 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.540
 problem and that is that many of the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.520
 shotguns especially the pumping ones are 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.170
 varied in some servers and you know 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.760
 that would kill you to take the plane for ass 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.170
 with the server and there is also another 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.489
 problem and that is that sometimes killing a 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.290
 shot and then you have to be 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.510
 firing nonstop at the guy who seems 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.250
 ironman and forgetting that you kill him so 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.140
 there is always an answer before all 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.519
 problems and the answer in this case is 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.519
 Russian very Russian 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.030
 today 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.720
 Y 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.310
 220 shots per minute an accuracy 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.350
 ridiculous for a shotgun 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.390
 semiautomatic and also pellets in 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.190
 each cartridge this is a Russian animated 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.750
 the logical saga is amazing the truth 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.610
 is that he has had a lot of fun playing 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.280
 with her because she is a whore 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.780
 butcher how they fall but in the 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.340
 first you can give them in the second 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.140
 everything you want pam pam pam ya 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.480
 take it for ass come your is pieces out 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.950
 the champions that fall like flies uncle and 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.690
 is that if I have to recommend some 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.160
 things is certainly this because it is that the 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.330
 non-automatic sensei you can run and 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.220
 shoot like a madman that there is no 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.600
 problem the lead will do the rest you just 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.130
 you have to point more or less where 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.180
 are your enemies and ready and if you have 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.520
 that attack media over long distances 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.930
 then you play it post and it's already pointed 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.580
 head and kill and if you're short 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.470
 distances and failures some it does not pass 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.850
 nothing man has seven cartridges and 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.260
 even 11 if you put the charger 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.970
 extended there is no problem because 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.710
 fail you stop carrying in your vein 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.450
 Russian and it is with all you do not believe all 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.950
 we have a little Russian inside when 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.750
 let's take this shotgun we start 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.400
 listen to a little hardcore music 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.810
 and we started to return the Russians really 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.920
 bursting everyone who puts us 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.240
 ahead 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.890
 he wanted to look 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.119
 I have the gun that shoots your face 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.590
 life is worth nothing in the back anymore 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.610
 pointed in the ass of glass nadia is not 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.770
 as cash as a shot in the temple 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.300
 Friday 7 peak and train style 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.950
 I have the motive and some will tell me 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.450
 fuck fonso but as you recommend this 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.550
 shotgun if everyone knows that the 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.260
 more versatile in the more 12 compost 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.630
 yes the most versatile in the pastas of 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.370
 compost but it's the funniest area or 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.410
 10 ships of viviers is because I do not 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.209
 have so much fun guy to me the yes yes salgado 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.160
 that gives me a special fun will be 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.690
 10 meters from the enemy and see how it jumps 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.580
 everything in the air with you do not know if you're 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.170
 you or the enemy are giving cane without 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.880
 stop and also approaching you left 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.530
 dude, this gun is awesome 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.120
 Also if you get bored and want to work 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.650
 a little bit by you put a look with 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.569
 enough increases a little later is 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.900
 and you can get out of the people seats to 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.130
 this because they say pan wafer like cream or 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.959
 Shotgun one sling comfort yes 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.549
 he attended but this guy is getting it 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.590
 I'm crazy but I'm fucking fucking 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.090
 with the exit and is that gentlemen not 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.470
 let's forget that this is still a 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.060
 game many times we have to be 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.739
 concentrated trying to win but 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.450
 it also has good to have an option that 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.859
 relieve us or take away all the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.000
 nerves that makes us laugh 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.820
 and no doubt there are 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.620
 is that gun takes the lead tree with 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.780
 a loader extended a few looks 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.550
 increases and you'll see how they start to fall 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.380
 in front of you and sometimes you will be killed 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.910
 behind of course but and the times that 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.070
 you did a kim suppression to quadruple 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.390
 who takes that off as a motherfucker and 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.920
 it is given more than to restore a bit 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.540
 Put yourself post and a look of enough 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.250
 increases and you'll laugh with the 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.810
 guiris let's start to know the chat 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.340
 and smoke, I hope you liked it 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.930
 this recommendation a little bit more 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.400
 a bit more for 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.650
 have fun do not always have to take the 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.180
 more weapon in a more polyvalent plan or the 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.500
 better sometimes you also have to choose a 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.000
 funniest weapon I hope that has 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.390
 liked a greeting and see you in the 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.390
 battlefield
