because there is no sight so he's going

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
they lose those first overlord or two so

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.520 
they lose those first overlord or two so
extractor<00:02:48.420> coming<00:02:48.720> down<00:02:48.840> now<00:02:49.080> we're<00:02:49.320> going<00:02:49.470> to

me<00:03:00.480> fast<00:03:00.780> expansion<00:03:01.200> coming<00:03:01.530> down<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.010> it

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
me fast expansion coming down and it

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.870 
me fast expansion coming down and it
looks<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.270> was<00:03:03.390> around<00:03:03.600> 16<00:03:04.020> and<00:03:04.880> we're

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
looks like that was around 16 and we're

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.460 
looks like that was around 16 and we're
seeing<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.330> spawn<00:03:06.600> larvae<00:03:06.990> from<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.260> queen

well<00:03:23.519> that<00:03:23.760> was<00:03:23.940> probably<00:03:24.269> done<00:03:24.480> right<00:03:24.750> after

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
well that was probably done right after

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.050 
well that was probably done right after
the<00:03:25.170> barracks<00:03:25.500> completed<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.400> course<00:03:26.640> it's<00:03:26.940> a

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
the barracks completed of course it's a

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.150 
the barracks completed of course it's a
hundred<00:03:27.300> and<00:03:27.480> fifty<00:03:27.780> minerals<00:03:28.140> but<00:03:28.830> gives<00:03:29.070> you

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
hundred and fifty minerals but gives you

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.699 
hundred and fifty minerals but gives you
that<00:03:29.280> mule<00:03:29.640> which<00:03:29.910> returns<00:03:30.300> about<00:03:30.709> 290

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
that mule which returns about 290

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.280 
that mule which returns about 290
minerals<00:03:32.070> in<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.880> 90<00:03:33.239> seconds<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.110> is

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
minerals in the 90 seconds that it is

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.390 
minerals in the 90 seconds that it is
alive<00:03:35.000> so<00:03:36.000> yeah<00:03:36.630> very<00:03:37.140> very<00:03:37.560> cost<00:03:37.890> effective

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
alive so yeah very very cost effective

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.690 
alive so yeah very very cost effective
