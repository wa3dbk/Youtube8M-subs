extra to regenerate on that's only to

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.880 
extra to regenerate on that's only to
get<00:04:05.770> them<00:04:05.890> to<00:04:06.040> level<00:04:06.280> two<00:04:06.550> so<00:04:07.510> if<00:04:07.630> i<00:04:07.750> upgrade<00:04:07.960> it

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890

takes<00:04:09.400> a<00:04:09.580> builder<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:11.230> as<00:04:11.500> you<00:04:11.890> can<00:04:12.040> see<00:04:12.400> it's

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
takes a builder so as you can see it's

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.630 
takes a builder so as you can see it's
like<00:04:13.570> if<00:04:13.750> you<00:04:13.870> needed<00:04:14.320> a<00:04:14.410> builder<00:04:14.830> to<00:04:15.070> upgrade

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
like if you needed a builder to upgrade

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.539 
like if you needed a builder to upgrade
a<00:04:15.670> unit<00:04:16.330> it's<00:04:16.810> not<00:04:17.020> like<00:04:17.200> a<00:04:17.260> laboratory<00:04:17.860> so<00:04:18.520> I

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
a unit it's not like a laboratory so I

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.410 
a unit it's not like a laboratory so I
actually<00:04:18.850> can't<00:04:19.330> do<00:04:19.510> that<00:04:19.660> right<00:04:19.720> now<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:22.060> this

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
actually can't do that right now so this

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.910 
actually can't do that right now so this
is<00:04:22.450> something<00:04:22.780> i'm<00:04:23.050> going<00:04:23.200> to<00:04:23.260> do<00:04:23.470> with<00:04:23.710> the

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
is something i'm going to do with the

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.910 
is something i'm going to do with the
collector<00:04:24.690> this<00:04:25.690> one<00:04:25.960> it<00:04:26.080> finishes<00:04:26.590> tomorrow

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
collector this one it finishes tomorrow

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.270 
collector this one it finishes tomorrow
and<00:04:27.460> this<00:04:28.270> one<00:04:28.510> will<00:04:28.690> probably<00:04:28.960> be<00:04:29.590> for<00:04:29.860> my<00:04:29.980> air

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
and this one will probably be for my air

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.900 
and this one will probably be for my air
since<00:04:30.670> the<00:04:30.850> air<00:04:31.030> is<00:04:31.210> very<00:04:31.270> long<00:04:31.750> to<00:04:32.020> upgrade<00:04:32.910> so

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
since the air is very long to upgrade so

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.870 
since the air is very long to upgrade so
in<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.570> fight<00:04:34.920> you<00:04:35.920> saw<00:04:36.130> that<00:04:36.160> i<00:04:36.370> made<00:04:36.580> a<00:04:36.610> lot

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
in the fight you saw that i made a lot

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.830 
in the fight you saw that i made a lot

statue<00:04:56.080> of<00:04:56.230> Pekka<00:04:56.530> okay<00:04:57.000> as<00:04:58.000> you<00:04:58.540> can<00:04:58.570> see<00:04:58.690> when

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
statue of Pekka okay as you can see when

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.680 
statue of Pekka okay as you can see when
I<00:04:59.050> move<00:04:59.350> out<00:04:59.560> you<00:04:59.890> see<00:05:00.070> there's<00:05:00.250> like<00:05:00.940> five

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
I move out you see there's like five

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.950 
I move out you see there's like five
zoom<00:05:01.990> in<00:05:02.170> you<00:05:02.890> can<00:05:02.920> see<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.510> lines<00:05:04.510> that<00:05:04.720> are

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
zoom in you can see the lines that are

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.020 
zoom in you can see the lines that are
like<00:05:05.200> sort<00:05:05.560> of<00:05:05.680> doing<00:05:06.160> like<00:05:06.310> little<00:05:06.700> squares

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
like sort of doing like little squares

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.150 
like sort of doing like little squares
that<00:05:07.150> are<00:05:07.300> white<00:05:07.600> those<00:05:08.500> are<00:05:08.710> where<00:05:08.890> he<00:05:09.010> could

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
that are white those are where he could

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.240 
that are white those are where he could
put<00:05:09.370> units<00:05:09.810> but<00:05:10.810> as<00:05:11.110> you<00:05:11.440> can<00:05:11.530> see<00:05:11.740> if<00:05:11.860> I<00:05:11.980> move

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
put units but as you can see if I move

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.750 
put units but as you can see if I move
here<00:05:12.910> there's<00:05:13.630> a<00:05:13.720> little<00:05:13.930> square<00:05:14.260> right<00:05:14.560> here

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
here there's a little square right here

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.850 
here there's a little square right here
he<00:05:15.760> could<00:05:16.030> put<00:05:16.300> units<00:05:16.630> in<00:05:16.870> there<00:05:17.080> I<00:05:17.290> think<00:05:17.680> so

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
he could put units in there I think so

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.650 
he could put units in there I think so
if<00:05:18.040> it's<00:05:18.190> big<00:05:18.430> enough<00:05:18.460> but<00:05:19.300> it's<00:05:19.420> like<00:05:19.540> an

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
if it's big enough but it's like an

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.120 
if it's big enough but it's like an

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.780 
and then I put the PEC a statue in front
here<00:05:43.810> you<00:05:44.380> can<00:05:44.530> only<00:05:44.680> start<00:05:45.010> putting<00:05:45.280> units<00:05:45.670> in
