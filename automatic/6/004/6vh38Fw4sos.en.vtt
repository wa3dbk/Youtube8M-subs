this is a guide to the proving grounds

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.499 
this is a guide to the proving grounds
this<00:00:09.260> is<00:00:09.440> the<00:00:09.559> healer<00:00:09.889> trial<00:00:10.370> and<00:00:10.639> this<00:00:11.389> is

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:11.509 
this is the healer trial and this is

this is the healer trial and this is
bronze<00:00:11.870> difficulty<00:00:12.849> so<00:00:13.849> we'll<00:00:14.120> just<00:00:14.269> walk

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
bronze difficulty so we'll just walk

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.299 
bronze difficulty so we'll just walk
through<00:00:14.599> the<00:00:14.780> basics<00:00:15.169> here<00:00:15.379> to<00:00:15.860> get<00:00:16.190> you

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
of course do damage yourself but with

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.890 
of course do damage yourself but with

really gear up for these in particular

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.830 
really gear up for these in particular
get<00:01:09.469> gear<00:01:09.950> with<00:01:10.280> his<00:01:10.460> mini<00:01:10.700> sockets<00:01:11.240> in<00:01:11.509> each

slot as possible and then optimize your

slot as possible and then optimize your
gems<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:15.049> you'll<00:01:16.009> be<00:01:16.189> good<00:01:16.429> to<00:01:16.490> go<00:01:17.829> so<00:01:18.829> the

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
gems and you'll be good to go so the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.779 
gems and you'll be good to go so the
bronze<00:01:19.249> is<00:01:19.460> pretty<00:01:19.640> simple<00:01:20.079> I<00:01:21.789> hadn't

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
bronze is pretty simple I hadn't

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.870 
bronze is pretty simple I hadn't
reforged<00:01:23.509> my<00:01:23.689> year<00:01:23.990> prior<00:01:24.799> to<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.039> doing

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
reforged my year prior to this doing

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.980 
reforged my year prior to this doing
this<00:01:25.969> so<00:01:27.130> getting<00:01:28.130> downgraded<00:01:28.759> to<00:01:28.789> 463<00:01:29.509> meant

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
this so getting downgraded to 463 meant

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.739 
this so getting downgraded to 463 meant
that<00:01:30.140> my<00:01:30.259> spirit<00:01:30.530> was<00:01:30.619> really<00:01:31.009> really<00:01:31.159> low<00:01:31.369> so

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749 
that my spirit was really really low so

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:34.179 
that my spirit was really really low so
I<00:01:32.749> have<00:01:32.899> to<00:01:33.020> sort<00:01:33.289> of<00:01:33.380> concern<00:01:33.710> man<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.100> the

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
I have to sort of concern man and the

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.870 
I have to sort of concern man and the
latter<00:01:34.369> half<00:01:34.460> of<00:01:34.729> this<00:01:35.679> but<00:01:36.679> overall<00:01:36.920> if<00:01:37.640> you

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
latter half of this but overall if you

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.270 
latter half of this but overall if you
look<00:01:37.909> at<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.240> damage<00:01:38.630> meter<00:01:38.960> in<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.409> right<00:01:40.100> of

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
look at the damage meter in the right of

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.999 
look at the damage meter in the right of
the<00:01:40.340> map<00:01:40.520> there<00:01:40.729> you<00:01:40.909> can<00:01:41.090> see<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:42.009> damage

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
the map there you can see the damage

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.730 
the map there you can see the damage
that<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:43.399> various<00:01:43.729> NPCs<00:01:44.149> are<00:01:44.179> doing<00:01:44.539> so<00:01:45.499> it's

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
that the various NPCs are doing so it's

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.309 
that the various NPCs are doing so it's
pretty<00:01:45.889> evenly<00:01:46.280> split<00:01:46.579> you<00:01:47.329> know<00:01:47.479> DPS<00:01:48.170> are

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
pretty evenly split you know DPS are

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.300 
pretty evenly split you know DPS are
doing<00:01:48.530> more<00:01:48.710> than<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:49.039> tank<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.579> little<00:01:50.090> bit

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
doing more than the tank a little bit

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.499 
doing more than the tank a little bit
but<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.639> kind<00:01:52.850> of<00:01:52.939> numbers<00:01:53.210> that<00:01:53.240> you're

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
but the kind of numbers that you're

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.510 
but the kind of numbers that you're
going<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.659> see<00:01:53.869> are<00:01:54.200> probably<00:01:55.130> quite<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.369> bit

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
going to see are probably quite a bit

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.840 
going to see are probably quite a bit
higher<00:01:55.670> than<00:01:55.939> most<00:01:56.289> healers<00:01:57.289> can<00:01:57.590> do<00:01:57.850> so

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
higher than most healers can do so

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.279 
higher than most healers can do so
you're<00:01:59.119> probably<00:01:59.329> better<00:01:59.539> off<00:01:59.659> spending<00:02:00.020> your

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
you're probably better off spending your

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.340 
you're probably better off spending your
mana<00:02:00.530> solely<00:02:01.100> on<00:02:01.280> healing<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.359> after<00:02:03.259> this

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
mana solely on healing so after this

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.840 
mana solely on healing so after this
bronze<00:02:03.649> one<00:02:03.889> I<00:02:03.920> sort<00:02:04.189> of<00:02:04.249> learned<00:02:04.459> that<00:02:04.670> doing

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
bronze one I sort of learned that doing

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.209 
bronze one I sort of learned that doing
the<00:02:05.030> silver<00:02:05.329> in<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.450> gold<00:02:05.749> and<00:02:05.979> focus<00:02:06.979> more<00:02:07.189> on

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219

silver and the gold but for now they're

pretty basic mom's the tank will pick

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.310 
pretty basic mom's the tank will pick
them<00:02:26.340> all<00:02:26.430> up<00:02:26.460> so<00:02:26.790> most<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:27.780> your<00:02:27.900> healing<00:02:28.170> will

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
them all up so most of your healing will

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.480 
them all up so most of your healing will
be<00:02:28.440> on<00:02:28.710> auto<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.670> warrior<00:02:30.060> tank<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:32.310> make

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
be on auto the warrior tank and so make

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.380 
be on auto the warrior tank and so make
sure<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.730> focus<00:02:32.970> in<00:02:33.270> primarily<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:36.120> don't

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
sure you focus in primarily you don't

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.390 
sure you focus in primarily you don't
really<00:02:36.570> have<00:02:36.900> any<00:02:37.230> out<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.560> combat<00:02:37.980> time

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
really have any out of combat time

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.460 
really have any out of combat time
between<00:02:38.910> waves<00:02:39.300> are<00:02:39.540> always<00:02:39.840> in<00:02:39.930> combat<00:02:40.320> for

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
between waves are always in combat for

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.440 
between waves are always in combat for
the<00:02:40.560> entire<00:02:40.770> duration<00:02:40.920> but<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.000> should<00:02:42.240> have

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
the entire duration but you should have

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.940 
the entire duration but you should have
time<00:02:42.780> between<00:02:42.990> Williams<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.620> just<00:02:43.800> stand

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
time between Williams to just stand

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.160 
time between Williams to just stand
there<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.190> regen<00:02:44.700> usually<00:02:45.660> they<00:02:45.780> will<00:02:45.930> kill

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
there and regen usually they will kill

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.930 
there and regen usually they will kill
things<00:02:46.410> off<00:02:46.590> before<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.250> next<00:02:47.370> wave<00:02:47.490> spawns

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
things off before the next wave spawns

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.180 
things off before the next wave spawns
so<00:02:48.810> here<00:02:48.960> you<00:02:49.080> can<00:02:49.140> see<00:02:49.350> there's<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.590> 10-second

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
so here you can see there's a 10-second

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.120 
so here you can see there's a 10-second
window<00:02:50.280> or<00:02:50.580> so<00:02:50.760> or<00:02:51.630> just<00:02:52.020> able<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.620> sit<00:02:53.010> here

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
window or so or just able to sit here

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.530 
window or so or just able to sit here
and<00:02:53.190> regen<00:02:53.580> with<00:02:53.760> my<00:02:53.880> normal<00:02:54.180> spirit

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
and regen with my normal spirit

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.050 
and regen with my normal spirit
regeneration<00:02:55.490> so<00:02:56.490> this<00:02:56.640> would<00:02:56.760> also<00:02:56.850> be<00:02:57.030> a

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
regeneration so this would also be a

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.750 
regeneration so this would also be a
good<00:02:57.270> time<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.480> use<00:02:57.630> any<00:02:57.900> on-demand<00:02:58.860> regen

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
good time to use any on-demand regen

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.850 
good time to use any on-demand regen
cooldowns<00:03:00.150> here<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.200> can<00:03:01.320> see<00:03:01.440> me<00:03:01.530> looking<00:03:01.770> at

having trouble with this in terms of
