towel and I like to have this big beach
towel<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.210> me<00:00:57.420> because<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.410> can<00:00:58.530> also<00:00:58.710> double

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
as a beach blanket if I needed to and

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.539 
as a beach blanket if I needed to and
the<00:01:04.019> first<00:01:04.320> thing<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.799> have<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.280> here<00:01:05.489> is

the first thing that I have in here is

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.969 
the first thing that I have in here is
probably<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.420> most<00:01:06.450> important<00:01:07.229> thing<00:01:07.439> if<00:01:07.920> I

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
probably the most important thing if I

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.590 
probably the most important thing if I
could<00:01:08.070> only<00:01:08.250> take<00:01:08.610> one<00:01:08.909> thing<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.450> beach

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
could only take one thing to the beach

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.140 
could only take one thing to the beach
it<00:01:09.869> would<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.430> my<00:01:11.760> banana

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
it would be this and this is my banana

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.830

boat<00:01:12.450> SPF<00:01:13.439> 110<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.420> believe<00:01:15.689> it's

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
boat SPF 110 and I just believe it's

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.200 
boat SPF 110 and I just believe it's
very<00:01:15.930> important<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.040> high<00:01:17.369> SPF<00:01:17.729> and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
very important to have a high SPF and

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.899 
very important to have a high SPF and
this<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.450> also<00:01:18.740> waterproof<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.280> sweat<00:01:20.520> proof

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
this is also waterproof and sweat proof

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.030 
this is also waterproof and sweat proof
and<00:01:21.180> all<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.509> for<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.869> beach<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.860> just

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
and all that for the beach so you just

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.100 
and all that for the beach so you just
go<00:01:23.189> ahead<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.400> spray<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.150> your<00:01:24.180> whole<00:01:24.869> body
