be<00:03:35.239> but<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.299> know<00:03:36.480> what<00:03:36.750> I'm<00:03:36.810> gonna<00:03:36.959> do<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.470> I

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
be but I know what I'm gonna do and I

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.220 
be but I know what I'm gonna do and I
say<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.459> was<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.820> product's<00:03:39.390> ordination<00:03:40.080> that's

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
say I was a product's ordination that's

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.710 
say I was a product's ordination that's
why<00:03:40.380> i<00:03:40.410> curled<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:40.830> up<00:03:40.950> but<00:03:41.549> anytime<00:03:41.880> i<00:03:42.090> use<00:03:42.420> a

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
why i curled it up but anytime i use a

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.440 
why i curled it up but anytime i use a
gel<00:03:43.260> or<00:03:43.530> something<00:03:44.130> with<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.340> consistency<00:03:45.090> I

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
gel or something with that consistency I

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.130 
gel or something with that consistency I
want<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.049> use<00:03:46.140> water<00:03:46.470> first<00:03:47.840> because<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:49.080> don't

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
want to use water first because I don't

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.940 
want to use water first because I don't
want<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.920> dry<00:03:50.190> my<00:03:50.400> hair<00:03:50.610> out<00:03:51.080> and<00:03:52.080> also<00:03:52.920> I

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
want that to dry my hair out and also I

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.020 
want that to dry my hair out and also I
don't<00:03:53.160> want<00:03:53.459> it<00:03:53.519> to<00:03:53.670> leave<00:03:53.820> no<00:03:54.000> white<00:03:54.269> residue

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
don't want it to leave no white residue

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.759 
don't want it to leave no white residue
so<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.060> just<00:03:57.299> use<00:03:57.540> a<00:03:57.570> little<00:03:57.810> bit<00:03:58.380> just<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.739> little

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
so I just use a little bit just a little

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.580 
so I just use a little bit just a little
bit<00:03:59.040> of<00:03:59.130> water<00:03:59.250> only<00:03:59.520> on<00:03:59.819> my<00:03:59.940> images

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
bit of water only on my images

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.290 
bit of water only on my images
I don't<00:04:02.010> want<00:04:02.190> this<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.370> build<00:04:02.730> up<00:04:02.910> any<00:04:03.060> white

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
I don't want this to build up any white

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.880 
I don't want this to build up any white
residue<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.959> because<00:04:04.170> if<00:04:04.319> you<00:04:04.410> just<00:04:04.590> put<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:04.830> on

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
residue it because if you just put it on

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.979 
residue it because if you just put it on
dry<00:04:05.160> hair<00:04:05.190> that's<00:04:05.670> what<00:04:05.849> it<00:04:06.000> may<00:04:06.239> tend<00:04:06.569> to<00:04:06.840> do

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
dry hair that's what it may tend to do

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.869 
dry hair that's what it may tend to do
so<00:04:07.739> I<00:04:08.099> kind<00:04:08.550> of<00:04:08.640> put<00:04:08.879> water<00:04:09.150> there<00:04:09.590> okay<00:04:10.590> I<00:04:10.879> took

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
so I kind of put water there okay I took

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.170 
so I kind of put water there okay I took
a<00:04:12.239> little<00:04:12.450> bit<00:04:12.629> of<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:13.200> edge<00:04:13.950> control<00:04:14.250> when<00:04:15.150> I

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
a little bit of the edge control when I

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.849 
a little bit of the edge control when I
rub<00:04:15.629> it<00:04:15.750> through<00:04:15.780> my<00:04:15.989> fingers<00:04:16.049> to<00:04:16.410> kind<00:04:16.799> of

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
rub it through my fingers to kind of

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.560

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
puff going and yeah i like it i mean i

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.320 
puff going and yeah i like it i mean i
think<00:05:38.960> that<00:05:39.319> it<00:05:39.439> really<00:05:39.469> holds<00:05:40.069> my<00:05:40.729> edges<00:05:41.120> down

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
think that it really holds my edges down

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.629 
think that it really holds my edges down
they're<00:05:42.259> not<00:05:42.409> close<00:05:42.800> enough<00:05:43.009> all<00:05:43.219> over<00:05:43.520> the

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
they're not close enough all over the

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.390 
they're not close enough all over the
place<00:05:43.879> and<00:05:44.150> I<00:05:44.539> saw<00:05:44.840> this<00:05:45.349> headband<00:05:45.979> it's

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
place and I saw this headband it's

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.089 
place and I saw this headband it's
pretty<00:05:46.849> tight<00:05:47.210> so<00:05:47.930> it<00:05:47.960> kinda<00:05:48.530> it's<00:05:48.680> not<00:05:48.800> really

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:49.099 
pretty tight so it kinda it's not really

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.189 
pretty tight so it kinda it's not really
tight<00:05:49.370> but<00:05:49.729> it's<00:05:49.849> a<00:05:50.210> new<00:05:50.330> hair<00:05:50.509> being<00:05:50.750> so<00:05:50.960> it<00:05:51.080> is

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
tight but it's a new hair being so it is

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.679 
tight but it's a new hair being so it is
tighter<00:05:51.469> then<00:05:51.979> it<00:05:52.310> can<00:05:52.610> hold<00:05:52.969> my<00:05:53.210> edges<00:05:53.539> back

00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:53.689 
tighter then it can hold my edges back

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:57.580 
tighter then it can hold my edges back
more<00:05:54.139> but<00:05:55.099> um<00:05:55.340> I<00:05:56.029> mean<00:05:56.810> it<00:05:56.960> does<00:05:57.139> what<00:05:57.439> it's

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
more but um I mean it does what it's

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.980 
more but um I mean it does what it's
supposed<00:05:57.650> to<00:05:58.039> do<00:05:58.219> it<00:05:58.520> is<00:05:58.699> a<00:05:58.729> edge<00:05:59.090> control<00:05:59.449> and

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
supposed to do it is a edge control and

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.830 
supposed to do it is a edge control and
again<00:06:00.650> i<00:06:00.680> did<00:06:01.069> still<00:06:01.430> put<00:06:01.699> water<00:06:02.000> on<00:06:02.120> my<00:06:02.419> edges
