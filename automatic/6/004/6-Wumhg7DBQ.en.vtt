00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.330
 In the spotlight: The butcher 

00:00:18.434 --> 00:00:22.531
 Only a few records of the Horadrim of Sanctuary tell of a demon 

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:24.367
 known as "The Butcher". 

00:00:24.797 --> 00:00:28.762
 He has been spotted twice so far, more than 20 years apart. 

00:00:29.255 --> 00:00:34.098
 Countless victims succumbed to the horror of this monstrosity when threatening Tristram, 

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:38.970
 and rumors say that this demon of body parts is made up of other demons. 

00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:45.774
 Therefore, he considers all living and undead beings only as individual parts. 

00:00:48.971 --> 00:00:51.385
 The Butcher is a brutal melee assassin, 

00:00:51.536 --> 00:00:56.305
 which nourishes its high damage by eating up its victims. 

00:00:57.885 --> 00:01:00.184
 The butcher's characteristic is fresh meat. 

00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:03.446
 If an enemy dies nearby, it drops fresh meat. 

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:06.733
 Servants drop a single piece as heroes drop three. 

00:01:06.884 --> 00:01:11.966
 Each piece of meat collected increases its attack damage permanently until death. 

00:01:12.552 --> 00:01:15.129
 The butcher's first ability is mutilation. 

00:01:15.477 --> 00:01:19.060
 He strikes with his cruel ax, causing damage 

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:22.270
 and slows down enemies in a long stretched area. 

00:01:22.943 --> 00:01:25.610
 The next ability is called branding. 

00:01:26.116 --> 00:01:31.003
 The butcher hurls his sickle forward and marks his target for 5 seconds, 

00:01:31.154 --> 00:01:36.691
 whereby his automatic attacks on the target heal him for 75% of the damage caused. 

00:01:36.988 --> 00:01:39.560
 When used on Heroes, the healing is doubled. 

00:01:40.553 --> 00:01:44.476
 The butcher's last basic skill is Brachial Rush. 

00:01:44.796 --> 00:01:49.392
 Like a nightmare the butcher storms towards a target and becomes unstoppable. 

00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:53.823
 When he reaches his target, the butcher inflicts and stuns his victim. 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.450
 Melting furnace is the butcher's first heroic option. 

00:01:59.526 --> 00:02:03.992
 After a delay of 3 seconds, the butcher lights up the fire, 

00:02:04.143 --> 00:02:06.481
 inflicting tremendous damage to nearby enemies. 

00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:10.367
 This ability can be used in conjunction with the Brachial Rush. 

00:02:11.387 --> 00:02:15.190
 The butcher's second heroic ability is to deliver the knife. 

00:02:15.684 --> 00:02:17.624
 He rams a stake into the ground at the destination 

00:02:17.775 --> 00:02:21.583
 and, after a short delay, chains the next opposing hero to the stake. 

00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:26.869
 Escape attempts only lead to the victim being dragged back into the sphere of influence. 

00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:30.881
 The early game phase is extremely important to the butcher. 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.714
 You have to collect as much fresh meat as possible before the team fights begin. 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.464
 The butcher can receive large quantities of meat, 

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:42.190
 by killing servants in the ways and eating their flesh. 

00:02:42.885 --> 00:02:45.670
 Another option is to aggressively move forward with a partner 

00:02:45.821 --> 00:02:48.759
 and to kill enemy heroes early on. 

00:02:49.047 --> 00:02:52.214
 But be careful because the butcher with this strategy 

00:02:52.365 --> 00:02:57.701
 can easily lose his fresh meat pile if he dies in a push. 

00:02:58.451 --> 00:03:02.596
 Once he has the maximum number of meat stacks, the butcher should focus on 

00:03:02.747 --> 00:03:05.257
 Isolate enemies with the Brachial Rush. 

00:03:05.928 --> 00:03:09.567
 Charges for an opponent with low health and brand it. 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.027
 Use mutilations if he tries to escape. 

00:03:12.397 --> 00:03:15.144
 With few automatic attacks and good positioning 

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:18.369
 The butcher can kill almost any enemy. 

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:23.299
 Delivering to the knife is a great help in isolating targets. 

00:03:23.807 --> 00:03:26.201
 Use this heroic ability to initiate a fight 

00:03:26.252 --> 00:03:30.957
 or keep away important opponents, so that your team is in the majority. 

00:03:32.048 --> 00:03:37.052
 You should choose Melting Furnace if you want to get more damage done to accomplish goals. 

00:03:37.442 --> 00:03:39.829
 Most of what you get out of this ability 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.032
 when the butcher can thereby hit more than two targets. 

00:03:44.355 --> 00:03:46.737
 When you face the butcher, 

00:03:46.888 --> 00:03:50.365
 then isolate him and bring him as a team quickly to the track. 

00:03:51.028 --> 00:03:54.180
 If you can prevent him from healing by branding, 

00:03:54.331 --> 00:03:57.229
 he does not stand up to a focused attack. 

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:01.367
 FRESH MEAT! 

00:04:05.484 --> 00:04:09.831
