00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
look around the device let's get rid of

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.330 
look around the device let's get rid of
all<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.460> plastic<00:01:45.560> like<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.649> said<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
all this plastic like I said this is the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.670 
all this plastic like I said this is the
black<00:01:48.060> version<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.229> Wi-Fi<00:01:49.649> only

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
black version and it's the Wi-Fi only

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.530 
black version and it's the Wi-Fi only
version<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.640> there<00:01:50.850> will<00:01:51.000> be<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.149> couple<00:01:51.360> of

camera<00:04:03.880> on<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.299> new<00:04:04.450> ipad<00:04:04.900> 4<00:04:05.170> then<00:04:05.739> one<00:04:06.040> on<00:04:06.280> the

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
camera on the new ipad 4 then one on the

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.330 
camera on the new ipad 4 then one on the
older<00:04:07.060> device<00:04:07.390> of<00:04:07.690> course<00:04:08.079> the<00:04:08.650> changes<00:04:09.130> are

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
older device of course the changes are

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.819 
older device of course the changes are
mostly<00:04:09.760> inside<00:04:10.360> this<00:04:11.049> one<00:04:11.230> is<00:04:11.410> built<00:04:11.620> on<00:04:11.769> a

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
mostly inside this one is built on a

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.979 
mostly inside this one is built on a
newer<00:04:12.070> platform<00:04:12.670> it's<00:04:12.820> a<00:04:12.910> lot<00:04:13.060> faster<00:04:13.450> it's

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
newer platform it's a lot faster it's

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.949 
newer platform it's a lot faster it's
more<00:04:14.260> efficient<00:04:14.829> so<00:04:14.950> it<00:04:15.100> should<00:04:15.370> it<00:04:16.269> while<00:04:16.840> it

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
more efficient so it should it while it

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.659 
more efficient so it should it while it
is<00:04:17.109> faster<00:04:17.530> it<00:04:17.680> should<00:04:17.919> run<00:04:18.190> for<00:04:18.400> pretty<00:04:18.579> much

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
is faster it should run for pretty much

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.380 
is faster it should run for pretty much
the<00:04:18.880> same<00:04:19.769> time<00:04:20.769> you<00:04:21.430> get<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.729> same<00:04:21.940> battery

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
the same time you get the same battery

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.060 
the same time you get the same battery
life<00:04:22.570> out<00:04:22.840> of<00:04:22.870> it<00:04:23.110> as<00:04:23.440> you<00:04:24.250> used<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.669> get

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
life out of it as you used to get

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.880 
life out of it as you used to get
to<00:04:25.250> get<00:04:25.460> on<00:04:25.640> the<00:04:25.730> ipad<00:04:26.060> 3<00:04:26.500> but<00:04:27.500> it<00:04:27.620> will<00:04:27.740> be

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
to get on the ipad 3 but it will be

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.680 
to get on the ipad 3 but it will be
faster<00:04:28.250> if<00:04:28.370> we<00:04:28.430> played<00:04:28.700> games<00:04:28.910> better<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.480> all

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
faster if we played games better and all

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.050 
faster if we played games better and all
this<00:04:29.870> all<00:04:30.320> these<00:04:30.470> things<00:04:30.740> ok<00:04:31.610> are<00:04:31.730> now<00:04:31.850> going
