here<00:03:38.850> almost<00:03:39.030> inverted<00:03:40.340> I've<00:03:41.340> lost<00:03:41.610> about<00:03:42.080> two

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.810 
here almost inverted I've lost about two
or<00:03:43.290> three<00:03:43.320> inches<00:03:43.530> in<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.040> back<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:44.610> now<00:03:44.760> the

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
or three inches in the back so now the

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.390 
or three inches in the back so now the
front<00:03:45.239> sets<00:03:45.450> up<00:03:45.630> higher<00:03:45.810> than<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.230> back<00:03:49.370> so<00:03:50.370> I

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
front sets up higher than the back so I

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.670 
front sets up higher than the back so I
ordered<00:03:50.880> add<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.870> leaf<00:03:52.290> from<00:03:52.620> tough<00:03:53.100> country

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.350 
the ones for the rears and I got them
and<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.560> didn't<00:03:58.800> come<00:03:58.920> with<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.370> hardware

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
and it didn't come with the hardware

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.580 
and it didn't come with the hardware
package<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.200> I<00:04:01.260> can't<00:04:01.500> even<00:04:01.620> vote<00:04:01.830> them<00:04:02.040> up<00:04:03.590> but

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
package so I can't even vote them up but

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.720 
package so I can't even vote them up but
call<00:04:04.800> them<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.100> they're<00:04:05.190> going<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.400> send<00:04:05.610> it

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
call them and they're going to send it

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.100 
call them and they're going to send it
out<00:04:06.320> so<00:04:07.320> I<00:04:08.030> should<00:04:09.030> put<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.390> ass<00:04:09.510> end<00:04:09.870> back<00:04:10.080> up

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.130 
out so I should put the ass end back up
pretty<00:04:10.560> good<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:11.300> as<00:04:12.300> you<00:04:12.600> see<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:12.810> didn't<00:04:13.080> have

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
pretty good and as you see I didn't have

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.380 
pretty good and as you see I didn't have
to<00:04:13.290> do<00:04:13.410> any<00:04:13.620> trimming<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:15.000> my<00:04:15.120> bumper<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:18.150> rubs

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
to do any trimming to my bumper it rubs

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.590 
to do any trimming to my bumper it rubs
just<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.900> little<00:04:19.169> bit<00:04:19.320> with<00:04:19.890> these<00:04:20.040> tires<00:04:20.600> and

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
just a little bit with these tires and

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.960 
just a little bit with these tires and
then<00:04:21.690> again<00:04:21.959> they're<00:04:22.200> probably<00:04:22.440> only<00:04:25.250> 45<00:04:26.250> 50<00:04:26.610> %

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
then again they're probably only 45 50 %

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.570 
then again they're probably only 45 50 %
tread<00:04:27.320> there<00:04:28.320> and<00:04:28.590> they<00:04:28.770> were<00:04:28.830> cut<00:04:29.130> with<00:04:29.340> a<00:04:29.370> hot

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:44.580 

I<00:04:41.010> like<00:04:42.010> them<00:04:43.230> probably<00:04:44.230> ought<00:04:44.320> to<00:04:44.350> start

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
I like them probably ought to start

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.380 
I like them probably ought to start
saving<00:04:44.830> up<00:04:45.070> for<00:04:45.100> some<00:04:45.370> new<00:04:45.490> tires<00:04:45.670> in<00:04:46.000> case<00:04:46.180> one

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
saving up for some new tires in case one
