00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.850
 computer it recognizes your cell phone 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.549
 in fastboot mode you have your drives 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.320

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.799
 drives installed here it will not 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.290
 recognize your cell phone 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.110
 it's important the drives are fine then 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.750
 first you get down to riding this 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.729

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.979
 I'm not mistaken then you'll download the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.080
 my program we will use that 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.320
 It's the second one here. 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.420
 he is very small he has not even 17 mega if 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.400
 I'm not mistaken and then you're going to download 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.890
 drives and will also install 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:43.799

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.000
 I did not get out of there so I got 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.250
 Recover team was starting on that 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.720
 there are some cell phones that do not even connect 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.740

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.860
 same thing 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.200

 the list on the site then we'll go 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:31.569
 open the program and you can see that 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:34.539
 in the program which has already recognized 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:36.669
 my connected usb device has to 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.750
 appear here in the program logo 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.150

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.630
 Are you going to squeeze? Go look for 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:48.880
 is the folder that you unzipped 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.370

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.000
 create a brown folder and in here 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.030

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.169
 files everything but it only shows these 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.660
 three here 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.650
 when you enter the program there 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:09.910

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.169
 after that it's very easy you press 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.349

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:23.229
 okay it will begin to recover and your 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:24.159
 It 's really simple, it does not have 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.070
 secret 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:29.620
 but it is a headache because I do not 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.270
 I found no tutorial in a video 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.389
 explaining was the first to do this 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.610
 video then ask you lilic that 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:40.539
 joinha at the moment you press here in 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.789
 start and will load 25 files taxi 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:45.130
 are the pomegranate files on your cell phone 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.409
 then the phone will restart and go 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.419
 restart with that screen does not 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:51.250
 will lose the title of what you did and 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.199
 will restart on that boot screen 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.599
 loader but you can expect a 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.759
 Little is going to come Tart is not going 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.599
 get more grip on that boot screen 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:02.020
 sludge 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:04.090
 make sure that the young person shares 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.370
 the video will help a lot of people there maybe 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.940
 will go through it someday until the 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.940
 next
