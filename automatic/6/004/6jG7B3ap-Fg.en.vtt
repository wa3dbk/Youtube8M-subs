00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:07.290
 fame group 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.290
 presents 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.099
 friends making the colonel route 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.200
 well let's start with the test of 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:27.130
 partner max and who has facilitated us today 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:30.099
 but morelia for this autoparts effect 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.040
 hard is not going to allow us good we're going 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.230
 to help make a delivery so that 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.540
 you see the load capacity that 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.540
 has the maxi partner 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.970
 It should be noted that the ability to 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.290
 load of this utility vehicle 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.690
 weight has 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.000
 good at most to load 800 kilos 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.070
 Now the truth is that we take it 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.080
 like who says half gas but like 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.170
 well you can also load a lot 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.400
 volume that's what we're seeing 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.820
 It is definitely a capacity 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.080
 load very very interesting and good because 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.700
 we have the task of delivering this 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.130
 asked and let's go before we are 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.500
 make it late so we're leaving 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.420
 eric with this load with this load and 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.420
 we continue making route 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.700
 with this we achieve 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.780
 We were able to take our order 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.310
 Take our order thanks to the beautiful 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.350
 maximum partner 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.630
 that's how we said in a vehicle 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.619
 utilitarian is the proposal of pellot 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.390
 for the Mexican market a car that already 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.320
 we saw 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.959
 can load up to 800 kilograms has 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.080
 a pretty enough cargo area 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.940
 wide and well speaking a little 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.980
 all the technical part of the vehicle in the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.319
 power plant is a 1600 engine 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.690
 cubic centimeters with the 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.730
 particularity that it has a 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.260
 turbo diesel engine that helps for a 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.560
 turbocharger and the fuel that 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.110
 used is diesel generating eric 90 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.480
 horsepower that rotate to a maximum 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.570
 of 4,000 revolutions per minute this is 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.070
 very characteristic of diesel engines 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.380
 revolve very little revolutions by 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.280
 minute and that's what allows the 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.800
 fuel consumption is really 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.570
 really low let's say it by comparing it 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.650
 trying it to compare with an engine to 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.450
 internal combustion that uses gasoline 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.900
 practically has yields of 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.490
 double kilometers that some engine of 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.650
 these same characteristics 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.470
 at 90 horsepower the truth a 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.810
 quite interesting torque is very easy 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.250
 very easy to handle very easy to 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.160
 make it reach its maximum performance 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.880
 five-speed manual transmission 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.620
 to the front obviously more the 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.880
 reverse the suspension that I would like 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.280
 to tell us a little about the 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.650
 suspension we have already been doing 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.810
 some tour here urban but the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.340
 suspension the suspension is very 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.750
 Particularly it makes me very good 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.150
 because it's to make a vehicle of 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.980
 work is very comfortable and it is quite 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.900
 comfortable obviously in mind with 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.020
 mcpherson shock absorbers in the part 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:45.370
 front and as well as has 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:48.220
 a shaft that pulls the back 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.069
 the axis obviously serves to tolerate the 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.860
 load and obviously forward it serves to 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.930
 have a little more comfort in the 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.120
 cabin plus the cabin has 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.069
 with space for three people but 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.380
 also has the facility that 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.630
 the 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.790
 middle seat is removed from a 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.190
 button and it can be retracted when 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.280
 It makes a comfortable table if it goes 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.750
 I'm traveling with an extra person 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.150
 nothing more as is the case as we saw 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.190
 Horita eric colonel and I become 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.910
 a very comfortable backup visit 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:24.260
 three seats have a belt 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.610
 security has air conditioning 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.210
 then this allows travel 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.530
 long to warm places and even with 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.150
 the closed glasses or all the 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.640
 characteristics that we can also 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.700
 find is that it has precisely the 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.560
 glasses and electrical insurance and me 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.630
 something that caught my attention is 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.340
 that right here in the center of 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.070
 control of the vehicle 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.170
 we found the electric insurance for 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.540
 all the vehicle and differentiated also 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.370
 for the cargo area is that if 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.470
 we get off if we only go 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.290
 to deliver we can open only the 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.660
 box leaving the safe room here 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.060
 we are seeing part of what is the 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.400
 front with the peyote logo on 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.590
 logo of what is being used in 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.970
 the news that stands out 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:15.090
 front of what is this car and 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.160
 abajito in slightly darker letters 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.020
 they reach to appreciate the acronyms that 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:24.420
 they name the brand and this is how it comes 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:27.630
 part of the phase that comes totally in 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:30.840
 black the headlights that is what he has 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.790
 changed let's say with your predecessor the 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.900
 partner max and already use these headlights 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:39.330
 stylized with that little room on led are 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.270
 obviously halogen lights where 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.850
 they also contain what are the 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:48.270
 directional the windshield is pretty 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:50.730
 wide for a huge visibility towards 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:54.530
 the front what allows then obviously 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:57.000
 better driving the interior space 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.900
 40 cubic meters is what you can 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.870
 load in this maxi partner and also the 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.690
 capacity in kilos are 800 as already 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.030
 we commented on the gross vehicle weight and 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.030
 calmly slashing 2,000 kilograms of 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:14.360
 two the two tons have these 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.729
 hooks inside 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:21.220
 they serve to hold the load either 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:24.910
 with some network with some 5 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:27.610
 with something that helps us to hold the 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:30.220
 load has an attachment that serves 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.020
 pretty light interior light interior 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.820
 because if you are late in your 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:38.290
 integrates into your delivery you will not have any 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:40.150
 kind of problems to deliver what 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.360
 there is what your client has 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:46.660
 requested the floor brings this 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:50.440
 let's say it's a cover in 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:55.410
 plastic to protect the sheet the floor 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.410
 sheet loading space 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.120
 what is the partner max and what can 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:06.000
 meet in the center of Morelia in the center 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.640
 commercial paseo altozano I asked for 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.840
 the financing plans that there 

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.840
 can offer 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.699
 fame group 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.699
 I present
