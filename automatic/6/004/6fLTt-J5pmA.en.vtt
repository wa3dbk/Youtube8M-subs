00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
you guys now i originally wanted to try

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.709 
you guys now i originally wanted to try
this<00:00:50.430> mostly<00:00:50.820> because<00:00:50.969> i<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.270> figure<00:00:51.510> might

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
this mostly because i have figure might

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.389 
this mostly because i have figure might
be<00:00:51.750> nicer<00:00:52.199> for<00:00:52.230> my<00:00:52.500> concealer<00:00:53.010> than<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
be nicer for my concealer than the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.119 
be nicer for my concealer than the
two-faced<00:00:53.820> oh<00:00:54.149> they're<00:00:55.140> about<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.530> same<00:00:55.710> but

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
two-faced oh they're about the same but

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.740 
two-faced oh they're about the same but
this<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.399> cheaper<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.879> i<00:00:56.910> guess<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.360> some

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
this is cheaper so i guess that is some

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.290 
this is cheaper so i guess that is some
a<00:00:57.960> little<00:00:58.710> bit<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.309> know<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.579> money<00:00:59.789> saver<00:01:00.120> to

use<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.539> for<00:01:00.690> my<00:01:00.780> concealer<00:01:01.109> instead<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.440> my

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
use this for my concealer instead of my

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.860 
use this for my concealer instead of my
more<00:01:01.710> expensive<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.100> face<00:01:02.430> but<00:01:03.329> i<00:01:03.600> also
