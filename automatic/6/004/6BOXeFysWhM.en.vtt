be<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.069> highlight<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.550> gunfight<00:03:06.000> they

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
be the highlight of the gunfight they

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.580 
be the highlight of the gunfight they
were<00:03:06.360> unpredictable<00:03:06.840> with<00:03:07.200> their<00:03:07.319> swift

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
were unpredictable with their swift

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.990 
were unpredictable with their swift
movements<00:03:07.980> which<00:03:08.099> kept<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.459> on<00:03:08.580> your<00:03:08.730> toes

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000

there's<00:03:09.510> also<00:03:09.599> one<00:03:09.870> point<00:03:10.079> in<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.200> game<00:03:10.290> where

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
there's also one point in the game where

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.050 
there's also one point in the game where
you<00:03:10.530> had<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.709> infiltrate<00:03:11.129> a<00:03:11.189> mansion<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.849> I

just like no the game it only lasted me

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.059

multiplayer<00:04:05.400> I<00:04:05.760> feel<00:04:06.090> like<00:04:06.180> that<00:04:06.359> could<00:04:06.450> have

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
multiplayer I feel like that could have

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.509 
multiplayer I feel like that could have
really<00:04:06.870> pushed<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.230> game<00:04:07.409> over<00:04:07.859> the<00:04:07.980> top<00:04:08.189> the

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
really pushed the game over the top the

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.490 
really pushed the game over the top the
AI<00:04:08.700> isn't<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.510> brightest<00:04:09.840> they<00:04:10.109> don't<00:04:10.349> move

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
AI isn't the brightest they don't move

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.259 
AI isn't the brightest they don't move
cover<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:10.920> cover<00:04:11.069> so<00:04:11.219> some<00:04:11.549> firefights<00:04:12.000> can<00:04:12.180> be

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
cover to cover so some firefights can be

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.240 
cover to cover so some firefights can be
very<00:04:12.569> easy<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.140> also<00:04:13.500> a<00:04:13.650> lot<00:04:13.920> of<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.099> enemies

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
very easy and also a lot of the enemies

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.250 
very easy and also a lot of the enemies
they<00:04:14.640> look<00:04:14.849> the<00:04:15.000> same<00:04:15.180> all<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.750> humans<00:04:16.109> were<00:04:16.230> a

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
they look the same all the humans were a

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.259 
they look the same all the humans were a
great<00:04:16.620> outfit<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.280> that's<00:04:17.640> about<00:04:17.850> it<00:04:18.000> and

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
also didn't like the fact that the devs

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.170 
also didn't like the fact that the devs
created<00:04:20.010> this<00:04:20.100> creepy<00:04:20.519> world<00:04:20.760> for<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.060> to

so<00:04:40.090> what<00:04:40.270> we<00:04:40.390> have<00:04:40.570> here<00:04:40.600> is<00:04:40.900> a<00:04:40.930> game<00:04:41.140> was

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
so what we have here is a game was

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.200 
so what we have here is a game was
satisfying<00:04:41.830> gunplay<00:04:42.370> but<00:04:42.580> it's<00:04:42.700> very<00:04:42.910> heavy

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
satisfying gunplay but it's very heavy

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.120 
satisfying gunplay but it's very heavy
on<00:04:43.390> the<00:04:43.480> story<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:44.170> gameplay<00:04:44.380> does<00:04:44.770> nothing

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
on the story the gameplay does nothing

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.530 
on the story the gameplay does nothing
to<00:04:45.160> reinvent<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:45.670> wheel<00:04:45.700> but<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.300> story

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
to reinvent the wheel but the story

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.060 
to reinvent the wheel but the story
carried<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:46.990> game<00:04:47.170> for<00:04:47.380> me<00:04:47.470> anyway

that<00:05:13.180> but<00:05:13.570> most<00:05:13.810> ahead<00:05:13.990> I<00:05:14.260> see<00:05:14.440> for<00:05:14.620> this<00:05:14.740> game

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
that but most ahead I see for this game

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
is because its cutscene and QTE heavy

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.320 
is because its cutscene and QTE heavy
didn't<00:05:17.830> heavy<00:05:18.040> rain<00:05:18.370> get<00:05:18.610> positive<00:05:18.820> reviews

10 and out of 5 scoring systems are and
is<00:05:37.270> exactly<00:05:37.390> why<00:05:37.930> I<00:05:37.960> don't<00:05:38.320> use<00:05:38.620> them<00:05:38.890> final

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580

recommendation<00:05:40.330> I<00:05:40.450> think<00:05:40.480> this<00:05:41.140> game<00:05:41.290> is

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.140 
recommendation I think this game is
worth<00:05:41.590> playing<00:05:41.620> but<00:05:42.340> only<00:05:42.580> when<00:05:42.880> there's<00:05:43.030> a

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
worth playing but only when there's a

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.790 
worth playing but only when there's a
price<00:05:43.390> drop<00:05:43.600> I<00:05:43.870> agree<00:05:44.170> there's<00:05:44.410> not<00:05:44.560> enough

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800
