00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.340
 I do not 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.200
 the wasteland of santurbán has the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.230
 privilege of having 457 species of 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.640
 plants and 293 species of fauna within 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.260
 of these species are the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.119
 frailejones that are at risk of 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.279
 become extinct so they are considered 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.279
 endemic species we can see the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.970
 surroundings of this lagoon complex 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:32.940
 we see a frailejones garden that there is 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.260
 alleys of 1 centimeter of 2 of 3 of 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.930
 5 of 20 of 50 and even frailejones of a 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.230
 subway we should keep in mind that this 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.140
 ecosystem is a very fragile ecosystem 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:50.489
 the restoration processes and 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.879
 recovery are very slow then the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.250
 make an intervention in this area or 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.070
 make an intervention in the páramo of 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.989
 santurbán will be very critical for the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.610
 preaching the fauna the same and the same 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.700
 part of hydrology the same cycle 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.159
 hydrological because it will be affected 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.710
 to cut the leaf of the frailejones the 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.360
 smell of bentin tea to its obvious aroma that 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.340
 according to the experts it can be a way 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.079
 to protect yourself from insects or pests 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.240
 What is worrying about this species 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.159
 explode and deteriorate is that your process 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.979
 of restoration would be hundreds of years 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.170
 Well, in 20 years, for example, a frailejón 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.100
 grows only 5 or 10 centimeters 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.069
 I came here in 2001 to take care of these 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.319
 properties that are some failures 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:43.260
 institutional this crashed were 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:47.520
 really finished there was livestock 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:51.180
 many people of public order 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.450
 what was there was totally destroyed 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.740
 and from there to here, he has been taking care of 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.899
 Well, they've already taken the cattle 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.140
 the people were educating that the páramos 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.259
 you had to take care of them and if in the 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.420
 present as you see this property 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:12.230
 abundant abundant frailejón de tutto 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.690
 the native species have already been 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.610
 widespread in this area too 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.769
 other exotic species are found 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.150
 like some orchids that only grow 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.150
 in the humidity of these páramos 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.700
 trees like the polylepis quadri fugue 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.410
 also known as the colorado or 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.910
 seven layers are at risk of 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.830
 become extinct because its wood was 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.710
 used by the peasants as firewood and 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.240
 for construction work all 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.730
 intervention done to this 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.470
 ecosystem either for agriculture 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.720
 livestock and mining would end with those 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.280
 endemic species with water and with 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.280
 natural resources that are housed there
