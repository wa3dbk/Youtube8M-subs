00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
get how much isn't it weird having these

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.980 
get how much isn't it weird having these
huge<00:03:08.100> lobes<00:03:08.550> like<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:08.910> Ferengi<00:03:09.510> or<00:03:09.600> something

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
huge lobes like a Ferengi or something

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.570
