00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
this biting anger is high control is

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:59.020 
this biting anger is high control is
difficult<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:55.400> this<00:02:56.400> edge<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:57.260> prone<00:02:58.260> to

this<00:03:26.910> is<00:03:29.210> scandi<00:03:31.040> biting<00:03:32.040> angle<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:32.430> larger<00:03:33.090> H

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
this is scandi biting angle is larger H

too<00:03:43.360> deep<00:03:43.629> and<00:03:43.870> I<00:03:44.290> raised<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.340> angle<00:03:50.310> possible

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
too deep and I raised the angle possible

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.710 
too deep and I raised the angle possible
but<00:03:51.579> it<00:03:52.420> is<00:03:52.959> prone<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.610> fighting<00:03:54.610> deeper<00:03:57.720> this

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720

very easy to make this thing car this is

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:38.530 
very easy to make this thing car this is
the<00:04:29.480> reason<00:04:30.110> why<00:04:31.510> this<00:04:32.650> grind<00:04:35.260> makes<00:04:37.540> team

have the same edge angle symmetrical a

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.020 
have the same edge angle symmetrical a
symmetrical<00:04:51.880> it<00:04:52.880> is<00:04:53.120> a<00:04:53.150> parapet<00:04:54.020> a<00:04:54.080> sticker

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
symmetrical it is a parapet a sticker

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.920 
symmetrical it is a parapet a sticker
