00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.939 

most<00:00:14.269> people<00:00:14.599> only<00:00:14.719> use<00:00:14.900> a<00:00:15.080> few<00:00:15.440> presets

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
most people only use a few presets

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.089 
most people only use a few presets
during<00:00:16.309> live<00:00:16.490> performance<00:00:17.150> and<00:00:17.420> so<00:00:18.259> instead

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
during live performance and so instead

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.029 
during live performance and so instead
of<00:00:19.250> having<00:00:19.550> to<00:00:19.849> step<00:00:20.270> through<00:00:20.570> all<00:00:20.619> 50<00:00:21.619> banks

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
of having to step through all 50 banks

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.130 
of having to step through all 50 banks
you<00:00:22.880> can<00:00:22.910> actually<00:00:23.449> limit<00:00:23.660> the<00:00:23.840> number<00:00:24.110> of

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
you can actually limit the number of

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.800 
you can actually limit the number of
banks<00:00:24.500> that<00:00:24.619> are<00:00:24.770> available<00:00:25.009> and<00:00:25.539> how<00:00:26.539> you<00:00:26.599> do

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
banks that are available and how you do

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.830 
banks that are available and how you do
this<00:00:27.020> is<00:00:27.259> first<00:00:27.980> you<00:00:28.189> go<00:00:28.489> into<00:00:29.059> system<00:00:29.599> mode

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
this is first you go into system mode

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.589 
this is first you go into system mode
which<00:00:30.649> is<00:00:30.829> done<00:00:31.009> by<00:00:31.189> holding<00:00:31.369> both<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.329> right

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
which is done by holding both the right

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.080 
which is done by holding both the right
foot<00:00:32.930> switch<00:00:33.200> and<00:00:33.469> the<00:00:33.680> encoder<00:00:34.010> button<00:00:34.309> for<00:00:35.059> a

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
foot switch and the encoder button for a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.029 
foot switch and the encoder button for a
few<00:00:35.360> seconds<00:00:36.910> and<00:00:38.170> you<00:00:39.170> know<00:00:39.289> that<00:00:39.410> you're<00:00:39.920> in

00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:40.039 
few seconds and you know that you're in

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.970 
few seconds and you know that you're in
system<00:00:40.430> mode<00:00:40.550> because<00:00:40.969> the<00:00:41.770> LEDs<00:00:42.770> are

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
system mode because the LEDs are

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.239 
system mode because the LEDs are
flashing<00:00:43.510> once<00:00:44.510> in<00:00:44.719> system<00:00:45.109> mode<00:00:45.260> turn<00:00:45.980> the
