here<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.930> everything<00:00:43.710> look<00:00:49.250> acting<00:00:50.250> almost

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
here and everything look acting almost

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.209 
here and everything look acting almost
like<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> new<00:00:51.239> game<00:00:51.510> plus<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.379> expansion<00:00:53.070> was

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
like a new game plus this expansion was

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.549 
like a new game plus this expansion was
built<00:00:53.460> according<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.120> player<00:00:54.390> requests<00:00:55.199> it

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
built according to player requests it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.810 
built according to player requests it
seems<00:00:55.800> most<00:00:55.980> players<00:00:56.280> were<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.520> bit

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
seems most players were a bit

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.360 
seems most players were a bit
masochistic<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.899> wanted<00:00:58.230> less<00:00:58.469> story<00:00:58.829> more

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
masochistic and wanted less story more

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.400 
masochistic and wanted less story more
survival<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.120> increased<00:01:00.570> difficulty

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
survival and increased difficulty

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.770 
survival and increased difficulty
I<00:01:01.590> guess<00:01:02.129> they<00:01:02.309> hadn't<00:01:02.640> bitten<00:01:03.239> off<00:01:03.420> more<00:01:03.449> than

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
I guess they hadn't bitten off more than

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.300 
I guess they hadn't bitten off more than
they<00:01:03.989> could<00:01:04.199> chew<00:01:04.500> yet<00:01:05.720> get<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.840> because<00:01:07.310> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
they could chew yet get it because the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.030 
they could chew yet get it because the
zombies<00:01:09.049> yeah<00:01:11.689> so<00:01:12.689> how<00:01:12.990> does<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.229> all<00:01:13.320> work

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
zombies yeah so how does it all work

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.640 
zombies yeah so how does it all work
well<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.760> spawn<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> world<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.110> same<00:01:16.470> one

you normally do but without the story

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.880 
you normally do but without the story
elements<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.270> survive<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> bit<00:01:25.590> you

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
elements so you survive for a bit you

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.620 
elements so you survive for a bit you
blow<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.310> heads<00:01:26.549> off<00:01:26.759> about<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:27.030> million

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
just drive into the next Valley which

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.249 
just drive into the next Valley which
again<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.579> same<00:01:41.880> map<00:01:42.180> but<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.899> time<00:01:43.110> it's

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
again is the same map but this time it's

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.960 
again is the same map but this time it's
more<00:01:43.409> difficult<00:01:43.649> there's<00:01:44.280> more<00:01:44.460> zombies

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
more difficult there's more zombies

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.719

vehicles the RV also respawns in a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.859 
vehicles the RV also respawns in a
different<00:01:50.610> place<00:01:50.850> as<00:01:51.060> well<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.600> you'll<00:01:51.750> need

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
different place as well so you'll need

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.289
