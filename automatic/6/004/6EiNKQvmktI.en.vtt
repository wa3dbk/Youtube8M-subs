00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.620
 National tournament of PK Paradise because of 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.330
 that nintendo another year more forgotten about 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.430
 Spain and does not organize national tournament 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.320
 here pk paradise has decided to organize his 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.779
 own national tournament in madrid of the 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.400

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.180
 acquaintances included such as moon 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.189
 They have decided to make another tournament too 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.919
 In Barcelona, I do not know exactly when 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.960
 neither how or where and there also a web 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.059
 I do not know how to say which one is 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.559
 after this but if you search online 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.719
 sure you find it like this is that if 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.269
 you can not come to this one you also have the 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.769
 Barcelona's option , not the reason for 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.420
 this tournament will be the winner the 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.010
 opportunity to travel to another country where 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.079
 Nintendo organizes the national tournament 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.210
 and thus be able to participate and demonstrate to 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.219
 nintendo that in Spain we know how to play 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.530

 already between 10 and 11 in the morning 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.920
 specific time can confirm the fishing 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.270
 paradise later on instead of the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.070
 meeting will be the exchanger of 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.480

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.470
 Meetings the Bastian hangouts a 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.300
 pokemon is usually by the 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.490
 plant - where the bus station 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.840
 of the exchanger and personally if 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.340
 I need help to find the 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.930
 lost people or I have to give some 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.790
 turn to find someone who does not 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.110
 know go to the point of not meeting 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.820
 I would gladly look for the person 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.830
 people who do not know how to move around 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.479
 area of the exchanger you know that 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.250
 twitter allows us to be in contact with 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.680
 instant and that day would not take away the view 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.119
 of him until we are all together 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.700
 the format of the tournament will be identical to 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.140
 who uses nintendo vgc will be fighting 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.450
 doubles in which they will be used 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.039
 four of the team's six pokemon 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.899
 this is pokemon must belong to the 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.460
 pokédex de carlos and they will also have to 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.050
 to have been born also in Carlos, that is to say 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.789
 they will have to have the blue pentagon in 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.649
 your record despite fulfilling these two 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.229
 requirements are excluded chernias and 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.610
 beltrán si garde on youtube the tournament 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.050
 will use a Swiss system of seven 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.940
 rounds so that a good bad hit 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.350
 luck a fight is not a factor 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.660
 determinant for the winner 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.910
 I leave the links of pk paradise with the 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.679
 list of pokemon allowed in vgc and the 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.269
 official rules should be translated into 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.700
 Spanish in the description of this 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.170
 video as I dropped at the beginning 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.220
 of this video the first prize will be a 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.050
 flight by plane 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.610
 return to italy milan to be able 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.650
 participate in the national tournament that 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.520
 will take place on May 31 and on 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.930
 June 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.850
 It is important that you know that the prize 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.260
 it only includes the price of flights and 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.730
 not the accommodation and other expenses that 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.890
 can have the winner and personally 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.020
 just because of the round trip 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.370
 it seems like a great prize in addition 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.470
 case the number of participants 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.640
 of the tournament was greater than 40 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.990
 would deliver a second trip in the 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.180
 Person remaining in second position 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.010
 in the tournament in case it does not 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.630
 reach without number of participants and 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.520
 there were enough participants 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.140
 like to make a second prize is a 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.760
 tournament champion is to say the one that was 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.140
 in second place you will receive a prize 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.640

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.740
 allowed with the remaining money 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.510
 collected from the inscriptions the 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.040

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.200
 money in which they are valued in 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.970

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.250
 the days in these times that I am not 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.050

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.280
 pay to think that to be eliminated 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.800
 There are several combats in which there is 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.209
 lose that not only one and that five euros 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.519
 this you spend on taking half a cup 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.810
 a king pin for pokemon and only 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.400
 for having the opportunity to win a 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.959
 trip to italy to participate in 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.549

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.530
 financed with that same money contributed 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.810
 by all the other participants is that 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.129
 It's worth paying it worth it to 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.200
