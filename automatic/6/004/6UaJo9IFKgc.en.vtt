00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.659
 Arrest 24 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.209
 Sperber was as 24 punk rock 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:11.449
 now it's about active Oppermann said there are various construction works 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.039
 and application examples such as now beckons Chevy El Vasco 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:18.980
 which is easy to set up 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.760
 What this for the mystical knows that is in the trunk there is also mostly 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.520
 only space for such large boxes installed here is just this active 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.439
 not having to take part in the design again has to take place here 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.010
 Extra vehicles need to be installed as another typical for example 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.880
 Afro Kallwass 500 Boss 25 so like foot 25 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.090
 now that we want to go in this way we want to see the extremely flat and 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.130
 So our driver or passenger sitting can be mounted so 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.580
 at all, Wendt says space is extra stressed as and on which we do not 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.830
 need 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.639
 there are 

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:53.050
 the variant of 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.229
 AIG has brought the way he is very small 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.319
 so I would let him be mounted for free or because active that 

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:03.440
 saves in the trunk is installed 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.400
 b 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.300
 and then you are 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.220
 the shift shakes Dr 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.110
 Bienia TSW x6 with Senate 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.350
 until it is conceived that he is actually directly into the yes we work hard it 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.600
 was useful 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.790
 so far 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.830
 from Dr 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.740
 in that is just the we will be from the top here even strengthened 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.310
 and would be wasted on the scene 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.320
 and culture Westerwelle has Burden 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.510
 Percent agree as well which in turn value 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.390
 Red 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.030
 I'm in great shape usually around some the remote 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.630
 This is why potentiometers are a problem 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.300
 You can be rehabilitated by her on the weekend up to five meters were with 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.009
 At the same time she started to have infected herself 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.810
 Usually only something 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.700
 Loud and soft sounds without the election office on the subject Voodoo Radio 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.700
 fits and height adjustment needs to go to the square 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.210
 also included 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.429
 Just whistled with the signal the GM grab the blue speaker signal from the car 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.300
 if you can not sell a nice car trips from original car radios of 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.299
 VW Audi BMW distance 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.969
 usually have no chemical output so it has to be the signal 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:23.349
 from two speakers or flight cancellations output Assad is directly tapping 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.779
 for that deliver 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:26.309
 a cable with it 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:29.169
 that can be extended accordingly 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.169
 connected to the right and left of the speaker 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:37.079
 Dimas has again rehearsed before still-master betrayed 5 4 IU 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.459
 in the delivery is also struck 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:45.369
 Power cable will be EUR Plus 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:46.279
 For 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:49.040
 what they connect directly to the body on it 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.409
 and in Rimlos entrance so that at home 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.809
 Elisabeth wanted the activists to interview me easily because of it 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:58.209
 automatically turns on 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.839
 Some had my car connecting itself that means they recognize 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:02.820
 automatically 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.860
 on the speaker signal that again under 1 and if you turn on and 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.750
 if you park your car and do not worry about that 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.640
 away point 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.359
 Appearance of this house Hanspeter Huber also automatically off 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.359
 Perfect 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.369
 who decides to be active 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:25.150
 I think a lot of value is on a space-saving solution 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.150
 and a club inflation 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:33.989
 Have a lot of power in the car and Bach that the discs bake 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.330
 may not be very important now about the active ones of Arbor 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.379
 whoever thinks of System Parts will support me and me 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.949
 of course, to feel a Bach's fugue in the car is something of course 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:50.370
 yes we have to grow now also have to distinguish a bit I have now 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:55.329
 a big vehicle Andy Hamer a2 or maybe although here Bambi as well 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.889
 Of course I can also choose the best conversation according to the conversation 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.889
 Adjust vehicle 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:07.079
 we have these four active or already unpacked and will be there for everyone 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.929
 Single still bring my luck 

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:10.859
 and show you exactly 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.589
 It should be noted in the installation, even if it is actually 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:17.829
 itself bared but there are a few small chain Kuwait has the fence 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.500
 have perfected and the connection can take care of that no offense 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.500
 Doing so afforded a lot of fun with the subject 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:27.659
 and who else questions 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:34.289

 So very big, we'll meet 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.050
