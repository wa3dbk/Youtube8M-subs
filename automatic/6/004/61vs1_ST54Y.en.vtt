but we knew we wanted to

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.970 
but we knew we wanted to
so<00:00:26.690> we<00:00:26.810> want<00:00:26.960> to<00:00:26.990> make<00:00:27.080> more<00:00:27.290> believable<00:00:27.680> and

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
so we want to make more believable and

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.130 
so we want to make more believable and
someone<00:00:28.550> who<00:00:28.610> can<00:00:28.850> care<00:00:29.030> about<00:00:29.060> so<00:00:29.810> we<00:00:29.900> decided

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
someone who can care about so we decided

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.840 
someone who can care about so we decided
to<00:00:30.230> take<00:00:30.350> her<00:00:30.470> down<00:00:30.619> to<00:00:30.770> the<00:00:30.800> origin<00:00:31.280> she's<00:00:31.460> 21

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
to take her down to the origin she's 21

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.180 
to take her down to the origin she's 21
years<00:00:31.880> old<00:00:32.180> now<00:00:32.419> sort<00:00:33.170> of<00:00:33.260> reimagining<00:00:33.650> so

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
years old now sort of reimagining so

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.549 
years old now sort of reimagining so
it's<00:00:34.400> not<00:00:34.880> back<00:00:35.120> in<00:00:35.150> time<00:00:35.420> in<00:00:35.600> modern<00:00:36.080> days<00:00:36.260> and

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
it's not back in time in modern days and

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.350 
it's not back in time in modern days and
the<00:00:37.250> goal<00:00:37.430> was<00:00:37.460> to<00:00:37.730> try<00:00:37.880> to<00:00:37.910> measure<00:00:38.120> our

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
the goal was to try to measure our

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.570 
the goal was to try to measure our
believable<00:00:38.930> that's<00:00:39.530> still<00:00:39.770> iconic<00:00:40.280> so

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
believable that's still iconic so

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.430

gonna have to learn how to survive but

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.990 
gonna have to learn how to survive but
the<00:01:25.649> thing<00:01:25.679> that<00:01:25.860> we<00:01:26.220> were<00:01:26.310> saying<00:01:26.520> even

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the thing that we were saying even

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.609 
the thing that we were saying even
though<00:01:27.030> she<00:01:27.119> gets<00:01:27.450> Mulville<00:01:27.929> she<00:01:28.440> has<00:01:28.530> this

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
though she gets Mulville she has this

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.080 
though she gets Mulville she has this
inner<00:01:28.830> strength<00:01:29.159> with<00:01:29.310> driving<00:01:29.520> record<00:01:29.880> and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
inner strength with driving record and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.460 
inner strength with driving record and
that's<00:01:30.509> where<00:01:30.690> we<00:01:30.780> think<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.960> lara<00:01:31.200> croft

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
that's where we think the lara croft

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.180 
that's where we think the lara croft
know<00:01:32.429> mythology<00:01:33.149> will<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.390> continuing<00:01:34.380> how

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
know mythology will be continuing how

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.600 
know mythology will be continuing how
does<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.429> kind<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.990> laura<00:01:36.990> croft<00:01:37.429> she<00:01:38.429> is

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
does this kind of laura croft she is

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.279 
does this kind of laura croft she is
like<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.789> new<00:01:39.090> younger<00:01:39.479> girl<00:01:39.840> how<00:01:40.020> does<00:01:40.170> that

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
like a new younger girl how does that

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.160 
like a new younger girl how does that
