00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.030
 in a good day 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.759
 here it is again jean-françois 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.959
 to put pictures solution 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:14.339
 in the previous video clip we created the device profile 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.269
 using the company's software at deby 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:19.470
 not the idea that I still 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.849
 and then I sometimes have ridicule 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.660
 so here is the second part dealing with the use of tanks and it will be when 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:26.609
 even each 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.269
 but this time inside image processing software in 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.210
 the photoshop instance is free 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.960
 let's start by opening at the same time 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.100
 all final images reported 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.010
 taken in the same situation of good 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.840
 on the agenda of ten cameras away the file-processing software 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 job is described by photoshop elements 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.229
 she falls on the busy left 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.430
 they want to be those of others 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.769
 the first series image precedes the chart track a check-up 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.909
 as a reference it is therefore on these that we see that he was performing 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.100
 all the corrections 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.320
 let's start with all selected 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.030
 on the first image appears 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.030
 but the corrections will be made kid on others and martin 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.420
 the first step is to apply the color profile that we have 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.270
 taken previously 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.940
 clicking on the third tab the one on which a track the device 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.040
 photographic 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.040
 it is called calibration of the camera 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.960
 he chooses his your cannone profile togo these expenses 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.409
 you will notice that he does not move his arms this is not his role 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.399
 it normalizes the colors according to the hue of colors that we have 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.399
 written in the sky dmj speed 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.280
 returning to the first contact with the agent 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.330
 in the form of diagrams 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.810
 swaying white metal and white balance shaped shops 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.980
 sally 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:46.940
 right here 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.790
 there are a lot of schools to think but hey it's not such a big 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.150
 importance 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.360
 abbas of the charter extra even when everyone 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.790
 there is a scale of 10 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.260
 from white to black 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.400
 avoiding it in the purest and the darkest black 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.440
 we go on the highway decarries my personal preference in his 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.920
 third from left 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.999
 that's already come 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:11.429
 because the opposition could not be decided directly this gray area 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:15.989
 reading dollars to countries 118 119 119 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.569
 lucky luke perfectly well 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.789
 we go to the exhibition 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:25.589
 if we rely on the purchase 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:30.089
 the white house at the bottom left should display RDV values ​​of 243 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:32.789
 from 143,242 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:34.019
 we know 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.420
 180 m2 179 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.879
 167 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:38.840
 our plan 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.749
 but to pass from the middle 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:44.179
 then you have to increase the value of the exposure 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:49.629
 +0 95 brings us values ​​of 245 242 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.629
 240 which is quite acceptable 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:56.529
 displaying decryption warnings 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.019
 if this rise of adecco exposure and crew in other areas of 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.730
 our subject is the loss of formations 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.629
 outside the charter 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.949
 we would not even use if recovery 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.799
 to deal with his losses 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.229
 that does not seem to be the case so recovery is useless 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:20.369
 the plans are flawless brushes at the moment 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.360
 the study on the darker area of ​​the charter the chief town down a little bit 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:25.909
 all over 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:27.010
 51 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.949
 these 40 51 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:34.409
 he wants us to confirm that this area should be around 52 52 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.799
 52 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.359
 elton perfectly in the standards 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.779
 unfortunately I have always found that these leaders are paid too much 

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:45.539
 the image miss a lot of contrast 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:49.770
 according to me the result turning around thirty 30 30 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.049
 it helps girls a lot 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.930
 it's using the right tool 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.019
 games like wii did later 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.700
 right a + goddess 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.559
 gives me satisfaction 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:00.519
 29 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:01.549
 you killed 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.629
 very fast 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.479
 whites and blacks being perfectly controlled 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.479
 we can remove decryption warnings 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:12.819
 let's switch the brightness ie 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.779
 to the brightness of the helmsman 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:19.650
 and that it be us confirms that the fourth gray area from the 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.560
 left should be possible around 120 m2 without even the EU without 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.069
 crutches 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:29.069
 on our history it makes 114 113 no doubt 

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:32.560
 the brightness tool 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.210
 should give him the necessary height 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.250
 a correction to + 9 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.639
 seems to make seamless work without flaws 119 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.150
 the press 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.569
 this one 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.129
 a little clarity he plays on the definition of micro details and 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.469
 increases saturation further a sublime blessing 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.680
 agencyport 40 points 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.520
 and a little saturation never hurt anyone 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.939
 let's go here for marc levy think who's gotten are already saturated 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:06.740
 with the maximum of tourists points 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.300
 you have to know how to restrain yourself a little 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.419
 using the preview button 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.419
 it is easier to appreciate the result 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:17.240
 who says better 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.979
 it only remains to click on to open images 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.089
 it was obvious and the treatment in photoshop 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:26.089
 tired and tracked stale 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:27.819
 we must remain optimistic
