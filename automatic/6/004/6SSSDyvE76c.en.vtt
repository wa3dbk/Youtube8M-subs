collection<00:05:35.940> of<00:05:36.060> some<00:05:36.300> sort<00:05:36.630> I<00:05:36.930> don't<00:05:37.740> know<00:05:37.800> why

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
collection of some sort I don't know why

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:39.380 
collection of some sort I don't know why
they'd<00:05:38.100> really<00:05:38.340> sell<00:05:38.610> these<00:05:38.790> cards<00:05:39.120> that

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
they'd really sell these cards that

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.570 
they'd really sell these cards that
don't<00:05:39.630> start<00:05:40.440> on<00:05:40.530> most<00:05:40.770> of<00:05:40.890> our<00:05:40.979> teams<00:05:41.280> if

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
don't start on most of our teams if

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.980 
don't start on most of our teams if
they're<00:05:41.729> not<00:05:41.880> going<00:05:42.000> to<00:05:42.060> do<00:05:42.210> some<00:05:42.450> collection

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
they're not going to do some collection

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.350 
they're not going to do some collection
so<00:05:43.350> I<00:05:43.560> could<00:05:44.490> definitely<00:05:44.760> be<00:05:45.000> wrong<00:05:45.180> on<00:05:45.300> that

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
so I could definitely be wrong on that

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.969 
so I could definitely be wrong on that
that's<00:05:45.810> just<00:05:46.020> what<00:05:46.229> I'm<00:05:46.320> thinking<00:05:46.770> and

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
that's just what I'm thinking and

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.810 
that's just what I'm thinking and
hopefully<00:05:47.850> they<00:05:48.210> do<00:05:48.270> a<00:05:48.890> middle<00:05:49.890> linebacker<00:05:50.130> a

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
hopefully they do a middle linebacker a

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.659 
hopefully they do a middle linebacker a
tight<00:05:51.180> end<00:05:51.390> and<00:05:51.780> a<00:05:52.560> left<00:05:52.770> outside<00:05:52.950> linebacker

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
tight end and a left outside linebacker

tight end and a left outside linebacker
