problem with the spy find is that
obviously<00:03:29.250> if<00:03:29.579> you<00:03:29.639> look<00:03:29.790> above<00:03:29.910> me<00:03:30.150> right<00:03:30.329> now

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
obviously if you look above me right now

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.830 
obviously if you look above me right now

my tactic pretty much you see Freddie
here<00:03:47.700> I<00:03:47.850> think<00:03:47.940> this<00:03:48.150> guy<00:03:48.389> the<00:03:48.959> guy<00:03:49.139> in<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.380> bus

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
here I think this guy the guy in the bus

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.690 
here I think this guy the guy in the bus
right<00:03:49.769> there<00:03:49.950> he<00:03:50.040> thinks<00:03:50.250> he's<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.370> bus<00:03:50.670> driver

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
right there he thinks he's a bus driver

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.170 
right there he thinks he's a bus driver
or<00:03:51.150> something<00:03:51.859> he's<00:03:52.859> like<00:03:53.040> every<00:03:53.250> time<00:03:54.030> he

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
or something he's like every time he

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.819 
or something he's like every time he
spawns<00:03:54.480> he<00:03:54.660> just<00:03:54.840> runs<00:03:55.049> back<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.560> front<00:03:55.709> of

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
spawns he just runs back to the front of

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.330 
spawns he just runs back to the front of
the<00:03:55.920> bus<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.100> try<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.519> shoot<00:03:56.670> me<00:03:56.819> but<00:03:57.569> I<00:03:58.340> catch

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
the bus to try and shoot me but I catch

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.920 
the bus to try and shoot me but I catch
mm<00:03:59.549> emotional<00:03:59.910> Center<00:04:00.150> which<00:04:00.299> is<00:04:00.329> obviously

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
mm emotional Center which is obviously

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.339 
mm emotional Center which is obviously
the<00:04:01.019> power<00:04:01.230> of<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.349> motion<00:04:01.680> sensor<00:04:03.230> it's<00:04:04.230> not

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
the power of the motion sensor it's not

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.289 
the power of the motion sensor it's not
even<00:04:04.799> called<00:04:05.099> emotions<00:04:05.519> it's<00:04:05.880> called<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.090> port

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
even called emotions it's called a port

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.789 
even called emotions it's called a port
or<00:04:06.359> a<00:04:06.420> radar<00:04:06.750> in<00:04:06.840> this<00:04:06.959> game<00:04:07.139> I<00:04:07.290> think<00:04:07.319> the

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
or a radar in this game I think the

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.289 
or a radar in this game I think the
portable<00:04:08.160> radar<00:04:08.310> on<00:04:08.489> this<00:04:08.639> game<00:04:08.790> beats<00:04:09.120> the

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
portable radar on this game beats the

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.330 
portable radar on this game beats the
motion<00:04:09.630> sensor<00:04:09.959> black<00:04:10.169> ops<00:04:10.440> not<00:04:11.069> only<00:04:11.190> because

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
motion sensor black ops not only because

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.520 
motion sensor black ops not only because
there's<00:04:11.639> like<00:04:11.760> less<00:04:12.060> people<00:04:12.450> with<00:04:13.019> assassin

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
there's like less people with assassin

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.259 
there's like less people with assassin
in<00:04:13.620> this<00:04:13.769> game<00:04:13.950> but<00:04:14.099> also<00:04:14.250> it's<00:04:14.880> got<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.060> wider

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
in this game but also it's got a wider

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.509 
in this game but also it's got a wider
range<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:16.019> you<00:04:16.200> can<00:04:16.349> chuck<00:04:16.560> it<00:04:16.620> displaces<00:04:17.280> of

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
range and you can chuck it displaces of

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.449 
range and you can chuck it displaces of
safety<00:04:17.940> where<00:04:18.180> people<00:04:18.570> may<00:04:18.660> not<00:04:18.840> see<00:04:19.079> it<00:04:19.459> and

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
safety where people may not see it and

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.890 
safety where people may not see it and
obviously<00:04:20.700> it<00:04:20.970> doesn't<00:04:21.120> make<00:04:21.359> a<00:04:21.389> sound<00:04:21.660> unless

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
obviously it doesn't make a sound unless

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.529 
obviously it doesn't make a sound unless
you<00:04:22.169> hear<00:04:22.590> somebody<00:04:22.830> end<00:04:23.159> bar<00:04:24.000> cops<00:04:24.300> it<00:04:24.510> was

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
you hear somebody end bar cops it was

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.060 
you hear somebody end bar cops it was
kind<00:04:24.750> of<00:04:24.810> like<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:24.990> soft<00:04:25.349> humming<00:04:25.590> sound<00:04:25.919> which

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
kind of like a soft humming sound which

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.620 
kind of like a soft humming sound which
meant<00:04:26.310> you<00:04:26.400> can<00:04:26.580> sign<00:04:26.820> through<00:04:27.060> or<00:04:27.120> not<00:04:27.240> Likud

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
meant you can sign through or not Likud

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.980 
meant you can sign through or not Likud
sound

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990

on that game bar and unless it's nation

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.860 
on that game bar and unless it's nation
style<00:04:31.020> until<00:04:31.380> obviously<00:04:31.770> somebody<00:04:32.870> comes

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
style until obviously somebody comes

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.110 
style until obviously somebody comes
into<00:04:34.199> its<00:04:34.380> radius<00:04:34.919> and<00:04:35.190> I<00:04:35.310> just<00:04:35.490> hit<00:04:35.639> my<00:04:35.669> mic<00:04:35.910> I

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
into its radius and I just hit my mic I

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.600 
into its radius and I just hit my mic I
hope<00:04:36.270> that<00:04:36.449> hasn't<00:04:36.569> changed<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:38.340> stones

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
hope that hasn't changed the the stones

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.309 
hope that hasn't changed the the stones
because<00:04:38.849> I<00:04:39.090> know<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.330> can<00:04:39.539> mess<00:04:39.810> up<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:40.110> little

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:40.319 
because I know it can mess up a little

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.309 
because I know it can mess up a little
bit<00:04:40.410> and<00:04:41.720> I<00:04:42.720> don't<00:04:42.960> know<00:04:43.020> if<00:04:43.080> you've<00:04:43.169> noticed

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:43.319 
bit and I don't know if you've noticed

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:45.320 
bit and I don't know if you've noticed
