but<00:00:17.090> if<00:00:17.180> you<00:00:17.270> thought<00:00:17.480> for<00:00:17.660> a<00:00:17.720> second<00:00:18.199> but<00:00:18.740> just

have our visual effects pipeline which
we've<00:01:05.430> been<00:01:05.670> working<00:01:06.030> at<00:01:06.300> since<00:01:06.570> our

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
we've been working at since our

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.140 
we've been working at since our
inception<00:01:07.040> we<00:01:08.040> also<00:01:08.190> have<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.520> cg<00:01:08.910> feature

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
inception we also have a cg feature

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.240 
inception we also have a cg feature
pipeline<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:10.140> open<00:01:10.440> season<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.860> surfs<00:01:11.070> up

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250

visual effects company has done this

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.609 
visual effects company has done this
successfully<00:01:17.869> generally<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.020> pipelines<00:01:19.470> are

successfully generally the pipelines are

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.070 
successfully generally the pipelines are
very<00:01:19.860> different<00:01:20.160> what<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.180> need<00:01:21.509> for<00:01:21.810> visual

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
very different what you need for visual

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
effects work is very different than what

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.430

you need for safety feature in addition

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.859 
you need for safety feature in addition
we've<00:01:25.740> also<00:01:25.920> got<00:01:26.220> performance<00:01:26.910> capture<00:01:27.090> which

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
we've also got performance capture which

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.990 
we've also got performance capture which
is<00:01:28.050> takes<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.710> best<00:01:28.920> parts<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:29.729> CG

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
is takes the best parts of the CG

cameras pick up the dots and function

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.289 
cameras pick up the dots and function
almost<00:02:31.709> like<00:02:31.799> a<00:02:31.860> compound<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.610> they<00:02:32.970> can<00:02:33.120> look

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
almost like a compound I they can look

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.410 
almost like a compound I they can look
at<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:34.110> actor<00:02:34.620> from<00:02:34.650> any<00:02:34.890> direction<00:02:35.130> week<00:02:36.120> or

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
basically a cloud of moving dots and

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.970 
basically a cloud of moving dots and
after<00:02:39.299> that<00:02:39.420> our<00:02:39.690> animators<00:02:40.350> can<00:02:40.590> then<00:02:40.739> take

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
after that our animators can then take

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.130 
after that our animators can then take
this<00:02:41.190> motion<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.910> anime<00:02:42.480> in<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.690> computer

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
this motion and anime in the computer

there's very exciting projects to work

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.640 
there's very exciting projects to work
on<00:04:01.420> because<00:04:01.690> they<00:04:02.200> tend<00:04:02.410> to<00:04:02.530> be

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
on because they tend to be

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.440 
on because they tend to be
groundbreaking<00:04:03.010> they<00:04:03.820> tend<00:04:04.120> to<00:04:04.180> involve

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
groundbreaking they tend to involve

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.410 
groundbreaking they tend to involve
technologies<00:04:05.230> that<00:04:05.500> aren't<00:04:06.310> don't<00:04:06.790> exist<00:04:07.240> at

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
technologies that aren't don't exist at

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.600 
technologies that aren't don't exist at
the<00:04:07.510> beginning<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.960> project<00:04:08.470> and<00:04:08.980> we<00:04:09.280> have<00:04:09.460> to

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
the beginning the project and we have to

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.240 
the beginning the project and we have to
create<00:04:10.420> this<00:04:10.720> technology<00:04:11.410> to<00:04:11.680> serve<00:04:12.100> the

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
create this technology to serve the

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.610 
create this technology to serve the
creative<00:04:12.670> whole<00:04:12.940> so<00:04:13.720> we<00:04:13.900> started<00:04:14.290> a<00:04:14.440> new

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
creative whole so we started a new

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.479 
creative whole so we started a new
process<00:04:15.130> called<00:04:15.460> EOG<00:04:16.200> EOG<00:04:17.200> involves<00:04:17.799> putting

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
process called EOG EOG involves putting

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.240 
process called EOG EOG involves putting
small<00:04:18.910> sensors<00:04:19.420> around<00:04:19.570> a<00:04:19.780> person's<00:04:20.140> eyes<00:04:20.350> we

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
small sensors around a person's eyes we

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.210 
small sensors around a person's eyes we
measure<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.850> electricity<00:04:22.570> that<00:04:22.930> the<00:04:23.920> muscles

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
measure the electricity that the muscles

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.750 
measure the electricity that the muscles
in<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.700> body<00:04:24.880> create<00:04:25.540> and<00:04:25.840> that<00:04:26.620> data<00:04:27.430> is

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
in the body create and that data is

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.240 
in the body create and that data is
turned<00:04:27.970> into<00:04:28.240> I<00:04:28.540> movement<00:04:28.960> it's<00:04:29.620> a<00:04:29.920> little

turned into I movement it's a little

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.130 
turned into I movement it's a little
hocus-pocus<00:04:30.670> with<00:04:31.420> them<00:04:31.630> but<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:31.930> really

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
hocus-pocus with them but it really

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:43.749 
hocus-pocus with them but it really
works<00:04:32.410> are<00:04:32.950> you<00:04:33.160> still<00:04:33.580> with<00:04:33.610> me<00:04:34.080> to<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.200> enemy
