I<00:02:15.690> do<00:02:15.810> here's<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.620> base<00:02:16.829> I<00:02:17.069> use<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.250> big

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
I do here's of the base I use a big

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.500 
I do here's of the base I use a big
brush<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:18.750> dust<00:02:19.139> the<00:02:19.380> base<00:02:19.579> like<00:02:20.579> this<00:02:20.609> and<00:02:21.389> you

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
brush to dust the base like this and you

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.289 
brush to dust the base like this and you
can<00:02:21.720> see<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.250> just<00:02:23.519> generally<00:02:23.880> removes

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
can see and that just generally removes

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.680 
can see and that just generally removes
the<00:02:25.400> most<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.639> the<00:02:26.760> dust<00:02:26.940> anyway<00:02:27.510> especially

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
the most of the dust anyway especially

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.660 
the most of the dust anyway especially
if<00:02:28.109> it's<00:02:28.260> on<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.500> black<00:02:28.739> surface<00:02:29.160> then

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
if it's on the black surface then

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.800 
if it's on the black surface then
obviously<00:02:29.819> there's<00:02:30.209> going<00:02:30.329> to<00:02:30.389> be<00:02:30.450> quite<00:02:30.750> a

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
obviously there's going to be quite a

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.440 
obviously there's going to be quite a
lot<00:02:31.049> of<00:02:31.079> it<00:02:31.350> after<00:02:32.340> I've<00:02:32.459> used<00:02:32.489> my<00:02:33.000> big<00:02:33.209> brush

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
lot of it after I've used my big brush

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.340 
lot of it after I've used my big brush
for<00:02:33.750> dust

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
for dust

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.330 
for dust
I<00:02:34.470> didn't<00:02:35.040> start<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.400> use<00:02:35.609> my<00:02:35.940> other<00:02:36.209> brush<00:02:37.340> for

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
I didn't start to use my other brush for

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.140 
I didn't start to use my other brush for
the<00:02:39.030> legs<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:40.170> for<00:02:40.650> any<00:02:40.829> other

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
the legs and for any other

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.619 
the legs and for any other
parts<00:02:42.870> of<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.170> body<00:02:43.349> that<00:02:43.650> answer<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.909> because

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
parts of the body that answer is because

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.149 
parts of the body that answer is because
I<00:02:45.780> obviously<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.319> use<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.650> for<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.799> whole<00:02:46.920> body

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
I obviously I use it for the whole body

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.240 
I obviously I use it for the whole body
knees<00:02:47.459> type<00:02:47.670> rush<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.269> is<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.450> lot<00:02:48.629> easier<00:02:49.250> and

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
knees type rush this is a lot easier and

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.149 
knees type rush this is a lot easier and
henceforth<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.819> just<00:02:51.000> picks<00:02:51.390> up<00:02:51.739> all<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.799> find

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
henceforth it just picks up all the find

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.430 
henceforth it just picks up all the find
the<00:02:53.220> dust<00:02:53.489> of<00:02:54.360> course<00:02:54.569> I<00:02:54.750> won't<00:02:54.930> do<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.230> whole

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
the dust of course I won't do this whole

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.350 
the dust of course I won't do this whole
figure<00:02:55.680> I'm<00:02:56.040> just<00:02:56.250> gonna<00:02:56.370> show<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.670> generally

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
figure I'm just gonna show you generally

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.710 
figure I'm just gonna show you generally
what<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.349> do<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.890> that's<00:02:59.099> all<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.670> would<00:02:59.790> do<00:03:00.060> then

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
what I do so that's all I would do then

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.660 
what I do so that's all I would do then
if<00:03:00.959> there's<00:03:01.140> anything<00:03:01.349> quite<00:03:01.799> really<00:03:02.250> smooth

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
if there's anything quite really smooth

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.080 
if there's anything quite really smooth
places<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.540> get<00:03:03.720> into<00:03:04.260> that's<00:03:05.129> when<00:03:05.519> I<00:03:05.730> bring

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
places to get into that's when I bring

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.710 
places to get into that's when I bring
this<00:03:06.720> paint<00:03:07.319> brush<00:03:07.440> in<00:03:07.890> beside<00:03:08.489> any<00:03:09.150> small

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
this paint brush in beside any small

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.990 
this paint brush in beside any small
places<00:03:10.049> like<00:03:10.560> these<00:03:10.920> little<00:03:11.280> crevices<00:03:11.459> in

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
places like these little crevices in

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.759 
places like these little crevices in
here<00:03:12.269> for<00:03:12.599> instance<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:14.000> brush<00:03:15.000> in<00:03:15.209> there<00:03:15.510> and

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
here for instance I brush in there and

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.470 
here for instance I brush in there and
also<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:16.920> best<00:03:17.129> thing<00:03:17.400> about<00:03:17.430> using<00:03:17.940> paint

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
also the best thing about using paint

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.750 
also the best thing about using paint
brushes<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.950> fact<00:03:20.190> that<00:03:20.280> you're<00:03:20.489> not

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
brushes is the fact that you're not

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.610 
brushes is the fact that you're not
gonna<00:03:21.000> damage<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.450> figure<00:03:21.959> because<00:03:22.349> you<00:03:22.470> can

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
gonna damage the figure because you can

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.800 
gonna damage the figure because you can
be<00:03:22.709> very<00:03:22.920> gentle<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.879> can<00:03:24.060> get<00:03:24.269> into<00:03:24.660> those

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
be very gentle you can get into those

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.150 
be very gentle you can get into those
again<00:03:25.200> there's<00:03:25.410> little<00:03:25.620> crevices<00:03:26.129> that

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
again there's little crevices that

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.740 
again there's little crevices that
repart<00:03:26.790> reach<00:03:27.709> with<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:29.069> small<00:03:29.819> paintbrush<00:03:30.180> and

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
repart reach with a small paintbrush and

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.699 
repart reach with a small paintbrush and
it<00:03:31.680> makes<00:03:31.890> life<00:03:32.159> a<00:03:32.370> lot<00:03:32.609> easier<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.590> as<00:03:34.590> you

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
it makes life a lot easier and as you

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.199 
it makes life a lot easier and as you
saw<00:03:34.859> I<00:03:34.890> had<00:03:35.099> another<00:03:35.340> paper<00:03:35.549> brush<00:03:35.760> there<00:03:36.030> but

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
saw I had another paper brush there but

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.830 
saw I had another paper brush there but
that<00:03:36.329> one<00:03:36.510> is<00:03:36.780> just<00:03:37.379> a<00:03:37.470> bit<00:03:37.650> pick<00:03:38.340> up<00:03:38.569> so<00:03:39.569> again

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.259 
that one is just a bit pick up so again
I<00:03:39.870> would<00:03:40.079> use<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.260> for<00:03:40.950> more<00:03:41.190> sort<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.150> this

I would use that for more sort of this

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.229 
I would use that for more sort of this
sort<00:03:42.510> of<00:03:42.540> area<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.489> yeah<00:03:44.489> I<00:03:44.519> do<00:03:44.700> this<00:03:44.940> with<00:03:45.150> all

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
dust that way all the time so yeah it's

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.069 
dust that way all the time so yeah it's
very<00:03:53.790> time-consuming<00:03:54.060> when<00:03:54.660> you've<00:03:54.780> got<00:03:54.930> over

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
very time-consuming when you've got over

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.220 
very time-consuming when you've got over
300<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.739> them<00:03:55.919> to<00:03:56.099> do<00:03:56.220> this<00:03:56.400> review<00:03:56.549> but<00:03:57.230> it's

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
300 of them to do this review but it's

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.420 
300 of them to do this review but it's
also<00:03:58.700> one<00:03:59.700> way<00:03:59.940> of<00:04:00.239> keeping<00:04:01.019> them<00:04:01.440> all<00:04:01.769> in<00:04:02.099> mint

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
also one way of keeping them all in mint

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.509 
also one way of keeping them all in mint
condition<00:04:02.750> so<00:04:03.750> that<00:04:03.989> is<00:04:04.139> generally<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:05.190> that's

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
condition so that is generally it that's

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.180 
condition so that is generally it that's

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.250 
my way of doing busting is something
that<00:04:13.799> again<00:04:14.040> it's<00:04:14.250> menial<00:04:14.790> it's<00:04:15.120> boring<00:04:15.660> but

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
that again it's menial it's boring but

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.439 
that again it's menial it's boring but
it's<00:04:16.440> something<00:04:16.680> that<00:04:16.949> you<00:04:17.280> have<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.940> do<00:04:18.090> and

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
it's something that you have to do and

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.629 
it's something that you have to do and
you<00:04:18.810> can't<00:04:19.079> escape<00:04:19.289> it<00:04:19.709> unfortunately<00:04:20.340> and

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
you can't escape it unfortunately and

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.330 
you can't escape it unfortunately and
when<00:04:21.419> you've<00:04:21.599> got<00:04:21.630> cabinets<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.949> best<00:04:23.160> thing

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
when you've got cabinets the best thing

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.950 
when you've got cabinets the best thing
is<00:04:23.520> is<00:04:23.669> that<00:04:23.789> you<00:04:23.910> don't<00:04:24.120> have<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.419> dust<00:04:24.630> as

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
is is that you don't have to dust as

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.420 
is is that you don't have to dust as
much<00:04:26.180> but<00:04:27.199> you<00:04:28.199> do<00:04:28.349> still<00:04:28.680> have<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.860> dust<00:04:29.220> at

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
much but you do still have to dust at

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.370 
much but you do still have to dust at
some<00:04:29.820> point<00:04:30.180> because<00:04:30.510> otherwise<00:04:30.810> you're

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
some point because otherwise you're

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.770 
some point because otherwise you're
seeing<00:04:31.740> that<00:04:31.919> they<00:04:32.070> get<00:04:32.340> dusty<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.120> mean<00:04:33.360> even

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780
