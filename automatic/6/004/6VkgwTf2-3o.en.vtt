lob<00:00:23.090> asked<00:00:24.090> me<00:00:24.269> how<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.050> make<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.289> region<00:00:26.220> where

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
lob asked me how to make a region where

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.310 
lob asked me how to make a region where
everyone<00:00:27.119> could<00:00:27.330> build<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.810> was<00:00:27.929> like<00:00:28.140> well

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
everyone could build and I was like well

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.339 
everyone could build and I was like well
that's<00:00:29.210> simple<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.269> then<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.720> realized<00:00:31.140> it

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
that's simple and then I realized it

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.520 
that's simple and then I realized it
wasn't<00:00:31.590> simple<00:00:32.059> so<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.090> actually<00:00:33.269> asked<00:00:33.989> skate

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
wasn't simple so I actually asked skate

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.400 
wasn't simple so I actually asked skate
9q<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.280> he<00:00:35.640> said<00:00:35.879> just<00:00:36.180> set<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:36.839> flag<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
9q and he said just set the flag to

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.280 
9q and he said just set the flag to
allow<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.430> he<00:00:38.489> also<00:00:38.640> said<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.059> if<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:40.110> have

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
allow but he also said that if you have

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.569 
allow but he also said that if you have
any<00:00:40.500> flags<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.550> set<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.090> deny<00:00:43.280> you<00:00:44.280> need<00:00:44.460> to

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
any flags you set to deny you need to

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.459 
any flags you set to deny you need to
set<00:00:44.820> parents<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.510> priorities<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.260> stuff

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
set parents and priorities and stuff

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.490 
set parents and priorities and stuff
like<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.649> but<00:00:46.860> if<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.670> haven't<00:00:48.030> set<00:00:48.600> build

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
like that but if you haven't set build

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.279 
like that but if you haven't set build
flags<00:00:49.890> anywhere<00:00:50.370> else<00:00:50.989> you<00:00:51.989> don't<00:00:52.140> need<00:00:52.199> to

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
flags anywhere else you don't need to

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.590 
flags anywhere else you don't need to
worry<00:00:52.320> about<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.070> most<00:00:53.969> people<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.390> not

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
worry about that so most people have not

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.660 
worry about that so most people have not
probably<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.320> best<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.739> avoid<00:00:55.860> setting<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
probably it's best to avoid setting the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.400 
probably it's best to avoid setting the
build<00:00:56.969> flags<00:00:57.300> if<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:57.870> not<00:00:57.989> need<00:00:58.199> to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
build flags if you do not need to

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.400 
build flags if you do not need to
because<00:00:58.739> by<00:00:58.890> default<00:00:58.949> they're<00:00:59.609> set<00:00:59.910> to

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
because by default they're set to

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.170 
because by default they're set to
disallow<00:01:01.410> building<00:01:01.859> but<00:01:02.100> um<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.969> how<00:01:03.120> you

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
disallow building but um this is how you

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.230 
disallow building but um this is how you
build<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.559> region<00:01:05.160> where<00:01:05.369> everyone<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.000> build

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
build a region where everyone can build

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.900 
build a region where everyone can build
and<00:01:06.860> why<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.280> might<00:01:08.399> want<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.610> do<00:01:08.700> something

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
and why you might want to do something

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.210 
and why you might want to do something
like<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.240> I've<00:01:09.750> made<00:01:10.140> some<00:01:10.470> bulletin<00:01:10.890> boards

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
like that I've made some bulletin boards

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.969 
like that I've made some bulletin boards
here<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:12.240> want<00:01:12.509> obviously<00:01:12.690> everyone<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.860> be

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
here and I want obviously everyone to be

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.830 
here and I want obviously everyone to be
able<00:01:14.009> to<00:01:14.220> build<00:01:14.429> here<00:01:14.789> because<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.479> don't<00:01:15.720> want

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
able to build here because I don't want

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.380 
able to build here because I don't want
to<00:01:15.929> just<00:01:16.649> set<00:01:16.950> owners<00:01:17.399> to<00:01:17.580> these<00:01:17.729> because<00:01:18.300> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
to just set owners to these because I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.330 
to just set owners to these because I
would<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.660> to<00:01:18.780> add<00:01:18.929> every<00:01:19.500> user<00:01:19.800> on<00:01:20.069> my

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
would have to add every user on my

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.949 
would have to add every user on my
server<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.849> these<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.209> that<00:01:21.300> would<00:01:21.420> be<00:01:21.539> really

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:21.959 
server to these and that would be really

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:25.669 
server to these and that would be really
annoying<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:23.750> I'm<00:01:24.750> not<00:01:25.020> going<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.229> do<00:01:25.349> that<00:01:25.380> I'm

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
annoying so I'm not going to do that I'm

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:27.680 
annoying so I'm not going to do that I'm
just<00:01:25.830> gonna<00:01:25.920> say<00:01:26.009> build<00:01:26.429> allow<00:01:26.729> they<00:01:27.390> won't<00:01:27.599> be

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
just gonna say build allow they won't be

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.180 
just gonna say build allow they won't be
able<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.899> build<00:01:28.020> out<00:01:28.229> here<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:28.770> they<00:01:28.890> will<00:01:29.069> be

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
able to build out here but they will be

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.499 
able to build out here but they will be
able<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.429> place<00:01:29.610> signs<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:31.190> and<00:01:32.190> remember

is i'm selecting this region right here
so<00:01:59.039> the<00:01:59.310> people<00:02:00.110> everyone<00:02:01.110> will<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.590> able<00:02:01.709> to

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
so the people everyone will be able to

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.760 
so the people everyone will be able to
just<00:02:03.060> destroy<00:02:03.599> the<00:02:03.629> wooden<00:02:03.959> blocks<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.440> there

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
just destroy the wooden blocks in there

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.130 
just destroy the wooden blocks in there
but<00:02:05.310> they<00:02:05.399> won't<00:02:05.580> be<00:02:05.670> able<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.849> place<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.420> top

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
but they won't be able to place on top

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.809 
but they won't be able to place on top
of<00:02:07.349> it<00:02:07.410> because<00:02:07.679> that's<00:02:07.800> technically<00:02:08.340> outside

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
of it because that's technically outside

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.430 
of it because that's technically outside
of<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.000> region<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.539> if<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.989> think<00:02:10.020> well<00:02:10.410> a

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
of the region and if you think well a

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.580 
of the region and if you think well a
sign<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.640> region<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.510> sign<00:02:13.260> is

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
sign is on that region a sign is

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.640 
sign is on that region a sign is
actually<00:02:14.160> considered<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.670> block<00:02:14.970> so<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:16.200> is

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
actually considered a block so that is

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.000 
actually considered a block so that is
not<00:02:16.770> in<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.010> region<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.550> here

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
not in the region and here

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.860 
not in the region and here
is<00:02:18.099> how<00:02:18.250> we<00:02:18.310> prove<00:02:18.610> it's<00:02:18.790> outside<00:02:19.209> of<00:02:19.269> building

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
is how we prove it's outside of building

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.199 
is how we prove it's outside of building
this<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.260> building<00:02:20.590> this<00:02:20.709> I<00:02:20.950> can't<00:02:21.849> build<00:02:22.060> any

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
this and building this I can't build any

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.220 
this and building this I can't build any
further<00:02:22.390> because<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.209> block<00:02:25.510> so

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
further because that is a block so

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.890 
further because that is a block so
instead<00:02:26.980> of<00:02:27.040> defining<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.670> board<00:02:28.000> all<00:02:28.629> we

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
instead of defining the board all we

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.780 
instead of defining the board all we
want<00:02:29.079> to<00:02:29.110> do<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.590> place<00:02:30.010> some<00:02:30.340> temporary

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
want to do is place some temporary

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.860 
want to do is place some temporary
blocks<00:02:31.239> and<00:02:32.370> define<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.549> region<00:02:33.939> directly<00:02:34.629> in

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
blocks and define the region directly in

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.080 
blocks and define the region directly in
front<00:02:34.900> of<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.409> and<00:02:35.560> not<00:02:35.799> the<00:02:35.980> board<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.879> will

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
front of it and not the board this will

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.819 
front of it and not the board this will
allow<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.750> still<00:02:38.260> place<00:02:38.530> signs<00:02:38.980> but<00:02:39.730> not

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
allow you to still place signs but not

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.259 
allow you to still place signs but not
destroy<00:02:41.829> the<00:02:41.980> actual<00:02:42.280> bulletin<00:02:42.670> board<00:02:42.879> itself

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
destroy the actual bulletin board itself

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.920 
destroy the actual bulletin board itself
so<00:02:44.260> if<00:02:44.530> you've<00:02:44.680> got<00:02:44.709> all<00:02:45.040> your<00:02:45.069> TNT<00:02:45.730> flags<00:02:46.090> set

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
so if you've got all your TNT flags set

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.740 
so if you've got all your TNT flags set
to<00:02:47.079> false<00:02:47.319> and<00:02:47.620> all<00:02:47.769> that<00:02:47.950> outside<00:02:48.510> we<00:02:49.510> need<00:02:49.659> to

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
to false and all that outside we need to

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.270 
to false and all that outside we need to
define<00:02:49.900> this<00:02:50.230> region<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:50.739> I've<00:02:50.859> defined<00:02:51.159> the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
define this region so I've defined the

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.280 
define this region so I've defined the
other<00:02:51.400> one<00:02:51.549> is<00:02:51.579> wall<00:02:51.909> one<00:02:52.209> so<00:02:52.599> I'm<00:02:52.840> going<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:53.109> do

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
other one is wall one so I'm going to do

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.349 
other one is wall one so I'm going to do
four<00:02:53.590> words<00:02:53.709> last<00:02:54.329> region<00:02:55.590> define<00:02:57.120> wall<00:02:58.120> too

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
four words last region define wall too

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.339 
four words last region define wall too
I'm<00:02:59.170> so<00:02:59.620> creative<00:03:00.069> and<00:03:00.450> then<00:03:01.450> we<00:03:01.659> need<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:02.049> set

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
I'm so creative and then we need to set

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:08.339 
I'm so creative and then we need to set
the<00:03:02.470> build<00:03:02.650> flag<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.250> allow<00:03:04.739> region<00:03:06.060> flag<00:03:07.349> wall

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
the build flag to allow region flag wall

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:14.309 
the build flag to allow region flag wall
to<00:03:10.379> build<00:03:11.379> allow<00:03:12.370> so<00:03:12.940> what<00:03:13.299> I've<00:03:13.420> done<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.629> the

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
to build allow so what I've done is the

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.430 
to build allow so what I've done is the
forward<00:03:14.620> slash<00:03:14.859> region<00:03:15.489> flag<00:03:16.359> and<00:03:16.659> then<00:03:17.290> the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
forward slash region flag and then the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.589 
forward slash region flag and then the
name<00:03:17.620> of<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:17.889> region<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.400> set<00:03:18.819> whatever<00:03:19.299> it

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
name of the region you set whatever it

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.280 
name of the region you set whatever it
may<00:03:19.810> be<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.819> build<00:03:21.819> that's<00:03:22.569> the<00:03:22.780> flag<00:03:23.049> we're

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
may be and build that's the flag we're

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.349 
may be and build that's the flag we're
modifying<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:24.069> then<00:03:24.519> we're<00:03:24.639> saying<00:03:24.849> allow

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
modifying and then we're saying allow

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.650 
modifying and then we're saying allow
you<00:03:26.349> just<00:03:26.530> click<00:03:26.709> enter<00:03:27.069> and<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:28.120> build<00:03:28.329> flag

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
you just click enter and the build flag

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.099 
you just click enter and the build flag
is<00:03:28.989> set<00:03:29.379> to<00:03:29.680> true<00:03:29.949> them<00:03:30.160> now<00:03:30.400> anyone<00:03:30.819> can<00:03:31.109> build

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
is set to true them now anyone can build

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.500 
is set to true them now anyone can build
anything<00:03:32.319> here<00:03:32.739> you<00:03:33.459> might<00:03:33.639> want<00:03:33.669> to<00:03:33.940> do<00:03:34.150> some

anything here you might want to do some

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.500 
anything here you might want to do some
research<00:03:35.169> on<00:03:35.590> sign<00:03:36.489> locks<00:03:36.819> I'll<00:03:37.120> include<00:03:37.299> a

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
research on sign locks I'll include a

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.689 
research on sign locks I'll include a

link to a couple bukkit plugins for
locking<00:03:40.090> signs<00:03:40.569> because<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:40.989> don't<00:03:41.139> want<00:03:41.260> to

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
locking signs because you don't want to

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.039 
locking signs because you don't want to
place<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.620> sign<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.329> then<00:03:43.329> someone<00:03:43.870> comes

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
place a sign and then someone comes

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.900 
place a sign and then someone comes
along<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.319> knocks<00:03:44.739> them<00:03:45.250> all<00:03:45.370> off<00:03:45.549> it<00:03:45.760> takes
