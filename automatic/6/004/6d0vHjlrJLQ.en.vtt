00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.790
 on the basics and of course in israel seriously 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.680
 will treat the possible reports 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.279
 chemical attack from the Syrian 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.140
 action movies 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.790
 not yet the Israeli press 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.570
 officials in any way that does not 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.880
 comments on 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.559
 according to rt sources in the near 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.510
 future and syrian areas where 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.699
 militants will be held 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.190
 attacks against israel using 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.980
 of chemical weapons it is not 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.720
 clarified it is important to note two points in 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.039
 first reported that the attacks will be 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.260
 held from the territory that 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.509
 control the forces of President al-Assad 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.639
 This means that all the blame will be placed on 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.399
 Syrian authorities on the other hand 

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:39.559
 performers and so will the militants like me 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.389
 Already said in the meantime in Israel in any way 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.069
 does not react to it but for the last 

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:44.870
 a few days passed 

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:46.609
 military exercises including in the north 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.999
 countries on the golan heights 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.420
 September 9th Israeli Institute 

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:52.100
 counterterrorism policy 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.019
 published a report which states 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.929
 that chemical weapons are kept in syria 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.059
 in about 50 cities in five of them have 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.429
 large enterprises, the report notes 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.619
 that the situation in these cities is constantly 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.449
 changing it means power can 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.219
 move from militants to 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.200
 government troops and back 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:10.549
 The report's authors conclude that 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.469
 if these cities come under control 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.450
 militants and those can take possession 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.460
 and weapons also expressed concerns 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.829
 that chemical weapons can fall into the hands 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.630
 Hezbollah Palestinian organizations or 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.789
 al-kaida groups 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.530
 Of course, any attack on Israel 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.200
 the Syrian side cause either Aviv 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.909
 great fears in the past israel inflicted 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.710
 on a series of blows justifying it 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.929
 desire not to allow 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.030
 weapons fell into Hezbollahâ€™s hands 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:37.249
 Israel and other countries know 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.679
 Tel Aviv is beneficial to power in the series 

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:41.240
 remained at Assad otherwise 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.759
 Israel will face a whole 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.920
 near personalities much more dangerous than him 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.859
 although officially Tel Aviv states that 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.359
 does not participate in the Syrian conflict 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.299
 most of the Israelis themselves believe that 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:54.829
 a lesser evil for the country would be 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.499
 Neighborhood 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.210
 Assad government alleged 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:01.280
 the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.780
 Militants aren't new in 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.329
 past we heard similar 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.520
 statement this conflict is marked by the most 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.739
 different provocations at all levels 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.629
 we saw shocking shots of the dead 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.730
 American authorities used children 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.239
 them as a justification for a possible strike on 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.640
 Syria 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:21.430
 later it turned out that these children were kidnapped 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.430
 and killed with the help of chemical weapons militants
