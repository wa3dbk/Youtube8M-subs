00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.830
 can put them anywhere you want on 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.650
 windows 8 you had to drag a 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.619
 one at a time and then organize 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.930
 Not now you can select all 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.570
 and drag them by a specific point 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.689
 can frame can 5 can be can 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.500

 new update also in sizes 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.659
 for example you can leave 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.470
 get the minors and get the biggest ones 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.770
 right click here 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:53.189
 resize and click small 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.550
 the wins are smaller you can

 also lets you avoid the biggest 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.860
 here comes the same great thing the advantage 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.770
 to have a law vitae or greater is that she 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.800

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.970
 instead of just one that is new 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.010
 now the good of this is that you can 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:26.790
 organize in a way that is 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:28.740
 best for you and you for example 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.030
 You can leave it in a way that 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.160
 please more 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.010
 another novelty is that you can 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.720
 customize the names of groups before 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.730

 for tablets or mobile devices with 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.270
 128.1 not so much for computer but not 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:25.000
 ceases to be a useful application 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.010
 the sound recorder as the name itself 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.320

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:49.240
 Can you hear it locally? 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.490
 calculator is a 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.560
 calculator is just that subway interface 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.340
 the normal calculator application that 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.340
 had before 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.580
 You're here without any problem. 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.860
 Can you use it if you can 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.900
 but this is a 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.490
 application on the metro interface 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.660
 Can you set it up on 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:19.210
 you can convert the 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:20.560
 volume is energy among other things 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.410
 scanner is also the same as the 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.600
 calculator a meter application for a 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:29.620
 function that already had the same application 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.270
 said Cameron who got in the area of 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.880
 I work from here without any problem one 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:38.710
 of the facts that most have a scanner here 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:41.140
 can facilitate a lot and well 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.520
 Another thing that changed a lot was the 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.280
 settings 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:48.160
 now it's in topics and more 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.620
 easy orientation you can see in 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.890
 configuration and can change typing 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.930
 or touchpad video the image resolution 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.930
 can you get information about your 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:01.330
 computer if you can update your 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.040
 computer you get many things and 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.700
 give it a much more intuitive way 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.500
 you find in my opinion a 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.110
 the best things come in 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.990
 windows 8 point was customization 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:17.800
 besides the live ones you come here to start 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:20.500
 click Custom Settings 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.230
 here you have a huge range of colors and 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.970
 of not so much more color designs 

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:27.289
 You, for example, do not like me very much. 

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:29.240
 pink then you drag 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:31.249
 also here in red does not choose your 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.169
 color you prefer 

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:36.199
 and you can change the colors too 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:39.860
 the colors of the drawings 

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:41.869
 I just came here and you can do it. 

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.270
 still place the bottom of your area of 

00:07:41.869 --> 00:07:47.419
 Work will always be the last one here. 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:49.399
 and 3rd attack on your desktop 

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:51.169
 I found it very interesting I found it very 

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:52.879
 necessary before I got a little 

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:56.930
 distressed because he had not so 

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:59.749
 customization on windows 8 but now 

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:03.039
 It's very simple for you to put things 

00:07:59.749 --> 00:08:06.559
