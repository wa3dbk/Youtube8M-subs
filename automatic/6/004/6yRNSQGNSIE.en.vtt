00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
suction-cup mount that you can get this

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.430 
suction-cup mount that you can get this
is<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.160> one<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:21.120> need<00:02:21.300> one<00:02:22.200> other

is the one that you need one other
really<00:02:22.710> nice<00:02:22.950> thing<00:02:23.250> about<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.640> suction<00:02:24.240> cup

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
really nice thing about this suction cup

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.750 
really nice thing about this suction cup
base<00:02:24.630> is<00:02:24.900> this<00:02:25.110> red<00:02:25.440> line<00:02:25.710> here<00:02:26.190> on<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.520> side

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
base is this red line here on the side

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.970 
base is this red line here on the side
so<00:02:27.330> when<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.780> pump<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.200> up<00:02:28.410> you'll<00:02:28.620> see<00:02:28.680> the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
so when you pump that up you'll see the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.610 
so when you pump that up you'll see the
red<00:02:29.160> line<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.610> going<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:30.090> disappear<00:02:30.630> over<00:02:31.350> time

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
red line is going to disappear over time

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.350 
red line is going to disappear over time
as<00:02:31.860> more<00:02:31.890> air<00:02:32.340> gets<00:02:32.640> in<00:02:32.820> underneath<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
as more air gets in underneath the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.030 
as more air gets in underneath the
suction<00:02:33.720> cup<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.170> starts<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.650> lose<00:02:34.800> its

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
suction cup and it starts to lose its

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.250 
suction cup and it starts to lose its
suckiness<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:36.300> red<00:02:36.510> line<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:36.930> going<00:02:37.140> to

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
suckiness that red line is going to

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.380 
suckiness that red line is going to
reappear<00:02:37.890> again<00:02:38.190> that's<00:02:38.670> your<00:02:38.880> cue<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.180> pump

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
reappear again that's your cue to pump

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.240 
reappear again that's your cue to pump
it<00:02:39.540> back<00:02:39.570> up<00:02:39.900> again<00:02:40.020> so<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.650> does<00:02:40.830> have<00:02:41.040> that

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
it back up again so it does have that

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.730 
it back up again so it does have that
visual<00:02:41.760> indicator<00:02:42.240> of<00:02:42.450> how<00:02:42.900> strong<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.500> hold

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
visual indicator of how strong the hold

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.250 
visual indicator of how strong the hold
is<00:02:44.010> going<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.460> be<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:45.300> let's<00:02:45.420> get<00:02:45.660> this<00:02:45.750> down<00:02:45.960> on

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
is going to be so let's get this down on

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.230 
is going to be so let's get this down on
the<00:02:46.290> table<00:02:46.770> here<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:48.620> once<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.980> is<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.700> place

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
the table here and once that is in place

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.270 
the table here and once that is in place
and<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.510> red<00:02:51.690> line<00:02:51.930> is<00:02:51.960> gone<00:02:52.320> we<00:02:52.800> can<00:02:52.950> take<00:02:53.130> our

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
and the red line is gone we can take our

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.490 
and the red line is gone we can take our
standard<00:02:53.760> length<00:02:53.970> B<00:02:54.300> socket<00:02:54.780> arm<00:02:55.020> that's
