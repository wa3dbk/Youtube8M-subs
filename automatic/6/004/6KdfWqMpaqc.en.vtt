00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
just reviewed that with the main build

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.109

builds<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.699> review<00:00:21.060> because<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.570> knew<00:00:21.810> I

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
builds in that review because I knew I

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.570 
builds in that review because I knew I
was<00:00:22.050> gonna<00:00:22.199> modify<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.160> didn't<00:00:23.460> even

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
was gonna modify it and I didn't even

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.509 
was gonna modify it and I didn't even
want<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.880> mess<00:00:24.810> around<00:00:24.990> with<00:00:25.289> doing<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.369> and

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
want to mess around with doing it and

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.779 
want to mess around with doing it and
have<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.789> tear<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.090> apart<00:00:27.230> so<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:29.220> one

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
have to tear it apart so this is the one

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.130 
have to tear it apart so this is the one
of<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.939> alternate<00:00:30.300> bills<00:00:30.510> which<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.929> like<00:00:31.109> a

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
of the alternate bills which is like a

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.770 
of the alternate bills which is like a
newspaper<00:00:31.410> stand<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.270> tweaked<00:00:33.630> a

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
newspaper stand and I just tweaked a

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.270 
newspaper stand and I just tweaked a
little<00:00:33.809> bit<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.200> probably<00:00:34.500> can't<00:00:34.739> even<00:00:35.010> tell

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
little bit you probably can't even tell

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.639 
little bit you probably can't even tell
what<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.670> did<00:00:36.030> by<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:36.780> looking<00:00:36.899> at<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.200> here

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
what I did by just looking at it here

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.110 
what I did by just looking at it here
but<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.550> will<00:00:38.760> show<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.420> instructions<00:00:40.110> for

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
but I will show you the instructions for

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.060 
but I will show you the instructions for
the<00:00:42.120> actual<00:00:42.690> set<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.290> kind<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.800> see<00:00:43.980> them

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
the actual set and you kind of see them

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.830 
the actual set and you kind of see them
get<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> paper<00:00:44.640> out<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.940> back<00:00:45.120> kind<00:00:45.719> of

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
get the paper out of the back kind of

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.750 
get the paper out of the back kind of
see<00:00:46.020> some<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:47.100> even<00:00:47.340> hard<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.579> tell

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
see some of the it's even hard to tell

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.139 
see some of the it's even hard to tell
here<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.629> basically<00:00:49.460> this<00:00:50.460> right<00:00:50.700> here<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.120> not

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
here so basically this right here is not

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.299 
here so basically this right here is not
a<00:00:51.390> door<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.750> made<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.350> door<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.649> put<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
a door I made that a door I put the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.180 
a door I made that a door I put the
awning<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.410> let<00:00:55.410> me<00:00:55.469> see<00:00:55.620> if<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.860> push<00:00:56.070> it

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
awning on it let me see if I can push it

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.310 
awning on it let me see if I can push it
over<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.550> gonna<00:00:56.820> get<00:00:57.480> both<00:00:57.750> I'm<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.109> same

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
over and gonna get both I'm in the same

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.599 
over and gonna get both I'm in the same
frame<00:00:58.710> here<00:00:59.449> tiled<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.750> up<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.350> made<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.010> modular

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
frame here tiled it up I made it modular

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.889 
frame here tiled it up I made it modular
instead<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.120> splitting<00:01:03.480> down<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.750> middle

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
instead of splitting down the middle

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.810 
instead of splitting down the middle
because<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:05.189> was<00:01:05.309> just<00:01:05.430> kind<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:05.790> a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
because this one was just kind of like a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
because this one was just kind of like a
fold<00:01:06.570> open<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:08.180> just<00:01:09.180> change<00:01:09.479> those<00:01:09.689> some

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
fold open and just change those some

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.210 
fold open and just change those some
other<00:01:09.990> little<00:01:10.320> things<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:10.830> we'll<00:01:10.979> take<00:01:11.159> a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
other little things but we'll take a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.740 
other little things but we'll take a
little<00:01:11.460> closer<00:01:11.640> look<00:01:11.790> at<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.180> here<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.630> to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
little closer look at it here just to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.980 
little closer look at it here just to
show<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.640> just<00:01:14.640> some<00:01:14.820> slight<00:01:15.150> changes<00:01:15.780> now

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
show you just some slight changes now

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.130 
show you just some slight changes now
this<00:01:16.170> little<00:01:16.500> soda<00:01:16.860> machine<00:01:17.570> actually<00:01:18.570> was<00:01:18.810> in

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
this little soda machine actually was in

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.990 
this little soda machine actually was in
the<00:01:19.170> build<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> main<00:01:20.310> build<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:20.880> like

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the build in the main build it was like

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.940 
the build in the main build it was like
part<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> building<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.740> moved

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
part of the building so I just moved

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.010 
part of the building so I just moved
that<00:01:23.100> over<00:01:23.159> set<00:01:23.670> making<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.509> little

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
that over set making that like a little

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.620 
that over set making that like a little
ice-cream<00:01:25.380> stand<00:01:26.009> or<00:01:26.280> whatever<00:01:26.400> was<00:01:26.700> maybe

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
ice-cream stand or whatever was maybe

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.020 
ice-cream stand or whatever was maybe
this<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.960> door<00:01:28.229> put<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> awning<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.640> like

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
this the door put the awning on it like

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.780 
this the door put the awning on it like
I<00:01:30.150> said<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.659> made<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.740> roof<00:01:32.400> comes<00:01:32.640> off

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
I said I made it so the roof comes off

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.490 
I said I made it so the roof comes off
and<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.150> put<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> skylight<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.110> there<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
and I put the skylight in there and

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.649 
and I put the skylight in there and
didn't<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.220> change<00:01:36.210> these<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
didn't have that and change these the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.200 
didn't have that and change these the
white<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.470> would<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.860> kind<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.909> flow

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
white so that would just kind of flow

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.980 
white so that would just kind of flow
better<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:39.720> white<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:41.280> gray<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.060> then

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
better like white and not gray and then

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.139 
better like white and not gray and then
as<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.740> see<00:01:43.950> inside<00:01:44.250> there<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> did<00:01:44.850> this

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
as you can see inside there I did this

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.749 
as you can see inside there I did this
go<00:01:45.329> ahead<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.979> with<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> awning<00:01:47.490> with<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
go ahead and with the awning with the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.399

I<00:02:03.840> made<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.469> where<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.979> don't<00:02:05.579> know<00:02:05.640> if<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.790> can

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
I made it where I don't know if you can

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.969 
I made it where I don't know if you can
see<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.270> hold<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.540> me<00:02:06.719> raise<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.710> up<00:02:07.890> a

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
see that hold on me raise this up a

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.130 
see that hold on me raise this up a
little<00:02:08.099> bit

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.160 

I<00:02:11.170> made<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.100> where<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.490> was<00:02:12.610> like<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.660> table

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
I made it where it was like the table

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.500 
I made it where it was like the table
was<00:02:14.440> tiled<00:02:14.770> in<00:02:15.370> there<00:02:15.610> see<00:02:16.060> if<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.210> can<00:02:16.330> focus

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
was tiled in there see if I can focus

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.470 
was tiled in there see if I can focus
that<00:02:16.870> for<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:18.160> tables<00:02:18.610> tile<00:02:18.850> didn't

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
that for you the tables tile didn't

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.110 
that for you the tables tile didn't
really<00:02:19.660> do<00:02:19.810> too<00:02:20.080> much<00:02:20.410> else<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:21.100> did<00:02:21.910> put<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.510> tile

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
really do too much else I did put a tile

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.910 
really do too much else I did put a tile
back<00:02:25.120> on<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.510> back<00:02:25.720> wall<00:02:26.050> there<00:02:26.350> that's<00:02:26.680> just

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
back on that back wall there that's just

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.120 
back on that back wall there that's just
like<00:02:27.130> I<00:02:27.690> think<00:02:28.690> this<00:02:28.840> looks<00:02:29.050> like<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.260> code<00:02:29.680> on<00:02:30.070> a

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
like I think this looks like a code on a

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.790 
like I think this looks like a code on a
beating<00:02:31.030> spaceship<00:02:31.600> I<00:02:31.750> never<00:02:31.930> did<00:02:32.470> nothing

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
beating spaceship I never did nothing

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.480 
beating spaceship I never did nothing
with<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.630> just<00:02:34.630> really<00:02:35.620> kind<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:36.010> liked<00:02:36.280> this

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
with it I just really kind of liked this

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.449 
with it I just really kind of liked this
build<00:02:36.880> probably<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.510> most<00:02:37.780> out<00:02:38.560> of<00:02:38.620> that<00:02:39.100> set

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
build probably the most out of that set

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.520 
build probably the most out of that set
and<00:02:39.820> I'll<00:02:40.360> probably<00:02:40.540> put<00:02:40.810> this<00:02:40.959> next<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.410> the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
and I'll probably put this next to the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.290 
and I'll probably put this next to the
greengrocer<00:02:41.740> just<00:02:42.459> because<00:02:42.760> it's<00:02:42.940> got<00:02:43.090> the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
greengrocer just because it's got the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.500 
greengrocer just because it's got the
same<00:02:43.930> green<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.459> did<00:02:45.640> change<00:02:45.970> this<00:02:46.270> this

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
same green and I did change this this

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.810 
same green and I did change this this
was<00:02:46.690> like<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.170> map<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:48.130> I<00:02:48.280> went<00:02:48.490> ahead<00:02:48.550> and

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
was like that map and I went ahead and

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.290 
was like that map and I went ahead and
put<00:02:49.570> some<00:02:49.750> of<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.989> old<00:02:50.739> timers<00:02:51.459> nice
