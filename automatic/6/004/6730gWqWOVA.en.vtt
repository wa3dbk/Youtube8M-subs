00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:08.420
 If you can do it at Skydesk 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:11.720
 Cooperation among multiple members 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.510
 Cloud service provided by Fuji Xerox 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.680
 Sky is 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:22.760
 This time, using the group creation function of the Sky desk 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:29.500
 We introduce the collaboration among multiple members 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:36.470
 I think that when I work in a team I am exchanging a lot of information 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:37.810
 Is there no way to share that information with other people? 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:44.270
 surely 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:48.110
 It's distinguished service which is no longer know the latest information in one to share with other people 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:51.560
 Change the format of information and transmission tools 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:57.640
 Information tends to be distributed 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.640
 Therefore, we recommend centralized management using use is mouth 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:13.260
 It is use Country is defined as organization organization group individual group 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:18.510
 Organization indicates the range to manage users in use is the mouth 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:24.980
 Users can not belong to multiple organizations 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:30.000
 Groups indicate the scope of users sharing data 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:36.350
 An organizational group is a group created under an organization 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.350
 Users in your organization can join multiple groups 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:46.760
 Personal groups can be created freely by individuals 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:54.240
 It can also be a group across organizations 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:58.450
 I understood the concept of organization and group, but how do you manage centrally in practice 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.570
 Let's look at the concrete screen 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.550
 cap 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:08.240
 Including the document file that was created with a lighter seat show 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.390
 Files and notes created on your desk 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.680
 Tasks etc 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:18.400
 Sharing is easy with groups 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.920
 If the file that has been shared to the group 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.569
 Listed on group page 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.359
 I see 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:37.579
 It is easy to understand which group shared the form 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:38.239
 Also , information about editors and edit date and time is saved by setting version control and access permissions. 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.900
 I will 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:45.780
 a 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:47.740
 If owners and editors are clear, you wo n't get lost who's up-to-date 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.360
 Hey 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:55.540
 If you share each other's calendar on your desk calendar 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:03.730
 It is easy to check the schedule 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:05.050
 You can set reading and writing permissions for each individual calendar on the shared calendar 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.370
 If you use it 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:18.340
 Without the e-mail exchange for the planned alignment 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:23.440
 Disappearing a poly I can share easily but I'm concerned it's an information leak I'm worried-all right 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.440
 There are basic formulas and group settings 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.349
 By manager setting of basic formula 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:37.190
 It is possible to limit the group creation range and connection ip 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:47.600
 Group share Ya clearly in the wrong transmission range 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:50.720
 There is also an effect that blackout avoids sharing 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.900
 While maintaining the scope of security as an organization 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.710
 You can share data 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.710
 That's right 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.730
 The second desk can be easily registered from the url you see 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.360
 Welcome to Skydesk
