00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.690 
sure you systems clean before you do
this<00:01:51.540> sort<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.869> thing<00:01:52.079> ok<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.369> we'll<00:01:53.520> let<00:01:53.640> this

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
this sort of thing ok so we'll let this

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.399 
this sort of thing ok so we'll let this
stop<00:01:54.060> pause<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.479> now<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.840> let<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.110> load<00:01:55.320> up

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
stop pause this now and let this load up

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.020 
stop pause this now and let this load up
ok<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.469> it's<00:01:58.860> nearly<00:01:59.100> there<00:01:59.280> now<00:01:59.490> Sowerby's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
ok so it's nearly there now Sowerby's

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.990 
ok so it's nearly there now Sowerby's
now<00:02:00.240> starting<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.689> windows<00:02:01.579> we<00:02:02.579> should<00:02:02.820> get

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
now starting the windows we should get

now starting the windows we should get
the<00:02:03.149> option<00:02:03.450> here<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.840> go<00:02:04.500> into<00:02:04.680> recovery

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
the option here to go into recovery

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.700 
the option here to go into recovery
console<00:02:05.719> so<00:02:06.719> we<00:02:06.840> want<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.079> push<00:02:07.229> our<00:02:07.469> at<00:02:07.619> a

windows CDs in so that's gonna be part
of<00:02:47.160> my<00:02:47.450> command

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
of my command

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.330 
of my command

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
is to expand again okay and then decode

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.200 
is to expand again okay and then decode
on<00:04:18.710> backslash<00:04:19.710> I<00:04:19.979> 386

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
on backslash I 386

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
again exactly same up the top each is

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.320

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
okay now this user init file was

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.730 
okay now this user init file was
sometimes<00:04:33.009> used<00:04:33.130> by<00:04:33.630> malware<00:04:34.630> to<00:04:35.500> cause

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
sometimes used by malware to cause

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.650

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
problems loop viruses and stuff like

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.080 
problems loop viruses and stuff like
that<00:04:37.870> keep<00:04:38.139> looping<00:04:38.380> shutting<00:04:39.130> a<00:04:39.190> PC<00:04:39.580> down<00:04:39.789> so

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090
