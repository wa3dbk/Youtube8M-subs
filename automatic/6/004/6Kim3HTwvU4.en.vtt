how to perform on stage I made my debut
a<00:04:19.320> couple<00:04:19.680> of<00:04:19.739> weeks<00:04:19.950> ago<00:04:20.190> as<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.459> signet<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.389> was

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
a couple of weeks ago as a signet it was

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.120 
a couple of weeks ago as a signet it was
a<00:04:21.630> big<00:04:22.079> moment<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:22.500> think<00:04:22.710> of<00:04:22.800> being<00:04:22.950> in<00:04:23.040> the

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
a big moment I think of being in the

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.650 
a big moment I think of being in the
world<00:04:23.250> ballet<00:04:23.490> because<00:04:23.730> it's<00:04:24.030> such<00:04:24.240> an<00:04:24.389> iconic

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
world ballet because it's such an iconic

world ballet because it's such an iconic
dance<00:04:24.930> I<00:04:25.410> think<00:04:25.770> it's<00:04:25.919> one<00:04:26.010> of<00:04:26.070> those<00:04:26.160> things

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
dance I think it's one of those things

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.340 
dance I think it's one of those things
if<00:04:26.580> you<00:04:26.700> think<00:04:26.940> about<00:04:27.150> it<00:04:27.330> too<00:04:27.480> much<00:04:27.510> you'll

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
if you think about it too much you'll

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.900 
if you think about it too much you'll
probably<00:04:28.889> panic<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.490> you're<00:04:29.639> on<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:29.790> wrong

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
probably panic that you're on the wrong

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.100 
probably panic that you're on the wrong
leg<00:04:30.090> because<00:04:30.360> you<00:04:30.419> really<00:04:30.660> have<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.900> trust

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
leg because you really have to trust

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.310 
leg because you really have to trust
yourself<00:04:31.530> that<00:04:31.800> it's<00:04:32.610> just<00:04:32.850> in<00:04:33.630> your<00:04:33.810> body<00:04:33.990> and

yourself that it's just in your body and

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.680 
yourself that it's just in your body and
that<00:04:34.919> your<00:04:35.070> feet<00:04:35.280> are<00:04:35.310> moving<00:04:35.570> without<00:04:36.570> you

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
that your feet are moving without you
