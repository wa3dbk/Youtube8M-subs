which<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:46.930> actually<00:02:47.230> interesting<00:02:48.090> choices

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
and things like that that you can kind

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.599 
and things like that that you can kind
of<00:02:51.370> make<00:02:51.549> to<00:02:51.909> kind<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.349> adjust<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.709> deck<00:02:53.859> we're

starting to finally see I guess the

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.670 
starting to finally see I guess the
level<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.370> diversity<00:02:57.819> outside<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.299> hat<00:02:58.680> you

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
level of diversity outside of hat you

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.770 
level of diversity outside of hat you
know<00:02:59.799> proving<00:03:00.310> how<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:01.090> know<00:03:01.209> resilient<00:03:01.719> the
