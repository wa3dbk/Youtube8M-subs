00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.990
 friends in this day of the child of questions 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.980
 good one of my biggest mischief 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.380
 It was a day that I bought myself not to be 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.039
 white I had bought it to go to the 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.429
 school 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.429
 Y 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.760
 and that is the same day that I bought it 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.200
 it was morning and afternoon 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.200
 I looked at the ball 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.050
 uy 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.070
 not thinking about what 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.010
 that it was going to rain then imagine 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.690
 you kind of omit me with the rain 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.690
 the earth full of mud 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.850
 the prank what good also I 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.830
 they punished I tell you always as a child 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.430
 They called me a lot the lonely ones 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.560
 strong and spent a lot of time with my 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.240
 friends playing with them and we go on 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.720
 where we go to the market to bought up 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.080
 the date when I go at Christmas and the year 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.900
 new 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.200
 several times I got in trouble and good 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.930
 the one that I remember the most now, a lot of grace 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.260
 with some friends especially with a 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.470
 Federico and we are going to buy accounts 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.850
 of the little popcorn and we passed 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.310
 at truck stops 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.740
 and we leave you a pigeon in the part of 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.439
 back is the stop too we were not 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.890
 so unconscious we are going back to 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.570
 that they will impersonate and two or three times we 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.310
 it sounded like they were thundering and they were running 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.580
 because people got so upset 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.340
 then the town was very very 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.020
 funny and yes yes we got to put in 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.920
 several aspects because more than once 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.920
 it almost reaches us 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.200
 what we will implement 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.010
 to the teacher as soon as that secondary of 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.010
 maths 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:11.510
 xicola degrees I remember a lot that with 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.510
 the companions came down that was life 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.030
 presents 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.840
 good some mischief I wanted from the child 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.319
 that instead of going to the catechism for 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.319
 do missions 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:43.750
 Well, later when the father said that 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:45.459
 not ours because when in the house 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.079
 My mom always gave me a gift because I 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.280
 break something broke his pottery and 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.840
 normally the rice and he hid in 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.700
 places that were not found after 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:01.720
 but 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:03.790
 I already knew that I was a little naughty 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.790
 the truth that as a child I was the youngest 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.700
 of the brothers learned many mornings 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.920
 where they already at a Christmas party 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.400
 that we were 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.319
 living with the family they got together 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.110
 many are 14 brothers back then 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.000
 of minimal then they were too many and 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.980
 once we bought my brother and ones 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.500
 furniture and they were stories that go from 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.910
 fashion from the commune maderita where dÃ­az al 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.640
 cigar and time to learn the 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.770
 post-it thundered well that we grabbed the 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.209
 pack of an uncle 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.130
 We knew that he smoked a lot and we started him 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.840
 changes in countries without giving 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.730
 account we put the 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.580
 cajeta and cigars in that 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.190
 those places 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.700
 and at the moment they were living together 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.700
 intensity 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.380
 the situation many got upset and started 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.130
 to investigate who was who he was and 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.340
 only my brother and I knew if I 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:10.660
 I brought an era that when I was a child 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.660
 the ball started playing soccer 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:19.019
 once we liked to bet football the 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.220
 silver and my mother sent me to buy the 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.860
 breakfast 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.770
 I bet and I lost it 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.080
 is that I wrote in the one I remember because 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.320
 football because of the passion that one of 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.260
 children and that I am now in the cube 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.060
 thank God they are anecdote that does not 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.130
 it happens in life 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.130
 that teach you to value things
