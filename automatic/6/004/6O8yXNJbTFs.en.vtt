as good designer I always believed in
few<00:00:31.210> parts<00:00:31.510> and<00:00:31.690> it<00:00:31.930> was<00:00:32.020> the<00:00:32.169> cheapest<00:00:32.529> memory

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
few parts and it was the cheapest memory

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.990 
few parts and it was the cheapest memory
that<00:00:32.920> saved<00:00:33.129> the<00:00:33.280> parts<00:00:33.579> that<00:00:33.640> was<00:00:33.789> going<00:00:33.940> to

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
that saved the parts that was going to

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.760 
that saved the parts that was going to
replace<00:00:34.270> other<00:00:34.629> types<00:00:35.020> of<00:00:35.140> magnetic<00:00:35.590> memory

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
replace other types of magnetic memory

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.830 
replace other types of magnetic memory
sobayed<00:00:36.640> a<00:00:36.670> lot<00:00:36.879> of<00:00:37.000> right<00:00:37.149> decisions<00:00:37.660> and

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
sobayed a lot of right decisions and

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.920 
sobayed a lot of right decisions and

I've<00:00:57.100> been<00:00:57.280> there<00:00:57.489> five<00:00:57.730> years<00:00:57.910> ago<00:00:58.090> I<00:00:58.180> built<00:00:58.450> a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
I've been there five years ago I built a

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.090 
I've been there five years ago I built a
computer<00:00:58.690> with<00:00:59.230> one<00:00:59.410> of<00:00:59.469> these<00:00:59.559> front<00:00:59.800> panels

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
and buttons I don't want that that cost

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.999 
and buttons I don't want that that cost
you<00:01:04.390> know<00:01:04.479> I<00:01:04.509> don't<00:01:04.629> like<00:01:04.809> metal<00:01:05.350> and<00:01:05.500> hardware

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
you know I don't like metal and hardware

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:07.770 
you know I don't like metal and hardware
I<00:01:06.219> don't<00:01:06.430> like<00:01:06.549> to<00:01:06.579> drill<00:01:06.939> the<00:01:07.060> holes<00:01:07.270> and

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
I don't like to drill the holes and

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.140 
I don't like to drill the holes and
mount<00:01:08.200> these<00:01:08.350> big<00:01:08.560> switches<00:01:09.430> inside<00:01:09.760> and<00:01:10.000> run

chips have to touch to my computer no
that's<00:01:14.440> just<00:01:14.619> too<00:01:14.710> many<00:01:14.860> parts<00:01:15.220> too<00:01:15.369> much

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
that's just too many parts too much

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.580 
that's just too many parts too much

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
took two chips back then because we

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.179 
took two chips back then because we

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
you told the computer to do and it

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.580 
you told the computer to do and it
doesn't<00:01:51.880> so<00:01:52.570> I<00:01:52.600> said<00:01:52.900> I'll<00:01:53.079> just<00:01:53.320> write<00:01:53.470> this

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
doesn't so I said I'll just write this

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.010 
doesn't so I said I'll just write this
program<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.100> now<00:01:54.189> I'll<00:01:54.369> have<00:01:54.520> my<00:01:54.900> terminal<00:01:55.900> to

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
program and now I'll have my terminal to

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.780 
program and now I'll have my terminal to
type<00:01:56.229> on<00:01:56.439> I'll<00:01:56.560> have<00:01:56.680> a<00:01:56.710> keyboard<00:01:56.979> it<00:01:57.430> looked

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
type on I'll have a keyboard it looked

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.190 
type on I'll have a keyboard it looked
like<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:57.939> typewriter<00:01:58.570> I<00:01:58.659> was<00:01:58.840> a<00:01:58.869> real<00:01:59.049> good

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
like a typewriter I was a real good

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.740 
like a typewriter I was a real good
typist<00:01:59.619> then<00:01:59.770> I<00:01:59.939> looked<00:02:00.939> like<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.090> typewriter<00:02:01.390> I

just<00:02:01.990> type<00:02:02.140> on<00:02:02.320> a<00:02:02.350> keyboard<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:02.979> I<00:02:03.310> watch<00:02:03.549> it

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
just type on a keyboard and I watch it

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.359 
just type on a keyboard and I watch it
on<00:02:03.820> my<00:02:03.939> home<00:02:04.119> TV<00:02:04.390> set<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.079> so<00:02:05.920> I<00:02:05.950> wrote<00:02:06.189> that

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
on my home TV set and so I wrote that

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.620 
on my home TV set and so I wrote that
little<00:02:06.549> program<00:02:06.820> without<00:02:06.939> at<00:02:07.119> working<00:02:07.450> one

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
now I had it I could write programs

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.429 
now I had it I could write programs
forever<00:02:15.840> instantly<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:16.989> popped<00:02:17.169> in<00:02:17.290> my<00:02:17.409> head

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
Bill Gates had written a base

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.670 
Bill Gates had written a base
for<00:02:19.000> some<00:02:19.150> other<00:02:19.300> types<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.599> computers<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.170> I

said I'm going to write a basic I've

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.399 
said I'm going to write a basic I've
never<00:02:22.330> studied<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.840> language<00:02:22.959> I've<00:02:23.260> never

used it I've never taken a class in
writing<00:02:25.480> languages<00:02:25.930> but<00:02:26.349> i<00:02:26.409> sat<00:02:26.620> down<00:02:26.739> that

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
writing languages but i sat down that

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.619 
writing languages but i sat down that
was<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.069> much<00:02:27.400> harder<00:02:27.610> project<00:02:28.120> than<00:02:28.209> any<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:28.540> my

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
was a much harder project than any of my

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.449 
was a much harder project than any of my

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
hardware projects at Apple ever took me

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.820 
hardware projects at Apple ever took me
about<00:02:30.610> four<00:02:31.090> months<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.720> write<00:02:32.170> this<00:02:32.379> basic

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
about four months to write this basic

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.080 
about four months to write this basic
and<00:02:32.980> when<00:02:33.099> I<00:02:33.129> look<00:02:33.310> back<00:02:33.340> on<00:02:33.610> some<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.819> my<00:02:33.879> time

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
and when I look back on some of my time

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.820 
and when I look back on some of my time
schedules<00:02:34.450> maybe<00:02:34.629> even<00:02:34.810> longer<00:02:35.019> write<00:02:35.709> this

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
schedules maybe even longer write this

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.559 
schedules maybe even longer write this
basic<00:02:36.220> that<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:36.400> could<00:02:36.580> type<00:02:36.819> in<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.180> simple

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
and nobody really have the time to build

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.170 
and nobody really have the time to build
it<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.349> so<00:03:00.099> Steve<00:03:00.340> Jobs<00:03:00.609> came<00:03:00.819> by<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.030> said

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
it and so Steve Jobs came by and said

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.089 
it and so Steve Jobs came by and said
why<00:03:01.329> don't<00:03:01.390> we<00:03:01.569> make<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.750> PC<00:03:02.200> board<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.859> save

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379
