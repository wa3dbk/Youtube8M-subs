00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.349
 ketchup salt and pepper 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.149
 we'll start with the onions we sell 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.610
 cut into slices and go to the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.870
 second where strange couples filmed well 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.870
 it will be for m raw in the hamburger 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.590
 we will keep both sides the pucks 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:54.710
 onion and we will add the chopped onion 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:56.150
 beef is added to the game 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.989
 manceau knows why play almost 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:04.030
 directly on the work plan as well 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.200
 only salt and pepper 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.590
 we decorate some herbs with 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.150
 Provence 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.540
 so not too much because it's very strong 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.390
 we'll be able to mix starts at the 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.920
 spoon but especially now I have my 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.180
 little mimic because the idea is okay 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.050
 to be well mixed then of 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.050
 shape canes steak 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.670
 we will share the stuffing in four 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:34.460
 we're going to make steaks 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.700
 that a step that it delivers in the 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.700
 stove 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.460
 but my first chopped steaks made by 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.619
 my white but I'm still 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.049
 super proud have of course for the 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.789
 cooking it can be done at the barbecue 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.299
 but good without wanting to tell you my 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.689
 life outside 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.959
 by rain, we decided on everything 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:02.530
 do on the tac a little bit scared 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:04.060
 we will need to be the steaks during 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.509
 that time we will also put the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.829
 sliced ​​smoked bacon or bacon 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:13.599
 adored we will also love the 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:19.329
 rolls so here it's the same 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:20.650
 take a little bit of fear then the 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.079
 point that it will go very fast 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.310
 so we'll hurry once 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.500
 that he is well nourished will put them 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.690
 other france and during that time yes 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.410
 it's all at the same time we'll take care 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.150

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:39.489
 a few slices of tomatoes 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:41.230
 so it's better and everyone has the ideas 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.970

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.329

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.930
 slice the cheese 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.850
 so if I had been organized I 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.430
 would have done it before starting the 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.569
 recipe if you too see yourself 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.750

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.440
 sum if you tell me 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:12.330
