a Tiki drive to a heavy air pedal
compared<00:01:13.570> to<00:01:13.660> everything<00:01:13.869> else<00:01:14.110> I've<00:01:14.380> done

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
compared to everything else I've done

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.490 
compared to everything else I've done
initially<00:01:15.940> it<00:01:16.570> was<00:01:17.880> requested<00:01:18.880> from<00:01:19.750> it<00:01:20.320> was<00:01:20.470> a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
initially it was requested from it was a

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.100 
initially it was requested from it was a

request from Elliot Easton to have a

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.870 
request from Elliot Easton to have a
pedal<00:01:23.619> that<00:01:23.649> was<00:01:23.890> a<00:01:23.920> little<00:01:24.160> more<00:01:24.310> aggressive

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
pedal that was a little more aggressive

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.120 
pedal that was a little more aggressive
so<00:01:25.330> he<00:01:25.450> could<00:01:25.600> use<00:01:25.840> cleaner<00:01:26.259> amps<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:26.890> have

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
so he could use cleaner amps and have

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.070 
so he could use cleaner amps and have
you<00:01:27.970> know<00:01:28.090> be<00:01:28.300> able<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.600> do<00:01:28.720> everything

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
you know be able to do everything

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
you basically have volume gain stage 1

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.210 
you basically have volume gain stage 1
and<00:01:52.060> 2<00:01:52.119> these<00:01:52.690> are<00:01:52.869> in<00:01:52.990> series<00:01:53.410> their<00:01:53.979> voice

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
and 2 these are in series their voice

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.029 
and 2 these are in series their voice
differently<00:01:54.849> and<00:01:55.590> it'll<00:01:56.590> let<00:01:56.740> you<00:01:56.860> go

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
differently and it'll let you go

differently and it'll let you go
anywhere<00:01:57.640> from<00:01:57.940> a<00:01:58.330> clean<00:01:58.929> set<00:01:59.289> up<00:01:59.470> to

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:00.599 
anywhere from a clean set up to

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.880 
anywhere from a clean set up to
basically<00:02:01.599> metal<00:02:02.020> if<00:02:02.140> you<00:02:02.259> want<00:02:02.500> it<00:02:02.649> to<00:02:02.740> be

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
basically metal if you want it to be

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.219 
basically metal if you want it to be
that<00:02:03.069> way<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:04.270> have<00:02:04.390> your<00:02:04.450> tone<00:02:04.869> control

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
that way you have your tone control

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.839 
that way you have your tone control
which<00:02:05.440> is<00:02:05.590> standard<00:02:05.950> on<00:02:06.039> all<00:02:06.160> my<00:02:06.340> pedals<00:02:06.670> and

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:06.849 
which is standard on all my pedals and

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:09.270 
which is standard on all my pedals and
the<00:02:07.030> voicing<00:02:07.569> the<00:02:08.229> voicing<00:02:08.649> is<00:02:08.740> used<00:02:08.979> a<00:02:09.130> little

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
the voicing the voicing is used a little

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.820 
the voicing the voicing is used a little
bit<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.729> tune<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.750> corresponding<00:02:11.680> amp

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
bit to tune to the corresponding amp

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:40.830 
bit to tune to the corresponding amp
that<00:02:11.980> you're<00:02:12.130> using<00:02:12.340> at<00:02:12.580> that<00:02:12.610> time

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.940 

what<00:02:41.840> I'm<00:02:41.930> gonna<00:02:42.050> do<00:02:42.260> now<00:02:42.470> is<00:02:42.500> I'm<00:02:42.800> basically

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
what I'm gonna do now is I'm basically

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.180 
what I'm gonna do now is I'm basically
set<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.430> up<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:44.180> get<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.540> as<00:02:45.260> close<00:02:45.620> as<00:02:45.770> clean<00:02:46.010> as

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
set it up to get a as close as clean as

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.699 
set it up to get a as close as clean as
we<00:02:46.220> can<00:02:46.550> get<00:02:46.730> for<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.060> pedal<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.599> what<00:02:48.380> we<00:02:48.500> did

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
we can get for the pedal and what we did

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.520 
we can get for the pedal and what we did
is<00:02:48.860> we<00:02:48.890> take<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.430> gain<00:02:49.760> one<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.180> getting<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.540> set

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
is we take a gain one and getting to set

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.360 
is we take a gain one and getting to set
them<00:02:51.680> up<00:02:51.770> around<00:02:52.069> ten<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:53.569> eleven<00:02:54.080> o´clock<00:02:54.370> you

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
them up around ten to eleven o´clock you

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.100 
them up around ten to eleven o´clock you
know<00:02:55.520> so<00:02:56.239> what<00:02:56.360> we're<00:02:56.450> gonna<00:02:56.510> do<00:02:56.750> is<00:02:56.870> go<00:02:57.019> ahead

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
know so what we're gonna do is go ahead

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:04.470 
know so what we're gonna do is go ahead
and<00:02:57.200> play<00:02:57.470> a<00:02:57.500> chord<00:02:57.980> like<00:02:58.069> an<00:02:58.340> e<00:02:58.459> open<00:02:58.880> e<00:02:58.970> chord

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.360 

now<00:03:05.020> we're<00:03:05.200> gonna<00:03:05.349> do<00:03:05.590> is<00:03:05.770> we're<00:03:05.890> gonna<00:03:05.980> change

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
now we're gonna do is we're gonna change

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.080 
now we're gonna do is we're gonna change
game<00:03:06.700> want<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.270> maybe<00:03:07.920> noon<00:03:08.920> or<00:03:09.370> one<00:03:09.819> o'clock

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
game want to maybe noon or one o'clock

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.300 
game want to maybe noon or one o'clock
in<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:10.540> case<00:03:10.750> go<00:03:11.200> ahead

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.160 

so<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.030> notice<00:03:18.390> that<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:18.630> gets<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.870> little<00:03:18.959> more

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
so you notice that it gets a little more

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.420 
so you notice that it gets a little more
aggressive<00:03:19.650> we're<00:03:19.770> gonna<00:03:19.890> do<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.190> same<00:03:20.370> thing

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
aggressive we're gonna do the same thing

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:30.210 
aggressive we're gonna do the same thing
