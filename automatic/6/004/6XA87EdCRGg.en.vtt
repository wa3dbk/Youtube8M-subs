otherwise I'll just wind up pissing

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.010 
otherwise I'll just wind up pissing
yourself<00:01:28.439> off<00:01:28.970> and<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:30.240> honest<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.720> don't

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
yourself off and to be honest I don't

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.140 
yourself off and to be honest I don't
really<00:01:31.140> care<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.740> smiles<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:32.310> gaming<00:01:32.700> if

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
really care for the smiles for gaming if

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.700 
really care for the smiles for gaming if
then<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.420> remembered<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.110> had<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.290> keep<00:01:34.500> one

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
then I remembered but we had to keep one

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.590 
then I remembered but we had to keep one
finger<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.310> mouth<00:01:35.460> at<00:01:35.729> all<00:01:35.850> time<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.479> then

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
finger on the mouth at all time so then

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.420 
finger on the mouth at all time so then
it<00:01:36.720> wasn't<00:01:36.869> too<00:01:37.110> bad<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.890> actually<00:01:38.009> pretty

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
it wasn't too bad it's actually pretty

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.020 
it wasn't too bad it's actually pretty
decent

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
decent

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.730 
decent
my<00:01:40.630> conclusion<00:01:40.840> is<00:01:41.350> that<00:01:41.409> it's<00:01:41.680> not

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
my conclusion is that it's not

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.219 
my conclusion is that it's not
necessarily<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.580> best<00:01:42.790> mouse<00:01:43.119> around<00:01:43.360> and<00:01:44.140> if

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
necessarily the best mouse around and if

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.109 
necessarily the best mouse around and if
you're<00:01:44.409> a<00:01:44.440> gamer<00:01:44.680> here<00:01:45.250> gotta<00:01:45.490> love<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.790> multi

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
you're a gamer here gotta love the multi

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.210 
you're a gamer here gotta love the multi
button<00:01:46.450> mouse<00:01:46.630> but<00:01:47.350> it's<00:01:47.500> really<00:01:47.650> not<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:47.950> bad

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
button mouse but it's really not a bad

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.190 
button mouse but it's really not a bad
Mouse<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:49.000> I<00:01:49.150> tend<00:01:49.360> to<00:01:49.420> think<00:01:49.509> apples<00:01:49.990> on<00:01:50.110> the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
Mouse and I tend to think apples on the

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.749 
Mouse and I tend to think apples on the
right<00:01:50.350> track<00:01:50.619> because<00:01:50.920> they've<00:01:51.280> implemented

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
right track because they've implemented

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.550 
right track because they've implemented
a<00:01:52.000> right<00:01:52.180> mouse<00:01:52.420> button<00:01:52.869> while<00:01:52.990> still<00:01:53.409> keeping

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
a right mouse button while still keeping

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.100 
a right mouse button while still keeping
that<00:01:53.830> one<00:01:54.100> mouse<00:01:54.369> button<00:01:54.820> look<00:01:55.030> my<00:01:55.630> mouse<00:01:55.810> fall

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
that one mouse button look my mouse fall

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.990 
that one mouse button look my mouse fall
hasn't<00:01:56.470> failed<00:01:56.710> me<00:01:56.860> yet<00:01:56.979> but<00:01:57.550> I<00:01:57.610> think<00:01:57.909> the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
hasn't failed me yet but I think the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.180 
hasn't failed me yet but I think the
time<00:01:58.240> will<00:01:58.270> come<00:01:58.479> soon<00:01:58.690> so<00:01:59.560> while<00:01:59.740> a<00:01:59.770> decent

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
time will come soon so while a decent

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.560 
time will come soon so while a decent
mouse<00:02:00.369> I<00:02:00.729> think<00:02:00.940> it's<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.119> little<00:02:01.210> bit<00:02:01.330> too

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
mouse I think it's a little bit too

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.570 
mouse I think it's a little bit too
pricey<00:02:01.899> for<00:02:02.110> what<00:02:02.409> it's<00:02:02.530> really<00:02:02.770> worth<00:02:02.860> so

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
pricey for what it's really worth so

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.010 
pricey for what it's really worth so
when<00:02:03.700> this<00:02:03.820> mouse<00:02:04.060> comes<00:02:04.390> in<00:02:04.509> with<00:02:04.690> your<00:02:04.840> Mac

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
when this mouse comes in with your Mac

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.469 
when this mouse comes in with your Mac
enjoy<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:05.740> because<00:02:05.860> it's<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.190> great<00:02:06.399> mouse<00:02:06.640> but

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
enjoy it because it's a great mouse but

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:08.340 
enjoy it because it's a great mouse but
if<00:02:07.540> you're<00:02:07.630> going<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.810> go<00:02:07.930> out<00:02:07.990> and<00:02:08.170> spend

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
if you're going to go out and spend

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.139 
if you're going to go out and spend
sixty<00:02:08.830> dollars<00:02:09.100> I<00:02:09.250> think<00:02:09.459> you<00:02:09.550> can<00:02:09.670> spin<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:09.970> on

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
sixty dollars I think you can spin it on

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.210 
sixty dollars I think you can spin it on
something<00:02:10.509> a<00:02:10.569> little<00:02:10.899> bit<00:02:11.170> better<00:02:11.410> but

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
something a little bit better but

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.740 
something a little bit better but
there's<00:02:12.400> one<00:02:12.519> thing<00:02:12.580> we<00:02:12.880> can<00:02:13.000> all<00:02:13.180> admit<00:02:13.540> is

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
there's one thing we can all admit is

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.270 
there's one thing we can all admit is
that<00:02:13.780> Apple's<00:02:14.320> getting<00:02:14.620> on<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.800> right<00:02:14.980> track

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
that Apple's getting on the right track

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.200 
that Apple's getting on the right track
with<00:02:15.550> implementing<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.239> right<00:02:16.450> mouse<00:02:16.720> button
