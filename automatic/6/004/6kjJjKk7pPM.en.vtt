00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 good youtube users called me way 160 and this is my first 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.790
 video 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.840
 and therefore my first step in the world of oquendo 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.889
 I'm just a beginner so I ask you please have mercy and 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.549
 do not violate me to fucking 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.580
 good in this video I will make a comparative criticism about a already known 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.400
 anime series nothing more or nothing less than full metal alchemist and full metal 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.550
 alchemist brotherhood or homeless or in Japanese I do not lean for any of 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.509
 both since both have theirs 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:29.839
 you will see why 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.340
 to begin I will talk about the argument of each of the series and 

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:36.570
 the positive and negative points that I find to each one 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.450
 warning 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.910
 If you have not seen either of the two animals 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.240
 do not see this criticism 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.470
 contains some exponents 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.280
 Start 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.300
 in the first fm the story is severely altered with respect to the 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.410
 manga story 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.670
 the shoulders are born differently 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.970
 different events 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.990
 the appearance and the name of some or many asses like murat 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.230
 for irie silot the villain here is a bitch old witch named dante how 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.280
 about a thousand years 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.720
 that is the chief boss of the homo an ass 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.940
 that is, the one that created them and the one that controls them 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.200
 I do not necessarily find this a negative point since the result of 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.260
 alter the story did not give bad product in my opinion 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.980
 the positive points that I find this would be that is more realistic 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.570
 tragic and more dramatic than the second 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.430
 what by personal opinion gives a great and deeper touch to the series 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.340
 although as he progresses to be fierce he will abuse the tragic moments 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.260
 and it will be transformed into a series for children who are weeping with characters we have 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.350
 requested in 12 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.250
 xd exaggerate a bit 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.510
 continuing the death of characters like giroux 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.300
 nima and escarolas I felt much heavier and emotional than in favor of rudy is 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.300
 that were better achieved and better acclimated 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.149
 besides the death of so many other characters, small pile of dead people had 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.580
 to have gathered the cemetery of amestoy bis and not in the dumps 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.380
 they fit xd 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.000
 the rhythm of the anime did not progress as fast as in brotherhood and the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.869
 shoulders were harder enemies to beat 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.420
 and the fact that our world was on the other side of the door was an idea 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.800
 fantastic 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.420
 alright now let's go with the negative points 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.420
 few fights 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.170
 little humor except when she is told her anus between other times 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.810
 the shortage of all the previous sections can make the series 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.960
 come back tedious and monotonous for some thing that did not happen to me since 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.840
 I was stuck to the end watching the series ha ha 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.120
 the story focuses only on ames turís 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.819
 the other countries went through the eggs as well as the wars that 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:31.930
 they had with them 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.389
 -exacto the massacre of hizb al but that war was fundamental in history 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.389
 the argument is less explanatory leaves many loose ends 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.019
 the end of unfinished shit 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.790
 and the end of the movie that followed without satisfying me even though something more than 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.749
 the anime 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:48.340
 talking about sahagun tracks 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.590
 openlink being inc 's 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.099
 The ones I liked the most were those in this series 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.090
 I do not know about you 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.040
 although the brotherhood are not bad and the style of drawing that I liked 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.779
 more also was this series 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:02.069
 look at the ex of the first fm allende sintex uu 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.859
 they saw the difference 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.019
 I opened recently I only see much more deformed than in the previous anime hahaha 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.919
 the other characters are fine but he has undoubtedly taken the prize of 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:13.069
 uglier 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.599
 now he feels that his 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.819
 good points the original story of the manga since without the manga the first 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.239
 anime would not have existed 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.659
 more complete story than the previous series 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.839
 with this I mean that more events happen and it combines 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:28.319
 to tragedy 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.840
 let's go as the typical ani mentions up there more romance 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.989
 although I'm not interested so much xd 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.060
 are no longer the cold semi couples of the previous anime where moments happened 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.040
 romantics every twenty chapters 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.959
 hopefully I found out that Mustang was looking forward to the final rizal of the series 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.249
 Well, I'm already deviating from the subject, let's continue 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:49.459
 the argument is better explained 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.480
 it shows the past of important characters of the anime and the reason for their 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.789
 existence as a jaén ojén 

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:56.750
 among others 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.930
 besides being able to know things about foreign countries and other places that 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.020
 they were never mentioned in the first fm a in addition to the type of alchemy that 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.339
 study in Chinese there are many more characters like 

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:09.059
 they throw me 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:10.859
 it falls like the balls 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.829
 these chimeras that join the team that I do not remember what they are called and so on 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.099
 although honestly some of these characters seem to me of simple filling 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:20.539
 just to vary more 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.560
 the most complete end of the story 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.030
 the animation is better there are more fights 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.970
 more dose of humor and the protas know how to solve their problems better and are 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.759
 more determined are no longer so depressed 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.900
 and finally its negative points 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.650
 gives the impression that the story is flying 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.509
 I mentioned earlier that in this anime there is tragedy and grass but not as much as in 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:41.460
 the first anime 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.270
 in the deaths of gypsy girl I almost did not get excited besides that they passed very 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.879
 Quick 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:49.169
 I know some say it's to focus on the most important facts 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.659
 of the plot but it did not cost them anything to give them a little more emotion 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.379
 it's also less realistic like for example like shit a microbe like 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:00.849
 mecham can have such strength and have such determination 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.990
 and also lynn a simple aspiring prince without knowledge of alchemy 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.060
 which is able to cope with send your second form and without receiving scratch 

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:11.860
 and in artistic terms 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.520
 the homeless scenes seem drawn with crayons and as 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.520
 I mentioned I do not like the drawing style of the series 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.069
 finally I have finished this shit hahaha 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:23.060
 good friends 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.620
 I have given them that nothing more than my humble opinion about these two 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.919
 excellent animes 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.510
 I probably missed something I had to say but I'm not cyber 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:32.970
 jesus so fuck 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.319
 here he says goodbye to 160 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:38.210
 comment and criticize this if you feel like 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.840
 see you soon
