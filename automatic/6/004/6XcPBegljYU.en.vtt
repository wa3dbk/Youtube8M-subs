they<00:03:33.310> use<00:03:33.490> hydraulics<00:03:34.150> with<00:03:34.420> pistons<00:03:34.900> pushing

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
they use hydraulics with pistons pushing

they use hydraulics with pistons pushing
oil<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.860> launch<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.400> cars<00:03:36.640> and<00:03:37.090> magnet

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.850 

the<00:03:42.700> hydraulic<00:03:43.270> system<00:03:43.300> is<00:03:43.750> essentially<00:03:44.230> a

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
the hydraulic system is essentially a

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.280 
the hydraulic system is essentially a
really<00:03:45.400> really<00:03:45.610> simple<00:03:46.300> system<00:03:46.750> it<00:03:46.870> pumps<00:03:47.110> oil

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
really really simple system it pumps oil

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.040 
really really simple system it pumps oil
out<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.710> tank<00:03:47.980> up<00:03:48.580> into<00:03:49.030> four<00:03:49.360> accumulators

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
out of a tank up into four accumulators

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.990 
out of a tank up into four accumulators
and<00:03:50.440> they<00:03:50.860> put<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.130> into<00:03:51.340> very<00:03:51.520> high<00:03:51.700> pressure

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
and they put it into very high pressure

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.400 
and they put it into very high pressure
oil<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.570> know<00:03:52.660> it's<00:03:52.810> like<00:03:53.640> 250<00:03:54.640> bar<00:03:55.030> and

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
oil you know it's like 250 bar and

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.630 
oil you know it's like 250 bar and
essentially<00:03:56.410> they<00:03:56.560> pump<00:03:56.800> that<00:03:56.950> oil<00:03:57.220> in<00:03:57.430> there

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
essentially they pump that oil in there

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.760 
essentially they pump that oil in there
and<00:03:57.850> pump<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.240> up<00:03:58.270> against<00:03:58.600> nitrogen<00:03:59.140> which<00:03:59.290> is

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
and pump it up against nitrogen which is

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.670 
and pump it up against nitrogen which is
compressed<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.460> acts<00:04:00.610> like<00:04:00.820> a<00:04:00.850> spring<00:04:01.150> on<00:04:01.680> a

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
compressed and acts like a spring on a

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.980 
compressed and acts like a spring on a
signal<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.850> oil<00:04:04.060> is<00:04:04.240> released<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:04.780> runs

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
signal the oil is released and runs

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.710 
signal the oil is released and runs
through<00:04:05.200> 32<00:04:05.560> hydraulic<00:04:06.220> motors<00:04:06.550> it<00:04:07.150> creates<00:04:07.570> a

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
through 32 hydraulic motors it creates a

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.750 
through 32 hydraulic motors it creates a
