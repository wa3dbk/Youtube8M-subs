00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
about 20 times so it's a lot of hard

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.539 
about 20 times so it's a lot of hard
work<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.650> with<00:01:20.009> all<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.310> hard<00:01:20.520> work

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
work it's just with all this hard work

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.370 
work it's just with all this hard work
just<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.909> get<00:01:21.030> one<00:01:21.210> good<00:01:21.360> picture<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:22.110> want<00:01:22.320> it

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380
