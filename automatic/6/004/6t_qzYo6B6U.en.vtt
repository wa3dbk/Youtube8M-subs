absolutely love to see it so for this
you're<00:00:18.750> going<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.199> need<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:20.310> LPS<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.060> you're

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
you're going to need the LPS that you're

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.230 
you're going to need the LPS that you're
drawing<00:00:21.600> or<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.529> picture<00:00:22.949> calpis<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.850> front<00:00:24.150> of

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
drawing or a picture calpis in front of

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.140 
drawing or a picture calpis in front of
you<00:00:24.830> and<00:00:25.830> eraser<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:28.080> pencil<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.849> first

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
you and eraser and a pencil so the first

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.110 
you and eraser and a pencil so the first
step<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:31.710> do<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.130> top<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.700> head<00:00:32.880> and

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
step is to do the top of the head and

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.600 
step is to do the top of the head and
I've<00:00:33.840> done<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.230> little<00:00:34.620> bit<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.950> hair<00:00:35.280> that

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
I've done this little bit of hair that

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.060 
I've done this little bit of hair that
they<00:00:35.760> have<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.239> top<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.620> this

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
they have on the top and then this this

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.490 
they have on the top and then this this
top<00:00:38.340> head<00:00:38.610> bar<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.510> now<00:00:39.719> I'm<00:00:39.899> going<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.200> do<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
top head bar so now I'm going to do the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.889 
top head bar so now I'm going to do the
ears<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.070> notice<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.510> cocker

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
ears and notice that on the cocker

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.470 
ears and notice that on the cocker
spaniels<00:00:43.440> ears<00:00:43.680> they<00:00:44.309> do<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.789> little<00:00:45.180> lines

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
spaniels ears they do have little lines

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.350 
spaniels ears they do have little lines
it's<00:00:46.200> quite<00:00:46.590> textured<00:00:47.250> because<00:00:47.910> those<00:00:48.149> are

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
it's quite textured because those are

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.990 
it's quite textured because those are
represent<00:00:48.930> little<00:00:49.289> curls<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:50.070> they're<00:00:50.760> on

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
represent little curls if they're on

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.200 
represent little curls if they're on
their<00:00:51.809> fur<00:00:52.140> all<00:00:52.289> mirrors<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.460> remember<00:00:54.000> to

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
their fur all mirrors so remember to

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.240 
their fur all mirrors so remember to
make<00:00:54.360> Google<00:00:54.600> lines<00:00:54.989> little<00:00:55.649> curls<00:00:55.980> to

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
make Google lines little curls to

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.420 
make Google lines little curls to
represent<00:00:56.789> points<00:00:57.230> okay<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.289> I've<00:00:58.949> drawn<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
represent points okay so I've drawn the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.200 
represent points okay so I've drawn the
ears<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.120> as<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.140> can<00:01:01.289> see<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:02.210> these

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
ears and as you can see I have these

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.460 
ears and as you can see I have these
little<00:01:03.840> um<00:01:04.850> little<00:01:05.850> lines<00:01:06.119> for<00:01:06.360> texture<00:01:07.080> in

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
little um little lines for texture in

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.570 
little um little lines for texture in
there<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.930> yeah<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.470> could<00:01:10.619> draw<00:01:10.890> more<00:01:11.250> lines

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
there and yeah you could draw more lines

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.710 
there and yeah you could draw more lines
if<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.939> wanted<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.540> or<00:01:12.799> less<00:01:13.799> lines<00:01:14.180> but<00:01:15.180> yeah

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
if you wanted to or less lines but yeah

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.820 
if you wanted to or less lines but yeah
so<00:01:16.680> I've<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:16.979> finished<00:01:17.580> drawing<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:19.470> bottom

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
so I've just finished drawing the bottom

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.700 
so I've just finished drawing the bottom
of<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> head<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.170> bit<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
of the head so it's just like a bit of a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.780 
of the head so it's just like a bit of a
curved<00:01:23.220> line<00:01:24.920> see<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.220> yeah<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.580> pretty

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
curved line see so yeah it's pretty

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.569 
curved line see so yeah it's pretty
simple<00:01:27.270> drawn<00:01:28.170> some<00:01:28.409> guidelines<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.189> help<00:01:29.280> me

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
simple drawn some guidelines to help me

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.850 
simple drawn some guidelines to help me
out<00:01:29.729> here<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.290> where<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.710> eyes<00:01:31.829> are

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
out here and this is where the eyes are

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.280 
out here and this is where the eyes are
you<00:01:32.460> know<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.850> because<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:34.020> first

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
you know that because this first

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.990 
you know that because this first
separates<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.189> space<00:01:35.520> between

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
separates the space between

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.410 
separates the space between
so<00:01:37.750> I've<00:01:37.960> drawn<00:01:38.350> my<00:01:38.380> eyes<00:01:38.890> basically<00:01:39.640> around

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
so I've drawn my eyes basically around

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.450 
so I've drawn my eyes basically around
the<00:01:40.660> guidelines<00:01:41.200> but<00:01:41.830> they're<00:01:42.010> a<00:01:42.040> little<00:01:42.280> bit

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
the guidelines but they're a little bit

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.130 
the guidelines but they're a little bit
off<00:01:42.760> and<00:01:42.940> that<00:01:43.210> doesn't<00:01:43.600> matter<00:01:43.720> because

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
off and that doesn't matter because

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.620 
off and that doesn't matter because
they're<00:01:44.740> supposed<00:01:45.190> to<00:01:45.550> be<00:01:45.700> messy<00:01:45.910> so<00:01:46.600> I

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
they're supposed to be messy so I

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.650 
they're supposed to be messy so I
thought<00:01:47.200> my<00:01:47.410> nose<00:01:47.470> my<00:01:48.010> mouth<00:01:48.220> and<00:01:48.490> notice<00:01:49.450> that

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
thought my nose my mouth and notice that

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.940 
thought my nose my mouth and notice that
they<00:01:49.870> take<00:01:50.170> up<00:01:50.380> about<00:01:50.910> two<00:01:51.910> lines<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:53.200> they're

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
they take up about two lines and they're

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.900 
they take up about two lines and they're
about<00:01:54.310> under<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.090> eye<00:01:55.120> so<00:01:55.900> yeah<00:01:56.470> so<00:01:57.310> I<00:01:57.340> draw<00:01:57.850> in

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
about under the eye so yeah so I draw in

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.910 
about under the eye so yeah so I draw in
front<00:01:58.300> of<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.510> body<00:01:58.720> and<00:01:59.260> if<00:01:59.380> you<00:01:59.470> look<00:01:59.650> at<00:01:59.800> the

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
front of the body and if you look at the

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.670 
front of the body and if you look at the
LPS<00:02:00.340> I'm<00:02:00.580> kind<00:02:01.300> of<00:02:01.390> drawing<00:02:01.870> it<00:02:02.110> from<00:02:02.380> about

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
LPS I'm kind of drawing it from about

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.270 
LPS I'm kind of drawing it from about
this<00:02:03.250> angle<00:02:03.910> on<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.180> body<00:02:04.390> so<00:02:05.350> my<00:02:05.740> paw<00:02:05.980> is

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
this angle on the body so my paw is

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.160 
this angle on the body so my paw is
sticking<00:02:06.820> out<00:02:07.000> to<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.330> side<00:02:07.540> little<00:02:07.900> so<00:02:08.110> I

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
sticking out to the side little so I

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.990 
sticking out to the side little so I
finish<00:02:08.649> drawing<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.250> rest<00:02:09.429> of<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.760> body
