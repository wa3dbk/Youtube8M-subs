other<00:02:04.079> ones<00:02:04.290> had<00:02:04.469> better<00:02:04.710> stars<00:02:05.159> some<00:02:05.969> have

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
other ones had better stars some have

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.869 
other ones had better stars some have
worse<00:02:06.329> stars<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:08.250> do<00:02:08.399> need<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.729> on<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
worse stars you do need to be on the

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.969 
worse stars you do need to be on the
lookout<00:02:09.209> for<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.929> paint<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.500> face<00:02:10.679> some

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
lookout for the paint on the face some

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.520 
lookout for the paint on the face some
of<00:02:11.099> them<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.400> some<00:02:12.300> walkie<00:02:12.510> mustaches

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
of them have some walkie mustaches

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.050 
of them have some walkie mustaches
or<00:02:13.650> some<00:02:13.920> kind<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.130> gac<00:02:14.340> where<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.700> eyebrows

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
or some kind of gac where the eyebrows

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.550 
or some kind of gac where the eyebrows
are<00:02:15.300> but<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.540> think<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.870> picked<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.170> really<00:02:16.350> really

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
are but I think I picked a really really

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.190 
are but I think I picked a really really
good<00:02:16.740> figure<00:02:17.069> here<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:18.060> like<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.780> his<00:02:18.959> teeth

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
good figure here I like that his teeth

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.550 
good figure here I like that his teeth
are<00:02:19.850> exposed<00:02:20.900> there's<00:02:21.900> an<00:02:22.050> axe<00:02:22.200> cop<00:02:22.440> that

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
are exposed there's an axe cop that

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.720 
are exposed there's an axe cop that
comes<00:02:22.740> with<00:02:22.860> Westar<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.459> it's<00:02:23.580> got<00:02:23.700> a

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
comes with Westar and it's got a

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.400 
comes with Westar and it's got a
different<00:02:24.150> head<00:02:24.300> sculpt<00:02:24.569> so<00:02:24.750> that's<00:02:24.930> cool<00:02:25.140> but

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
different head sculpt so that's cool but

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.730 
different head sculpt so that's cool but
there's<00:02:25.590> two<00:02:25.830> excellent<00:02:26.100> figures<00:02:26.400> out<00:02:26.550> there

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
there's two excellent figures out there

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.170 
there's two excellent figures out there
very<00:02:28.740> simple<00:02:29.040> work<00:02:29.190> here<00:02:29.370> with<00:02:29.640> his<00:02:29.819> badge<00:02:30.000> on

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
very simple work here with his badge on

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.699 
very simple work here with his badge on
the<00:02:30.239> chest<00:02:30.480> but<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> American<00:02:31.319> flag<00:02:31.500> looks

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
the chest but the American flag looks

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.390 
the chest but the American flag looks
good<00:02:32.060> paint<00:02:33.060> on<00:02:33.209> this<00:02:33.300> is<00:02:33.450> really<00:02:33.720> clean<00:02:33.989> I

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
good paint on this is really clean I

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.170 
good paint on this is really clean I
mean<00:02:35.400> there's<00:02:35.550> no<00:02:35.700> real<00:02:35.880> lines<00:02:36.270> or<00:02:38.060> smudges<00:02:39.060> to

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
mean there's no real lines or smudges to

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.530 
mean there's no real lines or smudges to
speak<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.730> paint<00:02:41.970> doesn't<00:02:42.209> hide

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
speak of and the the paint doesn't hide

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.100 
speak of and the the paint doesn't hide
the<00:02:43.080> sculpt<00:02:43.500> at<00:02:43.620> all<00:02:43.739> it's<00:02:43.980> it's<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.550> nice

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
the sculpt at all it's it's a nice

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.479 
the sculpt at all it's it's a nice
balance<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:46.380> sculpt<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:46.860> paint<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.220> create<00:02:47.340> a

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
balance of sculpt and paint to create a

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.190 
balance of sculpt and paint to create a
simple<00:02:47.790> stylized<00:02:48.390> figure<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:48.959> think<00:02:49.140> we

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
simple stylized figure that I think we

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.130 
simple stylized figure that I think we
did<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.380> really<00:02:49.620> really<00:02:49.709> good<00:02:49.950> job<00:02:50.130> with

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
did a really really good job with

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.060 
did a really really good job with
articulation<00:02:52.140> on<00:02:52.350> this<00:02:52.470> figure<00:02:52.739> is<00:02:52.830> fine

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
articulation on this figure is fine

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.949 
articulation on this figure is fine
however<00:02:53.610> just<00:02:53.730> know<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.330> hinged<00:02:54.630> legs

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
however just know that the hinged legs

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.570 
however just know that the hinged legs
don't<00:02:55.350> really<00:02:55.470> matter<00:02:55.860> because<00:02:56.130> there<00:02:56.519> is

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
don't really matter because there is

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.270 
don't really matter because there is
only<00:02:56.670> one<00:02:57.200> position<00:02:58.200> these<00:02:58.319> flat<00:02:58.709> sculpted

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
only one position these flat sculpted

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.820 
only one position these flat sculpted
shoes<00:02:59.550> can<00:02:59.790> be<00:02:59.819> in<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.480> any<00:03:00.810> other<00:03:01.050> position

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
shoes can be in so any other position

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.020 
shoes can be in so any other position
from<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.280> he<00:03:02.459> won't<00:03:02.550> be<00:03:02.670> able<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.850> stand

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
from that he won't be able to stand

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.390 
from that he won't be able to stand
properly<00:03:03.330> but<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.930> legs<00:03:04.140> do<00:03:04.380> move<00:03:04.590> well<00:03:04.830> the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
properly but the legs do move well the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.340 
properly but the legs do move well the
arms<00:03:05.730> move<00:03:05.790> well<00:03:06.150> one<00:03:06.900> thing<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.110> need<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.230> be

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
arms move well one thing you need to be

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.559 
arms move well one thing you need to be
aware<00:03:07.500> of<00:03:07.560> though<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:08.100> that<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.670> if<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:09.360> put

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
aware of though is that the if you put

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.990 
aware of though is that the if you put
his<00:03:09.720> arm<00:03:10.019> up<00:03:10.170> with<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.500> gun<00:03:10.709> it<00:03:11.430> will<00:03:11.670> tip<00:03:11.970> the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
his arm up with the gun it will tip the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.530 
his arm up with the gun it will tip the
balance<00:03:12.269> of<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.900> figure<00:03:14.030> because<00:03:15.030> his<00:03:15.180> his

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
balance of the figure because his his

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.390 
balance of the figure because his his
feet<00:03:15.900> are<00:03:16.080> pretty<00:03:16.380> little<00:03:16.680> but<00:03:17.040> if<00:03:17.160> you<00:03:17.250> just

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
feet are pretty little but if you just

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.789 
feet are pretty little but if you just
bring<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:17.730> gun<00:03:17.880> down<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.150> bit<00:03:18.500> then<00:03:19.500> he<00:03:19.650> doesn't

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
bring the gun down a bit then he doesn't

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.780 
bring the gun down a bit then he doesn't
fall<00:03:20.040> over<00:03:20.480> but<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.510> think<00:03:22.290> it's<00:03:22.440> awesome<00:03:23.220> that

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
fall over but I think it's awesome that

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.940 
fall over but I think it's awesome that
uh<00:03:24.209> he<00:03:24.870> has<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.320> poops<00:03:25.920> sucker<00:03:26.250> gun<00:03:26.519> and<00:03:27.799> oh<00:03:28.799> by

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
uh he has the poops sucker gun and oh by

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.979 
uh he has the poops sucker gun and oh by
the<00:03:28.980> way<00:03:29.130> his<00:03:29.340> head<00:03:29.489> articulation<00:03:30.090> it's<00:03:30.720> just

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
the way his head articulation it's just

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.990 
the way his head articulation it's just
a<00:03:31.079> side-to-side<00:03:31.350> head<00:03:31.709> but<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.579> works<00:03:32.790> it

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
a side-to-side head but it works it

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.330 
a side-to-side head but it works it
works<00:03:33.030> really<00:03:33.329> really<00:03:33.420> well<00:03:33.739> my<00:03:34.739> mistake<00:03:34.890> his

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
works really really well my mistake his

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.100 
works really really well my mistake his
head<00:03:35.370> is<00:03:35.790> not<00:03:35.970> just<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.480> head<00:03:36.660> that<00:03:36.750> swivels

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
head is not just a head that swivels

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.900 
head is not just a head that swivels
left<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.410> right<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.769> is<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.040> ball<00:03:38.310> jointed<00:03:38.700> head

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
left and right it is a ball jointed head

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.259 
left and right it is a ball jointed head
I<00:03:40.070> have<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.130> hard<00:03:41.310> time<00:03:41.430> getting<00:03:41.730> in<00:03:41.850> a<00:03:41.910> baby<00:03:42.090> to

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
I have a hard time getting in a baby to

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.180 
I have a hard time getting in a baby to
set<00:03:42.510> up<00:03:42.630> right<00:03:42.870> but<00:03:43.109> there<00:03:43.290> is<00:03:43.320> like<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.799> sweet

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
set up right but there is like a sweet

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.220 
set up right but there is like a sweet
spot<00:03:44.370> somewhere<00:03:45.090> between<00:03:45.630> his<00:03:45.900> legs<00:03:46.049> and

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
spot somewhere between his legs and

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.750 
spot somewhere between his legs and
diaper<00:03:46.410> there<00:03:46.799> you<00:03:46.890> go<00:03:47.010> where<00:03:47.280> he<00:03:47.400> doesn't

minor complaint because the way he

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
has done here what they've done is

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.430 
has done here what they've done is
they've<00:04:03.060> made<00:04:03.239> an<00:04:03.359> action<00:04:03.780> figure<00:04:03.959> that

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
they've made an action figure that

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.830 
they've made an action figure that
appeals<00:04:04.859> to<00:04:04.980> adult<00:04:05.370> collectors<00:04:05.910> but<00:04:06.660> also

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
appeals to adult collectors but also

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.319 
appeals to adult collectors but also
looks<00:04:07.320> like<00:04:07.440> it<00:04:07.680> could<00:04:07.890> be<00:04:07.920> just<00:04:08.400> little<00:04:09.180> kids

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329

action<00:04:09.720> figure<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.230> I<00:04:10.739> think<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:11.130> suits

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
action figure and I think that suits

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.890 
action figure and I think that suits
ex-cop<00:04:12.180> sensibilities<00:04:12.840> just<00:04:13.140> fine<00:04:13.410> because

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
ex-cop sensibilities just fine because

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.270 
ex-cop sensibilities just fine because

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
I could easily see like a little kid

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.080 
I could easily see like a little kid
