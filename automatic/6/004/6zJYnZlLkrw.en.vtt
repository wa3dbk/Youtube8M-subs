it<00:04:07.310> allows<00:04:07.519> you<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:07.790> jump<00:04:07.940> on<00:04:08.120> enemies<00:04:08.269> and

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
it allows you to jump on enemies and

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.319 
it allows you to jump on enemies and
damage<00:04:09.079> them<00:04:09.290> but<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:10.609> hit<00:04:10.760> detection<00:04:10.879> is

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
damage them but the hit detection is

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:17.830 
damage them but the hit detection is
pretty<00:04:11.629> weird<00:04:11.810> on<00:04:11.989> it<00:04:12.170> and<00:04:12.909> no<00:04:13.909> damn<00:04:14.540> it<00:04:16.840> well

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
pretty weird on it and no damn it well

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.509 
pretty weird on it and no damn it well
that<00:04:17.959> was<00:04:18.139> the<00:04:18.620> exploding<00:04:19.039> apples<00:04:19.370> are

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
that was the exploding apples are

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.150 
that was the exploding apples are
actually<00:04:19.820> a<00:04:19.880> good<00:04:19.970> example<00:04:20.030> of<00:04:21.160> something

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
actually a good example of something

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.260 
actually a good example of something
that<00:04:22.250> you<00:04:22.400> probably<00:04:22.520> don't<00:04:22.849> realize<00:04:23.120> about

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
that you probably don't realize about

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.339 
that you probably don't realize about
the<00:04:23.419> game<00:04:23.570> unless<00:04:23.780> you're<00:04:23.930> actually<00:04:24.050> playing

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
the game unless you're actually playing

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.680 
the game unless you're actually playing
it<00:04:24.699> which<00:04:25.699> is<00:04:25.849> that<00:04:25.880> it's<00:04:26.180> deceptively

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
it which is that it's deceptively

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.180 
it which is that it's deceptively
simple-looking<00:04:29.199> yeah<00:04:30.199> the<00:04:30.410> game<00:04:30.530> has<00:04:30.800> cutesy

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
simple-looking yeah the game has cutesy

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.860 
simple-looking yeah the game has cutesy
graphics<00:04:31.639> and<00:04:31.970> oh<00:04:32.389> also<00:04:32.840> notice<00:04:33.289> that<00:04:33.320> the

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
graphics and oh also notice that the

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.390 
graphics and oh also notice that the
special<00:04:35.870> items<00:04:36.169> don't<00:04:36.440> respawn<00:04:36.860> when<00:04:37.039> you<00:04:37.160> die

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.040 

which<00:04:40.400> makes<00:04:40.729> the<00:04:40.820> game<00:04:41.000> a<00:04:41.300> little<00:04:41.810> bit<00:04:41.930> more

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
which makes the game a little bit more

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.409 
which makes the game a little bit more
difficult<00:04:42.440> sometimes<00:04:43.090> because<00:04:44.090> every<00:04:44.300> now

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
difficult sometimes because every now

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.240 
difficult sometimes because every now
and<00:04:44.539> then<00:04:44.599> you<00:04:44.720> actually<00:04:45.110> need<00:04:45.260> those<00:04:45.410> items

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.379 

but<00:04:49.250> yeah<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.520> game<00:04:49.639> is<00:04:49.760> a<00:04:49.789> bit<00:04:49.940> deceptively

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
but yeah the game is a bit deceptively

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.529 
but yeah the game is a bit deceptively
simple<00:04:51.250> because<00:04:52.250> there's<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:52.430> cute<00:04:52.729> style<00:04:53.120> and

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
simple because there's a cute style and

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.420 
simple because there's a cute style and
you'd<00:04:53.840> think<00:04:54.080> oh<00:04:54.260> he's<00:04:55.099> a<00:04:55.130> game<00:04:55.400> no<00:04:55.849> not<00:04:56.210> at<00:04:56.360> all

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
you'd think oh he's a game no not at all

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.529 
you'd think oh he's a game no not at all
pretty<00:04:58.430> hard<00:04:58.669> actually<00:04:58.820> in<00:04:59.090> some<00:04:59.270> spots

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.249 

we<00:05:04.539> have<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:04.780> whacking<00:05:05.169> spoon<00:05:06.930> try<00:05:07.930> not<00:05:08.080> to<00:05:08.169> go

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259 
we have the whacking spoon try not to go
