00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello how about how are all a pleasure 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.569
 Say hello again on this occasion 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.630
 I'm going to show you a very special video 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.790
 an exclusive video the dark sensor that 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.980
 we brought from celebration 6 for all 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.350
 you will throw a little bit that was 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.950
 what happened with this video in the row 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.230
 for Kenny Baker's autograph that 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.660
 who makes arturito this I find myself 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.580
 to good friend arturo and then we 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.800
 we agree to go to form 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.219
 to the row of the skywalker ranch while 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.870
 he took the autograph high but now 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.670
 we are trained to get tumulus 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.859
 we entered the whole wave and I was happy 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.719
 watching the monkeys that will show us that 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.690
 video because there are some figures you use 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.940
 quite interesting and this and in that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.589
 moment arturo was waiting for 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.829
 steve so they gave us a gift 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.030
 autograph for the teacher and in the wait 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.359
 I tell you, it's already like that 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.269
 I want to go to the saint, I am very, very 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:59.400
 desperate and in that moment I see enter 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.280
 to an entourage of people 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.420
 the person who caught my attention 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.910
 the surprise was a guide who was the actor 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.370
 that will represent the emperor in the saga 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.790
 from star wars the usual emperor of him 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.880
 I wanted to take a picture but the price 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.800
 it was a little bit high at $ 75 and 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.320
 then I ran out of wool and I stayed 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.210
 with the desire to take my picture but 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.520
 this was the great reward that I had from 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.160
 celebration 6 that follows in the moment 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.750
 that enters and they have closed the access and 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.460
 then we were very few people 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.979
 around 7 we stayed 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.130
 inside the stand and then steve him 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.320
 begins to show its part the exhibition 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.960
 I had had and it was like we had 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.440
 these images in exclusive also 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.380
 thanks to friend arturo 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.990

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.090

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.170

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.100
 but if we can get very close 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.660
 our body for life but 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.650

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.670
 the 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.670
 d 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.560
 some emotional stimuli about 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.560
 how many steps 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.560

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.490
 also to the friend arturo that we stay 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:43.569
 waiting for what he wants an autograph 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.969
 from steve here we are german 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.559

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:50.050
 I never do I am a super person 

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:52.089
 impatient but this time I got a great 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.639
 reward that is to be able to see there before 

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:56.229
 as close as they saw the turn that 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.179
 It comes with taking care of her and that 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.429
 does it back but you see that it matters not 

00:05:58.179 --> 00:06:02.740
 we have a few steps what 

00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:05.800
 we managed to record we did not have pictures of 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.169
 but you can see my smile from ear to 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:13.179
 Wey ear super happy thanks to the bull 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:15.189
 to quote nothing amazing is not it 

00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:17.349
 I hope they get excited as I do with 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:19.089
 this video I think there were very few 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:21.909
 people that I had inside I had the 

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:25.059
 fortunate to record it from very very close like this 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:26.529
 that this after only this is worth it 

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:31.349
 have come here I do not want to know 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:31.349
 nothing else with this I am more than happy
