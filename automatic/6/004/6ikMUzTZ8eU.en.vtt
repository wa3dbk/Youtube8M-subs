the<00:00:41.129> nexus<00:00:41.520> 5<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.329> video<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:43.079> spotted<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the nexus 5 in that video we spotted a

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
look like the Nexus 5 so we assume that

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.660 
look like the Nexus 5 so we assume that
this<00:00:50.550> will<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.539> next<00:00:51.809> Nexus<00:00:52.379> 5<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:53.219> have<00:00:53.430> a

this will be the next Nexus 5 we have a

first<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.149> all<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.570> device<00:00:57.960> would<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
first of all this device would have the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
this is not a future-proof device like

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.120 
this is not a future-proof device like
the<00:01:21.000> Samsung<00:01:21.420> Galaxy<00:01:21.450> Note<00:01:22.020> 3<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.530> which<00:01:22.979> you

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 in which you

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.789 
the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 in which you
have<00:01:23.430> monstrous<00:01:24.180> performance<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.200> specs

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
have monstrous performance but the specs

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.760 
have monstrous performance but the specs
are<00:01:26.070> mid<00:01:26.640> high<00:01:26.970> end<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.960> big<00:01:28.170> thing<00:01:28.200> is

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
are mid high end but the big thing is

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.429 
are mid high end but the big thing is
that<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.579> nexus<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:31.259> basically

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
that it's a nexus so it's just basically

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.429 
that it's a nexus so it's just basically
clean<00:01:31.950> simple<00:01:32.310> smooth<00:01:33.180> vanilla<00:01:33.509> experience

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
clean simple smooth vanilla experience

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.490 
clean simple smooth vanilla experience
so<00:01:34.710> definitely<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.850> phone<00:01:36.570> was<00:01:37.170> worth

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
so definitely this phone was worth

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.830 
so definitely this phone was worth
buying<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.880> more<00:01:39.090> leak<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.450> goes<00:01:39.689> along

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
buying it one more leak that goes along

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.080 
buying it one more leak that goes along
with<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.259> Nexus<00:01:40.560> 5<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.490> nexus<00:01:41.850> 5

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
with the Nexus 5 is that this nexus 5

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.810 
with the Nexus 5 is that this nexus 5
will<00:01:42.630> have<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.170> bigger<00:01:43.439> camera<00:01:43.799> aperture<00:01:44.220> so

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
will have a bigger camera aperture so

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.620 
will have a bigger camera aperture so
that<00:01:45.060> will<00:01:45.270> let<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.720> more<00:01:46.020> light<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.630> much

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
that will let in more light in and much

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.690 
that will let in more light in and much
better<00:01:49.020> shallow<00:01:49.439> depth<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.950> field<00:01:50.009> now<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
better shallow depth of field now the

micro USB charging mandatory for all

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.430 
micro USB charging mandatory for all
devices<00:02:49.310> now<00:02:50.120> this<00:02:50.390> could<00:02:50.570> be<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.690> huge<00:02:50.750> huge

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
devices now this could be a huge huge

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.310 
devices now this could be a huge huge
problem<00:02:52.040> for<00:02:52.070> a<00:02:52.580> company<00:02:53.060> like<00:02:53.300> Apple<00:02:53.840> which

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
problem for a company like Apple which

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.550 
problem for a company like Apple which
they<00:02:54.620> have<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:55.280> proprietary<00:02:56.060> lightning<00:02:56.750> cable

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
they have of proprietary lightning cable

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.009 
they have of proprietary lightning cable
or<00:02:57.739> lightning<00:02:58.220> port<00:02:58.430> for<00:02:59.090> their<00:02:59.120> devices<00:02:59.600> and

or lightning port for their devices and

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.470 
or lightning port for their devices and
I<00:03:00.530> don't<00:03:00.860> feel<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:01.160> Apple<00:03:01.910> would<00:03:02.120> move<00:03:02.450> to

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
I don't feel that Apple would move to

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.830 
I don't feel that Apple would move to
micro<00:03:03.080> USB<00:03:03.560> anytime<00:03:04.340> soon<00:03:04.700> so<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:05.420> would<00:03:05.660> be<00:03:05.810> a

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
micro USB anytime soon so it would be a

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.380 
micro USB anytime soon so it would be a
huge<00:03:06.170> problem<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:07.010> huge<00:03:07.370> disadvantage<00:03:07.730> for

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
huge problem and huge disadvantage for

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.020 
huge problem and huge disadvantage for
them<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:08.930> along<00:03:09.530> with<00:03:09.730> technology<00:03:10.730> just

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
them and along with technology just

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.449 
them and along with technology just
improves<00:03:11.540> each<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.170> every<00:03:12.470> time<00:03:12.739> just<00:03:13.340> like

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
improves each and every time just like

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.039 
improves each and every time just like
the<00:03:13.640> approach<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:14.180> has<00:03:14.420> been<00:03:14.630> taken<00:03:14.959> with

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
the approach that has been taken with

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.410 
the approach that has been taken with
the<00:03:15.140> Samsung<00:03:15.380> Galaxy<00:03:15.500> Note<00:03:16.010> 3<00:03:16.040> that<00:03:16.910> we<00:03:17.239> have

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 that we have

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.820 
the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 that we have
the<00:03:17.660> USB<00:03:17.959> 3.0<00:03:18.650> which<00:03:19.400> allows<00:03:20.120> us<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.810> do<00:03:21.019> faster

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
the USB 3.0 which allows us to do faster

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.890 
the USB 3.0 which allows us to do faster
data<00:03:21.980> transfer<00:03:22.519> speed<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:23.030> faster<00:03:23.660> charging

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
data transfer speed and faster charging

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.860 
data transfer speed and faster charging
and<00:03:24.370> basically<00:03:25.370> no<00:03:25.700> other<00:03:25.880> company<00:03:26.269> will<00:03:26.480> try

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
and basically no other company will try

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.550 
and basically no other company will try
to<00:03:27.500> make<00:03:28.160> other<00:03:28.519> than<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:29.090> micro<00:03:29.480> USB<00:03:29.959> because

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
to make other than the micro USB because

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.380 
to make other than the micro USB because
of<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:30.890> law<00:03:31.100> that<00:03:31.430> UK<00:03:31.790> government<00:03:32.209> has

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
of the law that UK government has

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.569 
of the law that UK government has
applied<00:03:32.690> that<00:03:33.079> micro<00:03:33.709> USB<00:03:34.070> charging<00:03:34.459> is

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
applied that micro USB charging is

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.539 
applied that micro USB charging is
mandatory<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.630> I<00:03:35.900> guess<00:03:36.070> UK<00:03:37.070> government

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
mandatory so I guess UK government

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.090 
mandatory so I guess UK government
should<00:03:37.970> realize<00:03:38.360> that<00:03:38.780> it<00:03:39.079> is<00:03:39.560> not<00:03:39.829> really

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
should realize that it is not really

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.729 
should realize that it is not really
necessary<00:03:40.700> that<00:03:41.269> micro<00:03:41.660> USB<00:03:42.110> charging<00:03:42.410> should

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
necessary that micro USB charging should

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.979 
necessary that micro USB charging should
be<00:03:42.860> mandatory<00:03:43.100> and<00:03:43.610> they<00:03:44.180> just<00:03:44.420> take<00:03:44.750> their

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
be mandatory and they just take their

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.740 
be mandatory and they just take their
words<00:03:45.230> back<00:03:45.560> off<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.220> i<00:03:46.970> would<00:03:47.180> like<00:03:47.299> to<00:03:47.510> wrap

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
words back off and i would like to wrap

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.360 
words back off and i would like to wrap
