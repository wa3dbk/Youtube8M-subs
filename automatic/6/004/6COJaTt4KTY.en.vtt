ran<00:02:07.110> under<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.410> brow<00:02:08.000> what's<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.090> only<00:02:09.149> thing

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.290 
ran under the brow what's the only thing
I<00:02:09.509> think<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.840> palettes<00:02:10.289> missing<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:11.820> matte

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.750 
I think that palettes missing is a matte
beige<00:02:12.660> it's<00:02:13.320> kind<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.709> boring<00:02:13.890> color<00:02:14.250> but<00:02:14.580> I

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
beige it's kind of a boring color but I

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.930 
beige it's kind of a boring color but I
really<00:02:15.180> do<00:02:15.420> feel<00:02:15.450> like<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.900> finishes<00:02:16.410> off<00:02:16.940> any

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
really do feel like it finishes off any

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.330 
really do feel like it finishes off any
