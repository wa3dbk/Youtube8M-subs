00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480 

I've<00:00:00.480> always<00:00:00.750> been<00:00:01.050> fascinated<00:00:01.680> with<00:00:02.250> what

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
I've always been fascinated with what

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.490 
I've always been fascinated with what
goes<00:00:02.700> on<00:00:02.850> behind<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.449> scenes<00:00:03.840> of<00:00:04.170> making

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
goes on behind the scenes of making

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.120 
goes on behind the scenes of making
movies<00:00:04.859> and<00:00:05.420> for<00:00:06.420> myself<00:00:06.620> it's<00:00:07.620> always<00:00:07.980> been

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
movies and for myself it's always been

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.190 
movies and for myself it's always been
common<00:00:08.580> knowledge<00:00:08.610> that<00:00:08.970> when<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.780> movie<00:00:10.019> is

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
common knowledge that when a movie is

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.339 
common knowledge that when a movie is
shot<00:00:10.440> they<00:00:11.219> record<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.150> video<00:00:12.450> in<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.900> audio

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
shot they record the video in the audio

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.410 
shot they record the video in the audio
separately<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.130> then<00:00:14.670> match<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.150> two<00:00:15.299> of

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
separately and then match the two of

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.890 
separately and then match the two of
them<00:00:15.540> up<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.900> post<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:17.330> that<00:00:18.330> makes<00:00:18.539> complete

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
them up and post and that makes complete

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.810 
them up and post and that makes complete
sense<00:00:18.930> because<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:20.160> know<00:00:20.250> they<00:00:20.369> want<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.699> get

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
sense because you know they want to get

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.109 
sense because you know they want to get
the<00:00:20.939> best<00:00:21.090> possible<00:00:21.420> quality<00:00:21.930> from<00:00:22.529> each<00:00:22.769> one

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
the best possible quality from each one

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.939 
the best possible quality from each one
but<00:00:24.119> when<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> started<00:00:25.109> shooting<00:00:25.320> online

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
but when I started shooting online

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.419 
but when I started shooting online
videos<00:00:26.369> for<00:00:26.880> some<00:00:27.539> strange<00:00:27.930> reason<00:00:28.369> it<00:00:29.369> never

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
videos for some strange reason it never

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.460 
videos for some strange reason it never
really<00:00:29.849> dawned<00:00:30.179> on<00:00:30.449> me<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.840> record<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.320> audio

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
really dawned on me to record the audio

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.880 
really dawned on me to record the audio
separately<00:00:32.130> I've<00:00:32.550> always<00:00:33.420> just<00:00:33.840> used<00:00:34.530> the
