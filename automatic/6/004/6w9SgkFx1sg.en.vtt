 And then everyone, it 's a paladin. 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.850
 and game chosen for brand analysis to 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.990
 Today's time is the toy story racer of 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.910
 playstation 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.250
 of course everybody knows the toy movie 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.380
 story if you do not know at least you know that 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.119
 It's all about knowing if someone is not 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.099
 interests in more geared to the movies 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.960
 children so I'm going to give a 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.730
 big sums up here toy story is the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.860
 first film released by the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.630
 pixel in 1995 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.160
 a curiosity for you is that this 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.960
 movie is the first movie in history 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.840
 totally made by computer graphics 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.940
 and another thing the pizza was created by 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.739
 great steve jobs creator of apple 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.660
 he eventually bought one of the studios of 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.460
 lucasfilm's Computing 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.829
 For those who do not know, it's nothing less. 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.620
 who created star wars has partnered 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.660
 with disney released toy story lion king 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.449
 among other films with tactical film 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.010
 the film grossed more than 358 million 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.210
 dollars worldwide 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.840
 remembering that he received two more 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.610
 continued by story 2 in 1999 and toy 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.409
 story 3 in 2010 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.850
 with such fame would be almost 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.549
 impossible to receive a game to 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.110
 Videogame is serious and good talk. 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.270
 the main characters of the film are 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.220
 sick toys that of course stand out 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.430
 Woody the cowboy and space ranger 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.049
 buzz there and now enough of coaxing 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.610
 lets go to what matters 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.799
 toy store kings is a running game 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.360
 developed the plot and mainstay 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.579
 published by activision for 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.530
 playstation in 2015 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.750
 The game is entirely based on the first 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.180
 so much that characters and scenarios 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.670
 of toy story 2 that do not appear in the game 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.560
 good are 12 characters played and each one 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.810
 has your car with design related to 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.670
 character for example a buzu car 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.360
 and the traditional spacecraft that appears 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.430
 in the movie 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.560
 are twelve characters in all over 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.560
 early can only choose from four 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.390
 today the bank believes that that cart 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.340
 remote control and fir 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.320
 the other eight will be unlocked from 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.000
 according to the passing of the game will be made 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.590
 themselves for this, which in most cases 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 sometimes involves a race against a 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.670
 mount from the one you will unlock 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.840
 for example to unlock the rex you 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.660
 runs against many 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.970
 other rex on the track understood only to 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.650
 The other eight characters are 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.319
 rex little pig 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.519
 helsinque sir potato head beyond 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.920
 of rock 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.840
 the eye is alive and a crying baby every 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.780
 character has a different number of 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.910
 phase totaling 200 in practice is easy 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.769
 understanding and explaining is complicated but 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.799
 Come on, it works like this. 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.780
 200 boxes really fit the 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.510
 all divided for the 12 characters 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.940
 each box can have a single run or 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.700
 can be a championship with up to 12 or 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.760
 Sometimes it will only be a race to 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.569
 you advance in the game won soft beauty 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.130
 cool 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.500
 sometimes you need to win a 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.110
 All championship to pass only one box 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.329
 It's confusing, but playing is easier. 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.489
 understand the system is already in recess and 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.959
 do not own your battle fashion battle 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.299
 also that the focus is to hit 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.950
 opponents will explain first all 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.720
 the types of failures that exist 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.610
 Then I'll tell you everything you can if 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.530
 find the boxes to hit the 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.989
 other runners yes well in style 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.060
 mario kart but let's all agree 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.950
 children's racing games are this and that 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.319
 is already standard in this style, nor am I 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.910
 I like very good 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.459
 invest in the circuit with a number 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.410
 determined back there are things by time 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.170
 there are things that the last one deleted every 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.359
 back until you're gone or at least 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.069
 case are sobral first place to race 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.139
 that you can take some of your 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.060
 opponents to eliminate them and there 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.130
 things you have to eliminate all 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.900
 the opponents to win the mold 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.000
 that usually puts you in a 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.980
 environment for this or play 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.599
 all in a relatively large phase 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.579
 for you really tired of staying 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.919
 running after the opponents was 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.900
 filling the bag to and sometimes also 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.340
 more boring phases in my opinion than 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.459
 It's the photos you have to hit. 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.220
 five dollars lost on the stage or picking up 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.139
 five penguins there also lost in the 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.780
 just give yourself some time for this picture 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.609
 whenever you win by 15 seconds know 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.859
 or so it was with me when I 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.200
 I closed the items inside boxes 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.630
 colored that can be yellow roses 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.430
 red and blue on yellow you 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.380
 find a colored ball that you can 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.030
 look back and a bulletin that 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.680
 you can look forward 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.260
 in the spare you find a pawn that is 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.580
 running back and the sheep of bet that 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.590
 You leave and they stay. 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.780
 for opponents to hit and 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.759
 would run in the streets you find a 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.840
 rocket and directed forward 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.699
 reminding you that you have to watch 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.830
 because it goes totally 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.870
 straight line and also the disc 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.580
 Flying will be directed to where you 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.830
 a closer opponent being in his 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.719
 front and back and red is where 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.270
 you find the coolest items 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:47.219
 the turbo and a kind of shock that 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.599
 get close to someone you can take the 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:50.939
 opponent will run on the track 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:53.159
 completing the game by moving forward 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:54.800
 the 200 phases your reward will be a 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:58.020
 puzzle for each character 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.759
 simple only that even the other thing 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.219
 I forgot to talk, it closes the game. 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.080
 in about ten hours or less 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:07.110
 to close the game here toy story kings 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.479
 receives the note 8.2 on the site of hygiene 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.460
 You have to say something else, do not 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.650
 game really very good scenarios are 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.419
 vehicles detail the gameplay is very 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.879
 good and fun guaranteed 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.129
 and do you like racing games or the 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:22.349
 less does not like toy story if the game is 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.020
 highly recommended to you 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:26.610
 Good, this is what I hope you liked. 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.169
 avareense can be like her 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.270
 I liked the favorite to help in 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.560
 and sign up for the talk channel 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.719
 about old games
