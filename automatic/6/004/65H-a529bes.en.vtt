00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.569
 the person connect here in the global world 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.360
 games is that I fell one and be well 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.940
 come to another gamer guide and already made a 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.769
 list with the top ten fps games 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.120
 remembering that this bin certainly 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.039
 will have someone who will not agree to 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.080
 some sort so I guess 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.660
 Please make your list and 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:30.660
 puts in the video comments now 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:32.309
 stop in relation to the ball starting at 10 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.079
 place could not stay with nothing else 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.090
 less than sun 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.160
 this was certainly one of the first 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.280
 fps games I already played 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.620
 it was released in 1993 but I started to 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.629
 play serious even when you were 17 or 18 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.239
 years of age and above all in 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.190
 my uncle's computer the goal of the game 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.809
 was very simple at each stage 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.120
 you had to survive a lot of 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.280
 monsters to find an exit and 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.190
 so take to the next level 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.500
 four years later in 2005, 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.040
 released the movie with rock that comes 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.200
 which corroborates this very large the 9th 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.090
 place will stay with the series that zone 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.640
 not want to talk about a specific game 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.140
 itself because everyone in the series is good with 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.820
 exception of the 83 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.439
 so I got to play a little like this 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.150
 get my opinion on it but 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.770
 now that the eyes deserve to be with 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.830
 our ninth place for having attracted a 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.830
 legion of fans until today this is fact everything 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.000
 began in 2004 the first game of the series 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.880
 was still being released 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.979
 exclusively for play 2, which the 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.200
 men were fao this new one he used in 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.689
 now and has already been announced and probably 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.329
 will get to ps4 at the end of the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.950
 Now it 's just the game, it's very cool. 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.630
 even that I'll leave a link in the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.810
 description of the video for you to 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.369
 given in the new game beauty I doubt 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.439
 that there is someone who does not know this 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.240
 cover this game here to face if you 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.939
 talking you do not know then it's two 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.610
 things or you did not have childhood or not 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.250
 had a play 2 black for me was one of the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.540
 Most Played FPS Games 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.219
 2 staff 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.380
 game graphic was extremely 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.630
 fantastic and gameplay was 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.759
 completely innovative for the season with 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.679
 destructible weapons 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.190
 detailed and everything else 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.980
 the game was released in 2006 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.750
 playstation 2 and also for xbox only 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.300
 which unfortunately had only eight 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.500
 missions what to do of the game short but 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.970
 exciting 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.100
 the only thing that left me screaming 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.320
 even in the game is when you took the 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.750
 enemy does not get blood and if a spark 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.020
 white pretty weird here give a duel 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.180
 of the absurd and best phone house in sanaa 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.250
 is another remarkable game for playstation 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.900
 2 people I have to admit that this 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.870
 was one of the first games of the franchise 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.120
 that I played I was very addicted to it 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.660
 I played day and night like this without 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.400
 stop 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.350
 the campaign mode and also the spirit 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.610
 screen with my friends for whom still 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.280
 do not know the game when making a summary 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.320
 here the story of the game is based on the 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.540
 Japanese attack that base of the states 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.530
 united to hawaii called hoppy tail 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.240
 ready just this and now for a change 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.530
 little style for you guys will think 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.510
 I'm only doing games 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.730
 involving war now then speak of 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.650
 zombies that ranked sixth on our list 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.930
 will keep one of the best games of 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.180
 zombies that already existed that same I will 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.190
 speak that the left for that 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.430
 The goal of the game is simple are four 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.220
 survivors called the French bill and bill 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.410
 and also the luiz that in each level must 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.600
 to fight with several bis to achieve 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.489
 to see a kind of shelter where 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.739
 have several weapons and also several 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.630
 light supplies is not going to faint 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.420
 in the system of combating 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.459
 zombies who played already know is fun 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.430
 guaranteed playing with friends because it is 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.739
 much blood a lot of punches many weapons 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.330
 and also many a video and a fifth 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.959
 place is staying with which two 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.610
 folks 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.130
 we have to admit that crytek did 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.650
 an excellent job in this game both 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.350
 in graphics or gameplay the game 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.540
 around the moving alcatraz character 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.750
 a super technological type of armor 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.370
 called nano sui na 8 where the 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.500
 The objective of the game is to fight against 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.410
 aliens to try to save what they 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.080
 rest of the planet 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.730
 the staff being to this day my pocket 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.660
 money I spent on my pc to be able to 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.610
 run this game 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.580
 I was a bit hard but in the end it compensated 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.290
 Holy shit, almost 2 is a throw. 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.390
 the fourth place will be with a game 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.760
 very crazy that surprised everyone 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.370
 That's right, now that you're talking about far cry 3 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.900
 if you like a good fps yet added 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.000
 with the freedom to go to 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.060
 where you want to kill anyone you want and 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.500
 still able to hunt far cry 3 for sure 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.510
 the right choice 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.820
 The second game in the series was phenomenal. 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.980
 but that one shot up front so it was 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.280
 with the 3 got well deserved the room 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.830
 place on our list to admit that the 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.200
 Black ops 2 style is to impress 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.450
 in the game everything is very frantic is everything 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.130
 very fast and practical for here is thing 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.740
 crazy for sure when it comes 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.050
 conquering more and more people and being 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.270
 so one of the games that sells the most and 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.610
 thanks to great graphics great 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.620
 gameplay and everything else almost black ops 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.190
 2 was in third place in our 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.190
 list 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.050
 Dude, I 'm not going to explain why 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.850
 3d movies is second in our 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.650
 list ok 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.200
 at the top of our list 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.050
 will get so loved and so addictive 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.640
 counter strike 1.6 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.740
 who throws the first stone who never 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.480
 get some change from parents so that 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.570
 make a stranger at lan house with the 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.850
 friends, man this happened too much with me 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.280
 The game has become a fever here in Brazil. 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.890
 after 2001 a year after the game 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.630
 was launched and it was almost mandatory that 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.170
 in any lan house you were 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.840
 had to have cs 1.6 if it had not 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.800
 You were not even good times here. 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.540
 very good 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.660
 and to close with the golden key to you 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.810
 notion against strike 1.6 was one of the 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.520
 best selling games to date was 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.630
 the staff was the video of the week and 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.180
