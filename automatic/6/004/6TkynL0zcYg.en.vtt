water<00:06:16.210> then<00:06:17.210> the<00:06:17.360> only<00:06:17.630> way<00:06:17.750> to<00:06:17.810> get<00:06:18.050> that<00:06:18.200> tag

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
water then the only way to get that tag

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.240 
water then the only way to get that tag
would<00:06:18.740> be<00:06:18.860> to<00:06:19.010> make<00:06:19.220> it<00:06:19.250> splash<00:06:21.100> make<00:06:22.100> it

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
would be to make it splash make it

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.340 
would be to make it splash make it
literally<00:06:22.730> splash<00:06:23.030> oh<00:06:23.450> look<00:06:23.930> it's<00:06:24.080> the<00:06:24.140> only

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.350 
literally splash oh look it's the only

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.180 
literally splash oh look it's the only
reason<00:06:24.560> we<00:06:24.710> play<00:06:24.890> want<00:06:25.190> to<00:06:25.280> be<00:06:26.830> but<00:06:27.830> I<00:06:28.010> would

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
reason we play want to be but I would

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.000 
reason we play want to be but I would
only<00:06:28.220> make<00:06:28.790> it<00:06:28.820> splash<00:06:29.330> if<00:06:29.780> I<00:06:30.110> already<00:06:30.350> had<00:06:30.710> all

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.010 
only make it splash if I already had all

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.850 
only make it splash if I already had all
my<00:06:31.460> kill<00:06:31.729> stress<00:06:32.120> because<00:06:33.020> I'm<00:06:33.140> not<00:06:33.470> gonna<00:06:33.620> die

my kill stress because I'm not gonna die
just<00:06:33.890> but<00:06:34.310> I'll<00:06:34.430> look<00:06:34.700> at<00:06:34.820> that<00:06:34.850> pre<00:06:35.330> fire

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
just but I'll look at that pre fire

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.750 
just but I'll look at that pre fire
that<00:06:37.190> pre-fire<00:06:37.760> is<00:06:38.030> sexy<00:06:39.460> let's<00:06:40.460> see<00:06:40.580> if<00:06:40.670> I

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.860 
that pre-fire is sexy let's see if I
could<00:06:40.910> do<00:06:41.000> a<00:06:41.030> little<00:06:41.210> better<00:06:41.450> with<00:06:41.720> this

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
could do a little better with this

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.780 
could do a little better with this
lodestar<00:06:43.780> finally<00:06:44.780> getting<00:06:45.050> some<00:06:45.260> kills<00:06:45.790> and

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.430 
they said they nerf the SMGs I don't see
a<00:07:02.030> difference<00:07:02.770> it<00:07:03.770> seems<00:07:04.040> the<00:07:04.280> same<00:07:04.490> to<00:07:04.550> me<00:07:04.940> I

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 
a difference it seems the same to me I

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.900 
a difference it seems the same to me I
don't<00:07:06.440> know<00:07:06.530> if<00:07:06.620> they<00:07:06.740> were<00:07:06.800> lying<00:07:07.220> I<00:07:07.730> mean<00:07:07.880> I

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:07.910 
don't know if they were lying I mean I

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.620 
don't know if they were lying I mean I
don't<00:07:08.180> know<00:07:08.570> it<00:07:08.780> seems<00:07:09.260> the<00:07:09.560> same<00:07:10.510> maybe<00:07:11.510> I

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.630 
don't know it seems the same maybe I

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.300 
don't know it seems the same maybe I
just<00:07:11.960> need<00:07:12.200> to<00:07:12.230> give<00:07:12.470> it<00:07:12.590> some<00:07:12.620> time

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.310 
just need to give it some time

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.810 
just need to give it some time
play<00:07:13.550> a<00:07:13.580> little<00:07:13.820> more

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:17.820 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.360 

what<00:07:18.810> we<00:07:18.990> really<00:07:19.380> want<00:07:19.590> to<00:07:19.650> see<00:07:19.860> in<00:07:19.980> the<00:07:20.070> patch

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370 
what we really want to see in the patch

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.950 
what we really want to see in the patch
notes<00:07:20.760> is<00:07:21.419> the<00:07:21.840> lag<00:07:22.200> being<00:07:22.800> addressed<00:07:23.220> and

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 
notes is the lag being addressed and

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.240 
notes is the lag being addressed and
that's<00:07:24.960> why<00:07:25.200> I<00:07:25.230> started<00:07:25.800> using<00:07:25.980> that

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.250 
that's why I started using that

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.000 
that's why I started using that
toughness<00:07:26.580> perk<00:07:27.060> cuz<00:07:27.840> it<00:07:28.110> seems<00:07:28.320> like<00:07:28.650> if<00:07:28.860> you

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.010 
toughness perk cuz it seems like if you

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.629 
toughness perk cuz it seems like if you
use<00:07:29.250> toughness<00:07:30.860> combined<00:07:31.860> with<00:07:32.190> the<00:07:32.340> lag

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 
use toughness combined with the lag

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:34.970 
use toughness combined with the lag
problems<00:07:33.330> hit<00:07:33.810> detection<00:07:34.110> whatever<00:07:34.620> it<00:07:34.830> is

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:34.980 
problems hit detection whatever it is

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.900 
problems hit detection whatever it is
it's<00:07:35.910> just<00:07:36.060> so<00:07:36.419> hard<00:07:36.840> to<00:07:36.900> kill<00:07:37.260> you<00:07:37.500> and<00:07:37.910> mostly

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:38.910 
it's just so hard to kill you and mostly

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.310 
it's just so hard to kill you and mostly
everybody<00:07:39.180> that<00:07:39.540> I've<00:07:39.690> been<00:07:39.810> playing<00:07:39.990> they

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:40.320 
everybody that I've been playing they

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.240 
everybody that I've been playing they
use<00:07:40.590> it<00:07:40.800> too

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:41.250 
use it too

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.430 
use it too
so<00:07:41.550> if<00:07:41.669> I'm<00:07:41.850> shooting<00:07:42.090> them<00:07:42.480> and<00:07:42.750> they<00:07:43.260> have

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 
so if I'm shooting them and they have

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.710 
so if I'm shooting them and they have
toughness<00:07:43.919> and<00:07:44.100> I<00:07:44.190> don't<00:07:44.550> you<00:07:45.240> know<00:07:45.300> it's<00:07:45.480> like

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 
toughness and I don't you know it's like

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.470 
toughness and I don't you know it's like
I<00:07:46.070> can't<00:07:47.070> beat<00:07:47.250> the<00:07:47.400> lag<00:07:47.610> no<00:07:47.850> matter<00:07:48.030> what<00:07:48.270> but

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:48.480 
I can't beat the lag no matter what but

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.750 
I can't beat the lag no matter what but
now<00:07:48.630> that<00:07:48.810> I<00:07:48.900> have<00:07:49.050> it<00:07:49.229> on<00:07:49.320> -<00:07:49.620> now<00:07:50.040> it's<00:07:50.280> equal

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:50.760 
now that I have it on - now it's equal

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.460 
now that I have it on - now it's equal
and<00:07:50.970> then<00:07:51.389> it<00:07:51.600> doesn't<00:07:51.900> give<00:07:52.169> them<00:07:52.320> that

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:52.470 
and then it doesn't give them that

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.409 
and then it doesn't give them that
advantage<00:07:52.979> I<00:07:53.100> don't<00:07:53.340> know<00:07:53.430> maybe<00:07:53.880> it's<00:07:54.120> all<00:07:54.270> in

00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:54.419 
advantage I don't know maybe it's all in

00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:55.010 
advantage I don't know maybe it's all in
my<00:07:54.510> head

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:55.020 
my head

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.730 
my head
I<00:07:55.050> don't<00:07:55.680> know<00:07:55.860> but<00:07:56.690> by<00:07:57.690> using<00:07:57.960> toughness<00:07:58.590> I

00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:58.740 
I don't know but by using toughness I

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.080 
I don't know but by using toughness I
feel<00:07:59.070> like<00:07:59.280> I<00:07:59.430> do<00:07:59.490> so<00:08:00.120> much<00:08:00.330> better<00:08:00.570> out<00:08:00.660> there

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:02.090 
feel like I do so much better out there
