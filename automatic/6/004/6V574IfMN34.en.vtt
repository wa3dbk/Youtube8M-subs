 of baroque mines due to the 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.350
 peak of its gold mines but fell in the 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.829
 forgetfulness when the Portuguese 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.569
 have taken away this story again 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.459
 to take in our riches though 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.280

 legal not in history while the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.569
 history of courage to kill in portugal 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.850
 increased back day by day and the people 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.920

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.970
 have decided to create a 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:50.910

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:03.660
 mining disloyalty remained only in ideal 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.849
 1789 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.700
 the inconfidents were betrayed by the 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.799
 colonel joaquim silvério dos reis 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.540
 he counted a plan of liberation to the 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.209
 viscount of barbacena 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.650
 but in return that he made it the pension 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.989
 for life's rest 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.139
 forgiveness of their many debts and 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.919
 medal or viscount of barbacena 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.200
 immediately had the 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:27.349
 inconfident 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.400
 punishments and where confiscation of property to 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:33.200
 death penalty but the tiradentes 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.840
 he assumed responsibility for the 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.959
 conspiracy and ended up being hanged 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.739
 Do you know which of sad stories but? 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.930
 one minute 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.630

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.480

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:17.350
 the staff that the restaurant miner gold 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:20.560

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.050

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.600
 I can eat but there will not be any more 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.790
 space for the time that food arrives 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.630
 and has space when the business is 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.790
 food 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.970

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.260

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.190
 You're talking too much and asking.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.180

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.680
 Difficult to food here saw you could 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.750

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.820
 hunger and waiter 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.730
 You could bring the little chicken and a 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.160

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:46.440
 the sculptor italy the pain and architect 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.990
 miner of the baroque art crippled was 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.430
 a genius bug these sculptures are 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.680
 really awesome 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.960
 What else do you know about him being a son? 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.150
 of a slave with the master of works 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.210
 Portuguese began his artistic life 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.240
 still a child watching his father 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.580

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.810
 of the Brazilian Baroque is 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.420
 impressive 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.690
 He must have gotten very rich and nothing. 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:18.300

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:25.440
 many years after his death this 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.170
 seems to be a rule of the artists who 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.190
 I'll just find out what comes after 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.470
 my death 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:35.460
 Stay calm, you do not take this risk. 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:37.610
 that is to say that you already value me to this 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:42.240
 moment asks for a show of affection 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:44.750
