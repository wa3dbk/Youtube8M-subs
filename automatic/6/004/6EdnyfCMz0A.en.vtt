00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.109
 now 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.460
 hello guys and girls the other 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.860
 dimension we are in micro and others we 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.860
 I'm going to show you how I do the move 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.649
 I call it great to remove the house the court does not 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.470
 teach him that I'm going to make him a bot that 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.520
 is called 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.470
 minimum called boxing map that is for 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.410
 1.72 and it works comfort this was done 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.780
 we go to the way like the previous video does not 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.890
 had said that map is not today my mom 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.810
 the difference is quite large but 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.340
 let's put the menus that are 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.040
 press with m 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.380
 here we have for example the coordinates 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:01.170
 we can do this remove this and so on 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.170
 hide what location we want 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.640
 if we want a bigger or smaller one 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:12.000
 to regulate map type 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.900
 if it shows the coordinates as form 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.130
 old or modern way I do not know very well 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.450
 this part of the waypoints 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.880
 one of the parties in a very much 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.250
 but good 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.799
 here is like a kind of radar if 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.490
 works the radius of the caves now it 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.909
 I will teach 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.500
 to another performance detail that is 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.259
 performance we can remove lights 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.100
 dynamics in terrain effect 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.730
 Transparency of water etc etc 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.800
 here we have for example the radar 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.890
 when dealing with the dragon of dragon 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:53.030
 here we can see hostile shows that is 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.650
 hostile enemies that show them we're going 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.950
 after players and we are a part 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.540
 multiplayer also show their heads 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.530
 only 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.240
 filters of icons I am in multiplayer 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.890
 in this part of players and is that is 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.960
 playing with another person or they die with 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.330
 multiplayer see them showing 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.020
 of the characters of central things by 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.020
 example here you see 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:25.550
 other players names players 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.400
 but offline and other display in 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.990
 controls we have the controls that 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.910
 we have basic m / m 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.580
 z the zoom 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.380
 this sector that is by default is 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.270
 can you put this part I have not seen it 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:44.950
 a lot of body like in the race kill me and 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:48.430
 this is to see the fÃ¼hrer on screen 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.430
 what we have 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.740
 in this I'm fine the screen goes up 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.740
 right zooming 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.340
 is very good 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:06.100
 here we have the time it is to put a 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:08.620
 point let's put one loose 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.290
 we can select the color this palette 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.200
 of colors will appear I find very very 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.160
 good better 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.670
 and it appears is holographic type it does not show 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.050
 much 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.260
 I'm going to put it at night so I can see it in 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.260
 something 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.900
 it does not look like a peak 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.129
 but not an old pig a candle 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.140
 great this has like a distance of 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.260
 100 songs so they should be married from 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.830
 so far away 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.930
 if we have here you also have to read 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.260
 we should see some visibility in this 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.260
 world 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.830
 if we want to see the map fully all 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.010
 the other maps will only be touching 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.270
 with x this map appears even us 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.130
 we realize what direction we are 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.630
 taking expose we are here of 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.630
 suddenly we are going to do this for example 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.750
 it does not correspond to you if you realize 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.410
 appeared a never again kit 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.660
 educational 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.760
 a skull appears 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:22.200
 and this skull that points where we are 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.200
 In rooms 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.710
 this little figure appears in america 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.419
 removing with all my limits 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.100
 and a beam of light appears 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:43.009
 If you do not want to erase this just simply go 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:48.740
 with the m key go to wellpoint touch the 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:51.169
 button that claimed to play where we say the 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.520
 play point where you died you can 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.660
 edit they change the color 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.660
 let's say I want a 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.729
 from the heart 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.350
 and it 's good I do not know if we suddenly want 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.700
 erase what we say we want to erase or 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:15.520
 here we go so distance to see or 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.060
 erase it or have it transport us where 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.060
 we had fallen 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:27.620
 so bye selector 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:29.160
 or just delete it or we want to create 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.460
 other 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.820
 for the same amount with the bottle a 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.820
 button 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.860
 or 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:50.080
 keyboard sometimes we do not do it for 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:54.879
 example here of victory and is what it was 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:58.810
 is that I moved with the eric ms been 06 but 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:06:00.539
 I did not want to put to see build everything 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.949
 this so 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:06.509
 suppose we go to some caves that 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:06.509
 here I have a cave under the house 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:14.600
 let's enter enter between the entrances 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.600
 see how it starts to appear 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.630
 the cave javier 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.630
 it's very very interesting very good 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:29.009
 we have another type of map that is round 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:32.059
 and now we are going to enter a server 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:32.059
 and one thing 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.849
 as you see this server is seen in the 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:45.520
 beings of the characters on the map 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:48.830
 here we have shooters read and 7 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:52.780
 to see the map also see how they see 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:57.000
 the controls to the downside 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:59.940
 the players give them or put them 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.450
 for your two heads and their names 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.450
 appear 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:10.050
 Well I hope you liked smoke no 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:13.190
 we see another chau chau fish and not 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.190
 let's be tripers
