and I'm going to tell you why but let's

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.959 
and I'm going to tell you why but let's
start<00:00:55.140> at<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.350> beginning<00:00:55.469> what<00:00:56.280> exactly<00:00:56.820> does

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
start at the beginning what exactly does

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.180 
start at the beginning what exactly does
the<00:00:57.120> ECM<00:00:57.539> jammer<00:00:57.570> do<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.320> how<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.160> it

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
the ECM jammer do and how is it

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.490 
the ECM jammer do and how is it
different<00:00:59.430> from<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.910> IR<00:01:00.239> flares<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.260> main

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
different from the IR flares the main

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
purpose of the ECM jammer is to break a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.899 
purpose of the ECM jammer is to break a
lock<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.350> prevent<00:01:04.949> further<00:01:05.189> lock-ons

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
lock on and prevent further lock-ons

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:30.710 
lock on and prevent further lock-ons
while<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.540> active

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.750 

the<00:01:31.720> ECM<00:01:32.140> jammer<00:01:32.230> works<00:01:32.860> on<00:01:33.040> a<00:01:33.070> 10<00:01:33.340> second

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
the ECM jammer works on a 10 second

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.120 
the ECM jammer works on a 10 second
cycle<00:01:34.180> if<00:01:34.450> you<00:01:34.870> deploy<00:01:35.230> it<00:01:35.260> you'll<00:01:35.770> have<00:01:35.980> to

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
cycle if you deploy it you'll have to

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.860 
cycle if you deploy it you'll have to
wait<00:01:36.280> 10<00:01:36.580> seconds<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.180> deploy<00:01:37.480> it<00:01:37.630> again

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
wait 10 seconds to deploy it again

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.260 
wait 10 seconds to deploy it again
during<00:01:38.380> those<00:01:38.680> 10<00:01:38.980> seconds<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.790> ECM<00:01:40.240> jammer

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
during those 10 seconds the ECM jammer

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.960 
during those 10 seconds the ECM jammer
will<00:01:40.780> actively<00:01:41.410> prevent<00:01:41.830> lock-on<00:01:42.340> for<00:01:42.850> the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
will actively prevent lock-on for the

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.910 
will actively prevent lock-on for the
first<00:01:43.210> 5<00:01:43.450> seconds<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.110> leave<00:01:44.710> you<00:01:44.860> vulnerable

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
first 5 seconds and leave you vulnerable

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.450 
first 5 seconds and leave you vulnerable
to<00:01:45.520> lock-on<00:01:46.060> for<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.630> last<00:01:46.840> 5<00:01:47.080> seconds<00:01:47.530> so<00:01:47.770> to

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
to lock-on for the last 5 seconds so to

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.580 
to lock-on for the last 5 seconds so to
sum<00:01:48.670> things<00:01:48.850> up<00:01:49.090> once<00:01:49.630> you<00:01:49.780> pop<00:01:50.020> it<00:01:50.229> it'll

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
sum things up once you pop it it'll

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.290 
sum things up once you pop it it'll
prevent<00:01:50.830> lock-on<00:01:51.250> for<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.490> first<00:01:51.700> 5<00:01:51.850> seconds

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
prevent lock-on for the first 5 seconds

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.240 
prevent lock-on for the first 5 seconds
and<00:01:52.450> then<00:01:52.990> you'll<00:01:53.200> be<00:01:53.229> vulnerable<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.830> lock-on

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
and then you'll be vulnerable to lock-on

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.710 
and then you'll be vulnerable to lock-on
in<00:01:54.370> the<00:01:54.430> last<00:01:54.610> 5<00:01:54.820> seconds<00:01:55.180> while<00:01:55.360> it's<00:01:55.540> still

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
in the last 5 seconds while it's still

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.200 
in the last 5 seconds while it's still
cooling<00:01:56.110> down<00:01:56.290> so<00:01:57.130> for<00:01:57.370> the<00:01:57.460> most<00:01:57.640> part<00:01:57.790> it's

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
cooling down so for the most part it's

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.570 
cooling down so for the most part it's
best<00:01:58.720> to<00:01:58.870> pop<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.380> ECM<00:01:59.770> jammer<00:01:59.800> before<00:02:00.490> the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
best to pop the ECM jammer before the

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.790 
best to pop the ECM jammer before the
enemy<00:02:00.729> fires<00:02:01.120> is<00:02:01.360> missile<00:02:01.780> so<00:02:02.259> when<00:02:02.530> you<00:02:02.619> hear

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
enemy fires is missile so when you hear

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.350 
enemy fires is missile so when you hear
the<00:02:02.890> long<00:02:03.070> beep<00:02:03.340> indicating<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.060> enemy's

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
the long beep indicating the enemy's

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.270 
the long beep indicating the enemy's
completed<00:02:04.930> this<00:02:05.020> lock-on<00:02:05.530> that's<00:02:05.950> when<00:02:06.190> you

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
completed this lock-on that's when you

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.280 
completed this lock-on that's when you
should<00:02:06.460> pop<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.790> ECM<00:02:07.180> jammer<00:02:07.210> or<00:02:07.840> even

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
should pop the ECM jammer or even

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.900 
should pop the ECM jammer or even
slightly<00:02:08.830> before<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.399> if<00:02:09.550> you<00:02:09.640> want<00:02:09.790> to<00:02:09.850> be

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
slightly before that if you want to be

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.240 
slightly before that if you want to be
really<00:02:10.209> cautious<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.350> ECM<00:02:11.800> jammer<00:02:11.830> is

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
really cautious so the ECM jammer is

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.340 
really cautious so the ECM jammer is

there's<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.650> much<00:03:48.890> smaller<00:03:49.250> chance<00:03:49.340> that<00:03:49.790> the

there's a much smaller chance that the

there's a much smaller chance that the

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
oncoming missile would be deterred by

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.620 
oncoming missile would be deterred by
the<00:03:51.799> shaft<00:03:52.130> cloud<00:03:52.340> this<00:03:52.790> is<00:03:53.000> why<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.180> ECM

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
the shaft cloud this is why the ECM

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.720 
the shaft cloud this is why the ECM
jammer<00:03:53.660> is<00:03:54.049> not<00:03:54.290> as<00:03:54.500> reliable<00:03:54.769> at<00:03:55.340> deterring

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
jammer is not as reliable at deterring

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.490 
jammer is not as reliable at deterring
missiles<00:03:56.180> once<00:03:56.480> they've<00:03:56.750> been<00:03:56.870> fired<00:03:57.170> and

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
missiles once they've been fired and

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.920 
missiles once they've been fired and
this<00:03:58.130> is<00:03:58.280> why<00:03:58.430> you<00:03:58.489> can't<00:03:58.970> use<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.450> ECM<00:03:59.900> jammer

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
this is why you can't use the ECM jammer

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.520 
this is why you can't use the ECM jammer
like<00:04:00.530> he<00:04:00.709> would<00:04:00.920> use<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.430> IR<00:04:01.609> flares<00:04:02.200> so<00:04:03.200> it's

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
like he would use the IR flares so it's

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.470 
like he would use the IR flares so it's
best<00:04:03.829> to<00:04:03.920> use<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.280> ECM<00:04:04.640> jammer<00:04:04.670> for<00:04:05.269> its

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
best to use the ECM jammer for its

a lock on the ECM jammer is very
