00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.550 

I<00:03:49.980> think<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.970> flight<00:03:51.240> goes<00:03:51.480> up<00:03:51.720> when<00:03:51.930> vrel

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
I think the flight goes up when vrel

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.360 
I think the flight goes up when vrel
touches<00:03:53.099> the<00:03:53.250> ball

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
touches the ball

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.690 
touches the ball
I'd<00:03:55.730> like<00:03:55.970> to<00:03:56.000> see<00:03:56.269> another<00:03:57.080> closer<00:03:57.409> look<00:03:57.709> look

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
I'd like to see another closer look look

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.160 
I'd like to see another closer look look
like<00:03:58.849> the<00:03:59.000> linesman<00:03:59.450> on<00:03:59.569> that<00:03:59.720> right<00:03:59.989> there

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
like the linesman on that right there

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.910 
like the linesman on that right there
just<00:04:00.200> said<00:04:00.590> that<00:04:00.739> he<00:04:00.890> was<00:04:01.069> on

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
not touch the ball there I think that

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.110 
not touch the ball there I think that

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.960 
on that one via rial did not touch the
ball<00:04:14.730> no<00:04:15.569> zard<00:04:16.200> as<00:04:16.440> artists<00:04:16.950> here<00:04:17.160> but<00:04:17.850> I<00:04:17.880> think

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
ball no zard as artists here but I think

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.729 
ball no zard as artists here but I think
being<00:04:18.329> real<00:04:18.480> was<00:04:18.720> offside<00:04:19.109> not<00:04:19.470> when<00:04:19.650> the

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
being real was offside not when the

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.800 
being real was offside not when the
first<00:04:20.010> ball<00:04:20.250> got<00:04:20.459> it<00:04:20.669> no<00:04:20.970> and<00:04:21.389> I<00:04:21.480> think<00:04:21.690> that

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
first ball got it no and I think that

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.000 
first ball got it no and I think that
that's<00:04:21.840> what<00:04:22.079> the<00:04:22.169> lines<00:04:22.350> was<00:04:22.560> talking<00:04:22.830> about

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
that's what the lines was talking about

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.830 
that's what the lines was talking about
