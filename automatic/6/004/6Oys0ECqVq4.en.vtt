as well as all the road out countless
hours<00:00:32.980> and<00:00:33.220> miles<00:00:33.840> if<00:00:34.840> we're<00:00:35.020> putting<00:00:35.260> in<00:00:35.380> from

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.560 
hours and miles if we're putting in from

now until the race day it's certainly

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.979 
now until the race day it's certainly
worth<00:00:38.559> paying<00:00:38.830> attention<00:00:38.920> to<00:00:39.309> your<00:00:39.489> kit<00:00:39.989> and

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
worth paying attention to your kit and

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.060 
worth paying attention to your kit and
especially<00:00:41.260> q<00:00:41.590> ring<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:43.680> what<00:00:44.680> you<00:00:44.770> might<00:00:44.950> be

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
especially q ring so what you might be

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.530 
especially q ring so what you might be
used<00:00:45.280> to<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:47.350> your<00:00:47.500> user<00:00:47.739> training<00:00:48.190> roads

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
used to on your user training roads

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.590 
used to on your user training roads
maybe<00:00:49.540> it's<00:00:49.720> a<00:00:49.780> standard<00:00:50.140> set<00:00:50.320> it<00:00:50.470> up<00:00:51.150> 3953<00:00:52.150> at

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
maybe it's a standard set it up 3953 at

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.729 
maybe it's a standard set it up 3953 at
the<00:00:52.690> front<00:00:53.280> maybe<00:00:54.280> 12<00:00:54.640> 23<00:00:55.030> at<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.269> back<00:00:55.739> you

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
the front maybe 12 23 at the back you

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.430 
the front maybe 12 23 at the back you
probably<00:00:56.920> do<00:00:57.100> yourself<00:00:57.400> a<00:00:57.430> lot<00:00:57.550> of<00:00:57.580> favors<00:00:58.000> by

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
probably do yourself a lot of favors by

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.709 
probably do yourself a lot of favors by
having<00:00:59.440> a<00:00:59.500> look<00:00:59.650> at<00:00:59.769> that<00:01:00.239> when<00:01:01.239> you're<00:01:01.450> when

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
having a look at that when you're when

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.700 
having a look at that when you're when
you<00:01:01.809> take<00:01:01.989> on<00:01:02.110> the<00:01:02.200> mountains<00:01:02.879> maybe<00:01:04.710> consider

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
you take on the mountains maybe consider

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.290 
you take on the mountains maybe consider
stripping<00:01:05.920> that<00:01:06.100> down<00:01:06.430> to<00:01:06.640> a<00:01:06.670> slightly<00:01:07.090> lower

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
stripping that down to a slightly lower

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.190 
stripping that down to a slightly lower
ratio<00:01:08.220> compaq<00:01:09.220> hearing<00:01:09.899> it's<00:01:10.899> quite<00:01:11.140> a

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
ratio compaq hearing it's quite a

ratio compaq hearing it's quite a
standard<00:01:11.920> now<00:01:12.070> so<00:01:12.399> a<00:01:12.869> lot<00:01:13.869> of<00:01:13.899> options<00:01:14.229> out

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
standard now so a lot of options out

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.630 
standard now so a lot of options out
there<00:01:14.910> may<00:01:15.910> be<00:01:15.940> a<00:01:16.090> 34<00:01:16.630> small<00:01:16.930> chain<00:01:17.170> ring<00:01:17.399> 30<00:01:18.399> 40

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
there may be a 34 small chain ring 30 40

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.749 
there may be a 34 small chain ring 30 40
40<00:01:18.940> 36<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.619> on<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.800> back<00:01:20.979> you<00:01:21.009> can<00:01:21.130> go<00:01:21.630> 25<00:01:22.630> 27

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
40 36 and on the back you can go 25 27

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.010 
40 36 and on the back you can go 25 27
even<00:01:24.759> stepping<00:01:24.970> up<00:01:25.119> to<00:01:25.270> 29<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:27.490> to<00:01:27.580> meet<00:01:28.020> meet

the<00:01:29.110> day<00:01:29.550> not<00:01:30.550> only<00:01:30.580> more<00:01:30.940> enjoyable<00:01:31.210> but

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the day not only more enjoyable but

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.040 
the day not only more enjoyable but
overall<00:01:32.920> I<00:01:32.979> think<00:01:33.160> the<00:01:33.750> result<00:01:34.750> you<00:01:34.840> will<00:01:34.899> have
