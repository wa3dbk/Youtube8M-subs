the draft coil in the cooler and I tell

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.000 
the draft coil in the cooler and I tell
you<00:03:26.579> what<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.629> was<00:03:28.170> having<00:03:28.439> a<00:03:28.530> little<00:03:28.650> bit<00:03:28.890> of

you what I I was having a little bit of

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.670 
you what I I was having a little bit of
difficulty<00:03:29.459> getting<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:30.629> draft<00:03:31.019> coil<00:03:31.409> in

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
difficulty getting this draft coil in

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.190 
difficulty getting this draft coil in
and<00:03:32.010> realized<00:03:32.640> that<00:03:32.849> I<00:03:32.879> needed<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.329> remove<00:03:33.659> the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
and realized that I needed to remove the

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.899 
and realized that I needed to remove the
one<00:03:34.439> compressor<00:03:35.069> fitting<00:03:35.430> I<00:03:35.549> was<00:03:35.670> kind<00:03:35.849> of

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
one compressor fitting I was kind of

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.580 
one compressor fitting I was kind of
getting<00:03:36.180> in<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.329> way<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:36.629> I<00:03:36.900> unscrewed<00:03:37.560> that

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
getting in the way so I unscrewed that

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.619 
getting in the way so I unscrewed that
that<00:03:38.370> gave<00:03:38.579> me<00:03:38.700> plenty<00:03:38.909> of<00:03:39.030> room<00:03:39.299> for<00:03:39.329> the

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
that gave me plenty of room for the

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.270 
that gave me plenty of room for the
draft<00:03:39.930> coil<00:03:40.230> which<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.590> pushed<00:03:40.859> to<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.129> bottom

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
draft coil which I pushed to the bottom

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.399 
draft coil which I pushed to the bottom
of<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.609> cooler<00:03:41.819> and<00:03:42.150> then<00:03:42.599> reattach<00:03:42.930> the

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
of the cooler and then reattach the

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.409 
of the cooler and then reattach the
compressor<00:03:43.889> fitting<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.370> our<00:03:44.939> final<00:03:45.269> two

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
compressor fitting and our final two

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.270 
compressor fitting and our final two
connections<00:03:45.930> are<00:03:46.139> the<00:03:46.500> two<00:03:46.769> couplers<00:03:47.250> that

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
connections are the two couplers that

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.879 
connections are the two couplers that
get<00:03:47.819> plugged<00:03:48.120> into<00:03:48.450> both<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:49.139> our<00:03:49.349> compressor

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
get plugged into both of our compressor

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.800 
get plugged into both of our compressor
fittings<00:03:50.250> as<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:51.000> can<00:03:51.150> see<00:03:51.329> it's<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.569> pretty

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
fittings as you can see it's a pretty

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.589 
fittings as you can see it's a pretty
compact<00:03:52.409> and<00:03:52.680> neat<00:03:53.099> design<00:03:53.579> so<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.150> last<00:03:54.329> step

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
compact and neat design so the last step

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.589 
compact and neat design so the last step
of<00:03:54.810> course<00:03:55.079> is<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.709> add<00:03:55.980> ice<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:57.120> convertible

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
of course is to add ice the convertible

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.509 
of course is to add ice the convertible
jockey<00:03:58.019> box<00:03:58.169> is<00:03:58.409> pretty<00:03:58.709> much<00:03:58.919> finished<00:03:59.159> the

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
jockey box is pretty much finished the

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.399 
jockey box is pretty much finished the
last<00:03:59.760> step<00:04:00.060> would<00:04:00.269> be<00:04:00.329> to<00:04:00.480> get<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:00.810> coupler<00:04:01.379> that

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
last step would be to get a coupler that

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.250 
last step would be to get a coupler that
fits<00:04:01.919> either<00:04:02.159> your<00:04:02.609> homebrew<00:04:03.510> keg<00:04:03.900> or<00:04:04.169> a

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
fits either your homebrew keg or a

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.319 
fits either your homebrew keg or a
commercial<00:04:04.680> keg<00:04:05.129> and<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.730> will<00:04:05.849> go<00:04:06.030> on<00:04:06.239> the

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
commercial keg and that will go on the

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.319 
commercial keg and that will go on the
beer<00:04:07.109> inline<00:04:07.799> which<00:04:08.189> is<00:04:08.370> this<00:04:08.609> one<00:04:08.879> now<00:04:09.090> you

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
beer inline which is this one now you

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.309 
beer inline which is this one now you
might<00:04:09.450> be<00:04:09.480> wondering<00:04:09.750> why<00:04:09.959> it's<00:04:10.109> called<00:04:10.230> a

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
might be wondering why it's called a

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.170 
might be wondering why it's called a
convertible<00:04:10.709> jockey<00:04:11.189> box<00:04:11.459> well<00:04:11.879> there's<00:04:12.120> a

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
convertible jockey box well there's a

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.099 
convertible jockey box well there's a
good<00:04:12.269> reason<00:04:12.329> for<00:04:12.629> that

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
good reason for that

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.080 
good reason for that
now<00:04:13.319> those<00:04:13.470> compressor<00:04:14.430> fittings<00:04:14.790> that<00:04:15.000> we

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
now those compressor fittings that we

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.509 
now those compressor fittings that we
put<00:04:15.359> in<00:04:15.510> here<00:04:15.540> will<00:04:15.840> those<00:04:16.169> allow<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:16.709> to<00:04:17.099> pop

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
put in here will those allow you to pop

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.210 
put in here will those allow you to pop
them<00:04:17.760> off<00:04:17.909> remove<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.840> draft<00:04:19.199> coil<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:19.919> then

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
them off remove the draft coil and then

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.039 
them off remove the draft coil and then
you<00:04:20.310> could<00:04:20.489> put<00:04:20.639> a<00:04:20.699> mini<00:04:21.000> keg<00:04:21.329> inside<00:04:21.780> and

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
you could put a mini keg inside and

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.320 
you could put a mini keg inside and
attach<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.560> mini<00:04:22.800> keg<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.340> your<00:04:23.460> lines<00:04:23.699> add

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330

attach the mini keg to your lines add
some<00:04:24.659> ice<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.229> your<00:04:25.740> mini<00:04:25.979> keg<00:04:26.280> will<00:04:26.580> stay

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
some ice and your mini keg will stay

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.680 
some ice and your mini keg will stay
cold<00:04:27.630> for<00:04:28.110> hours<00:04:28.289> and<00:04:28.919> you<00:04:29.460> can<00:04:29.580> also<00:04:29.760> dispense

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
cold for hours and you can also dispense
