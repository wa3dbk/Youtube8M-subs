 in a spot of the stain 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.330
 and whose name I do not want to remember 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.000
 there is not much time that a gentleman lived 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.780
 of the spear in Adarga shipyard 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.780
 ancient 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.720
 and that it was over forty-one 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.720
 niece 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.650
 but the times I was idle was given 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.470
 to read books of chivalry with so much 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:23.680
 hobby that forgot the exercise of 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.680
 hunting filling your entire house with books 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.250
 where 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.250
 very very 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.490
 justly 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.409
 he kept awake to understand these reasons 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.679
 and unravel them the meaning 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.749
 he got so caught up in the reading that he 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.749
 they spent the nights reading of course 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.899
 the fantasy of all that was filled 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.899
 I read in theaters 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.069
 unnecessary slope 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.329
 so for the mentado or honor 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.329
 as for the service then 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.900
 My sentences 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.770
 exercise 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.870
 besides my verses 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:24.220
 rusty and full of mont so many 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.220
 sacred and distant centuries 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.820
 I follow that which has to be but work of 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.820
 your uncle who is lately excited 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.340
 hunting ghosts because of those 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.150
 books of chivalry want god that is 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.150
 I passed his nose 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.590
 note 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.110
 what 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:42.680
 but as famous as me 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:49.279
 not have known names from 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:52.020
 now it will be called cooking because it is a 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:54.350
 tall and lonely man 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.610
 kitchen 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.170
 also me alonso quijano the good can 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.390
 adopt a name that matches the 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:07.070
 exercise of chivalry while 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:09.230
 I'm going to hug and that's what you call me 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.140
 Don Quixote 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:15.520
 the courageous amadis added to his name the 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:20.110
 from his land calling himself amadÃ­s de gaula 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.110
 I would add my name to mine 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.640
 son of the stain 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.569
 but look for a branch of who fall in love 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.960
 in a place near his 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.710

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:52.650
 ok give her the title of lady of her 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:56.630
 thoughts calling her children 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.630
 the toboso because it was natural
