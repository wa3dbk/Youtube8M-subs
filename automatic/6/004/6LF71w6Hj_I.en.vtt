00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.320
 What's up kids today we bring you rena 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.480
 no twists a free to play shooter 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.939
 developed by an idea and that we 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.860
 moved to the Renaissance era would be 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.630
 the big brother or the pc version 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.730
 of the game for tablet that we already saw 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.350
 previously as it is a free to 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.359
 play and you have already finished your beta 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.940
 you can download it from your 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.680
 official page 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.750
 well once we have already started 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.390
 the game we have before us the 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.850
 main menu where we have access to 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.440
 everything that this game offers us as 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.420
 you know it's a free to play 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.910
 so we will not have to buy it 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.650
 to be able to play but have a store 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.780
 within the game by which we can 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.570
 buy infinity of objects here what 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.850
 we see all divided into categories 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.760
 or with the points that generate the 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.210
 play simply or buying the currency 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.430
 of the game 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.600
 and an example of what we could buy 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.430
 it would be from from the weapon we have 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.420
 different types of weapons and we can 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.119
 buy new characters or objects to 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.550
 our characters for example a 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.000
 hat that improves us the amount of 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.610
 ammunition that we collect since the mode of 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.710
 game that has a little peculiar and not 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.840
 We have several chargers simply 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.509
 we have a charger and our crossbow and 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.230
 apart from our gun vÃ©lez so no 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.710
 we can not recharge 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:36.730
 here we can also buy as I have already 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.830
 said all the character for example this 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.090
 this iron mask that would give us 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.509
 something more than point of life 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.369
 like all the suits and weapons that are 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.380
 quite well achieved and set in 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.570
 the time of the Renaissance 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.710
 something very fun they know they have are 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.899
 the ceremonies 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.350
 literally translated to what they would be 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.450
 typical mote and here after 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.880
 kill one we could activate it 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.890
 by pressing the z button and each one 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.649
 also it improves us some attributes 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.250
 well let's go to the important that our 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.040
 profile here we could choose between 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.680
 all the characters that are available 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.930
 everything and everyone are pretty good 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.840
 quite well done considering 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.580
 the characteristics of rebirth and 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.000
 well we have now this 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.000
 selected 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.620
 and here we could create from our three 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.660
 classes that come by default and each 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.030
 one has the main weapon that usually 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.540
 be the submachine gun 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.360
 in our crossbow the special weapon and 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.510
 our soul melee broad here 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.530
 we could customize it with everything 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.530
 what we have bought in the store 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.200
 we can apply all the enhancers 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.209
 that they are would be like the perch and all the 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.380
 ceremony or objects that we have 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.410
 bought 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.620
 here we have the websites or missions are 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.930
 as a reward for example when doing 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.570
 of ml attacks because they give us as a 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.690
 achievement and with that achievement they give us this 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.580
 sort of banner that serves us well 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.880
 simply to customize our 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.880
 profile 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.630
 here in our profile, we have 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.819
 all our statistics the time 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.260
 that we have played in the experience and 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.629
 everything else 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.830
 and this is the typical ranking and the 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.830
 messages from our friends 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.440
 now 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:48.520
 Well, we've already seen that he was reborn in 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:50.469
 heros is a pretty attractive game since 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.300
 not only because of its graphic section that 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:54.879
 take advantage of the engine of a real 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.770
 but for its playability and all its 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:59.139
 game modes including the typical 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.969
 duel by team in the different maps 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.669
 all set in the time of 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:05.740
 renaissance in relation heros is very 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.050
 important to have control of the map at 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.240
 style a real tournament since we were 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.240
 improvements will appear for our 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.830
 character some more special weapons and 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.300
 over all ammunition that will be very 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.979
 important since it does not give us the 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.139
 possibility to recharge our weapon 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:22.599
 also if we add that a game 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.279
 free there is no reason why 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:25.270
 you can download and try it 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:26.559
 same 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.729
 Well, I hope you liked the 

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:29.729
 video and see you in the next
