00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.720
 Alternative clinics, how they came to deal with the issue of shoes 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.720
 You are not a loft 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.720
 This is the important difference between us and a shoe store whose goal is only to sell shoes 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:32.720
 But as part of my search I looked for all kinds of techniques to help patients 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.720
 As the innovative technology we have, like shock waves and laser therapy 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.720
 I also looked for other ways to improve posture, reduce stress from back pain and knees 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.720
 I was approached by a guy named Boaz Niv who I thought was seven or eight years ago 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.720
 That he remembered me from the Hapoel Tel Aviv soccer team that I dealt with many years ago 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:10.720
 He asked me how much I was wearing and offered to send me shoes to tell him to check them 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.720
 And I can help them rehabilitate people with pain 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.720
 And he did send the shoes to me for a while 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.720
 Then I realized the uniqueness of these shoes 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.720
 That they can help many pain and orthopedic problems in combination with the treatments we do in the clinic 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.720
 What is a physiological shoe? 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.720
 Okay, this physiological shoe is a different shoe than an orthopedic shoe 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.720
 An orthopedic shoe has a subject of comfort 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:02.720
 When a physiological shoe is a shoe that is supposed to help pain and orthopedic problems with the technology in shoes 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.720
 I'll explain a little, 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.720
 With the physiological shoe we can improve the posture by 10 degrees 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.720
 We can improve back pain problems 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.720
 We can reduce stress from the joints, knees, back and foot 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.720
 Between fourteen and nineteen percent 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.720
 And we balance the center of gravity which is very important 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.720
 On the subject of orthopedics and posture 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.720
 Once the center of gravity is balanced, there is less pressure on the joints and there is less wear 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.720
 In addition, the shoe activates muscles that, with the help of a normal shoe, it can not operate 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.720
 Then it helps the posture muscles 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.720
 And strengthen muscles in other normal shoes we can not do it 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.720
 A very important thing about the subject of physiological shoes is that the angles 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.720
 I will give an example 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.720
 The angle of walking the shoe creates a movement of rolling 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.720
 Avatar We manage to exert muscle 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.720
 And the special blemishes in shoes 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.720
 And this normal shoe does not exist 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.720
 Softness and special stunts are the special things
