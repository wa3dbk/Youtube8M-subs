00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.940
 certainly one of the most acute problems 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.850
 which was going to be today the entire population 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.850
 our country is a sharp rise in prices 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:11.699
 I must say that this problem is not only those 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:13.059
 who drives 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.059
 essentially hall rise 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.960
 cooking concerns 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.310
 economy of all citizens 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.759
 because 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:25.779
 sets the club 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.039
 inflation and all the rest 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.130
 various kinds of goods works services and 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.520
 do not accidentally connect ipod touch 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.900
 subject that uses 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.900
 everyday life 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.040
 what to do with your feet when to say it 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.720
 How long will this growth be respected? 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.280
 how many men are hostages of that 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.340
 situations which 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.000
 deal with the cause 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.220
 However, the head of Sastre is that our oil 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.230
 sector 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.060
 in fact is one of the main 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.600
 sources of income 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.090
 budgets of all levels 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.200
 very significant winners 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.840
 it rules 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.570
 so literally a few engine 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.370
 potassium 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.850
 so oil companies 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.240
 which set a certain 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.229
 skeleton specific prices at idle 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.360
 Chateau Taman 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.670
 not by chance but if the company 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.860
 being developed by subject 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.100
 consideration of federal 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.110
 antitrust 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.910
 one of them is already subject to 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.390
 multi-billion dollar fines 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.000
 This is actually a similar situation. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.380
 More recently, the next 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.200
 case 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.160
 largest companies 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.110
 nonetheless collecting and maintaining 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.550
 monopoly high prices 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.200
 rao continues to take place and and unfortunately 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.040
 I must admit that the protest against 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.470
 federation yet nothing to do with it 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.160
 but also when it was 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.510
 collect oil industry annually actually 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.470
 we are watching and here 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.950
 but an experienced picture and almost diminishes ul 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.170
 may even require but but in manual mode 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.750
 percent specificity 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.850
 Deputy Prime Minister stressed that all 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.600
 these pills don't change 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.000
 I remember quite recently literally 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.130
 a few years ago we talked a 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.340
 overcoming chub 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.880
 but also fuel prices psychologically 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.560
 Warsaw threshold in the 20th 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.149
 rubles per liter 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.579
 but far behind and we are selected in dense 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:13.470
 thirty 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.640
 in rubles came running when it comes to 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.569
 most successful with gasoline attacks 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.769
 by ABC live and rising diesel prices 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.040
 fuel will find glad that under the threat of thousands of 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.539
 of all 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.040
 the role of spring field work since they 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.189
 nationalism then governments 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:30.819
 based on such 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.019
 accounting gaap extremely difficult situation but 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.739
 I must admit that unfortunately it 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.349
 is a kind of our consequence 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.089
 structures of our economy where 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:41.479
 the ball is ruled by raw materials 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:44.329
 yes even the main budget revenue and say so 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.079
 specific policy 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.269
 governments I want to remind how 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.129
 there a year and a half ago, Vladimir Putin 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.680
 one if press conferences to question 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.699
 how many motorists will be still 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:53.879
 rise prices 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.519
 the public, but I think that in general 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.029
 is talking to you 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:02:59.629
 shame for that in general more that all 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.309
 understand this but deliberately goes on 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:02.139
 such a 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.549
 situation because one of the technicians 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.819
 will love the main budget revenues a 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:07.939
 also designed to solve 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.019
 social 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.909
 otherwise we were told the policy 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.279
 present next 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:14.879
 keep posters then gone 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.459
 select the limits of such super profits 5 3 in 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.679
 favor of the poorest 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:21.499
 so to speak 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:23.219
 when the composition of such a policy will be for 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.609
 middle class account 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:26.349
 overwhelmingly 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.349
 Russian motorists 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.599
 Here are some Kyrgyz and movies so in general 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:31.519
 judges 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.789
 we have going on 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:35.859
 growths also influenced a recent decision 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.609
 government and parliament 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:39.739
 boost 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.299
 excise on tobacco all types of fuel have 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.499
 it is clear that the oil workers did not chatter themselves 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:46.309
 carry over costs period 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:47.599
 Lenin consumers 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.599
 actually father and paid the ransom 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:57.079
 I suppose that in general this policy is understandable. 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.259
 tenge is quite farsightedly soft 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:00.099
 by saying 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.320
 that there is a teacher 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.740
 but also problems besides here as if right 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.339
 hand our power in general prevents 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:07.999
 because what does the left 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:09.769
 on the one hand, thousands are accepted 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.059
 various incentive programs 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:14.119
 car purchase 

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:15.310
 cars 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.150
 Especially car ketch on 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.209
 motor pumps different attitude but rolled 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.729
 do not eat 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.349
 and m of these cars 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.999
 Experience shows the highest demand 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:26.979
 recycling program 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.819
 prisoners more simple and cheap 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:31.069
 car makes 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.539
 our classic 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.909
 Lada five always 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:36.589
 but sometimes the owners for 

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:38.479
 car and suffer most 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:39.819
 from 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:41.580
 where exactly they specify when on 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.870
 field 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.509
 no i'm just not talking about what you 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.229
 we will all be forced to be serious 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.059
 minimize our ancestors use 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.800
 rubles 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.219
 at those gasoline prices which 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:52.809
 that is, in general there is a clear 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:54.849
 contradiction is another factor that too 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:55.789
 need to take into account 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:56.860
 for me is very our 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.979
 because 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.009
 me like extreme 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.469
 one of the few of our seniors 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:05.199
 for veterans and retirees a lot of 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.729
 they should have a car 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.830
 the machine uses rare enough to 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.949
 order to go to the cottage and then this one 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.050
 from the main sources of income 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.729
 and so here I think that 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:15.490
 in Japan 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.029
 first hit 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:20.030
 tradition will soon be able to abandon the flight 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.819
 and then sorry due to what 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:25.689
 in short i think that 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:28.309
 the problem of gasoline prices in three 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.960
 sisters 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.089
 it's fuel 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:31.979
 general state 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.040
 percent 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.500
 total social total 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.750
 fairs say nothing 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.059
 until now 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:42.419
 cardinal reforms using all 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:43.729
 no english 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:45.930
 so to speak anti-monopoly with growth 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.599
 prices that are worked out 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:49.570
 market economy 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.570
 otherwise I suppose that in general 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.090
 social support base of the current 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.689
 the authorities were substantially melting 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.689
 is not working enough now 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:00.599
 Responsibly many footballers 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.399
 declares a strong protest wits 

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:03.669
 searchlights issued 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.939
 about what's going on 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:08.949
 so here they need assistance 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:11.009
 decided the steps to restore order 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:14.009
 and to tighten all the same victory 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.949
 melt i believe that these steps will 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:19.979
 but 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.629
 and reached 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:22.379
 but there is one circumstance 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:24.029
 which can be encouraging 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:25.949
 performed a year which 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:27.969
 it will end a 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:31.309
 parliamentary elections and the next 

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:32.969
 presidential election 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:36.259
 with such power she still tries to do everything 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:37.969
 do not annoy public opinion 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:38.949
 to 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:40.639
 percent however at least reduce 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.770
 heat is most acute 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.270
 this is the only one 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.580
 for me it is the capital factor which 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.919
 all the same let me think that 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:50.449
 the government will take some steps to that 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:51.119
 to 

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:52.549
 curb monopolists and 

00:06:52.549 --> 00:06:55.119
 provide if not reducing performance 

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:56.299
 price stabilization
