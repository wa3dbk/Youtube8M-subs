00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
room for error and my plan was to go not

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.270 
room for error and my plan was to go not
fast<00:01:47.450> but<00:01:47.780> do<00:01:48.050> some<00:01:48.260> sharper<00:01:48.650> turns<00:01:48.830> and<00:01:49.130> she

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
fast but do some sharper turns and she

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.990 
fast but do some sharper turns and she
did<00:01:50.170> stay<00:01:51.170> within<00:01:51.440> her<00:01:51.830> time<00:01:52.130> and<00:01:52.520> then<00:01:52.760> if<00:01:52.880> I

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
did stay within her time and then if I

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.600 
did stay within her time and then if I
had<00:01:53.180> any<00:01:53.330> faults<00:01:53.750> after<00:01:54.140> after<00:01:55.010> the<00:01:55.250> second

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610

had any faults after after the second
last<00:01:55.760> jump<00:01:56.090> I<00:01:56.330> would<00:01:56.630> just<00:01:56.900> go<00:01:57.710> for<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:57.980> clean

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
last jump I would just go for the clean

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.310 
last jump I would just go for the clean
and<00:01:58.310> if<00:01:58.640> not<00:01:58.820> I<00:01:58.880> would<00:01:59.150> make<00:01:59.330> up<00:01:59.480> my<00:01:59.630> time<00:01:59.660> with

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
and if not I would make up my time with

and if not I would make up my time with
four<00:02:00.590> faults<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.100> last<00:02:01.310> jump<00:02:01.580> but<00:02:01.760> it<00:02:01.880> was<00:02:01.970> a
