00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.640
 gambling presents 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.480
 wine either and shock infinite big dodger 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.250
 Ken Levin managed to turn it all 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.310
 in a way that now can come up 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.890
 the most incredible stories jumble in 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.590
 familiar characters and any events 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.870
 and at the same time everything will look logical 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.430
 miss this opportunity in rational 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.370
 games did not 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.630
 and here we have the first episode 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.210
 add-ons burial at sea 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.239
 in it they promised us not only to tell about 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.030
 the fate of booker and elizabeth but also 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.399
 weave together the story of a floating city 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:57.420
 colombia and underwater utopia 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:01:00.120
 delight despite the change of place 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.350
 actions of external changes are less than 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.110
 one would expect 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.720
 booker devitt despite moving to 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.990
 delight all also depressively smokes in 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.390
 the office of your private detective agency 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:16.760
 as in the original story his life in 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.760
 changes radically with the advent of elizabeth 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:27.680
 the girl asks the booker to find the girl by 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:30.380
 the name sally david idea is not inspired but 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.740
 still agrees apparently not resisting 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.720
 before the languid gaze of a pretty girl 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.300
 beginning promises a story in noir style 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.430
 but the script quickly returns everything to 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.650
 habitual way to start we 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.350
 go for a peaceful walk through 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.750
 the city as in the original we study it 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.790
 denizens and listen to a casual conversation 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:55.369
 The year 1958 has a fatal Christmas 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.890
 did not come so the fans themselves 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.560
 the first part will be interesting for its 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.250
 eyes to look at delight in his era 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.190
 greatness is true this part is expected 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.679
 transient and soon we are with a light hand 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.190
 one of the old acquaintances we fall into 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.560
 isolated part of the city inhabited 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.080
 distraught followers of the fountain on 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.660
 shoe change comes to live city 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.239
 shops and giant half-empty halls 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.590
 where to spend most of 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:30.430
 additions here the game turns into 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.019
 the most classic bayusha 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.900
 again with play barn plasmid 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.720
 and adam and almost all means of dealing with 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.280
 mutants migrated from infinite let 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.280
 and in a bit reduced form 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.890
 new positions in the arsenal of only 2 plasmids 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.670
 and Santa Claus is an analogue of winter freshness 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.370
 freezing the opponent and 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.490
 micro wave emitter literally 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.650
 tearing enemies apart into the rest 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.170
 even in melee all the same 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.600
 have to fight back aero hook instead 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.390
 accustomed to the first part of the nut 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.420
 key air rails here by the word 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.450
 unexpectedly there too why aren't we 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.260
 seen in the very first part of the constant and 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.120
 variables 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:22.120
 Gentlemen, well, that's just the fight 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.880
 changed and become more difficult from now on 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.740
 allowed to wear the entire arsenal 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.020
 at the same time 100 only amended to 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.050
 the stock for each weapon is limited 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.700
 just two clips cartridges end in 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.070
 the worst possible moment 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.530
 and the people of delight are more dangerous 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.810
 the inhabitants of Colombia, they are not joking 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.790
 able to send a hero to the next world 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.550
 just a couple of shots 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.010
 obviously players are more actively stimulated 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.310
 use plasmids which are true on 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.830
 this time only five pieces and spicer and 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.650
 appear unexpectedly and even 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.709
 and arise from nowhere already cleaned 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.450
 locations is annoying even though 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.940
 the fact that you can master the supplement 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.340
 literally an hour break between 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.709
 shootouts besides research 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.230
 looted shops can all also 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.530
 admire elizabeth seek audio 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.359
 diaries and rummaging in trash cans 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.459
 looking for money on them as before 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.130
 to be purchased cartridges and 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.590
 first aid kits and also improved plasmids 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.360
 the truth of the weapon can only be tightened 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.030
 micro wave emitter 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.110
 Yes, and it is given the duration 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.050
 addon easy to miss 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.419
 but be that as it may skirmish element 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.000
 secondary as in any part of the series 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:40.210
 here in the first place of course the plot 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.910
 talking about him is dangerous the story is confusing 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.350
 and even the smallest and detail can 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.890
 turn up spoiler 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.750
 but the ending is a tradition 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:52.240
 can how to make look forward 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.980
 the second episode and finally 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.250
 disappoint in the whole series 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.200
 let's say this way if the plot is in shock 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.560
 ring and no came to your taste 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.950
 find another watch and add on here 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.950
 something like this
