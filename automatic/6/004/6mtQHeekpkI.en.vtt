much again to discuss it's okay it's

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.720 
much again to discuss it's okay it's
okay<00:00:30.289> the<00:00:31.289> reason<00:00:31.650> honestly<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.309> believe

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
okay the reason honestly I believe

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.130

there's<00:00:33.090> really<00:00:33.270> not<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.480> much<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.780> discuss

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
there's really not that much to discuss

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.900 
there's really not that much to discuss
is<00:00:34.290> because<00:00:34.530> there<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.890> no<00:00:35.160> zazz<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> grind

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
is because there is no zazz to the grind

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.630 
is because there is no zazz to the grind

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.910 
build you now have to boil dirty water
to<00:01:35.850> make<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.270> drinkable<00:01:36.659> which<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.170> great<00:01:37.619> it's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
to make it drinkable which is great it's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.780 
to make it drinkable which is great it's
going<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.159> add<00:01:38.310> another<00:01:38.430> layer<00:01:38.759> of

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
going to add another layer of

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.760 
going to add another layer of
survivability<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.659> mean<00:01:39.900> if<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.470> look<00:01:40.650> at

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
survivability I mean if you look at

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.260 
survivability I mean if you look at
other<00:01:40.890> survival<00:01:41.280> games<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.670> boiling<00:01:41.909> water

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
other survival games it's boiling water

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.780 
other survival games it's boiling water
as<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:43.799> long<00:01:43.979> dark<00:01:44.250> comes<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.640> mind

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
as it is the long dark comes to mind

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.520 
as it is the long dark comes to mind
immediately<00:01:44.939> which<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> game<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.320> hit<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
immediately which is a game we hit the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.700 
immediately which is a game we hit the
boiling<00:01:46.890> water<00:01:47.070> quite<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> lot<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:49.079> constantly

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
boiling water quite a lot so constantly

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.289 
boiling water quite a lot so constantly
having<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.920> make<00:01:50.070> sure<00:01:50.189> your<00:01:50.670> water<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.090> safe

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
having to make sure your water is safe

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.760 
having to make sure your water is safe
is<00:01:51.540> good<00:01:51.990> because<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.380> don't<00:01:52.560> you're

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
is good because if you don't you're

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.109 
is good because if you don't you're
going<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.950> get<00:01:53.009> sick<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.399> if<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.579> get<00:01:53.700> sick<00:01:53.909> in
