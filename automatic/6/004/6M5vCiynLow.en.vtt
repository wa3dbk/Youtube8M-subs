00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480 

I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:00.840> the<00:00:00.900> most<00:00:01.050> amazing<00:00:01.500> thing<00:00:01.890> with<00:00:02.310> this

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
I think the most amazing thing with this

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.670 
I think the most amazing thing with this
whole<00:00:03.060> flooding<00:00:03.659> situation<00:00:04.110> in<00:00:04.230> Thailand<00:00:04.560> is

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
whole flooding situation in Thailand is

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.730 
whole flooding situation in Thailand is
the<00:00:04.920> amount<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.670> water<00:00:05.970> that<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:06.990> covering<00:00:07.649> the

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
the amount of water that is covering the

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.430 
the amount of water that is covering the
ground<00:00:08.160> it's<00:00:08.670> hard<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.150> imagine<00:00:09.540> how<00:00:10.380> much

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
ground it's hard to imagine how much

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.830 
ground it's hard to imagine how much
water<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.070> we<00:00:12.030> went<00:00:12.179> ahead<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.389> measured

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
water this is we went ahead and measured

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.480 
water this is we went ahead and measured
it<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.349> it's<00:00:13.469> amazing<00:00:13.920> because<00:00:13.950> all<00:00:14.460> of

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
it and and it's amazing because all of

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.580 
it and and it's amazing because all of
the<00:00:14.639> areas<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.089> see<00:00:15.120> here<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.540> blue

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
the areas that you see here in blue

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.230 
the areas that you see here in blue
indicate<00:00:16.590> areas<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:17.039> are<00:00:17.190> flooded<00:00:17.789> not

areas that will flood or have the

areas that will flood or have the
potential<00:00:20.039> for<00:00:20.189> flooding<00:00:20.460> or<00:00:20.699> were<00:00:20.820> flooded

potential for flooding or were flooded

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.000 
potential for flooding or were flooded
before<00:00:21.300> areas<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.260> are<00:00:22.380> covered<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:22.769> water

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
before areas that are covered in water

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.370 
before areas that are covered in water
right<00:00:23.279> now<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:24.119> will<00:00:24.269> bring<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:25.019> an

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
right now and that will bring you to an

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.380 
right now and that will bring you to an
area<00:00:25.590> roughly<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.220> size<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.849> country<00:00:27.240> of

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
area roughly the size of the country of

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.599 
area roughly the size of the country of
Denmark<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.470> some<00:00:28.680> cases<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.130> water<00:00:29.400> is

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
Denmark so in some cases this water is

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.120 
Denmark so in some cases this water is
just<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:30.029> few<00:00:30.330> inches<00:00:30.779> deep<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.650> some<00:00:31.859> cases

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
just a few inches deep and in some cases

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.310 
just a few inches deep and in some cases
many<00:00:32.640> feet<00:00:33.090> deep<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.630> all<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.110> is

many feet deep and all of this is

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.870 
many feet deep and all of this is
advancing<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> south

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880

all<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.630> drainage<00:00:37.590> has<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.950> happen

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
all of this drainage has to happen

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.680 
all of this drainage has to happen
across<00:00:38.879> these<00:00:39.239> areas<00:00:39.690> here<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:41.149> in<00:00:42.149> Thailand

held back by the rising tide we get the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.030 
held back by the rising tide we get the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
highest tides of course when we have the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.500 
highest tides of course when we have the

close to the new moon and we're going to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.710 
close to the new moon and we're going to
see<00:01:13.799> these<00:01:14.430> rivers<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.909> are<00:01:14.970> flowing<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.540> the

south getting backed up by the high tide

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.170 
south getting backed up by the high tide
slows<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.170> down<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:20.490> highest<00:01:20.880> tides<00:01:21.090> that
