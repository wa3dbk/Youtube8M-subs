00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:29.439
 the so-called moderator allows the 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.439
 reduce the volume of the piano 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.080
 a mechanical device placed 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.690
 at that time only a felt strip 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.990
 between hammer and sides so that the 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:23.250
 sound is dampened and therefore advertise 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.250
 moderate sounds 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.369
 modern pianos usually have one 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.180
 third and that the middle pedal that 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.610
 this task takes over this pedal 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.650
 will not like it during the game 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.630
 the other case is the 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.820
 piano piece accordingly several times 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.640
 but rather has the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.340
 function of a lever which the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.259
 moderator turns it on once 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:13.020
 he will permanently lock the pedal ever 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.620
 after construction either by itself 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.739
 on 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.190
 or must be fixed on the side 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.190
 become 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.840
 the middle pedal is missing at the piano 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.889
 This is not necessarily an indication of this 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.450
 that it does not have a moderator 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:40.689
 since it is a switch off 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.540
 if you want to act you will find 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:47.939
 often a pedal instead of a pedal 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.939
 lever under or next to the keyboard 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.950
 thus, it is also for older pianos 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:57.849
 who almost never had such a steaming 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.489
 possible a moderator margin for 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:03.010
 Finger exercises or a piece first 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.949
 to get to know me is the moderator 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.569
 sure a fine thing 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:10.239
 but when using a 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.849
 Footstep between hammer and sides 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.639
 is located at a musical 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.310
 not to think 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.530
 many of them are lost in the sound 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.340
 go 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.739
 the piano sounds like it's packed in cotton 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.139
 Another disadvantage is that you have the 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.639
 resistance of the felt at the stop 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.639
 feels negative 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.770
 can you look constantly on a 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.400
 there is a danger that one is one 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:45.460
 other type of game therefore appropriated mine 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.100
 rad use the moderator only in 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.830
 rare falls may only be around 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.750
 to acquire a fingering sentence or the 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.710
 Structure of a new plan of her piece 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.710
 turn to learn 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.480
 The middle pedal has one wing 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.670
 completely different function 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.400
 there will be the complete mechanics 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.650
 moved so that the banging the side 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.170
 do not hit with their whole area 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.170
 and another sound picture emerges
