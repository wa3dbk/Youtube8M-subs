going into the 2010 games I've got a

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.910 
going into the 2010 games I've got a
real<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.479> different<00:01:55.080> mindset<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.770> real

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
real a different mindset of a real

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.520 
real a different mindset of a real
difference<00:01:56.280> focus<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.360> guess<00:01:57.390> it's<00:01:57.869> it's<00:01:58.409> I

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
difference focus I guess it's it's I

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.350 
difference focus I guess it's it's I
want<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.770> go<00:01:58.860> there<00:01:59.039> to<00:01:59.220> compete<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
best and and that's I think the big

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.649 
best and and that's I think the big
difference<00:02:02.220> I'm<00:02:02.789> not<00:02:02.970> I'm<00:02:03.179> not<00:02:03.209> really<00:02:03.509> going
