as<00:00:00.870> you<00:00:01.800> all<00:00:01.890> know<00:00:01.920> I've<00:00:02.580> been<00:00:02.730> using<00:00:02.970> these

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:04.069 
as you all know I've been using these

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.629 
as you all know I've been using these
civil<00:00:05.069> war<00:00:05.310> 10<00:00:05.940> patterns<00:00:07.490> that<00:00:08.490> are

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
civil war 10 patterns that are

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:17.360 
civil war 10 patterns that are
adjustable<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:12.469> the<00:00:13.469> patterns

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:17.370 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.740 

that<00:00:18.000> were<00:00:18.150> used<00:00:19.880> corresponding<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.240> the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
that were used corresponding to the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.820 
that were used corresponding to the
crimping<00:00:22.230> boards<00:00:22.620> as<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:24.470> this<00:00:25.470> front

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
crimping boards as in this this front

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.290 
crimping boards as in this this front
and<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:29.250> patterns<00:00:29.910> also<00:00:30.210> corresponded<00:00:30.930> to<00:00:31.590> a

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
and the patterns also corresponded to a

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.510 
and the patterns also corresponded to a
particular<00:00:33.300> last<00:00:33.660> size<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:35.130> if<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.790> do<00:00:35.850> this

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
particular last size so if I do this

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.760 
particular last size so if I do this
pattern<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:39.330> a<00:00:39.930> size<00:00:40.530> 10<00:00:41.840> it'll<00:00:42.840> fit<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> civil

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.060 
war 10 it will not fit regular size 10
of<00:00:48.360> today<00:00:49.190> now<00:00:50.190> because<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.150> pattern<00:00:51.650> has<00:00:52.650> a

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
of today now because this pattern has a

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:08.330 
of today now because this pattern has a
very<00:00:54.350> drastic<00:00:55.350> L<00:00:56.100> shape<00:00:59.210> as<00:01:00.830> opposed<00:01:01.830> to<00:01:07.340> the

very drastic L shape as opposed to the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.660 

you<00:01:22.600> can<00:01:22.810> see<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.260> difference<00:01:23.740> in<00:01:23.980> the<00:01:24.370> front

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
you can see the difference in the front

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:32.970 
you can see the difference in the front
here<00:01:26.340> now<00:01:27.340> that<00:01:27.640> means<00:01:27.910> the<00:01:28.210> boot<00:01:29.910> will<00:01:31.980> be

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
here now that means the boot will be

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.730 
here now that means the boot will be
able<00:01:33.160> to<00:01:33.370> pull<00:01:33.640> straighter<00:01:34.390> across<00:01:35.380> the

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
able to pull straighter across the

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.430 
able to pull straighter across the
throat<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:40.240> one<00:01:40.540> that<00:01:40.750> I'm<00:01:40.870> touching<00:01:41.080> right

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
throat this one that I'm touching right

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.010 
throat this one that I'm touching right
here<00:01:41.860> is<00:01:42.340> your<00:01:42.520> conventional<00:01:43.210> one<00:01:43.450> your

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
here is your conventional one your

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.280 
here is your conventional one your
conventional<00:01:44.530> crimping<00:01:44.920> board<00:01:46.050> you<00:01:47.050> know<00:01:47.170> it

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
conventional crimping board you know it

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.130 
conventional crimping board you know it
is<00:01:47.440> made<00:01:48.010> to<00:01:48.190> standard<00:01:48.670> they<00:01:49.540> used<00:01:49.780> them<00:01:49.960> with

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
is made to standard they used them with

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.160 
is made to standard they used them with
a<00:01:50.170> crepe<00:01:50.920> break<00:01:51.450> they<00:01:52.450> use<00:01:52.600> them<00:01:52.780> just<00:01:52.930> with

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
a crepe break they use them just with

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.670 
a crepe break they use them just with
crimping<00:01:54.570> crimping<00:01:55.570> screws<00:01:58.350> but<00:01:59.350> I<00:01:59.380> don't

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
crimping crimping screws but I don't

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.090 
crimping crimping screws but I don't
have<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.100> pattern<00:02:00.520> for<00:02:00.970> these<00:02:01.119> ones<00:02:02.100> the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
have the pattern for these ones the

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.240 
have the pattern for these ones the
pattern<00:02:03.490> I<00:02:03.610> have<00:02:03.640> is<00:02:04.619> what<00:02:05.619> I<00:02:05.650> just<00:02:05.979> showed<00:02:06.220> you

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
pattern I have is what I just showed you

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.900 
pattern I have is what I just showed you
so<00:02:06.970> I've<00:02:07.180> made<00:02:07.360> this<00:02:07.630> other<00:02:07.869> crimping<00:02:08.530> board

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
so I've made this other crimping board

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.240 
so I've made this other crimping board
the<00:02:09.910> one<00:02:10.119> underneath<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.080> you<00:02:11.530> can<00:02:11.560> see<00:02:11.920> how

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
the one underneath and you can see how

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:20.240 
the one underneath and you can see how
much<00:02:12.610> I<00:02:13.090> have<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.660> take<00:02:14.050> up<00:02:14.550> right<00:02:15.550> there<00:02:17.820> so

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
much I have to take up right there so

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.100 
much I have to take up right there so
this<00:02:21.250> crimped<00:02:21.760> front<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.420> going<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.780> have<00:02:22.930> to

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
this crimped front is going to have to

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.960 
this crimped front is going to have to
come<00:02:23.290> up<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:23.620> there<00:02:23.830> meaning<00:02:24.430> it's<00:02:24.700> going<00:02:24.760> to

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
come up to there meaning it's going to

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.009 
come up to there meaning it's going to
be<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.090> lot<00:02:25.270> of<00:02:25.300> stretch<00:02:25.690> in<00:02:25.930> there<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.780> thing

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
be a lot of stretch in there the thing

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.490 
be a lot of stretch in there the thing
is<00:02:29.200> with<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.470> crimped<00:02:29.920> front<00:02:30.600> if<00:02:31.600> it's<00:02:32.230> done

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
is with a crimped front if it's done

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.080 
is with a crimped front if it's done
correctly<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.790> boot<00:02:34.000> stands<00:02:34.390> up<00:02:34.720> straight<00:02:36.090> if

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
correctly the boot stands up straight if

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.430 
correctly the boot stands up straight if
it's<00:02:37.299> not<00:02:37.480> done<00:02:37.810> correctly<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.890> boot<00:02:39.070> leans

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
it's not done correctly the boot leans

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.220 
it's not done correctly the boot leans
back<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.760> when<00:02:43.000> it's<00:02:43.150> pulled<00:02:43.450> straight<00:02:43.930> it

back and when it's pulled straight it

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.990 
back and when it's pulled straight it
has<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.500> lot<00:02:44.769> of<00:02:44.799> wrinkles<00:02:45.250> like<00:02:45.519> those<00:02:45.760> ones
