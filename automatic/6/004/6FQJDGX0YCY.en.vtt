 boiler he was in a coma nods 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.200
 the scheme is very simple for an area of ​​96

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.630
 inside the system but also the police 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.630
 there is a watercourse 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.810

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.420
 here is another way out 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.450
 in science

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.180
 this is an old behavior system which 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.920
 will be

 I want after dinner 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.129
 in the kilowatt message 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.129
 it's like a surge tank 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:22.329
 impregnations also begin 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.109
 the radiator 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.349
 roundabout in other words before 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:29.979
 there were systems 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.979
 summer klitschko 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:39.989
 very comfortably

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.819
 here is the coolant

 heat network temperature 60 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:48.389
 degrees 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.469
 the radiator heats up to sixty UAH 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.009
 heat carrier can be 90 degrees 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:58.319
 the temperature of the theater will be and heat transfer 90
