00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
for example a clotheshorse

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.840 
for example a clotheshorse
to<00:03:04.840> dry<00:03:05.170> my<00:03:05.290> clothes<00:03:05.620> on<00:03:05.830> because<00:03:06.670> it's<00:03:06.819> a

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
to dry my clothes on because it's a

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.760 
to dry my clothes on because it's a
washing<00:03:07.030> machine<00:03:07.150> but<00:03:07.660> nowhere<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.410> dry<00:03:08.620> my

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770

washing machine but nowhere to dry my
stuff<00:03:09.010> except<00:03:09.340> I<00:03:09.400> guess<00:03:09.550> here<00:03:10.530> but<00:03:11.530> it's

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
stuff except I guess here but it's

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.970 
stuff except I guess here but it's
pretty<00:03:12.190> cold<00:03:12.430> so<00:03:13.270> I<00:03:13.690> think<00:03:14.560> my<00:03:14.650> clothes<00:03:14.830> will

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
just freeze there because as the famous

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.260 
just freeze there because as the famous
