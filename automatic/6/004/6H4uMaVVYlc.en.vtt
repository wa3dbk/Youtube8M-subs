it's going to give free and opportunity

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.890 
it's going to give free and opportunity
to<00:01:16.680> pull<00:01:16.770> back<00:01:17.040> into<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.430> game<00:01:17.670> because<00:01:18.390> he

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
to pull back into this game because he

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.240 
to pull back into this game because he
was<00:01:19.049> not<00:01:19.200> mining<00:01:19.470> from<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.680> natural<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.070> think

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
was not mining from the natural I think

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.249 
was not mining from the natural I think
at<00:01:20.400> all<00:01:20.430> he<00:01:21.360> started<00:01:21.720> off<00:01:21.780> mining<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> little

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
at all he started off mining a little

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.020 
at all he started off mining a little
bit<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.409> he<00:01:22.530> pulled<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:22.860> most<00:01:23.549> if<00:01:23.729> not<00:01:23.759> all<00:01:23.880> of

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
bit but he pulled up most if not all of

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.090 
bit but he pulled up most if not all of
his<00:01:24.210> suvs<00:01:24.540> from<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> natural<00:01:24.900> expansion<00:01:25.229> just

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
his suvs from the natural expansion just

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.030 
his suvs from the natural expansion just
would<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:26.479> keep<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.630> defense<00:01:27.930> holding<00:01:28.290> but

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
would just keep the defense holding but

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.859 
would just keep the defense holding but
definitely<00:01:29.490> has<00:01:29.729> quite<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> few<00:01:30.299> tanks<00:01:30.600> and

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
happening so I definitely I thought for

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.819 
happening so I definitely I thought for
a<00:01:59.340> second<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.640> saw<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.299> ebay<00:02:00.750> spin<00:02:01.229> at<00:02:01.439> ebay

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
a second I saw that ebay spin at ebay

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.190

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
blinking and it is blinking I thought it

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.410 
blinking and it is blinking I thought it
was<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> very<00:02:04.439> early<00:02:04.740> ebay<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.189> him<00:02:05.520> for<00:02:06.060> turret

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
simply a little bit too early so

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.520 
simply a little bit too early so
definitely<00:02:09.450> saw<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.690> Academy<00:02:10.200> blinking

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
definitely saw the Academy blinking

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.300 
definitely saw the Academy blinking

up to arbiters of two bases and this is

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.070 
up to arbiters of two bases and this is
unfortunate<00:02:51.390> for<00:02:51.420> me<00:02:51.510> because<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.750> arbiters

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
unfortunate for me because the arbiters

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.300 
unfortunate for me because the arbiters
is<00:02:52.200> not<00:02:52.380> what<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.590> needs<00:02:52.800> right<00:02:52.950> now<00:02:52.980> what<00:02:53.250> he

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
is not what it needs right now what he

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.090 
is not what it needs right now what he
needs<00:02:53.490> right<00:02:53.580> now<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:54.440> zealots<00:02:55.440> on<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.830> ground

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100

what he needs is rebirth and I think the
