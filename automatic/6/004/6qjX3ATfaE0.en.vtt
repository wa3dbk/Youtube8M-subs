know what happened but the game just got

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.359 
know what happened but the game just got
out<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.330> hand<00:00:24.810> now<00:00:25.380> normally<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:26.070> would<00:00:26.189> show

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
out of hand now normally we would show

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.089 
out of hand now normally we would show
you<00:00:26.430> guys<00:00:26.609> clips<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.180> last<00:00:27.420> game<00:00:27.750> but<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
you guys clips in the last game but the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.429 
you guys clips in the last game but the
teams<00:00:29.460> did<00:00:29.820> not<00:00:30.029> record<00:00:30.420> their<00:00:30.689> games<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.380> I

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
teams did not record their games and I

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.229 
teams did not record their games and I
think<00:00:31.679> at<00:00:31.769> least<00:00:31.920> if<00:00:32.099> one<00:00:32.340> team<00:00:32.579> did<00:00:32.910> they

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
think at least if one team did they

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.880 
think at least if one team did they
might<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.690> deleted<00:00:33.840> theirs<00:00:34.320> I'm<00:00:34.680> not<00:00:34.829> sure

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
might have deleted theirs I'm not sure

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.950 
might have deleted theirs I'm not sure
hit<00:00:35.610> hit<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:36.120> one<00:00:36.239> team<00:00:36.420> did<00:00:36.630> forget<00:00:36.899> to

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
hit hit but one team did forget to

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.840 
hit hit but one team did forget to

is<00:01:43.709> very<00:01:44.009> hard<00:01:44.280> predicting<00:01:44.729> these<00:01:44.789> games

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
is very hard predicting these games

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.749 
is very hard predicting these games
because<00:01:45.899> we're<00:01:46.110> looking<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:47.159> at<00:01:47.340> numbers

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
because we're looking just at numbers

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.279 
because we're looking just at numbers
we're<00:01:47.909> looking<00:01:48.090> at<00:01:48.209> over<00:01:48.599> also<00:01:48.750> looking<00:01:49.200> at

we're looking at over also looking at

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.199 
we're looking at over also looking at
height<00:01:49.649> stats<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.399> just<00:01:50.549> trying<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.849> predict

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209

I<00:02:06.509> would<00:02:06.899> have<00:02:06.989> never<00:02:07.049> predicted<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:08.099> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
I would have never predicted that to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.880 
I would have never predicted that to
happen<00:02:08.459> okay<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.929> round<00:02:10.200> two<00:02:10.410> hopefully<00:02:10.619> my

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
happen okay but round two hopefully my

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.530 
happen okay but round two hopefully my
predictions<00:02:11.340> are<00:02:11.430> on<00:02:11.519> point<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:12.329> is<00:02:12.480> just

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
predictions are on point this is just

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.020 
predictions are on point this is just
impossible<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.620> really<00:02:14.069> honestly<00:02:14.519> let's<00:02:14.849> just

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
impossible so really honestly let's just

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.400 
impossible so really honestly let's just
get<00:02:15.150> into<00:02:15.269> this<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.720> like<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.019> said<00:02:16.079> I'm<00:02:16.290> going

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
get into this and like I said I'm going

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.080 
get into this and like I said I'm going
to<00:02:16.500> speculate<00:02:16.859> on<00:02:17.010> who<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.459> think<00:02:17.639> is<00:02:17.880> gonna<00:02:18.000> win

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
to speculate on who I think is gonna win
