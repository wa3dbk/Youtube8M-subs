00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.110
 Today I make aubergine from paprika 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:20.220
 For this I first halve an aubergine 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.980
 and put three peppers into life 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.820
 I've gotten out of the oven now 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.660

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.660
 preheated 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.960

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.559
