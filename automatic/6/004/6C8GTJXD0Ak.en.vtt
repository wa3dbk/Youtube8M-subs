00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
we're back with another video of Dragon

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.339 
we're back with another video of Dragon
City<00:00:09.179> today<00:00:09.450> we're<00:00:09.719> looking<00:00:09.900> at<00:00:10.200> another

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
City today we're looking at another

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.490 
City today we're looking at another
ancient<00:00:11.219> dragon<00:00:11.700> evolution<00:00:12.360> now<00:00:12.509> one<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.290> our

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
ancient dragon evolution now one of our

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.799 
ancient dragon evolution now one of our
ancient<00:00:13.740> dragon<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.460> stuck<00:00:14.820> because<00:00:15.240> we<00:00:15.630> don't

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
ancient dragon is stuck because we don't

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.380 
ancient dragon is stuck because we don't
have<00:00:15.929> enough<00:00:16.230> platinum<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.340> gotta<00:00:17.730> give<00:00:18.090> all

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
have enough platinum so I gotta give all

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.390 
have enough platinum so I gotta give all
these<00:00:18.660> things<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.289> they<00:00:19.439> they<00:00:19.800> can<00:00:19.949> generate

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
these things so they they can generate

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.730 
these things so they they can generate
platinum<00:00:20.939> much<00:00:21.150> faster<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.170> we're<00:00:22.320> looking<00:00:22.619> at

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
platinum much faster so we're looking at

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.820 
platinum much faster so we're looking at
rebored<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.640> know<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.480> ashes<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.380> we're<00:00:25.710> gonna

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
rebored I know of ashes and we're gonna

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.070 
rebored I know of ashes and we're gonna
do<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.189> evolution<00:00:26.789> I'm<00:00:27.000> first<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.660> all<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.810> want

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
do the evolution I'm first of all I want

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.839 
do the evolution I'm first of all I want
to<00:00:28.170> go<00:00:28.320> in<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.949> have<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.220> memory<00:00:29.699> of

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
to go in here so you have a memory of

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.500 
to go in here so you have a memory of
his<00:00:30.840> or<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.560> guess<00:00:31.830> for<00:00:32.009> his<00:00:32.279> second<00:00:32.730> animation

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
his or I guess for his second animation

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.569 
his or I guess for his second animation
so<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.410> what<00:00:34.530> he<00:00:34.620> does<00:00:34.770> he<00:00:35.040> coughs<00:00:35.340> and

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
so this is what he does he coughs and

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.639 
so this is what he does he coughs and
then<00:00:35.730> he<00:00:35.790> blows<00:00:36.090> out<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.480> Phoenix<00:00:37.020> fire

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
then he blows out this Phoenix fire

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.549 
then he blows out this Phoenix fire
breath<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.610> what<00:00:38.850> I'm<00:00:38.969> calling<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.750> mean<00:00:40.230> I

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
breath is what I'm calling it I mean I

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.180 
breath is what I'm calling it I mean I
think<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.040> sounds<00:00:41.219> good<00:00:41.550> Phoenix<00:00:42.030> fire<00:00:42.239> breath

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
think it sounds good Phoenix fire breath

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.130 
think it sounds good Phoenix fire breath
but<00:00:44.190> there<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.610> what<00:00:45.360> we're<00:00:45.480> gonna<00:00:45.629> do<00:00:45.870> now

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
but there it is what we're gonna do now

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.060 
but there it is what we're gonna do now
is<00:00:46.200> evolve<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.430> Phoenix<00:00:48.289> Phoenix<00:00:49.289> dragon<00:00:49.950> is

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
is evolve this Phoenix Phoenix dragon is

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.950 
is evolve this Phoenix Phoenix dragon is
I<00:00:50.610> guess<00:00:51.030> that's<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.420> should<00:00:51.660> call<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
I guess that's what I should call it the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.770 
I guess that's what I should call it the
Phoenix<00:00:52.320> dragon<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.699> we're<00:00:54.030> gonna<00:00:54.180> evolve<00:00:54.570> it

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
Phoenix dragon but we're gonna evolve it

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.849 
Phoenix dragon but we're gonna evolve it
and<00:00:56.000> there<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.230> gonna<00:00:58.350> evolve<00:00:58.710> now

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
and there it is so it's gonna evolve now

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.700 
and there it is so it's gonna evolve now
remember<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.460> tail<00:00:59.730> in<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.660> wings<00:01:03.710> alright

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
remember to tail in the wings alright

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.560 
remember to tail in the wings alright
it's<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.189> gone<00:01:05.369> bigger<00:01:05.850> there's<00:01:06.240> not<00:01:06.390> much

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
it's just gone bigger there's not much

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.880 
it's just gone bigger there's not much
of<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.780> difference<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.260> don't<00:01:07.439> think<00:01:07.650> there's<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
of a difference I don't think there's a

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.310 
of a difference I don't think there's a
huge<00:01:08.189> change<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.760> course<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.210> cannot<00:01:09.540> see<00:01:10.200> it

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
huge change of course I cannot see it

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.620 
huge change of course I cannot see it
because<00:01:10.530> obviously<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.460> cannot<00:01:11.880> rewind<00:01:12.390> in

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
because obviously I cannot rewind in

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.990 
because obviously I cannot rewind in
recording<00:01:13.470> video<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.850> want

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
recording video but you can if you want

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.929 
recording video but you can if you want
to<00:01:15.119> rewind<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.750> check<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.110> out<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.520> see<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
to rewind to check it out and see the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.580 
to rewind to check it out and see the
differences<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.630> can<00:01:18.900> do<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.380> let<00:01:19.560> me

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
differences you can do that and let me

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.320 
differences you can do that and let me
know<00:01:19.710> what<00:01:20.189> are<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.490> differences<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
know what are the differences in the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.140 
know what are the differences in the
comments<00:01:21.810> below<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.710> pretty<00:01:23.159> much<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> mean

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
comments below but pretty much it I mean

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.240 
comments below but pretty much it I mean
I<00:01:24.479> don't<00:01:24.689> see<00:01:24.869> anything<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.380> different<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
I don't see anything that different the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.010 
I don't see anything that different the
first<00:01:26.549> form<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.060> second<00:01:27.479> form<00:01:27.689> there's<00:01:27.930> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
first form to the second form there's a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.170 
first form to the second form there's a
big<00:01:28.290> difference<00:01:28.740> there<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.520> big<00:01:29.759> difference

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
big difference there the big difference

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.780 
big difference there the big difference
was<00:01:30.329> hey<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.930> actually<00:01:31.650> grew<00:01:31.860> another<00:01:32.130> tail<00:01:32.490> or

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
was hey it actually grew another tail or

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.940 
was hey it actually grew another tail or
split<00:01:33.119> another<00:01:33.360> tail<00:01:33.720> let's<00:01:34.380> go<00:01:34.500> back<00:01:34.680> out<00:01:34.920> of

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
split another tail let's go back out of

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.069 
split another tail let's go back out of
here<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.939> cannot<00:01:36.270> evolve<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.900> we're

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
here and we cannot evolve it we're

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.469 
here and we cannot evolve it we're
missing<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.680> SAP<00:01:37.979> fire<00:01:38.369> maybe<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.150> could<00:01:39.299> make<00:01:39.450> a

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
missing a SAP fire maybe we could make a

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.999 
missing a SAP fire maybe we could make a
SAM<00:01:39.810> fire<00:01:40.049> let's<00:01:40.290> go<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.710> here<00:01:45.860> alright<00:01:46.860> we

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
SAM fire let's go on in here alright we

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.460 
SAM fire let's go on in here alright we
have<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> lot<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.610> stuff<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.720> thing<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.110> I've

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
have a lot of stuff the thing is I've

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.590 
have a lot of stuff the thing is I've
just<00:01:50.159> been<00:01:50.310> collecting<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.180> haven't<00:01:51.360> been

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
just been collecting it I haven't been

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.490 
just been collecting it I haven't been
using<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.920> that's<00:01:53.399> really<00:01:53.670> bad<00:01:53.939> actually<00:01:54.500> I

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
using it so that's really bad actually I

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.810 
using it so that's really bad actually I
think<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.130> enough<00:01:56.399> right<00:01:56.610> now<00:01:56.640> to

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
think we just have enough right now to

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.880 
think we just have enough right now to
do<00:01:57.060> another<00:01:57.299> evolution<00:01:57.990> but<00:01:58.409> first<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.740> all<00:01:58.860> I

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
do another evolution but first of all I

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.100 
do another evolution but first of all I
want<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.130> go<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.490> here<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.119> then<00:02:00.420> check<00:02:00.960> out

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
want to go in here and then check out

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.800 
want to go in here and then check out
the<00:02:01.229> animation<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:03.000> we're<00:02:03.119> gonna<00:02:03.210> tap<00:02:03.479> on<00:02:03.659> it

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
the animation so we're gonna tap on it

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.180 
the animation so we're gonna tap on it
oh<00:02:04.310> my<00:02:05.310> god<00:02:05.820> how<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.240> fire<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:06.990> mean<00:02:07.530> rain<00:02:07.799> go<00:02:08.069> on

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
oh my god how can fire I mean rain go on

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.919 
oh my god how can fire I mean rain go on
to<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> fire<00:02:08.610> that's<00:02:08.879> really<00:02:09.179> bad<00:02:09.300> actually

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
to a fire that's really bad actually

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.370 
to a fire that's really bad actually
so<00:02:10.410> let's<00:02:10.590> top<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.950> again

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.860 

all<00:02:16.380> right<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:16.650> there<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.070> I<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:18.210> guess<00:02:18.690> it

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
all right so there it is I I guess it

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.590 
all right so there it is I I guess it
starts<00:02:19.170> raining<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.700> takes<00:02:21.060> out<00:02:21.210> his<00:02:21.360> fire

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
starts raining and takes out his fire

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.050 
starts raining and takes out his fire
and<00:02:21.630> then<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.990> fire<00:02:22.200> grows<00:02:22.530> back<00:02:22.890> but<00:02:23.760> yeah<00:02:24.030> I

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
and then the fire grows back but yeah I

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.730 
and then the fire grows back but yeah I
mean<00:02:24.210> we<00:02:25.200> have<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.350> lot<00:02:25.770> of<00:02:25.980> crystals<00:02:27.710> because<00:02:28.710> I

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
mean we have a lot of crystals because I

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.530 
mean we have a lot of crystals because I
haven't<00:02:29.130> been<00:02:29.310> upgrading<00:02:29.970> I've<00:02:30.090> just<00:02:30.360> been

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
haven't been upgrading I've just been

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.450 
haven't been upgrading I've just been
collecting<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:31.260> we're<00:02:31.800> gonna<00:02:31.890> evolve<00:02:32.250> it

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
collecting it we're gonna evolve it

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.360 
collecting it we're gonna evolve it
again<00:02:32.910> this<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.140> third<00:02:34.410> form<00:02:34.800> as<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.070> saw

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
again this is the third form as you saw

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.190 
again this is the third form as you saw
the<00:02:35.430> animation<00:02:35.670> we<00:02:36.120> can<00:02:36.150> evolve<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.720> once<00:02:36.930> more

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
the animation we can evolve it once more

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.950 
the animation we can evolve it once more
and<00:02:37.760> do<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.820> remember<00:02:38.970> what<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.600> looks<00:02:39.780> like

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
and do you remember what it looks like

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.410 
and do you remember what it looks like
hopefully<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.650> makes<00:02:40.920> some<00:02:41.130> big<00:02:41.790> changes

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.850 

alright<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.630> grows<00:02:45.870> much<00:02:46.110> bigger<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.740> you'll

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
alright it grows much bigger and you'll

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.640 
alright it grows much bigger and you'll
notice<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.460> has<00:02:47.490> three<00:02:48.150> fire<00:02:48.510> things<00:02:49.380> now

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
notice that it has three fire things now

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.850 
notice that it has three fire things now
opposed<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.760> just<00:02:50.940> being<00:02:51.240> too<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:52.380> there<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.710> is

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
opposed to just being too so there it is

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.880 
opposed to just being too so there it is
and<00:02:53.630> looks<00:02:54.630> like<00:02:54.810> it's<00:02:54.990> at<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.290> max<00:02:55.560> oh<00:02:55.860> no

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
and looks like it's at the max oh no

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.980 
and looks like it's at the max oh no
it's<00:02:56.460> not<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.670> max<00:02:57.090> level<00:02:57.360> we<00:02:57.600> just<00:02:57.840> don't

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
it's not the max level we just don't

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.600 
it's not the max level we just don't
have<00:02:58.140> enough<00:02:58.200> gems<00:03:01.070> actually<00:03:02.070> I<00:03:02.100> could<00:03:02.400> take<00:03:02.580> a

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
have enough gems actually I could take a

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.130 
have enough gems actually I could take a
look<00:03:02.850> at<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.120> but<00:03:03.330> here<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.750> is

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
why we're left with so much lower level

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.340 
why we're left with so much lower level
gems<00:03:41.310> or<00:03:41.580> lower<00:03:41.760> lower<00:03:42.090> level<00:03:42.510> crystals

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
gems or lower lower level crystals

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.350 
gems or lower lower level crystals
rather<00:03:43.590> let<00:03:44.340> me<00:03:44.370> go<00:03:44.550> in<00:03:44.670> here<00:03:44.700> let's<00:03:45.120> see<00:03:45.210> what
