00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.260
 we do not have a sticker 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.420
 Only here and people all watching 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.420
 cars that rush past them 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.250
 here is one sped still 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.379
 how many cars chases 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.609
 only I can't hope at all 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.300
 driving through the streets 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.699
 their wheels are much bigger and wider than those 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.369
 ordinary cars themselves these 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.759
 race car belly almost 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.360
 asphalt rub it is called low 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:17.000
 landing why is it necessary to 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.210
 sore so called these machines could 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.720
 maximum speed in general, all 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.860
 unusual details of the appearance of the car 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.229
 explained by the desire 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.200
 designers to create the fastest 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.229
 the car for this body is made of very 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.600
 light but durable material 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.880
 fiberglass wide tires to which you 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.759
 immediately paid attention provides 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.679
 good grip as a result 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.509
 pallida rush at a speed of more 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.789
 three hundred kilometers per hour 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:52.280
 any other car on such 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:54.860
 speeds would take off 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.250
 attention to the details in front and 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:02.240
 in front of racing cars 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:05.210
 the frame that lies behind the cars 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.090
 some kind of rectangular gate 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.180
 These are the details that are attached 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.500
 also called anti wings and do not give 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.260
 Formula 1 car 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.440
 off the ground they are constructed 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.299
 so when driving a car 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.299
 there is a force pushing it to the ground 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:39.530
 Now I understand Uncle Kuziâ€™s car 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.120
 and why all of these are not if 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:53.780
 all sat down plaids 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:57.580
 yes that street was not necessary fun and 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.950
 tail race cars are racing cars 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.549
 they are created specifically for race tracks 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.489
 and on the streets of the city they have nothing to do 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:09.530
 why are we going to go now 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.989
 modern city on a busy 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.989
 crossroads there you will understand everything
