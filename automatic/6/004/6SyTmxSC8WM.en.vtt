00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.980
 portable metal detector film 158 c 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.780
 these are four devices in one 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.299
 metal detection housing 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.260
 items put the switch in 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.260
 position 1 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.830
 slowly move the device along 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.180
 surface to be studied in different 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:30.550
 Directions notices the diode and squeals 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.599
 bipper means device detected 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.150
 metal object 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.670
 the device finds nails rivets studs 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.809
 cable conductors inside plastic and 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.120
 wooden structures 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.890
 the sensor determines which metals as 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.590
 become iron and copper 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.210
 gold aluminum and so on next 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.370
 network variable test function 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.199
 voltage before starting work 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.900
 it is necessary to put the switch in 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.040
 position 2 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:59.830
 bring the dough off 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:02.440
 the electric device diode will light up 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.400
 scribe bieber if the device is not grounded 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.500
 bring the device to the television or monitor 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.600
 we want to move away from the screen as well 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.580
 the diode goes out and the beeper stops beeping 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.490
 is safe in terms of 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.619
 radiation device can also determine 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.940
 voltage hidden wiring only if 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.220
 the wire is not shielded 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.250
 for more precise definition put 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.140
 free hand on the wall next 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.000
 the ability of this detector to test for 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.799
 open circuit and polarity test 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.350
 attention make sure that there is no nearby 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:36.429
 a high voltage source set 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.939
 switch to position 0 touch 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.299
 to metal plates with left hand a 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.100
 right hand 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:47.039
 collaboration contact testee 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.039
 object and for test pin object 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.049
 if the diode lights up and squeals now 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.630
 it means you are good too 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.969
 check utility from 6 to 36 volts 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.020
 if the diode lights up and the bieber squeals 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.780
 means plus 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.819
 and a nice bonus is the LED flashlight 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.260
 to use it is necessary 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:12.910
 put the switch to 0 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.640
 instrument characteristics are the following depth 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.980
 measurements up to 50 millimeters without contact 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.790
 AC Voltage Detection 70 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.150
 600 volts 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.060
 test for breaking from 0 to 50 heads test for 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.340
 polarity 6 . 6 volts sleep permanent 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.140
 current battery life is about one 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.450
 year without using LED 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.410
 lamp power one battery type krone 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.470
 9v 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.329
 ms50 87 will be great for you 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.690
 assistant and replace a few 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.690
 appliances
