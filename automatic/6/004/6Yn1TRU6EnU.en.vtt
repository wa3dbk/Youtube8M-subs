with some hot water I can press the top
down<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.160> then<00:03:12.980> get<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.190> crud<00:03:14.520> out<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.850> there

down and then get that crud out of there
I<00:03:16.790> don't<00:03:17.790> really<00:03:17.940> want<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.240> saw<00:03:18.450> would<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.780> want

I don't really want to saw would I want

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.500 
I don't really want to saw would I want

to saw through the glue and pull out the

to saw through the glue and pull out the
dried<00:03:21.780> stuff<00:03:25.160> because<00:03:26.160> that<00:03:26.340> would<00:03:26.490> keep<00:03:26.670> the

dried stuff because that would keep the

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.730 
dried stuff because that would keep the

another good cleaner is drywall sanding
screen<00:03:34.460> that's<00:03:35.460> 120<00:03:36.180> grit<00:03:36.390> if<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:36.600> can<00:03:36.750> get

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
screen that's 120 grit if you can get

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.770 
screen that's 120 grit if you can get
into<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.320> joint<00:03:38.030> it'll<00:03:39.030> pull<00:03:39.210> a<00:03:39.240> lot<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.510> stuff

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
into the joint it'll pull a lot of stuff

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:49.390 
into the joint it'll pull a lot of stuff
out

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.709 

that's<00:03:50.400> about<00:03:50.670> as<00:03:50.790> clean<00:03:51.000> as<00:03:51.180> I'll<00:03:51.299> get<00:03:51.480> that

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:51.719 
that's about as clean as I'll get that

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:54.920 
that's about as clean as I'll get that
and<00:03:52.579> it's<00:03:53.579> ready<00:03:53.849> for<00:03:54.120> glue<00:03:54.269> now<00:03:54.540> I've<00:03:54.659> got<00:03:54.840> to

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
and it's ready for glue now I've got to

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.920 
and it's ready for glue now I've got to
figure<00:03:55.079> out<00:03:55.200> how<00:03:55.560> I'll<00:03:55.769> glue<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.010> up<00:03:56.750> to<00:03:57.750> get

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
figure out how I'll glue it up to get

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.830 
figure out how I'll glue it up to get
rid<00:03:58.049> of<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.290> dip<00:03:58.500> up<00:03:58.709> here

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
rid of the dip up here

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.500 
rid of the dip up here
think<00:04:00.840> about<00:04:01.019> that<00:04:01.170> overnight
