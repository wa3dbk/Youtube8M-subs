00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.020 
there we go put it just a light amount
on<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.930> also<00:02:16.110> on<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.590> hub<00:02:16.770> itself<00:02:17.160> and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
on it and also on the hub itself and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.660 
on it and also on the hub itself and
this<00:02:18.690> will<00:02:18.840> stop<00:02:19.050> this<00:02:19.230> from<00:02:19.440> locking<00:02:19.890> up<00:02:20.010> take

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
this will stop this from locking up take

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.450 
this will stop this from locking up take
a<00:02:20.810> rag<00:02:21.810> or<00:02:22.290> something<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.860> wipe<00:02:23.100> it

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
a rag or something and wipe it

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.120 
a rag or something and wipe it
so<00:02:24.060> it's<00:02:24.270> an<00:02:24.360> ultra-thin<00:02:24.900> coating<00:02:25.710> that's<00:02:25.920> on

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
so it's an ultra-thin coating that's on

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.190 
so it's an ultra-thin coating that's on
there<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.610> what<00:02:27.210> this<00:02:27.330> will<00:02:27.480> do<00:02:27.630> is<00:02:27.780> stop<00:02:28.050> the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
there and what this will do is stop the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.130 
there and what this will do is stop the
electrolysis<00:02:28.710> a<00:02:29.130> lot<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.820> times<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.090> see<00:02:30.300> you

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
electrolysis a lot of times you see you

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.540 
electrolysis a lot of times you see you
know<00:02:31.230> vehicles<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.770> have<00:02:31.920> alloy<00:02:32.220> wheels

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
know vehicles that have alloy wheels

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.000 
know vehicles that have alloy wheels
like<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.990> aluminum<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:34.560> all<00:02:34.710> destroyed

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
like this the aluminum is all destroyed

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.880 
like this the aluminum is all destroyed
all<00:02:35.520> around<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.910> perimeter<00:02:36.240> if<00:02:37.050> somebody<00:02:37.620> did

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
all around the perimeter if somebody did

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.940 
all around the perimeter if somebody did
this<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.970> would<00:02:39.120> help<00:02:39.270> prevent<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.140> slow

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
this it would help prevent that and slow

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.890 
this it would help prevent that and slow
it<00:02:41.070> down<00:02:41.100> you<00:02:41.430> see<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.790> rust<00:02:42.000> already<00:02:42.450> forming

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
it down you see the rust already forming

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.580 
it down you see the rust already forming
on<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.110> insides<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:43.820> drums<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:46.500> know

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
on the insides of the drums and you know

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.690 
on the insides of the drums and you know
should<00:02:46.830> this<00:02:46.890> should<00:02:46.950> have<00:02:47.130> been<00:02:47.160> done<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.400> year

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
should this should have been done a year

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
should this should have been done a year
ago<00:02:47.910> on<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.420> car<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.830> was<00:02:49.950> let<00:02:50.550> go<00:02:50.720> you

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
ago on this car and it was let go you

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.750 
ago on this car and it was let go you
know<00:02:51.810> it's<00:02:52.590> just<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:52.890> way<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.100> is<00:02:53.190> sometimes

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
know it's just the way it is sometimes

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.150 
know it's just the way it is sometimes
but<00:02:54.570> at<00:02:54.750> least<00:02:54.900> now<00:02:55.170> we're<00:02:55.560> gonna<00:02:55.650> have<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.100> and

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
but at least now we're gonna have it and

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.190 
but at least now we're gonna have it and
we're<00:02:59.160> gonna<00:02:59.250> try<00:02:59.490> to<00:02:59.520> prevent<00:02:59.880> it<00:03:03.200> okay

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
we're gonna try to prevent it okay

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.720 
we're gonna try to prevent it okay
that's<00:03:04.620> how<00:03:04.800> it<00:03:04.860> should<00:03:04.920> look<00:03:05.100> after<00:03:05.610> you're

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
that's how it should look after you're

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.210 
that's how it should look after you're
done<00:03:05.820> cleaning<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.330> nice<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.440> clean<00:03:07.650> nice<00:03:08.160> and

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
done cleaning it nice and clean nice and

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.390 
done cleaning it nice and clean nice and
uniform<00:03:09.140> put<00:03:10.140> your<00:03:10.290> never<00:03:10.500> sees<00:03:10.740> all<00:03:10.980> around

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
uniform put your never sees all around

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.330 
uniform put your never sees all around
and<00:03:11.989> when<00:03:12.989> you<00:03:13.080> put<00:03:13.200> your<00:03:13.290> lug<00:03:13.470> nuts<00:03:13.680> don't

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
and when you put your lug nuts don't

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.540 
and when you put your lug nuts don't
forget<00:03:14.790> all<00:03:15.180> right<00:03:15.660> in<00:03:15.780> here<00:03:16.160> because<00:03:17.160> this<00:03:17.400> is

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
forget all right in here because this is

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.770 
forget all right in here because this is
going<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.730> go<00:03:17.850> in<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.090> touch<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.570> rim<00:03:19.580> so

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
going to go in and touch the rim so

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.770 
going to go in and touch the rim so
grease<00:03:21.780> these<00:03:22.019> up<00:03:22.640> this<00:03:23.640> way<00:03:23.850> steel<00:03:24.330> does<00:03:24.600> not

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
grease these up this way steel does not

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.670 
grease these up this way steel does not
come<00:03:25.050> direct<00:03:25.470> contact<00:03:25.980> with<00:03:26.100> aluminum<00:03:26.760> and

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
come direct contact with aluminum and

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.340 
come direct contact with aluminum and
you<00:03:28.680> should<00:03:28.860> be<00:03:28.950> good<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.220> go
