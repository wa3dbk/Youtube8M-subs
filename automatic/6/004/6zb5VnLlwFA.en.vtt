00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.990
 now 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.750
 of the images that can be seen in 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.030
 Internet about human mutations is 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.190
 includes only one perhaps the least 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.230
 cruel and that is also mitigated for 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.360
 illustrate an objective fact that the 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.940
 failures in nuclear reactors including 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.100
 small incidents and the waste of 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.830
 operation can produce effects 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.650
 that make them essentially different than 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.900
 any other type of accident in a 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.900
 tragedy any consequences 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.660
 are limited to what happened 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.339
 Ionizing radiations affect 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.010
 the genetic structure of beings 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.520
 living and its aftermath in humans and 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.170
 environment are unpredictable 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.990
 that's why the simple count of victims 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.390
 initials in a nuclear accident lacks 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.909
 not at all of significance 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.890
 Chernobyl only the employees of the 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.840
 plant died on that same night as 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.210
 direct consequence of the explosion and 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.640
 about 30 in the following days 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.590
 for those first victims the 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.830
 problems ended but for the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.840
 survivors had just begun 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.030
 ionizing radiation went on and on 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.450
 working for that the effects on the 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.100
 population were tragic 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.670
 if you see a report from the organization 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.280
 global health is about a 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.369
 historical document issued at 20 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.380
 years of the Chernobyl disaster UB 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.179
 estimated an excess of 9,000 deaths per 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.600
 cancer among the most 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:01.299
 directly related 116 thousand 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.759
 people were initially evacuated and 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:08.830
 after another 330 thousand more than 5 million 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.560
 they live in still contaminated areas 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.040
 many with unexplained symptoms 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.019
 clear, we are still trying to improve 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.560
 the affected populations through 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.420
 various programs in summary according to that 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.940
 report of the world organization of 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.450
 health some consequences were some 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.510
 9 thousand deaths from cancer and 450,000 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.879
 displaced people 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.950
 the effects of mutations are worse 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.459
 and they are not limited to the generation that 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.659
 He lived the problem spent more than 25 years 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.060
 and they continue to be developed avoiding other 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.790
 human images we see now some 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.599
 effects of ionizing radiation on the 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.110
 animal genetics an 8- legged mutant 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.609
 who was called the patrician of Gorbachev 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.200
 embalmed and preserved by a member 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:02.470
 of the Colombian academy of sciences 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.319
 Thousands of people are born in contaminated areas 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.330
 deformed animals initially is 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.610
 part of the cattle there went to riad oa 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.709
 russia but the animals were so 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.810
 contaminated that were sacrificed and 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.580
 buried studies were made 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.700
 statistics that show a 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.519
 the decline of biodiversity 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.019
 mammals decreases in the area a 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.599
 Resident research in the region 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.740
 notes that the size of the 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.350
 brains of birds 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.960
 is the most threatening effects for the 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.000
 evolution were studied in ukraine on 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.670
 research team indicates that the 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.220
 low dose radiation may have 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.530
 significant effects on development 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.530
 normal brain regarding its size 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.170
 and therefore potentially on the 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.720
 cognitive ability there is some reason 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.600
 by which our species would escape 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.940
 that kind of consequences 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.070
 fukushima has spent little time in the 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.650
 scale in which these events are 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.170
 develop to take stock in the 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.510
 environmental consequences of the accident 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.180
 of fukushima also in Japan the 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.790
 ionizing radiation followed and will continue 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.310
 acting is not yet known the state 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.740
 of the reactor cores and a lot 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.080
 minus the current consequences and 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.200
 future of the disaster on the territory 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.360
 insular and on the pacific the first 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.610
 studies on mutations were made 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.650
 about species whose generations 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.190
 They renew much faster than 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.190
 of mammals 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.539
 the first mutant species emerged in 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.889
 fukushima is a butterfly the 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.780
 scientists have found three 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.699
 generations of this animal with strong 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.050
 changes in its morphology by the 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.370
 radiation from the disaster of the plant 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:47.169
 nuclear in a second investigation 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.720
 They collected 238 copies in 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.849
 September 2011 they had 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.590
 even more pronounced mutations on 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.759
 everything in the wings and eyes that in the 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.759
 previous studies 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.270
 the radionuclides were still 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.340
 affecting the development of the evils 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.969
 even after the radiation of the 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.969
 minguera 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:11.709
 because I'm looking to solve your demands for 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:14.229
 energy with a system that can 

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:15.999
 produce such frightening effects is that 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.639
 as explained in other videos of this 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:21.549
 channel the atomic energy did not arise 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.860
 looking for human welfare for the 

00:05:21.549 --> 00:05:26.309
 the opposite was a by-product of 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.249
 development of a form of destruction 

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:34.709
 human the atomic bomb we remember it in 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:34.709
 the second part of this report 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.530
 how those problems started fission 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.410
 nuclear was developed so that its 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.600
 consequences were uncontrollable what 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.880
 they were in hiroshima and they still are 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.100
 in the world when you use central 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.500
 fission electric waste 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.780
 manufacture of the first pumps and 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:12.060
 first plants are still poorly saved 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:14.639
 in hanford state of washington usa 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.220
 not only there in the whole world are they followed 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:19.230
 accumulating radioactive waste is 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:24.330
 they are still looking for solutions for their 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:26.879
 final destination since 1951 or earlier 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.560
 as it was said nuclear fission was 

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:32.550
 developed so that its consequences 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.939
 were uncontrollable in practice what 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:38.849
 they are still in applications 

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:41.430
 peaceful not only the massive doses of 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:44.280
 radiation are harmful too what 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.750
 are the low doses of waste per 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.240
 spills 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.580
 a nuclear fission plant with 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.250
 perfect security would have a cost 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.350
 infinite is regrettable that not yet 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.260
 have developed the power stations 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:01.390
 nuclear fusion there is a possible 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.090
 explanation a fission power plant 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.740
 nuclear is not a nuclear bomb but its 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.520
 technology can have applications 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:12.250
 military a fusion power station and pod o 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.320
 Camac is not a nuclear bomb and 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.930
 unlike those of fission its 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:20.350
 technology can not be used for purposes 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:22.780
 war experts suggest that that's why 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:25.480
 have developed despite the fact that their 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:29.140
 pollution rates would be much 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:31.360
 less fortunately the energies 

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.920
 renewables are being imposed on the 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.890
 market in its own right 

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:41.050
 that way humanity will not need 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:41.050
 keep playing with the uncontrollable
