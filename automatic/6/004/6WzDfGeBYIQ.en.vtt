single door to match the description but
then<00:02:52.980> another<00:02:53.250> thought<00:02:53.519> occurred<00:02:53.849> to<00:02:53.879> me<00:02:54.090> what

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
then another thought occurred to me what

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.929 
then another thought occurred to me what
if<00:02:54.750> Andy's<00:02:55.530> door<00:02:55.799> has<00:02:56.129> already<00:02:56.699> been

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939 
if Andy's door has already been

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.000 
if Andy's door has already been
destroyed<00:02:57.449> I<00:02:57.719> mean<00:02:58.019> they<00:02:58.139> show<00:02:58.349> earlier<00:02:58.859> in

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
destroyed I mean they show earlier in

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.589 
destroyed I mean they show earlier in
the<00:02:59.099> movie<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.430> door<00:02:59.730> being<00:02:59.939> destroyed<00:03:00.269> because

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
the movie a door being destroyed because

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.149 
the movie a door being destroyed because
the<00:03:00.750> kid<00:03:00.959> wasn't<00:03:01.199> afraid<00:03:01.560> anymore

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
the kid wasn't afraid anymore

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.770 
the kid wasn't afraid anymore
he<00:03:02.310> said<00:03:02.579> in<00:03:02.699> a<00:03:02.819> mirror<00:03:03.060> about<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.359> same<00:03:03.540> age

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
he said in a mirror about the same age

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.479 
he said in a mirror about the same age
and<00:03:03.989> if<00:03:04.109> that<00:03:04.230> was<00:03:04.379> his<00:03:04.620> room<00:03:04.829> we<00:03:04.980> saw<00:03:05.129> earlier

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
and if that was his room we saw earlier

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.250 
and if that was his room we saw earlier
in<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.730> movie<00:03:06.030> then<00:03:06.269> we<00:03:06.689> know<00:03:06.840> they're<00:03:07.109> at

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
in the movie then we know they're at

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.809 
in the movie then we know they're at
about<00:03:07.409> the<00:03:07.769> age<00:03:07.799> where<00:03:08.189> they're<00:03:08.340> gonna<00:03:08.459> start

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
about the age where they're gonna start

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.699 
about the age where they're gonna start
outgrowing<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.540> monsters<00:03:09.989> I<00:03:10.199> mean<00:03:10.379> they're

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
outgrowing the monsters I mean they're

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.949 
outgrowing the monsters I mean they're
already<00:03:11.010> much<00:03:11.459> older<00:03:11.909> than<00:03:12.060> Boo<00:03:12.359> is<00:03:12.599> in<00:03:12.870> the

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
already much older than Boo is in the

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.780 
already much older than Boo is in the
movie<00:03:13.230> anyway<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.799> plus<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.250> have<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.579> think

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
movie anyway and plus you have to think

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.030 
movie anyway and plus you have to think
that<00:03:14.939> Andy<00:03:15.419> is<00:03:15.569> definitely<00:03:16.169> way<00:03:16.379> braver<00:03:16.769> than

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
that Andy is definitely way braver than

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.089 
that Andy is definitely way braver than
Sid<00:03:17.400> right<00:03:17.759> but<00:03:18.449> still<00:03:18.930> well<00:03:19.680> there<00:03:19.799> was<00:03:19.919> a<00:03:19.949> way

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
Sid right but still well there was a way

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.460 
Sid right but still well there was a way
