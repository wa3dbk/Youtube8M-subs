added texture to go to go with the

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.800

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
and that's kind of reminds me of the

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.240 
and that's kind of reminds me of the
Olympic<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:20.359> Olympic<00:04:20.870> Stadium<00:04:21.410> that<00:04:22.070> they

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
Olympic the Olympic Stadium that they

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.620 
Olympic the Olympic Stadium that they
built<00:04:22.520> in<00:04:22.910> China<00:04:23.360> but<00:04:23.860> I'm<00:04:24.860> sure<00:04:25.190> it<00:04:25.550> has<00:04:25.820> some

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
built in China but I'm sure it has some

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.680 
built in China but I'm sure it has some
elements<00:04:27.110> of<00:04:27.199> that<00:04:27.410> but<00:04:28.389> more<00:04:29.389> than<00:04:29.449> anything

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
elements of that but more than anything

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.430 
elements of that but more than anything
it's<00:04:30.320> because<00:04:31.070> of<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:32.270> bamboo<00:04:32.840> theme<00:04:33.229> that

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
it's because of the bamboo theme that

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.529 
it's because of the bamboo theme that
they're<00:04:33.650> going<00:04:33.860> for<00:04:34.130> with<00:04:34.430> this<00:04:34.610> year<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:35.300> the

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
they're going for with this year and the

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.060 
they're going for with this year and the
reason<00:04:35.810> why<00:04:35.900> they're<00:04:36.050> going<00:04:36.229> with<00:04:36.350> ambu<00:04:36.680> once
