number<00:00:08.250> one<00:00:08.700> in<00:00:08.970> post<00:00:09.360> series<00:00:09.809> so<00:00:10.320> here<00:00:10.590> are

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
number one in post series so here are

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.709 
number one in post series so here are
some<00:00:10.860> examples<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.670> sketches<00:00:12.210> that<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.450> made

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
some examples of sketches that I made

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.839 
some examples of sketches that I made
using<00:00:13.019> these<00:00:13.349> posts<00:00:13.920> it's<00:00:14.219> really<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.700> know

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
using these posts it's really you know

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.180 
using these posts it's really you know
useful<00:00:15.240> one<00:00:15.719> not<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.289> difficult<00:00:16.500> for<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
useful one not that difficult for the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.720 
useful one not that difficult for the
beginning

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
beginning

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.760 
beginning
so<00:00:18.119> first<00:00:18.359> I'm<00:00:18.510> drawing<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.990> head<00:00:19.230> as<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.560> see

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
so first I'm drawing the head as you see

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.740 
so first I'm drawing the head as you see
it<00:00:19.859> slightly<00:00:20.100> bends<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.939> then<00:00:21.480> drawing

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
it slightly bends it and then drawing

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.439 
it slightly bends it and then drawing
the<00:00:21.990> neck<00:00:22.170> as<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.619> would<00:00:22.830> draw<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.279> like<00:00:23.490> with

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
the neck as you would draw it like with

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.339 
the neck as you would draw it like with
this<00:00:24.720> head<00:00:25.199> position<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.039> then<00:00:26.760> let's<00:00:27.090> make<00:00:27.300> a

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
this head position and then let's make a

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.420 
this head position and then let's make a
slope<00:00:28.349> lines<00:00:28.769> like<00:00:29.480> 25-30<00:00:30.480> degrees<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.430> I'm

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
slope lines like 25-30 degrees and I'm

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.520 
slope lines like 25-30 degrees and I'm
just<00:00:32.640> adjusting<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.450> central<00:00:33.840> line<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.110> your

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
just adjusting the central line of your

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.030 
just adjusting the central line of your
neck<00:00:34.559> turning<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.149> bit<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.110> left<00:00:37.140> if

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
neck turning it is a bit to the left if

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.790 
neck turning it is a bit to the left if
we<00:00:38.430> talk<00:00:38.760> about<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.329> view<00:00:39.510> from<00:00:39.719> camera<00:00:40.500> side

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
we talk about the view from camera side

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.209 
we talk about the view from camera side
and<00:00:41.480> from<00:00:42.480> these<00:00:42.719> points<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.410> new<00:00:43.680> points

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and from these points like new points

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.420 
and from these points like new points
sent<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.210> your<00:00:45.450> neck<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.930> chunk<00:00:46.530> shoulder

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
sent of your neck and chunk shoulder

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.360 
sent of your neck and chunk shoulder
that<00:00:47.640> line<00:00:47.910> I'm<00:00:48.180> counting<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.500> centimeters

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
that line I'm counting to centimeters

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.040 
that line I'm counting to centimeters
and<00:00:50.520> five<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.120> centimeters<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.870> five

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
and five to centimeters and five

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.069 
and five to centimeters and five
millimeters<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:53.460> total<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.270> lens<00:00:54.510> from

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
millimeters in total the lens from

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.840 
millimeters in total the lens from
shoulder<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.469> shoulder<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.980> five<00:00:56.399> centimeters

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
shoulder to shoulder is five centimeters

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.139 
shoulder to shoulder is five centimeters
and<00:00:57.360> then<00:00:57.840> I'm<00:00:58.050> counting<00:00:58.680> four<00:00:59.149> centimeters

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
and then I'm counting four centimeters

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.020 
and then I'm counting four centimeters
down<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.590> waist<00:01:01.829> line<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.399> I'm<00:01:02.850> making

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
down it's the waist line and I'm making

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.170 
down it's the waist line and I'm making
a<00:01:03.300> parallel<00:01:03.719> line<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.739> equal<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.880> two

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
a parallel line that is equal to two

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.890 
a parallel line that is equal to two
centimeters

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
centimeters

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.609 
centimeters
it's<00:01:07.530> your<00:01:07.860> waist<00:01:08.130> line<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.060> five<00:01:09.960> centimeters

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
it's your waist line so five centimeters

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.240 
it's your waist line so five centimeters
shoulders<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.380> two<00:01:13.380> centimeters<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.040> waist

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
shoulders and two centimeters the waist

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.370 
shoulders and two centimeters the waist
line<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.210> see<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> keep<00:01:15.990> these

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
line and as you see I keep these

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.730 
line and as you see I keep these
distance<00:01:17.479> just<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:18.840> repeat<00:01:19.140> what<00:01:19.350> I'm<00:01:19.439> doing

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
distance just just repeat what I'm doing

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.480 
distance just just repeat what I'm doing
right<00:01:19.860> now<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.369> then<00:01:21.119> I'm<00:01:21.299> just<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:23.460> know

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
right now and then I'm just you know

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.590 
right now and then I'm just you know
like<00:01:23.790> linking<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:25.380> arms<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.090> points<00:01:27.479> of

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
like linking the arms of the points of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.469 
like linking the arms of the points of
arms<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.710> waist<00:01:28.920> line<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.450> then<00:01:30.450> just

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
arms and the waist line and then just

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.249 
arms and the waist line and then just
let's<00:01:31.200> define<00:01:31.829> your<00:01:32.280> shoulder<00:01:32.880> part<00:01:36.259> one

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
let's define your shoulder part one

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.469 
let's define your shoulder part one
centimetre<00:01:37.829> lower<00:01:38.280> than<00:01:38.670> your<00:01:38.909> shoulder<00:01:39.299> line

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
centimetre lower than your shoulder line

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.920 
centimetre lower than your shoulder line
make<00:01:39.960> one<00:01:40.200> more<00:01:40.409> parallel<00:01:40.950> line<00:01:41.390> here<00:01:42.390> as<00:01:42.570> you

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
make one more parallel line here as you

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.560 
make one more parallel line here as you
see<00:01:43.229> when<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:44.070> draw<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:45.000> know<00:01:45.119> we<00:01:45.299> start

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
see when going to draw you know we start

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.600 
see when going to draw you know we start
the<00:01:45.659> armpit<00:01:46.140> part<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.890> basically<00:01:47.340> drawing

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
the armpit part and basically drawing

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.230 
the armpit part and basically drawing
the<00:01:47.909> chest<00:01:48.710> chest<00:01:49.710> part<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.610> now<00:01:50.790> I'm<00:01:51.000> drawing

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
the chest chest part so now I'm drawing

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.380 
the chest chest part so now I'm drawing
slightly<00:01:51.960> bigger<00:01:52.320> part<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:53.040> bigger<00:01:53.790> size<00:01:54.180> of

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
slightly bigger part a bigger size of

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.530 
slightly bigger part a bigger size of
the<00:01:54.570> breast<00:01:54.869> but<00:01:55.649> like<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.700> up<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.509> I

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
the breast but like it's up to you I

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.950 
the breast but like it's up to you I
will<00:01:57.990> draw<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.590> bit<00:01:58.860> smaller<00:01:59.159> ones

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
will draw like a bit smaller ones

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.980 
will draw like a bit smaller ones
we'll<00:02:00.140> erase<00:02:00.940> what<00:02:01.940> I'm<00:02:02.060> doing<00:02:02.330> right<00:02:02.510> now<00:02:02.570> but

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
we'll erase what I'm doing right now but

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:32.210 
we'll erase what I'm doing right now but
it's<00:02:03.560> up<00:02:03.740> to<00:02:03.770> use<00:02:04.040> just<00:02:04.369> as<00:02:04.610> one<00:02:05.390> of<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.690> option

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.100 

okay<00:02:33.220> so<00:02:33.280> let's<00:02:33.670> be<00:02:33.850> find<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.420> shape<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:34.840> your

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
okay so let's be find the shape of your

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.180

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.350 
curved inwards closer to your knees and
I'm<00:03:36.070> going<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.490> locate<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:37.000> here<00:03:37.030> knees

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
I'm going to locate it here knees

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.610 
I'm going to locate it here knees
slightly<00:03:37.720> differently<00:03:38.940> one<00:03:39.940> just<00:03:40.930> on<00:03:41.200> the

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
slightly differently one just on the

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.699 
slightly differently one just on the
second<00:03:41.980> line<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:42.430> one<00:03:43.330> almost<00:03:44.020> on<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.440> first

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
second line and one almost on the first

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.100 
second line and one almost on the first
line<00:03:44.950> so<00:03:45.370> I<00:03:45.670> would<00:03:46.120> close<00:03:46.330> it<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.660> each<00:03:46.780> other

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
line so I would close it to each other

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.220 
line so I would close it to each other
and<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:48.220> widest<00:03:48.580> part<00:03:48.790> of<00:03:48.970> your<00:03:49.030> hips<00:03:49.450> going

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
and the widest part of your hips going

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.170 
and the widest part of your hips going
to<00:03:50.440> be<00:03:50.620> just<00:03:51.070> slightly<00:03:51.280> lower<00:03:51.670> than<00:03:51.790> the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
to be just slightly lower than the

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.530 
to be just slightly lower than the
bottom<00:03:52.600> and<00:03:53.140> let's<00:03:54.070> shape<00:03:54.310> your<00:03:54.610> upper<00:03:55.150> legs

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
bottom and let's shape your upper legs

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.420 
bottom and let's shape your upper legs
just<00:03:56.110> follow<00:03:56.380> me

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.869 

okay<00:04:02.430> so<00:04:02.989> again<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.409> lower<00:04:04.590> part<00:04:04.980> lower<00:04:05.310> TBS

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
okay so again the lower part lower TBS

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.149 
okay so again the lower part lower TBS
let's<00:04:06.239> make<00:04:06.510> these<00:04:06.780> bones<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.409> bit<00:04:07.530> curved<00:04:07.890> so

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
let's make these bones a bit curved so

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.660 
let's make these bones a bit curved so
they<00:04:08.340> look<00:04:08.579> naturally<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.530> again<00:04:10.530> valence<00:04:11.430> is

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
they look naturally and again valence is

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.789 
they look naturally and again valence is
6<00:04:11.939> centimeters<00:04:12.480> from<00:04:12.689> your<00:04:12.989> knees<00:04:13.140> till<00:04:13.500> your

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
6 centimeters from your knees till your

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.270 
6 centimeters from your knees till your
ankles<00:04:14.340> just<00:04:15.019> follow<00:04:16.019> me<00:04:16.320> their<00:04:16.799> outer

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
ankles just follow me their outer

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.849 
ankles just follow me their outer
muscles<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.269> bit<00:04:18.329> more<00:04:18.750> curved<00:04:19.139> than<00:04:19.289> in<00:04:19.680> the

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
muscles a bit more curved than in the

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:36.790 
muscles a bit more curved than in the
muscles

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.890 

okay<00:04:37.800> so<00:04:37.860> when<00:04:38.310> we<00:04:38.340> draw<00:04:38.880> ankles<00:04:39.390> we<00:04:39.660> draw

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
okay so when we draw ankles we draw

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.750 
okay so when we draw ankles we draw
those<00:04:40.140> inner<00:04:40.530> bones<00:04:40.860> a<00:04:41.100> bit<00:04:41.250> higher<00:04:41.490> than

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
those inner bones a bit higher than

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.350 
those inner bones a bit higher than
outer<00:04:42.060> bones<00:04:42.420> and<00:04:42.810> when<00:04:43.710> we<00:04:43.890> draw<00:04:44.190> feet<00:04:44.820> in<00:04:45.120> the

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
outer bones and when we draw feet in the

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.480 
outer bones and when we draw feet in the
heels<00:04:45.630> as<00:04:45.990> you<00:04:46.050> see<00:04:46.350> that<00:04:46.590> in<00:04:46.830> a<00:04:46.860> line<00:04:47.130> that<00:04:47.340> I'm

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
heels as you see that in a line that I'm

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.120 
heels as you see that in a line that I'm
drawing<00:04:47.520> is<00:04:48.060> almost<00:04:48.960> parallel<00:04:49.290> to<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:49.890> ground

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
drawing is almost parallel to the ground

00:04:50.130 --> 00:05:00.920 
drawing is almost parallel to the ground
and<00:04:50.400> the<00:04:50.850> outer<00:04:51.090> one<00:04:51.600> is<00:04:51.900> slow

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.439 

okay<00:05:01.930> and<00:05:02.319> so<00:05:02.590> the<00:05:02.800> length<00:05:02.979> of<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.759> lower<00:05:04.180> part

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
okay and so the length of the lower part

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.300 
okay and so the length of the lower part
of<00:05:04.599> your<00:05:04.780> arm<00:05:04.990> that<00:05:05.440> we<00:05:05.620> are<00:05:05.680> facing<00:05:05.949> right<00:05:06.280> now

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
of your arm that we are facing right now

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.969 
of your arm that we are facing right now
is<00:05:06.759> as<00:05:07.180> like<00:05:07.960> from<00:05:08.229> the<00:05:08.349> waist<00:05:08.530> till<00:05:08.860> the

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
is as like from the waist till the

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.710 
is as like from the waist till the
middle<00:05:09.129> of<00:05:09.340> your<00:05:09.550> feet<00:05:09.759> that's<00:05:09.970> why<00:05:10.180> I<00:05:10.210> counted

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
middle of your feet that's why I counted

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.710 
middle of your feet that's why I counted
it<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:11.050> pay<00:05:11.800> attention<00:05:11.830> to<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:13.030> location<00:05:13.210> of

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
it and pay attention to the location of

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.010 
it and pay attention to the location of
the<00:05:13.780> elbow<00:05:14.530> right<00:05:14.949> now<00:05:15.129> like<00:05:15.460> at<00:05:15.940> your<00:05:16.659> chest

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
the elbow right now like at your chest

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.860 
the elbow right now like at your chest
line<00:05:17.289> and<00:05:18.180> so<00:05:19.979> the<00:05:20.979> length<00:05:21.190> of<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:21.729> arm<00:05:21.940> as<00:05:22.690> I

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
line and so the length of the arm as I

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.839 
line and so the length of the arm as I
said<00:05:23.110> it's<00:05:23.289> like<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:23.530> same<00:05:24.009> as<00:05:24.220> waist<00:05:24.550> line
