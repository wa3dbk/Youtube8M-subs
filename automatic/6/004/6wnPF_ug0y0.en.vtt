getting to the F sharp minor which is
the<00:00:41.450> next<00:00:41.720> chord<00:00:44.020> the<00:00:45.020> REE<00:00:45.110> kind<00:00:45.320> of<00:00:45.380> like

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
the next chord the REE kind of like

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.830 
the next chord the REE kind of like
starts<00:00:45.800> a<00:00:45.890> little<00:00:45.980> late<00:00:46.220> I<00:00:46.250> think<00:00:46.780> anyway<00:00:47.780> so

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
starts a little late I think anyway so

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
then we have the F sharp minor chord so

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.190 
then we have the F sharp minor chord so
it's<00:00:51.370> I'm<00:00:52.370> drinking<00:00:52.700> back<00:00:52.850> alone<00:00:53.330> in<00:00:53.510> my<00:00:53.629> local

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.530 

the<00:02:30.940> feeling<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.740> we're<00:02:32.740> moving<00:02:33.250> he<00:02:34.060> major

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
the feeling that we're moving he major

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:43.690 
the feeling that we're moving he major
so<00:02:35.880> for<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.030> first
