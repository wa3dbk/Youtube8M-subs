00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
so years ago we thought yogurt then we

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.260 
so years ago we thought yogurt then we
think<00:00:06.279> sauerkraut<00:00:07.279> we<00:00:07.609> think<00:00:07.850> about<00:00:07.970> these

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:08.270 
think sauerkraut we think about these

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.480 
think sauerkraut we think about these
foods<00:00:08.660> that<00:00:08.900> ferment<00:00:09.559> when<00:00:10.040> dealing<00:00:10.280> with

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
foods that ferment when dealing with

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.790 
foods that ferment when dealing with
fungus<00:00:11.030> or<00:00:11.179> a<00:00:11.210> Phase<00:00:11.480> one<00:00:11.510> diet<00:00:12.110> Kyle<00:00:12.500> drew

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:12.800 
fungus or a Phase one diet Kyle drew

fungus or a Phase one diet Kyle drew
joins<00:00:13.040> me<00:00:13.280> right<00:00:13.309> now<00:00:13.610> are<00:00:13.849> these<00:00:14.660> good<00:00:15.590> or<00:00:15.920> our

joins me right now are these good or our

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.220 
joins me right now are these good or our
fermented<00:00:16.939> foods<00:00:17.240> that<00:00:17.750> have<00:00:17.960> all<00:00:18.080> this

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
fermented foods that have all this

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.640 
fermented foods that have all this
bacteria<00:00:18.949> fermenting<00:00:19.869> good<00:00:20.869> for<00:00:21.109> us<00:00:21.199> bad<00:00:21.439> or

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
bacteria fermenting good for us bad or

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.980 
bacteria fermenting good for us bad or
good<00:00:21.770> oh<00:00:21.980> man<00:00:22.369> I<00:00:22.609> got<00:00:23.119> to<00:00:23.210> tell<00:00:23.390> you<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:23.750> whole

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
good oh man I got to tell you the whole

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.800 
good oh man I got to tell you the whole
issue<00:00:24.260> of<00:00:24.500> fermentation<00:00:25.460> is<00:00:25.820> such<00:00:26.510> a

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
issue of fermentation is such a

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.320 
issue of fermentation is such a
double-edged<00:00:27.710> sword<00:00:27.789> it's<00:00:28.789> a<00:00:28.970> little<00:00:29.210> bit

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
double-edged sword it's a little bit

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.089 
double-edged sword it's a little bit
like<00:00:29.539> the<00:00:29.689> issue<00:00:29.810> of<00:00:30.050> cortisol<00:00:30.619> you<00:00:31.010> know

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
like the issue of cortisol you know

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.799 
like the issue of cortisol you know
there's<00:00:31.310> all<00:00:31.460> these<00:00:31.580> books<00:00:31.849> on<00:00:32.029> cortisol<00:00:32.540> will

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
there's all these books on cortisol will

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.410 
there's all these books on cortisol will
make<00:00:32.989> you<00:00:33.140> fat<00:00:33.410> but<00:00:34.100> cortisol<00:00:34.640> is<00:00:34.850> necessary

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
make you fat but cortisol is necessary

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.150 
make you fat but cortisol is necessary
for<00:00:35.660> stress<00:00:35.960> and<00:00:36.200> and<00:00:36.350> so<00:00:36.649> it<00:00:36.800> becomes<00:00:37.040> this

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
for stress and and so it becomes this

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.650 
for stress and and so it becomes this
double-edged<00:00:37.670> thing<00:00:37.940> I<00:00:38.090> got<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:38.450> tell<00:00:38.600> you

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
double-edged thing I got to tell you

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.530 
double-edged thing I got to tell you
fermentation<00:00:39.500> is<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:40.460> exact<00:00:40.850> same<00:00:41.120> way<00:00:41.300> now

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
fermentation is the exact same way now

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.299 
fermentation is the exact same way now
when<00:00:41.690> we<00:00:41.809> think<00:00:41.989> of<00:00:42.140> fermentation<00:00:42.890> we<00:00:43.010> always

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
when we think of fermentation we always

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.610 
when we think of fermentation we always
immediately<00:00:43.760> think<00:00:44.000> of<00:00:44.090> beer<00:00:44.450> wine<00:00:44.809> alcohol

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
immediately think of beer wine alcohol

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.040 
immediately think of beer wine alcohol
yeah<00:00:46.070> well<00:00:46.760> what's<00:00:47.000> happening<00:00:47.510> well<00:00:47.719> you've

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
yeah well what's happening well you've

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.340 
yeah well what's happening well you've
got<00:00:48.350> molds<00:00:49.219> or<00:00:49.340> yeasts<00:00:49.879> that<00:00:50.750> are<00:00:50.989> put<00:00:51.230> in

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
got molds or yeasts that are put in

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.760 
got molds or yeasts that are put in
certain<00:00:51.710> conditions<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:52.520> that<00:00:52.700> they<00:00:52.879> excrete

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
certain conditions so that they excrete

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.660 
certain conditions so that they excrete
mycotoxins<00:00:54.770> and<00:00:54.949> in<00:00:55.039> that<00:00:55.219> case<00:00:55.399> the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
mycotoxins and in that case the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.840 
mycotoxins and in that case the
mycotoxin<00:00:55.879> they<00:00:56.690> excrete<00:00:57.079> is<00:00:57.350> alcohol<00:00:58.160> there

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
mycotoxin they excrete is alcohol there

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.459 
mycotoxin they excrete is alcohol there
are<00:00:59.000> other<00:00:59.149> mycotoxins<00:01:00.020> that<00:01:00.140> they<00:01:00.289> can

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
are other mycotoxins that they can

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.110 
are other mycotoxins that they can
excrete<00:01:00.920> it<00:01:00.949> when<00:01:01.129> you're<00:01:01.250> saying<00:01:01.489> mycotoxin

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
excrete it when you're saying mycotoxin

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.869 
excrete it when you're saying mycotoxin
fungal<00:01:02.510> poor<00:01:02.660> uncle<00:01:02.989> poisons<00:01:03.590> yes<00:01:03.920> alcohol<00:01:04.610> is

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
fungal poor uncle poisons yes alcohol is

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.990 
fungal poor uncle poisons yes alcohol is
a<00:01:04.960> fungal<00:01:05.960> poison<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:06.860> be<00:01:06.979> technical<00:01:07.520> about<00:01:07.640> it

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
a fungal poison to be technical about it

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.469 
a fungal poison to be technical about it
and<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:09.080> if<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:10.280> do<00:01:10.460> this<00:01:10.670> with<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.240> same

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
and so if you do this with the same

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.810 
and so if you do this with the same
process<00:01:11.960> with<00:01:12.110> bacteria<00:01:12.740> they<00:01:13.369> tend<00:01:13.729> to

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
process with bacteria they tend to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.020 
process with bacteria they tend to
produce<00:01:13.970> not<00:01:14.510> alcohol<00:01:15.080> but<00:01:15.260> acids<00:01:16.030> lactic

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
produce not alcohol but acids lactic

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.719 
produce not alcohol but acids lactic
acid<00:01:17.540> sometimes<00:01:18.140> malic<00:01:18.710> acid<00:01:19.100> sometimes<00:01:19.310> good

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
acid sometimes malic acid sometimes good

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.149 
acid sometimes malic acid sometimes good
ones<00:01:19.939> so<00:01:20.150> you've<00:01:20.600> got<00:01:20.840> these<00:01:21.020> good<00:01:21.470> guys<00:01:21.740> bad

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
ones so you've got these good guys bad

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.120 
ones so you've got these good guys bad
guys<00:01:22.220> you've<00:01:22.909> got<00:01:23.119> good<00:01:23.479> acids<00:01:24.409> and<00:01:24.590> organic

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
guys you've got good acids and organic

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.940 
guys you've got good acids and organic
compounds<00:01:26.030> you've<00:01:26.360> got<00:01:26.630> bad<00:01:26.900> ones<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:27.409> so

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
compounds you've got bad ones and so

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.700 
compounds you've got bad ones and so
it's<00:01:28.340> hard<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:28.909> wade<00:01:29.330> through<00:01:29.360> all<00:01:30.140> of<00:01:30.170> this<00:01:30.439> so

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
it's hard to wade through all of this so

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.530 
it's hard to wade through all of this so
let<00:01:31.100> me<00:01:31.189> give<00:01:31.340> you<00:01:31.460> one<00:01:31.670> good<00:01:31.880> side<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:32.360> let<00:01:32.479> me

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
let me give you one good side and let me

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.510 
let me give you one good side and let me
give<00:01:32.689> you<00:01:32.810> one<00:01:32.960> bad<00:01:33.170> side<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.979> good<00:01:34.159> side<00:01:34.369> is

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
give you one bad side the good side is

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.039 
give you one bad side the good side is
exactly<00:01:34.909> what<00:01:35.119> Doug<00:01:35.329> talked<00:01:35.570> about<00:01:35.869> the

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
exactly what Doug talked about the

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.590 
exactly what Doug talked about the
yogurts<00:01:36.530> I'm<00:01:36.829> telling<00:01:37.640> you<00:01:37.790> if<00:01:38.000> you<00:01:38.360> have

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
yogurts I'm telling you if you have

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.359 
yogurts I'm telling you if you have
never<00:01:38.869> had<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.320> opportunity<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:40.220> have

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
never had the opportunity to have

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.480 
never had the opportunity to have
farm-fresh<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.840> I<00:01:42.470> guess<00:01:42.770> fresh<00:01:43.070> isn't<00:01:43.430> the

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
farm-fresh and I guess fresh isn't the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.950 
farm-fresh and I guess fresh isn't the
right<00:01:43.610> word<00:01:43.790> with<00:01:44.030> yogurt<00:01:44.390> because<00:01:44.509> it<00:01:44.780> needs

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
right word with yogurt because it needs

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.350 
right word with yogurt because it needs
some<00:01:45.229> time<00:01:45.470> but<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.460> take<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:46.939> straight<00:01:47.119> from

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
some time but you take it straight from

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.210 
some time but you take it straight from
the<00:01:47.479> far<00:01:47.720> grass-fed<00:01:48.350> antibiotic<00:01:49.009> free

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
the far grass-fed antibiotic free

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.760 
the far grass-fed antibiotic free
hormone<00:01:49.610> free<00:01:49.850> cow<00:01:50.119> go<00:01:50.600> milk<00:01:50.869> go<00:01:51.290> to<00:01:51.590> all<00:01:51.740> my

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
hormone free cow go milk go to all my

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
hormone free cow go milk go to all my
land<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.549> then<00:01:53.240> added<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.049> it<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.790> various

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
land and then added to it a various
