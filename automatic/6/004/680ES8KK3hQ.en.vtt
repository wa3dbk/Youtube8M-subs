the<00:04:44.270> first<00:04:44.540> time<00:04:44.750> I<00:04:44.780> ever<00:04:45.020> made<00:04:45.290> it<00:04:45.500> I<00:04:45.530> had<00:04:45.830> I

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
the first time I ever made it I had I

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.390 
the first time I ever made it I had I
really<00:04:47.540> wanted<00:04:47.900> to<00:04:47.960> add<00:04:48.200> more<00:04:48.500> milk<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:49.010> I<00:04:49.160> did
