00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.240 
I'm saying so it's a big cycle I think
everybody<00:06:14.380> should<00:06:14.410> try<00:06:14.560> to<00:06:14.740> take<00:06:15.099> that

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
everybody should try to take that

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.560 
everybody should try to take that
approach<00:06:15.490> instead<00:06:16.000> of<00:06:16.120> just<00:06:16.270> copping

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
approach instead of just copping

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.080 
approach instead of just copping
everything<00:06:17.169> and<00:06:18.039> stocking<00:06:18.460> up<00:06:18.550> like<00:06:18.880> oh

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
everything and stocking up like oh

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.960 
everything and stocking up like oh
they're<00:06:19.930> gonna<00:06:20.050> take<00:06:20.320> a<00:06:20.349> different<00:06:20.680> approach

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
they're gonna take a different approach

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.520 
they're gonna take a different approach
so<00:06:21.970> I<00:06:22.000> hope<00:06:22.660> you<00:06:22.810> guys<00:06:22.930> enjoyed<00:06:23.289> the<00:06:23.380> video
