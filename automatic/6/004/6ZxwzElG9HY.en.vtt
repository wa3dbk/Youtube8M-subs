00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
the stream screen here now this could be

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.230 
the stream screen here now this could be
a<00:00:24.750> reflection<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.609> something<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> window

could be something else and I wanted to
videotape<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.270> myself<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.260> could<00:00:34.350> have

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
videotape it myself so that I could have

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.410 
videotape it myself so that I could have
documentation<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:36.780> my<00:00:36.930> own<00:00:36.980> records

be<00:02:39.769> like<00:02:39.800> a<00:02:39.980> spiritual<00:02:40.580> thing<00:02:41.110> but<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:43.190> could

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
be like a spiritual thing but that could

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.550 
be like a spiritual thing but that could
have<00:02:43.519> been<00:02:43.700> not<00:02:44.540> saying<00:02:44.840> that<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.350> is

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560
