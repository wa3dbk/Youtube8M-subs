00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.299 

hello<00:00:12.809> today<00:00:13.290> for<00:00:13.500> this<00:00:13.590> first<00:00:13.860> video<00:00:14.130> we're

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
hello today for this first video we're

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.310 
hello today for this first video we're
gonna<00:00:14.400> look<00:00:14.580> at<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.790> modes<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.300> I<00:00:16.080> try<00:00:16.260> to

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
gonna look at the modes and I try to

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.930 
gonna look at the modes and I try to
answer<00:00:16.500> one<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.860> the<00:00:16.950> questions<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.880> get

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
answer one of the questions that I get

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.540 
answer one of the questions that I get
asked<00:00:18.330> all<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.540> time<00:00:19.020> which<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.920> what<00:00:20.279> did<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
asked all the time which is what did the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.800 
asked all the time which is what did the
mode<00:00:20.670> sound<00:00:21.029> like<00:00:22.070> most<00:00:23.070> people<00:00:23.369> can<00:00:23.700> and<00:00:24.060> will

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
mode sound like most people can and will

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.569 
mode sound like most people can and will
learn<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.470> scales<00:00:25.770> of<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:25.980> most<00:00:26.250> so

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 
learn the scales of the most so

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.850 
learn the scales of the most so
basically<00:00:26.970> just<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> note<00:00:27.900> sequence<00:00:28.169> without

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
basically just the note sequence without

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.470 
basically just the note sequence without
you<00:00:29.489> know<00:00:29.610> major<00:00:29.759> problems

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
you know major problems

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.020 
you know major problems
the<00:00:30.720> thing<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.110> when<00:00:31.290> they<00:00:31.500> start<00:00:31.770> to<00:00:32.000> try<00:00:33.000> to

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
the thing is when they start to try to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.850 
the thing is when they start to try to
use<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.360> then<00:00:33.840> they<00:00:33.989> realize<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.560> they<00:00:34.710> don't

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
use it then they realize it they don't

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.500 
use it then they realize it they don't
really<00:00:34.980> know<00:00:35.190> what<00:00:35.430> kind<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.700> color<00:00:35.970> each<00:00:36.180> mode

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
really know what kind of color each mode

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.690 
really know what kind of color each mode
has<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.590> think<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.890> reason<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.489> is

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
has and I think the reason for that is

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.240 
has and I think the reason for that is
that<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:39.120> always<00:00:39.329> practice<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.899> scales<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:41.130> a

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
that we always practice the scales in a

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.130 
that we always practice the scales in a
vacuum<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.000> basically<00:00:42.360> what<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.630> do<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.810> just

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
vacuum so basically what we do is just

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.200 
vacuum so basically what we do is just
play<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.740> from<00:00:44.130> a<00:00:44.190> play<00:00:44.400> C<00:00:44.580> major<00:00:47.210> and

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
play like this from a play C major and

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.370 
play like this from a play C major and
we<00:00:48.330> learned<00:00:48.540> that<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.930> all<00:00:49.050> over<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
we learned that in all over the

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.810 
we learned that in all over the
fretboard<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.920> then<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.370> might<00:00:50.550> want<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
fretboard and then we might want to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.100 
fretboard and then we might want to
study<00:00:51.150> C<00:00:52.080> minor<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.630> keep<00:00:57.780> going

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
study C minor and and we just keep going

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.720 
study C minor and and we just keep going
like<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.290> and<00:00:58.470> the<00:00:58.680> problem<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.190> most<00:00:59.490> of

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
like that and the problem is most of

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.920 
like that and the problem is most of
these<00:00:59.820> modes<00:01:00.060> are<00:01:00.240> really<00:01:00.450> close<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.840> each

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
these modes are really close to each

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.980 
these modes are really close to each
other<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.650> example<00:01:02.010> take<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:03.600> Ionian

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:03.990 
other so for example take the Ionian

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.359 
other so for example take the Ionian
mode<00:01:04.019> which<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> major<00:01:04.680> scale<00:01:05.009> and<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
mode which is the major scale and the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.980 
mode which is the major scale and the
Lydian<00:01:05.729> mode<00:01:05.909> there's<00:01:06.329> only<00:01:06.479> one<00:01:06.750> note

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
Lydian mode there's only one note

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.719 
Lydian mode there's only one note
difference<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.610> play<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:08.850> this

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.130 

it's<00:01:14.360> not<00:01:14.539> that<00:01:14.659> big<00:01:14.780> of<00:01:14.899> a<00:01:14.990> difference

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
it's not that big of a difference

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.690 
it's not that big of a difference
because<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:15.860> have<00:01:15.979> nothing<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.280> compare<00:01:16.640> it

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
because you have nothing to compare it

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.760 
because you have nothing to compare it
to<00:01:16.909> I<00:01:17.119> mean<00:01:17.840> this<00:01:18.079> mode<00:01:20.200> it's<00:01:21.200> also<00:01:21.439> major

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
to I mean this mode it's also major

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.219 
to I mean this mode it's also major
scale<00:01:22.070> of<00:01:22.460> G<00:01:23.090> so<00:01:23.420> we're<00:01:23.570> never<00:01:23.659> going<00:01:23.899> to<00:01:23.990> that

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
scale of G so we're never going to that

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.800 
scale of G so we're never going to that
today<00:01:24.679> but<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.579> problem<00:01:26.060> with<00:01:26.240> this<00:01:26.390> is<00:01:26.659> that

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
today but the problem with this is that

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.569 
today but the problem with this is that
you<00:01:26.869> always<00:01:27.140> listen<00:01:27.439> to<00:01:27.649> the<00:01:27.829> modes<00:01:28.039> in<00:01:28.429> a

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
you always listen to the modes in a

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.069 
you always listen to the modes in a
vacuum<00:01:29.000> and<00:01:29.329> so<00:01:29.539> that<00:01:29.689> makes<00:01:29.840> it<00:01:29.990> very

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
vacuum and so that makes it very

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.440 
vacuum and so that makes it very
difficult<00:01:30.289> to<00:01:30.679> play<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.189> to<00:01:31.460> use<00:01:31.670> them<00:01:31.909> in<00:01:32.390> a

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
difficult to play and to use them in a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.749 
difficult to play and to use them in a
musical<00:01:33.350> manner<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.280> other<00:01:34.399> thing<00:01:34.640> we

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
musical manner and the other thing we

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.300 
musical manner and the other thing we
always<00:01:34.970> do<00:01:35.240> is<00:01:35.479> play<00:01:36.439> on<00:01:36.619> top<00:01:36.920> of<00:01:37.100> chord

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
always do is play on top of chord

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.459 
always do is play on top of chord
progressions<00:01:37.789> so<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.390> idea<00:01:38.810> is<00:01:38.960> that<00:01:38.990> you

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
progressions so the idea is that you

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.469 
progressions so the idea is that you
know<00:01:39.590> if<00:01:39.829> we<00:01:39.979> have<00:01:40.100> a<00:01:40.130> chord<00:01:40.460> then<00:01:41.149> we'll<00:01:41.299> know

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
know if we have a chord then we'll know

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.389 
know if we have a chord then we'll know
what<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.659> mode<00:01:41.869> sounds<00:01:42.259> like<00:01:42.409> well<00:01:42.979> you<00:01:43.189> will

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
what the mode sounds like well you will

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.609 
what the mode sounds like well you will
but<00:01:43.850> as<00:01:43.939> soon<00:01:44.119> as<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.329> chord<00:01:44.630> changes<00:01:44.869> the

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
but as soon as the chord changes the

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:46.809 
but as soon as the chord changes the
relationship<00:01:46.099> between<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.429> scale<00:01:46.670> you're

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
relationship between the scale you're

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.630 
relationship between the scale you're
using<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.750> chord<00:01:48.369> switches<00:01:49.369> you<00:01:49.549> know

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
using and the chord switches you know

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.219 
using and the chord switches you know
changes<00:01:50.000> everything<00:01:50.299> over<00:01:50.509> so<00:01:50.720> maybe<00:01:51.080> the

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
changes everything over so maybe the

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.289 
changes everything over so maybe the
mode<00:01:51.380> you're<00:01:51.560> using<00:01:51.740> now<00:01:51.979> over<00:01:52.310> C<00:01:52.579> is<00:01:53.060> not

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
mode you're using now over C is not

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.480 
mode you're using now over C is not
going<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.569> be<00:01:53.689> that<00:01:53.899> mode<00:01:54.110> over<00:01:54.530> F<00:01:54.709> or<00:01:55.009> G<00:01:55.280> or<00:01:55.459> a

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
going to be that mode over F or G or a

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.850 
going to be that mode over F or G or a
minor<00:01:55.819> or<00:01:56.090> whatever<00:01:56.349> okay<00:01:57.349> so<00:01:57.409> what<00:01:57.770> we're

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
minor or whatever okay so what we're

like<00:03:14.209> that<00:03:14.389> for<00:03:14.689> a<00:03:14.719> long<00:03:14.870> time<00:03:15.139> the<00:03:15.859> idea<00:03:16.069> is

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:16.219 
like that for a long time the idea is

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.009 
like that for a long time the idea is
you<00:03:16.340> only<00:03:16.459> get<00:03:16.669> one<00:03:16.939> note<00:03:17.209> even<00:03:17.629> get<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.870> whole

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
you only get one note even get the whole

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.020 
you only get one note even get the whole
chord<00:03:18.409> and<00:03:18.650> even<00:03:18.829> change<00:03:19.129> chords<00:03:19.549> so<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:19.819> just

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
chord and even change chords so you just

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.699 
chord and even change chords so you just
keep<00:03:20.209> this<00:03:20.419> one<00:03:20.659> note<00:03:20.870> I<00:03:21.109> know<00:03:21.349> you<00:03:21.500> have<00:03:21.620> this

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
just play all these scales and rocks

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:38.500 
just play all these scales and rocks
that's<00:03:37.579> what<00:03:37.730> they<00:03:37.790> call<00:03:37.939> this<00:03:38.030> anyway<00:03:38.359> check

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
that's what they call this anyway check

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:46.119 
that's what they call this anyway check
it<00:03:38.629> out<00:03:38.750> so<00:03:39.290> I'm<00:03:39.500> gonna<00:03:39.590> play<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:40.329> C<00:03:45.129> alright

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
it out so I'm gonna play the C alright

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.270 
it out so I'm gonna play the C alright
and<00:03:46.790> now<00:03:46.909> you'll<00:03:47.060> hear<00:03:47.359> how<00:03:48.079> apparent<00:03:48.799> the

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
and now you'll hear how apparent the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.179 
and now you'll hear how apparent the
modes<00:03:49.489> become<00:03:49.939> so<00:03:50.479> this<00:03:50.599> is<00:03:50.720> major<00:03:50.959> scale<00:03:51.319> or<00:03:51.530> a

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:52.189 
modes become so this is major scale or a

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:58.650 
modes become so this is major scale or a
union

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.920 

and<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:01.190> this<00:04:01.310> is<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.550> leading<00:04:01.790> sphere<00:04:02.210> only

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
and and this is the leading sphere only

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:12.660 
and and this is the leading sphere only
one<00:04:03.110> note<00:04:03.350> difference

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.680 

so<00:04:13.670> it's<00:04:13.820> much<00:04:13.970> easier<00:04:14.300> to<00:04:14.360> hear<00:04:14.600> the

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
so it's much easier to hear the

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.970 
so it's much easier to hear the
difference<00:04:15.080> now<00:04:15.200> because<00:04:15.410> we're<00:04:15.650> comparing

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
difference now because we're comparing

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.190 
difference now because we're comparing
it<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.430> root<00:04:16.640> so<00:04:17.180> C<00:04:17.480> is<00:04:17.600> always<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:17.989> root

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
it to the root so C is always the root

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.020 
it to the root so C is always the root
and<00:04:18.800> we<00:04:18.860> don't<00:04:19.070> fall<00:04:19.190> in<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.310> trap<00:04:19.489> of<00:04:19.760> just

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
and we don't fall in the trap of just

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.450 
and we don't fall in the trap of just
playing<00:04:20.510> different<00:04:20.989> major<00:04:21.140> scales<00:04:21.470> right<00:04:22.250> so

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
playing different major scales right so

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.070 
playing different major scales right so
what<00:04:22.610> I<00:04:22.640> want<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:22.910> do<00:04:23.030> is<00:04:23.180> first<00:04:23.450> off<00:04:23.690> just

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
what I want to do is first off just

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.770 
what I want to do is first off just
start<00:04:24.350> with<00:04:24.470> one<00:04:24.590> octave<00:04:24.980> and<00:04:25.490> improvise<00:04:26.210> so

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
start with one octave and improvise so

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.780 
start with one octave and improvise so
picking<00:04:27.110> out<00:04:27.350> to<00:04:27.650> come<00:04:27.800> over<00:04:27.950> and<00:04:28.190> listen

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
picking out to come over and listen

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:48.340 
picking out to come over and listen
Lydian<00:04:29.270> a<00:04:29.360> will<00:04:29.480> display<00:04:29.750> on<00:04:30.110> top<00:04:30.230> of<00:04:30.350> that

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.870 

all<00:04:48.860> right<00:04:48.980> never<00:04:49.190> get<00:04:49.340> out<00:04:49.430> of<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:49.580> out<00:04:49.700> there

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880

really feel the mode and then once you
get<00:05:45.259> that<00:05:45.320> level<00:05:45.740> then<00:05:46.039> it<00:05:46.400> will<00:05:46.520> be<00:05:46.580> much

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:46.729
