00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.799
 How was reach action? 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.510
 Such a picture is unavoidably for people who like pachinko 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.510
 work I will work 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.110
 But was delayed My name My name is Nagao I Pachipuro 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:45.300
 It is sudden 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:49.060
 People who hit pachinko with pachinko lost 2000 yen on average for one hour 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:54.720
 How do you feel if you ask 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:02:01.540
 This is a factual figure based on certain statistical data 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:03.980
 If you hit a pachinko for 50 hours a month , the money you get there is 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.830
 50,000 yen in January 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:12.329
 600,000 yen for one year 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:18.740
 If it becomes a period of 10 years, it is really 6 million yen 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:20.069
 It will be that a lot of money is lost in pachinko 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.670
 vice versa 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.670
 What if you could win 1000 yen in one hour ? 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.790
 The difference is actually 22 million yen because the loss is changed to winning 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:42.420
 It is about 3,000 yen per hour when I convert myself now 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:49.190
 I earn by pachinko 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:51.220
 What if it won't lose to pachinko even if it doesn't go to here ? 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.920
 For example so it does not decrease money 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.760
 You can say to your favorite pachinko 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:03.540
 Rather if you can win 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:07.100
 For example, favorite hobbies and sake with that money 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:13.390
 And to fashion or family 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.390
 I can spend money like that 8 like that 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.340
 From pachinko as entertainment Rie Keio Ri influence 6 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.340

 I will celebrate the 10th anniversary of my birth as a pachi pro . 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:37.540

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:43.000
