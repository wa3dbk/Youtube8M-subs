00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.070
 Lunging belongs especially in the 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.320
 training of young horses to the building 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.630
 Musculature for a better balance 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.460
 of the horse but also about the handling 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.890
 between human and horse to improve 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.010
 be young horses in their education 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.730
 lunged regularly 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.100
 horse manager vera long 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.220
 time you and the horse on the 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.199
 work on the longe prepared as 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.900
 Document for the long-suffering I take myself 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:38.019
 I like a saddle padding then 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.080
 on the outside fold as and 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:44.199
 padding for the giro so that the 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.549
 Front opening is these steps to the 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.049
 actually to the mooring on the saddle 

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:49.330
 thought to disappear underneath 

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:52.330
 let the wage good is not so far 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.400
 in front like the saddle but still 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.989
 much further behind the shoulder 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.420
 but usually it almost slips off 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.220
 alone in the right position 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.680
 I really love a horse or a dog 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.540
 I would always slip forward 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.150
 the longiert a saddle 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.240
 because of the very good, so better 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.160
 where I once fixed the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.630
 stirrup off so that I am in the way 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.320
 and really this offer about it 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.320
 to lay 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.840
 these many years these many rings 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.480
 the page especially for a young horse 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.180
 These rings are generally too high for me 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.340
 there to train instructor 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.870
 I then strap the trainers around the trainers 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.760
 front group of this longtime 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.920
 on both sides 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.750
 so they are deeper just around the front 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.909
 so that they do not slip all the way down 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.280
 if you can see that after 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.650
 when shunting with run birds to 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.450
 example , then you can also the 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.210
 Upper rings use around the triangle 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.470
 These runaways vary too lucys 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.870
 equipment still belongs 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.520
 each one knits the legs investor 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.100
 front and back 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.140
 especially because they are all around now 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.780
 I also have horseshoes with her 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.340
 Still bells in the front in case of emergency ever 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.310
 After how the horses can move 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.230
 you even bark around at the back 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.550
 really every injury risk 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.550
 completely unnecessary to avoid 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.080
 my equipment is expressly owned 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.850
 also a few gloves 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.800
 even if you drive one good has it 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.480
 there can always be something that happens 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.580
 drives people really pulls times 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.980
 must hold on and that is without 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.170
 gloves not possible or very much 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.070
 moreover the spurs are painful 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.959
 cut off 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.340
 you move forwards and backwards 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.890
 then it could happen that one times 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.420
 Accident hazards stumble over the tracks 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.480
 which you should avoid in any case 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.150
 especially in very stormy horses 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.660
 Young horses, I like to put that 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.760
 halter over the border around the left 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.280
 hook in both where you are rain as 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.590
 also hook in the ring of the halter 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.390
 and so to prevent that the bit 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.640
 one-sided too strong from the horses wall 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.470
 In addition, young horses know that 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.230
 Bit not so good and you want 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.790
 do not over-regulate them with it 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.090
 how are the teeth even more something 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.209
 gentler experience and you hooked the long 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.330
 just below the instructor in 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.650
 the normal trensing ring 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.080
 would you with a Hanoverian reid l 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.000
 you could also lose this one 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.980
 ring from Hanover wright half to 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.350
 make use of and still with in 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.230
 to feed langhagen 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.970
 sometimes you see that the longs through 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.970
 pulled through the inner bit ring 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:33.049
 is guided over the neck and outside 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.360
 hooked perhaps in young stallions 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.610
 for example, which are still very impetuous 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.019
 where you really control up here too 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.530
 that's about the neck 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.610
 but a very sharp effect 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.650
 and does not belong in the hands of 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.900
 everybody has to be very careful with that 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.489
 be what you see when you think 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.230
 you would leave the horses with it outside 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.750
 possibly better limit by the 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.560
 inner bit ring in the outer 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.390
 bitten rain 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.060
 but that only works 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.670
 that the trensen penetrate pulled together 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.920
 the bitten will begin against the 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.770
 Lips to pinch for the horse rather 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.630
 unpleasant and not of use 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:12.620
 in the trade are also so-called long 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.330
 Ski goggles available the lead from 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.980
 inner to the outer bit ring and 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.299
 have a ring down in the middle for the 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.769
 a hook of the loge 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.859
 that's it, though 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.290
 Industry leader can not be horse 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.350
 emotional einzurammen and really well 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.640
 to work on creation and approval 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.030
 There is also the possibility that 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.880
 horse to engage with the cup fence 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.470
 he is going over the normal trense 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.940
 snowed 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.070
 you have to be in a very good fit 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.440
 make this cup to be in fabric and 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.720
 That's why it fits quite well already 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.930
 horse 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.910
 The loge will be in this ring 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.130
 hereof on the nose one strapped here 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.490
 the front is a steel handle incorporated 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.919
 So you really have influence over 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.570
 the nasal bone on the head of the horse 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.590
 and therefore also on the neck 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.300
 the instructor rein would be normal in the 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.030
 Bitten ringer to be strapped 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.610
 unlike the halter, this cup sits 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.110
 for really the head quite firmly the 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.060
 So should not be back and forth 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.280
 but really can move 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.380
 horse head are lying so that you too 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.090
 really has a real impact if 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.130
 the horse just before riding something 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.470
 You want to applaud everyone 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.560
 cases the stirrups secure for them 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.770
 do not slip down the horse then 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.300
 could be very irritating on the flanks 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.340
 The start flying especially if 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.240
 the horse gallops that one should 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.540
 do not risk it 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.370
 and so you can secure the stirrups 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.450
 even in the now urgent stirrups 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.520
 The horse could be in the worst 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:47.419
 trap case with the hind leg 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.950
 that would be very bad the rein secures 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.790
 but when you applaud, you will 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.620
 not extra either 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:57.970
 by putting them here under the 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.860
 horseradish turns around and then 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.920
 pervades the chin strap here and 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.690
 again, it closes the horse 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.330
 not over the top of your head 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:10.630
 you can slip or you put it behind 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.430
 The stirrups also then you can 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.210
 do not slip forward and on 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.760
 both sides 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.070
 So far , you really only use that 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.110
 to lunge the horse for a short while 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.580
 so it is in no way bound from 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.550
 but it really can only be one 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.640
 walk freely about despondent yourself 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.640
 become
