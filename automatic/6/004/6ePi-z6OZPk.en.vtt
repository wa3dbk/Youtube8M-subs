00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
the reason I did that is because if I

put<00:05:07.480> now<00:05:07.690> I<00:05:08.050> mean<00:05:08.290> you<00:05:08.380> could<00:05:08.590> put<00:05:08.860> black<00:05:09.280> into

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
put now I mean you could put black into

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.850 
put now I mean you could put black into
the<00:05:09.940> waterline<00:05:10.720> as<00:05:10.870> well<00:05:11.050> that's<00:05:11.500> really<00:05:11.650> good

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
the waterline as well that's really good

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.290 
the waterline as well that's really good
if<00:05:11.950> you<00:05:12.070> have<00:05:12.100> like<00:05:12.430> really<00:05:12.669> large<00:05:13.030> eyes

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
if you have like really large eyes

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.840
