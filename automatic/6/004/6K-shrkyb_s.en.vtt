session we're looking at the Mari spark
dive<00:00:08.530> computer<00:00:09.070> as<00:00:09.520> you<00:00:09.700> can<00:00:09.820> see<00:00:10.120> it<00:00:10.210> comes<00:00:10.360> in

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
dive computer as you can see it comes in

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.570 
dive computer as you can see it comes in
either<00:00:10.600> a<00:00:10.719> wrist<00:00:10.990> mounted<00:00:11.590> computer<00:00:12.070> or<00:00:12.549> a

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580 
either a wrist mounted computer or a

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.699 
either a wrist mounted computer or a
console<00:00:13.209> based<00:00:13.480> so<00:00:14.110> let's<00:00:14.260> take<00:00:14.379> a<00:00:14.410> look<00:00:14.590> at<00:00:14.680> a

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:14.709 
console based so let's take a look at a

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.029 
console based so let's take a look at a
few<00:00:14.799> of<00:00:14.889> its<00:00:14.949> features<00:00:16.619> okay<00:00:17.619> so<00:00:17.680> some<00:00:17.890> of<00:00:17.920> the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
few of its features okay so some of the

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.080 
few of its features okay so some of the
features<00:00:18.160> we've<00:00:18.520> got<00:00:18.670> included<00:00:18.940> on<00:00:19.000> the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
features we've got included on the

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.360 
features we've got included on the
computer<00:00:19.510> then<00:00:19.890> first<00:00:20.890> take<00:00:21.070> a<00:00:21.100> look<00:00:21.250> at<00:00:21.310> the

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:21.370 
computer then first take a look at the

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.850 
computer then first take a look at the
console<00:00:21.760> based<00:00:22.060> one<00:00:22.390> make<00:00:22.990> sure<00:00:23.020> your<00:00:23.260> sits<00:00:23.560> in

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
console based one make sure your sits in

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.920 
console based one make sure your sits in
the<00:00:24.100> console<00:00:24.640> get<00:00:25.180> the<00:00:25.270> added<00:00:25.480> benefit<00:00:25.900> of

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
the console get the added benefit of

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.090 
the console get the added benefit of
obviously<00:00:26.350> the<00:00:26.410> pressure<00:00:26.620> gauge<00:00:26.890> of<00:00:27.010> the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
obviously the pressure gauge of the

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.000 
obviously the pressure gauge of the
bottom<00:00:27.400> and<00:00:27.610> the<00:00:28.390> compass<00:00:28.810> at<00:00:28.990> the<00:00:29.080> top<00:00:29.350> to

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.779 
system makes it very easy to operate
especially<00:01:53.829> when<00:01:53.979> you're<00:01:54.130> underwater

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
especially when you're underwater

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.459 
especially when you're underwater
let's<00:01:55.630> I'll<00:01:55.749> take<00:01:55.899> a<00:01:55.929> look<00:01:56.049> at<00:01:56.169> the<00:01:56.229> menu

let's I'll take a look at the menu

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.519 
let's I'll take a look at the menu
system<00:01:56.619> itself<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.990> if<00:01:59.049> you<00:01:59.109> take<00:01:59.229> a<00:01:59.319> look<00:01:59.439> at

00:01:59.519 --> 00:01:59.529

system itself so if you take a look at
the<00:01:59.590> menu<00:01:59.829> system<00:02:00.009> on<00:02:00.279> the<00:02:00.369> computer<00:02:00.819> then<00:02:00.969> as

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
the menu system on the computer then as

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.029 
the menu system on the computer then as
we<00:02:01.659> said<00:02:01.810> before<00:02:01.959> it's<00:02:02.259> got<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:02.469> nice<00:02:02.739> large

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
we said before it's got a nice large

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.010 
we said before it's got a nice large
clear<00:02:03.489> display<00:02:03.909> makes<00:02:04.389> it<00:02:04.509> nice<00:02:04.659> and<00:02:04.689> easy<00:02:04.899> to

usually<00:02:07.810> does<00:02:07.989> have<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.229> scratch<00:02:09.190> guard<00:02:09.550> just

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
usually does have a scratch guard just

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.160 
usually does have a scratch guard just
place<00:02:10.149> it<00:02:10.179> over<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.569> front<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:10.899> there<00:02:10.989> just

place it over the front and there just

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.350 
place it over the front and there just
to<00:02:11.319> protect<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.220> screen<00:02:12.550> we<00:02:13.060> have<00:02:13.150> removed

to protect the screen we have removed

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.910 
to protect the screen we have removed
that<00:02:13.540> from<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.810> video<00:02:13.960> just<00:02:14.290> reduces<00:02:14.740> down

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
that from the video just reduces down

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.650 
that from the video just reduces down
any<00:02:15.070> glare

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
any glare

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.720

and<00:02:15.870> also<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.530> can<00:02:16.650> see<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.160> display<00:02:17.550> a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
and also so you can see the display a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.450 
and also so you can see the display a
little<00:02:18.000> more<00:02:18.150> clearly<00:02:19.250> also<00:02:20.250> as<00:02:20.340> you

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
little more clearly also as you

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.460 
little more clearly also as you
mentioned<00:02:20.550> before<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.360> single<00:02:22.170> buttoned

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
mentioned before is a single buttoned

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.100 
mentioned before is a single buttoned

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
whole process especially when you're

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.530 
whole process especially when you're
underwater<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.880> don't<00:02:27.060> have<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.270> worry<00:02:27.390> about

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
underwater you don't have to worry about

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.910 
underwater you don't have to worry about
too<00:02:27.690> many<00:02:27.840> buttons<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.620> can<00:02:28.650> literally

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
too many buttons you can literally

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.530 
too many buttons you can literally
scroll<00:02:29.310> through<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.640> menu<00:02:29.670> settings<00:02:30.300> and

scroll through the menu settings and

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.300 
scroll through the menu settings and
computer<00:02:31.350> functions<00:02:31.800> with<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.100> single

computer functions with this single

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.450 
computer functions with this single
button<00:02:32.990> so<00:02:33.990> let's<00:02:34.020> take<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.410> look<00:02:34.620> then<00:02:34.830> it's

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
button so let's take a look then it's

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.300 
button so let's take a look then it's
currently<00:02:35.790> sat<00:02:36.120> in<00:02:36.420> its<00:02:36.840> dive<00:02:37.080> mode<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.800> a

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
currently sat in its dive mode is a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.220 
currently sat in its dive mode is a
water<00:02:38.580> activating<00:02:39.150> computer<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:39.840> once<00:02:39.990> you<00:02:40.110> do

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
water activating computer so once you do

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.630 
water activating computer so once you do
enter<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.560> water<00:02:40.740> it<00:02:40.920> automatically<00:02:41.340> switch

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
enter the water it automatically switch

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.330 
enter the water it automatically switch
to<00:02:41.670> this<00:02:42.030> mode<00:02:42.530> isn't<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.620> surface<00:02:44.010> state<00:02:44.220> at

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
to this mode isn't it surface state at

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.830 
to this mode isn't it surface state at
the<00:02:44.430> moment<00:02:44.460> no<00:02:44.850> so<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:45.300> shows<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.630> it's

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
the moment no so it just shows you it's

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.380 
the moment no so it just shows you it's
setup<00:02:46.020> for<00:02:46.410> saltwater<00:02:46.890> diving<00:02:47.550> or<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:48.210> there's

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
setup for saltwater diving or so there's

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.880 
setup for saltwater diving or so there's
a<00:02:48.450> temperature<00:02:48.750> gauge<00:02:49.080> for<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.410> water<00:02:49.650> as

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
a temperature gauge for the water as

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.950 
a temperature gauge for the water as
well<00:02:50.070> obviously<00:02:51.000> doesn't<00:02:51.300> kick<00:02:51.450> in<00:02:51.600> until<00:02:51.750> you

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
well obviously doesn't kick in until you

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.130 
well obviously doesn't kick in until you
actually<00:02:52.320> get<00:02:52.470> into<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.830> water<00:02:52.860> itself<00:02:54.140> so

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
actually get into the water itself so

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.470 
actually get into the water itself so
that<00:02:55.230> simple<00:02:55.530> operation<00:02:56.070> of<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.910> menu<00:02:57.120> system

logbook I'm going to dive stored in this

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.190 
logbook I'm going to dive stored in this
particular<00:03:54.209> computer<00:03:54.540> at<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.780> moment<00:03:55.110> but

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
particular computer at the moment but

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.780 
particular computer at the moment but

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
so a really really simple computer to

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.729 
so a really really simple computer to
use<00:04:06.060> but<00:04:06.870> it's<00:04:06.959> got<00:04:07.080> all<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.290> bits<00:04:07.410> and<00:04:07.590> pieces

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
use but it's got all the bits and pieces

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.820 
use but it's got all the bits and pieces
in<00:04:07.890> there<00:04:08.130> you<00:04:08.220> need<00:04:08.340> for<00:04:08.550> the<00:04:08.610> dive<00:04:09.830> ideally

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
in there you need for the dive ideally

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.860 
in there you need for the dive ideally
aim<00:04:11.040> towards<00:04:11.520> recreational<00:04:12.150> divers<00:04:12.540> but<00:04:12.690> also

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
aim towards recreational divers but also

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.229 
aim towards recreational divers but also
make<00:04:13.110> a<00:04:13.140> great<00:04:13.350> backup<00:04:13.830> computer<00:04:14.340> is<00:04:14.880> really

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
make a great backup computer is really

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.870 
make a great backup computer is really
one<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.600> consider
