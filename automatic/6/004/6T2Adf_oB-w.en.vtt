nice<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> first<00:01:05.640> day<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.510> took<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:06.960> less

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
nice on the first day it took like less

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.230 
nice on the first day it took like less
than<00:01:07.409> an<00:01:07.560> hour<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> wax<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.430> pull<00:01:08.729> out<00:01:08.909> it

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
than an hour for the wax to pull out it

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.820 
than an hour for the wax to pull out it
took<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.570> 45<00:01:09.810> minutes<00:01:10.200> but<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.560> didn't

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
took like 45 minutes but that didn't

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.859 
took like 45 minutes but that didn't
even<00:01:10.890> matter<00:01:11.189> because<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:12.240> center<00:01:12.689> was

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
even matter because the center was

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.020 
even matter because the center was
amazing<00:01:13.470> before<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.040> wax<00:01:14.220> had<00:01:14.460> even<00:01:14.700> cooled

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
amazing before the wax had even cooled

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.749 
amazing before the wax had even cooled
and<00:01:15.930> usually<00:01:16.890> that's<00:01:17.070> not<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> case<00:01:17.490> usually

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
and usually that's not the case usually

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.880 
and usually that's not the case usually
like<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.750> wax<00:01:18.930> pools<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.560> then<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.740> could

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
like the wax pools and then you could

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.859 
like the wax pools and then you could
kind<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.250> smell<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.700> stronger<00:01:21.180> but<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.630> one

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
kind of smell it stronger but this one

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.870 
kind of smell it stronger but this one
it<00:01:22.140> was<00:01:22.380> strong<00:01:22.740> from<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> beginning<00:01:23.580> without

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
it was strong from the beginning without

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.810 
it was strong from the beginning without
the<00:01:24.060> wax<00:01:24.270> pool<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:25.830> an<00:01:25.950> even<00:01:26.189> lingered<00:01:26.490> after

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the wax pool and an even lingered after

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.039 
the wax pool and an even lingered after
I<00:01:26.850> blew<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.119> out<00:01:29.000> on<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.420> second<00:01:30.780> day<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
I blew it out on the second day the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.499 
I blew it out on the second day the
flames<00:01:31.439> were<00:01:31.740> really<00:01:32.280> really<00:01:32.490> high<00:01:32.970> they<00:01:33.299> got

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
flames were really really high they got

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.240 
flames were really really high they got
higher<00:01:33.750> than<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.110> first<00:01:34.350> day<00:01:34.590> they<00:01:35.189> were

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
higher than the first day they were

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.370 
higher than the first day they were
actually<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.729> high<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:35.939> they<00:01:36.210> were<00:01:36.380> smoking

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
actually so high that they were smoking

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.109 
actually so high that they were smoking
up<00:01:37.530> pretty<00:01:37.860> bad<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.520> like<00:01:38.670> they<00:01:38.850> are<00:01:38.939> right

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
up pretty bad just like they are right

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.109 
up pretty bad just like they are right
now<00:01:39.270> -<00:01:39.329> actually<00:01:40.369> it<00:01:41.369> was<00:01:41.430> bad<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> while

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
now - actually it was bad for a while

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.999 
now - actually it was bad for a while
but<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.420> kind<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.689> came<00:01:42.930> down<00:01:42.990> after<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.680> I

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
but it kind of came down after like I

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.410 
but it kind of came down after like I
think<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.340> was<00:01:44.430> after<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.850> second<00:01:45.180> hour<00:01:45.299> I

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
think it was after the second hour I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.420 
think it was after the second hour I
don't<00:01:45.570> remember<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.860> did<00:01:46.979> take<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> like<00:01:47.399> a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
don't remember but it did take a like a

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.450 
don't remember but it did take a like a
while<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.140> even<00:01:49.259> had<00:01:49.500> like<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.890> smush<00:01:50.310> room

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:45.919 
don't go and go buy it because it was

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.309 
don't go and go buy it because it was
really<00:03:46.250> good<00:03:46.549> at<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.819> beginning<00:03:47.269> and<00:03:48.169> I<00:03:48.230> don't

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
really good at the beginning and I don't

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.500 
really good at the beginning and I don't
know<00:03:48.470> if<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:48.650> can<00:03:48.829> tell<00:03:49.130> but<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:50.000> wicks<00:03:50.239> have

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
know if you can tell but the wicks have

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.150 
know if you can tell but the wicks have
turned<00:03:50.750> like<00:03:50.930> really<00:03:51.380> black<00:03:51.799> and<00:03:51.829> they've

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
turned like really black and they've

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.449 
turned like really black and they've
kind<00:03:52.400> of<00:03:52.579> bent<00:03:53.000> over<00:03:54.010> that's<00:03:55.010> how<00:03:55.160> they<00:03:55.310> were

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
kind of bent over that's how they were

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.520 
kind of bent over that's how they were
before<00:03:55.700> I<00:03:55.910> burned<00:03:56.239> it<00:03:56.389> today<00:03:56.690> too<00:03:56.750> so<00:03:57.200> that's

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
before I burned it today too so that's

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.030 
before I burned it today too so that's
why<00:03:57.739> today<00:03:58.700> I<00:03:58.849> snipped<00:03:59.329> my<00:03:59.510> well<00:04:00.470> I<00:04:00.530> cut<00:04:00.889> off<00:04:01.010> a

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
why today I snipped my well I cut off a

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.170 
why today I snipped my well I cut off a
little<00:04:01.280> bit<00:04:01.400> of<00:04:01.579> the<00:04:01.669> wicks

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
little bit of the wicks

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.900 
little bit of the wicks
I<00:04:02.209> don't<00:04:02.599> usually<00:04:02.720> trim<00:04:03.349> them<00:04:03.590> but<00:04:04.250> I<00:04:04.639> just

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
I don't usually trim them but I just

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.490 
I don't usually trim them but I just
take<00:04:05.030> off<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.329> mushroom<00:04:05.480> tops<00:04:05.870> but<00:04:06.109> today<00:04:06.410> I

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
take off the mushroom tops but today I

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.870 
take off the mushroom tops but today I
felt<00:04:06.739> like<00:04:06.950> I<00:04:07.069> had<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.280> because<00:04:07.639> they<00:04:07.760> were

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
felt like I had to because they were

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.229 
felt like I had to because they were
really<00:04:08.209> really<00:04:08.650> burnt<00:04:09.650> and<00:04:09.980> just<00:04:10.519> bent<00:04:11.000> over

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
really really burnt and just bent over

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.509 
really really burnt and just bent over
like<00:04:11.480> a<00:04:11.660> cane<00:04:12.049> and<00:04:12.410> I<00:04:12.500> thought<00:04:12.709> that<00:04:12.980> it<00:04:13.370> would

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
like a cane and I thought that it would

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.880 
like a cane and I thought that it would
have<00:04:13.610> burned<00:04:13.790> well<00:04:14.329> I<00:04:14.689> said<00:04:15.079> I<00:04:15.110> lighted<00:04:15.769> it

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890
