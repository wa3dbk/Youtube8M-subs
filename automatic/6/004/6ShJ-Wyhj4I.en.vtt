00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.480
 welcome to another video of 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.629
 me 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.800
 this time it's about bang matches 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:14.730
 I have three different ones 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:21.150
 here the from nico with the derived logo 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:23.789
 up here some funny rooster cockerel 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.340
 chicken on the pack with so 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.119
 Dancing somehow looks a bit 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.489
 funny on the back you can 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.360
 still here the old silver hut logo 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:42.030
 see and down here as well 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.010
 pyrotechnic silver hut so yes anyway 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.620
 an imported product here you can 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.379
 series manufacturer is ypsilanti and the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.370
 importer georg riss direction is coming 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.510
 not from germany 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.370
 yes, if you look in here 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.510
 is still in English morning do not 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.359
 track cd face logically because it stops 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.549
 hopefully popping down here 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.060
 a bond area the matches 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.510
 are wood shapes ultimately and painted 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.950
 and a red head and back here 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:20.040
 you see the sticking points 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:25.470
 Second, weko's with the old one 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.920
 away uran sign there is on the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.329
 back to the other languages ​​ultimately 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.880
 here are the other languages behind 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.590
 on it and still the gross weight 25 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.909
 gram 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.079
 actually down here, too 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.350
 the bam number is the p100 9 710 ignition 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.810
 and only in 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.939
 there is the same requirement as at 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.259
 that of niko and down here it is 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.700
 whole again in German before the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.009
 close the hatch and close the back 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.010
 you can see the 10 points again 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:08.740
 also wood colors and with red skirt 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:12.370
 and third, safir of close 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.330
 lay before striking so do not make 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.130
 that I am still more than unlikely 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.560
 and delivery to persons under 18 years 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:25.150
 allowed here also stands on the ground 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.590
 the 03 49 class 1 and if you are in rain 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.380
 looks then you see they are unfortunately 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.620
 pretty moldy I hope that 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.890
 work anyway and clearly not 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.360
 eyes can take the point to the rear 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.300
 you can hardly tell because it is 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.030
 painted stripe to black with yellow 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.330
 ribe head now you look again here 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.470
 short because of the wm number that must yes 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.580
 actually I have it on it too 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:56.410
 previously ignored this is the 00 08 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:01.420
 02 and the three I will film now and 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:05.070
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:10.360
 let 's go with the nico bang matches 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:12.780
 number one out and see what the sun 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.780
 klöckner 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.970
 in fact, there is a pinch 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.470
 pretty loud sugar we'll do it again 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.400
 a second because I believe that still 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.400
 not so good applies 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.420
 you really need it together properly 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:51.739
 Loudly look if w &amp; co's just as good 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.739
 So these are here with the lips 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.180
 not quite so loud for it burn place 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.180
 another of these, too 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:27.110
 So the nicos are definitely louder 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.310
 and third of safir ob 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.900
 The mold I take here 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.259
 where not so much worse 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.550
 it's their turn to see if they are that good too 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.550
 like the nico or avi divx 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:50.659
 or if that was already the bang I was 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:50.659
 I'm afraid I 'm still in the distance 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.120
 So the signal clearly on 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.470
 worst that's actually more 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.590
 normal match that a bit 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.650
 schnitzler so the nico are really 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.440
 good as bang matches because you have the 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.419
 you should take these ones 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.800
 others may already play that 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.669
 age a bit you know 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.340
 not exactly 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:22.610
 Definitely interesting funny 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.780
 small articles and yes many thanks for 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.780
 watch until next time
