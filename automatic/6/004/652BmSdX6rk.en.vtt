00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:15.319
 t 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.680
 welcome to the three city schools in this dvd 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.400
 let the Spanish basketball federation say let's share some of 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.570
 the fundamental aspects in the learning process of our sport in its 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.570
 earlier stage 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.390
 tragic in attack 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.140
 once the ball is received 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.540
 we must occupy a position that allows us to react as quickly as possible 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.629
 possible 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.780
 without losing stability 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.150
 this position should allow us 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
 maintain body balance 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.720
 move with speed 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.930
 have a vision of the game 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.080
 To see exactly what this position is, we must look at the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.590
 next image 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.590
 and that unemployed with the weight of the party 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
 knees bent 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
 Tilting in the hip 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.649
 Elbow separated from the body 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.730
 and active hands 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.730
 trunk slightly tilted forward 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
 erect head wide visual field 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.049
 triple threat position 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.979
 the triple threat position is the balanced position adopted by the 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:15.269
 player with ball 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.269
 and that allows you to perform all three actions 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:22.899
 move along 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.289
 happen 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:33.289
 Bogota 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:42.499
 we will call for the action that the player with the ball performs 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:43.600
 possible him 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.140
 to move from a dynamic action to another static one in maximum situation 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.539
 stealth 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:54.989
 It can be a time when you stand with both feet at the same time 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.989
 can be two times first it has been possible to meet 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.989
 the duo with the other 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:15.480
 so that 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.949
 recommend for research 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:22.379
 two-handed chest passes excellent for beginners for the ease of 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.379
 deceased gesture 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.289
 Two-handed chopped pass 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:37.749
 that allows players delight and got a better reception 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:40.749
 watching the ball arrive at a lower speed 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.919
 I passed two hands over the head 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.919
 a good way to solve the defensive pressure 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:56.900
 one-hand palaces 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.020
 for the most skilled is the best way to get around the arms of the defender 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.599
 achieving very precise passing angle 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.980
 the passage of vehicles is allowed to reach further reaching contact with 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.979
 comrades on the other side of the court 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.010
 hand-bazze 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.050
 a comfortable way to exchange the ball
