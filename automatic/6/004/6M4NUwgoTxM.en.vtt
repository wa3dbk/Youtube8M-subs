00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.029 
thing went up and grab the palm a bit
better<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.820> part<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.360> because<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.410> have<00:00:46.680> I

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
better this part of it because I have I

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.760 
better this part of it because I have I
have<00:00:47.640> bigger<00:00:47.879> hands<00:00:48.300> it'd<00:00:49.079> be<00:00:49.200> nicer<00:00:49.559> if<00:00:49.590> I

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
kind of hard to tell if this thing fits

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.860 
kind of hard to tell if this thing fits

military<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:11.030> you<00:01:12.030> know<00:01:12.119> something<00:01:12.420> that

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
military it's you know something that

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.609 
military it's you know something that
you're<00:01:12.600> going<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.750> use<00:01:12.990> or<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.320> know<00:01:13.470> you're

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
you're going to use or you know you're

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.410 
you're going to use or you know you're
going<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.830> use<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.070> when<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.250> go<00:01:14.369> up<00:01:14.490> um<00:01:15.299> I

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
going to use it when you go up um I

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.899 
going to use it when you go up um I
think<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.830> kind<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> middle<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.759> that

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
think it's kind of in the middle in that

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.280 
think it's kind of in the middle in that
category<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:20.189> feels<00:01:20.790> good<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.780> just

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
category so it feels good but it's just

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.230 
category so it feels good but it's just
a<00:01:22.470> little<00:01:22.770> small<00:01:23.159> for<00:01:24.290> a<00:01:25.880> service<00:01:26.880> plate<00:01:27.119> i

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
a little small for a service plate i

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.020 
a little small for a service plate i
guess<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.500> little<00:01:28.770> bit<00:01:28.890> big<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.460> acc

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
guess but a little bit big for a acc

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.210 
guess but a little bit big for a acc
blade<00:01:30.270> I've<00:01:30.780> carried<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.619> DC<00:01:31.920> before<00:01:32.040> I

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
more than aesthetic and it does it's a

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.719 
more than aesthetic and it does it's a
cool-looking<00:01:58.170> life<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.189> it<00:02:01.399> all<00:02:02.399> these

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729

little<00:02:03.060> grooves<00:02:03.540> here<00:02:03.689> they<00:02:04.110> they<00:02:04.500> really

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
little grooves here they they really

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.139

don't<00:02:05.070> serve<00:02:05.399> any<00:02:05.759> purpose

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
don't serve any purpose

but<00:02:08.149> they<00:02:08.630> they<00:02:08.959> they<00:02:09.259> look<00:02:09.740> cool<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.280> guess<00:02:10.490> you

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
but they they they look cool I guess you

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.160 
but they they they look cool I guess you
could<00:02:10.729> say<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.120> takes<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.510> little<00:02:11.840> bit<00:02:12.110> of

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
could say it takes a little bit of

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.880 
could say it takes a little bit of
weight<00:02:12.440> off<00:02:13.540> probably<00:02:14.540> not<00:02:14.720> very<00:02:15.080> much<00:02:15.620> or

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
weight off probably not very much or

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.790 
weight off probably not very much or
nothing<00:02:16.250> noticeable<00:02:16.580> on<00:02:16.850> a<00:02:16.970> scale<00:02:17.300> but<00:02:17.680> if<00:02:18.680> it

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
hand um yeah like I haven't tried that I

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.140 
hand um yeah like I haven't tried that I
am<00:03:59.060> it<00:03:59.450> probably<00:03:59.989> works<00:04:00.140> I've<00:04:00.530> seen<00:04:00.769> other

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
am it probably works I've seen other

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.660 
am it probably works I've seen other
devices<00:04:02.150> and<00:04:02.540> for<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.810> same<00:04:02.959> thing<00:04:03.170> that<00:04:03.319> look

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
devices and for the same thing that look

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.990 
devices and for the same thing that look
be<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:05.000> same<00:04:05.239> so<00:04:06.400> overall<00:04:07.400> I<00:04:07.430> think<00:04:07.579> this<00:04:07.819> is

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
be the same so overall I think this is

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.370 
be the same so overall I think this is
probably<00:04:08.180> a<00:04:08.390> good<00:04:08.450> knife<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:08.930> carry<00:04:09.170> in<00:04:09.350> your

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
probably a good knife to carry in your

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.410 
probably a good knife to carry in your
car<00:04:09.739> actually<00:04:10.010> you<00:04:10.700> got<00:04:10.819> the<00:04:10.940> window<00:04:11.209> breaker

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
car actually you got the window breaker

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.300 
car actually you got the window breaker
to<00:04:11.630> see<00:04:11.780> if<00:04:11.870> I'll<00:04:11.989> cutter<00:04:12.200> plus<00:04:12.500> this<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:13.040> nice

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
to see if I'll cutter plus this the nice

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.250 
to see if I'll cutter plus this the nice
part<00:04:13.670> for<00:04:13.880> cutting<00:04:14.209> stuff<00:04:14.450> say<00:04:14.750> it<00:04:14.810> gets<00:04:15.049> stuck

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
part for cutting stuff say it gets stuck

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.599 
part for cutting stuff say it gets stuck
in<00:04:15.320> the<00:04:15.500> winter<00:04:15.799> out<00:04:15.979> somewhere<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:16.549> you

in the winter out somewhere and you

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.460 
in the winter out somewhere and you
can't<00:04:16.820> get<00:04:16.940> help<00:04:17.209> you<00:04:17.900> know<00:04:17.989> you<00:04:18.079> can<00:04:18.260> cut<00:04:18.440> up

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
can't get help you know you can cut up

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.650 
can't get help you know you can cut up
some<00:04:18.680> food<00:04:18.919> cut<00:04:19.220> up<00:04:19.310> some<00:04:19.459> blankets

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
some food cut up some blankets

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.000 
some food cut up some blankets
where<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:20.810> get<00:04:20.959> stuck<00:04:21.200> underwater<00:04:21.470> you<00:04:21.860> can

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
where you get stuck underwater you can

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.310 
where you get stuck underwater you can
probably<00:04:22.220> break<00:04:22.610> your<00:04:22.820> window<00:04:23.450> open<00:04:23.810> or<00:04:24.170> your

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
probably break your window open or your

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.040 
probably break your window open or your
seatbelt<00:04:24.740> stuck<00:04:24.980> but<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.420> purpose<00:04:26.840> is<00:04:27.020> that

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
seatbelt stuck but the purpose is that

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.480 
seatbelt stuck but the purpose is that
you<00:04:27.260> could<00:04:27.410> use<00:04:27.440> this<00:04:27.680> thing<00:04:27.860> for<00:04:28.100> a<00:04:28.130> pretty

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
you could use this thing for a pretty

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.350 
you could use this thing for a pretty
endless<00:04:28.670> um<00:04:30.520> so<00:04:31.520> overall<00:04:31.820> I<00:04:31.910> think<00:04:32.060> it's<00:04:32.300> a

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
endless um so overall I think it's a

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.780 
endless um so overall I think it's a
pretty<00:04:32.480> good<00:04:32.600> knife<00:04:33.100> for<00:04:34.100> fifty<00:04:34.370> bucks<00:04:34.400> gotta

pretty good knife for fifty bucks gotta

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.570 
pretty good knife for fifty bucks gotta
