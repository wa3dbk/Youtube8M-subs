00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
got a different kind of a look when you

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.300 
got a different kind of a look when you
smudge<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.870> usually<00:03:19.470> what<00:03:19.800> I<00:03:19.830> do<00:03:19.980> out<00:03:20.280> of

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
smudge it and usually what I do out of

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.160 
smudge it and usually what I do out of
their<00:03:20.520> boundaries<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.360> I<00:03:21.480> smudge<00:03:22.050> everything

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
their boundaries and I smudge everything

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.740 
their boundaries and I smudge everything
to<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.530> q-tip<00:03:23.160> or<00:03:23.430> my<00:03:23.580> finger<00:03:23.940> just<00:03:23.970> like<00:03:24.480> a

to a q-tip or my finger just like a

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.670 
to a q-tip or my finger just like a
brush<00:03:26.600> so<00:03:27.600> then<00:03:27.840> I'm<00:03:28.020> going<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.260> take<00:03:28.500> my

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
and from that time you probably want to

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.050 
and from that time you probably want to
have<00:04:40.510> your<00:04:40.990> daytime<00:04:44.670> time<00:04:45.670> you<00:04:45.790> probably

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:56.400 
have your daytime time you probably
don't<00:04:46.240> need<00:04:52.980> so<00:04:54.510> this<00:04:55.510> is<00:04:55.720> look<00:04:55.960> for<00:04:56.260> nighttime

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
I'm doing my solo so that's also why I'm

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.740 
I'm doing my solo so that's also why I'm
using<00:05:01.540> more<00:05:01.840> blush<00:05:02.080> than<00:05:02.350> usual<00:05:03.060> so<00:05:04.060> now<00:05:04.270> I'm

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
using more blush than usual so now I'm

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.160 
using more blush than usual so now I'm
gonna<00:05:04.960> do<00:05:05.710> my<00:05:05.890> little<00:05:05.920> lips<00:05:07.860> I<00:05:09.870> like<00:05:10.870> use

gonna do my little lips I like use

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.770 
gonna do my little lips I like use
lipstick<00:05:11.860> brush<00:05:12.070> tip<00:05:12.520> to<00:05:13.060> make<00:05:13.240> them<00:05:13.480> like<00:05:13.630> a

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
lipstick brush tip to make them like a

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.370 
lipstick brush tip to make them like a
smoother

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
smoother

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.280 
smoother
this<00:05:14.740> is<00:05:16.620> amplified<00:05:18.510> and<00:05:19.510> it's<00:05:19.630> also<00:05:19.810> for<00:05:20.080> Mac

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
this is amplified and it's also for Mac

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:52.130 
this is amplified and it's also for Mac
so<00:05:21.510> it's<00:05:22.510> like<00:05:22.750> a<00:05:22.780> burgundy<00:05:23.110> color

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.040 

so<00:05:52.950> to<00:05:53.520> get<00:05:53.670> rid<00:05:53.910> of<00:05:53.940> some<00:05:54.180> mistakes<00:05:54.540> I<00:05:54.780> just

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
so to get rid of some mistakes I just

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.850 
so to get rid of some mistakes I just
like<00:05:55.230> to<00:05:55.440> take<00:05:55.590> my<00:05:55.800> finger<00:05:56.250> and<00:05:56.750> just<00:05:57.750> like<00:05:57.960> boy

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
like to take my finger and just like boy

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:06.190 
like to take my finger and just like boy
gram<00:05:59.190> enough<00:05:59.550> but<00:06:00.540> you<00:06:00.960> can<00:06:01.080> also<00:06:01.230> use<00:06:01.590> a<00:06:01.620> q-tip

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:12.160 

yes<00:06:07.200> so<00:06:07.640> that<00:06:08.640> is<00:06:08.970> the<00:06:09.330> end<00:06:09.570> of<00:06:09.900> that<00:06:10.140> look<00:06:10.890> and

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
yes so that is the end of that look and

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.920 
yes so that is the end of that look and
if<00:06:13.190> you<00:06:14.190> like<00:06:14.370> wearing<00:06:15.090> a<00:06:15.240> lot<00:06:15.300> of<00:06:15.420> makeup<00:06:15.750> for

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
if you like wearing a lot of makeup for

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.840 
if you like wearing a lot of makeup for
night<00:06:16.110> time<00:06:16.290> then<00:06:16.500> this<00:06:16.620> is<00:06:16.800> good<00:06:16.980> luck<00:06:17.190> but

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
night time then this is good luck but

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.550 
night time then this is good luck but
also<00:06:18.060> sometimes<00:06:18.750> you<00:06:18.930> may<00:06:19.050> think<00:06:19.350> like<00:06:19.530> a

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
also sometimes you may think like a

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.770 
also sometimes you may think like a
British<00:06:19.920> going<00:06:20.160> like<00:06:20.340> bowling<00:06:20.670> here<00:06:21.120> to<00:06:21.690> the

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
British going like bowling here to the

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.660 
British going like bowling here to the
movies<00:06:22.110> or<00:06:22.290> something<00:06:22.320> this<00:06:22.710> is<00:06:23.040> probably<00:06:23.520> to

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.670 
movies or something this is probably to

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.410 
movies or something this is probably to
let<00:06:23.910> me<00:06:24.030> quit<00:06:24.600> the<00:06:25.310> blush<00:06:26.310> and<00:06:26.520> lipstick<00:06:26.850> but

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:27.420 
let me quit the blush and lipstick but

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.380 
let me quit the blush and lipstick but
the<00:06:27.690> ice<00:06:27.870> cursor<00:06:28.290> or<00:06:28.500> granny<00:06:28.800> occasionally<00:06:29.610> so

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
the ice cursor or granny occasionally so

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.910 
the ice cursor or granny occasionally so
these<00:06:30.570> are<00:06:30.750> just<00:06:30.900> some<00:06:31.050> ideas<00:06:31.170> on<00:06:31.620> how<00:06:31.800> you<00:06:31.830> can

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:31.920 
these are just some ideas on how you can

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.470 
these are just some ideas on how you can
do<00:06:32.130> your<00:06:32.250> makeup<00:06:32.340> so<00:06:33.300> she<00:06:33.360> made<00:06:33.690> a<00:06:33.720> feast
