00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.549
 what kind of message exactly before eleven 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.010
 years on 31 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.930
 In 2004, the vampire danced the musical success 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.690
 by the director and Oscar winner 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.740

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.289
 Germany premiere 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.390
 reason enough in this place thousands 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.009
 performances later some guys 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.320

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.749

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.579
 thank 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:33.980

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.600
 have soulful musical experience 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.670

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.320
 absolute extra class to be spoken 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.960
 but what would a musical be without 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.210
 his great actors in stuttgart 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.699
 There are even two outstanding ones 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.190
 Count Krolock for one 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.219
 first cast jan ammann and 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.129
 kevin tarte alternately sits today 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.620

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.970
 nobody knew what a great success dance 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.700
 the vampires in germany ever will be 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.040

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.550
 the dance of the vampires such a 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.590
 got incredible success so 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.540
 We never really had anything at the time 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.620
 thought 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.290
 We knew that was a good one 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.470

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.620

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.140
 years that we home standing ovations 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.460
 after eleven years enthusiastic audience 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.550
 already for the first moments 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:43.340
 we feel these these these force these 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:46.520
 this excitement for it from the audience that 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.070
 none of us expected that and it did 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.820

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.830
