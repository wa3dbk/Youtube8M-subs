00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.080 
with the football ferns since the 2012
Olympics<00:00:44.680> I<00:00:47.070> kind<00:00:48.070> of<00:00:48.129> expected<00:00:48.670> us<00:00:48.790> to<00:00:48.820> be<00:00:49.059> a

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
Olympics I kind of expected us to be a

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.580 
Olympics I kind of expected us to be a
bit<00:00:49.330> rusty<00:00:49.690> last<00:00:49.930> week<00:00:50.110> because<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.410> team

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
bit rusty last week because the team

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.920 
bit rusty last week because the team
hasn't<00:00:50.770> been<00:00:51.010> together<00:00:51.190> for<00:00:51.610> some<00:00:51.760> time<00:00:51.790> so<00:00:52.600> I

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
hasn't been together for some time so I

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.140 
hasn't been together for some time so I
kind<00:00:53.739> of<00:00:53.830> expected<00:00:54.400> us<00:00:54.489> to<00:00:54.520> be<00:00:54.730> a<00:00:54.760> little<00:00:54.970> bit

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
kind of expected us to be a little bit

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.910 
kind of expected us to be a little bit
disjointed<00:00:55.360> and<00:00:55.840> I<00:00:55.960> think<00:00:56.170> we<00:00:56.290> we're<00:00:56.470> at<00:00:56.650> times

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
disjointed and I think we we're at times

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.760 
disjointed and I think we we're at times
during<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.580> game<00:00:57.730> but<00:00:58.360> there<00:00:58.510> was<00:00:58.630> also<00:00:58.810> some

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
during the game but there was also some

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.700 
during the game but there was also some
very<00:01:00.660> promising<00:01:01.660> things<00:01:02.079> in<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.380> sense<00:01:02.560> that

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
very promising things in the sense that

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.680 
very promising things in the sense that
we<00:01:02.920> still<00:01:03.190> kind<00:01:03.820> of<00:01:03.880> picked<00:01:04.059> up<00:01:04.210> from<00:01:04.360> where<00:01:04.570> we

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
we still kind of picked up from where we

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.190 
we still kind of picked up from where we
left<00:01:04.839> off<00:01:05.080> how<00:01:05.410> we<00:01:05.470> want<00:01:05.800> to<00:01:05.860> play<00:01:06.070> and<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.780> as

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
left off how we want to play and and as

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.389 
left off how we want to play and and as
ever<00:01:08.380> we<00:01:08.619> you<00:01:08.740> know<00:01:08.830> we<00:01:08.920> kept<00:01:09.100> a<00:01:09.190> clean<00:01:09.369> sheet

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
ever we you know we kept a clean sheet

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.790 
ever we you know we kept a clean sheet
which<00:01:10.030> is<00:01:10.149> really<00:01:10.420> important<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:10.899> and<00:01:11.500> we<00:01:11.649> won

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
which is really important and and we won

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.710 
which is really important and and we won
the<00:01:11.950> game<00:01:12.040> convincingly<00:01:12.700> in<00:01:13.119> the<00:01:13.300> end<00:01:13.450> so

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
the game convincingly in the end so

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.450 
the game convincingly in the end so
there<00:01:14.229> were<00:01:14.290> some<00:01:14.440> real<00:01:14.619> positives<00:01:15.220> at<00:01:15.369> the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
there were some real positives at the

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.760 
there were some real positives at the
game<00:01:15.670> but<00:01:16.330> at<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.479> same<00:01:16.630> time<00:01:16.930> I<00:01:17.290> have<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:17.740> be

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
game but at the same time I have to be

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.830 
game but at the same time I have to be
careful<00:01:18.250> that<00:01:18.280> year<00:01:18.700> you<00:01:18.880> realize<00:01:19.479> at<00:01:19.690> this

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
careful that year you realize at this

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.460 
careful that year you realize at this
stage<00:01:20.110> what<00:01:20.380> I<00:01:20.440> know<00:01:20.860> is<00:01:21.100> is<00:01:22.200> restarting<00:01:23.200> again

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
stage what I know is is restarting again

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.800 
stage what I know is is restarting again
if<00:01:23.800> you're<00:01:24.039> late<00:01:24.190> after<00:01:24.520> a<00:01:24.550> break<00:01:24.850> so<00:01:25.149> a<00:01:25.390> team

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
if you're late after a break so a team

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.210 
if you're late after a break so a team
is<00:01:25.899> always<00:01:26.080> a<00:01:26.200> little<00:01:26.350> bit<00:01:26.500> rusty<00:01:26.979> at<00:01:27.070> that

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
is always a little bit rusty at that

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.550 
is always a little bit rusty at that
time<00:01:27.490> um<00:01:27.970> you<00:01:28.300> know<00:01:28.420> I<00:01:28.450> think<00:01:28.539> that<00:01:29.320> was<00:01:29.470> the

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
time um you know I think that was the

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.780 
time um you know I think that was the
first<00:01:29.740> game<00:01:29.860> we've<00:01:30.010> had<00:01:30.159> as<00:01:30.280> a<00:01:30.310> team<00:01:30.549> in<00:01:30.700> a

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
first game we've had as a team in a

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.730 
first game we've had as a team in a
while<00:01:30.970> so<00:01:31.420> just<00:01:32.020> kind<00:01:32.200> of<00:01:32.229> continue<00:01:32.650> to

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
while so just kind of continue to

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.140 
while so just kind of continue to
tighten<00:01:33.040> things<00:01:33.159> up<00:01:33.369> clean<00:01:33.640> things<00:01:33.850> up<00:01:34.000> a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
tighten things up clean things up a

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.810 
tighten things up clean things up a
little<00:01:34.240> bit<00:01:34.440> and<00:01:35.440> you<00:01:36.159> know<00:01:36.250> hopefully<00:01:36.430> score

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
little bit and you know hopefully score

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.219 
little bit and you know hopefully score
some<00:01:37.000> goals<00:01:37.119> like<00:01:37.330> we<00:01:37.450> did<00:01:37.600> that<00:01:37.630> Australia

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
some goals like we did that Australia

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.109 
some goals like we did that Australia
game<00:01:38.470> New<00:01:39.220> Zealand's<00:01:39.580> a<00:01:39.610> different<00:01:39.909> team<00:01:40.090> than

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
game New Zealand's a different team than

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.450 
game New Zealand's a different team than
Australia<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:41.320> they're<00:01:41.830> a<00:01:41.860> good<00:01:42.010> team<00:01:42.070> I

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
Australia and they're a good team I

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.250 
Australia and they're a good team I
think<00:01:42.520> that<00:01:42.790> they've<00:01:42.939> made<00:01:43.479> made<00:01:43.960> great

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
think that they've made made great

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.230 
think that they've made made great
strides<00:01:44.439> over<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.890> last<00:01:44.979> five<00:01:45.280> years<00:01:45.549> we

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
strides over the last five years we

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.070 
strides over the last five years we
obviously<00:01:46.630> played<00:01:46.840> them<00:01:46.960> in<00:01:46.990> the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
obviously played them in the

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.210 
obviously played them in the
quarterfinals<00:01:47.619> of<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:47.740> Olympics<00:01:48.070> last

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
quarterfinals of the Olympics last

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.420 
quarterfinals of the Olympics last
summer<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.439> it<00:01:50.799> wasn't<00:01:51.010> an<00:01:51.250> easy

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
summer and and and it wasn't an easy

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.219 
summer and and and it wasn't an easy
game<00:01:51.700> by<00:01:51.880> any<00:01:52.000> means<00:01:52.119> obviously<00:01:53.020> it's<00:01:53.170> a

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
game by any means obviously it's a

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.899 
game by any means obviously it's a
knockout<00:01:53.560> round<00:01:53.799> they're<00:01:54.490> our<00:01:54.640> team<00:01:54.880> that

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
knockout round they're our team that

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.719 
knockout round they're our team that
isn't<00:01:55.840> expected<00:01:56.259> to<00:01:56.290> be<00:01:56.860> d<00:01:56.979> us<00:01:57.250> in<00:01:57.430> that<00:01:57.549> kind

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
isn't expected to be d us in that kind

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.460 
isn't expected to be d us in that kind
of<00:01:57.759> environment<00:01:57.939> so<00:01:58.450> we<00:01:59.080> know<00:01:59.200> that<00:01:59.380> they're

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
of environment so we know that they're

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.520 
of environment so we know that they're
gonna<00:01:59.590> actually<00:01:59.650> bring<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:01.530> difficult

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
gonna actually bring a difficult

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.380 
gonna actually bring a difficult
challenge<00:02:02.860> for<00:02:02.890> us<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.340> I<00:02:03.400> think<00:02:03.430> that<00:02:03.790> for

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
challenge for us and I think that for

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
what tom has going on bringing in new

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.609 
what tom has going on bringing in new
players<00:02:06.369> having<00:02:07.330> different<00:02:07.960> lineups<00:02:08.320> almost

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
players having different lineups almost

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.469 
players having different lineups almost
every<00:02:08.829> single<00:02:08.979> game<00:02:09.250> for<00:02:09.940> us<00:02:10.060> it's<00:02:10.239> a<00:02:10.299> matter

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
every single game for us it's a matter

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.000 
every single game for us it's a matter
of<00:02:10.570> just<00:02:10.780> getting<00:02:11.019> on<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.140> same<00:02:11.350> page<00:02:11.410> getting

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
of just getting on the same page getting

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.530 
of just getting on the same page getting
into<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.220> rhythm<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.730> hopefully<00:02:13.299> getting

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
into a rhythm and hopefully getting

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.759 
into a rhythm and hopefully getting
chances<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.049> finishing<00:02:14.350> them<00:02:14.470> well<00:02:14.620> we've

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
chances and finishing them well we've

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.680 
chances and finishing them well we've
faced<00:02:15.430> New<00:02:15.579> Zealand<00:02:15.970> in<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.150> Olympics<00:02:16.540> are

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
faced New Zealand in the Olympics are

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.810 
faced New Zealand in the Olympics are
obviously<00:02:17.079> a<00:02:17.170> very<00:02:17.380> tough<00:02:17.590> opponent<00:02:17.739> I<00:02:18.250> can

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
obviously a very tough opponent I can

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.130 
obviously a very tough opponent I can
never<00:02:18.940> take<00:02:19.150> them<00:02:19.329> lightly<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.660> think<00:02:19.989> they've

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
never take them lightly I think they've

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.800 
never take them lightly I think they've
done<00:02:20.380> a<00:02:20.950> lot<00:02:21.160> with<00:02:21.549> their<00:02:21.700> squad<00:02:21.970> from

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
done a lot with their squad from

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.199 
done a lot with their squad from
Olympics<00:02:23.260> up<00:02:23.470> until<00:02:23.769> this<00:02:23.860> point<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.430> we've

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
Olympics up until this point so we've

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.370 
Olympics up until this point so we've
just<00:02:25.239> got<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.540> be<00:02:25.570> ready<00:02:25.750> for<00:02:25.840> them<00:02:26.079> they're

going to be strong physical you know I

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.479 
going to be strong physical you know I
think<00:02:28.959> somewhat<00:02:29.320> like<00:02:29.470> Australia<00:02:30.040> wanting<00:02:30.400> to

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
think somewhat like Australia wanting to

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:31.800 
think somewhat like Australia wanting to
try<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.670> play<00:02:30.910> they've<00:02:31.299> got<00:02:31.480> some<00:02:31.630> quality

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
try to play they've got some quality

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
players in the center of the part

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.210 
players in the center of the part
and<00:02:34.350> we've<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:34.530> got<00:02:34.710> to<00:02:34.890> come<00:02:35.040> out<00:02:35.190> and

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
the first Australia game was a good

the first Australia game was a good
start<00:02:53.070> for<00:02:53.460> us<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.850> hopefully<00:02:53.910> we<00:02:54.180> can<00:02:54.210> kind

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480
