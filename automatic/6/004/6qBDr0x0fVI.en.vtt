the option if you want to turn it on or
not<00:02:19.079> so<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.440> guess<00:02:19.650> we'll<00:02:19.829> turn<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.040> on<00:02:20.660> awesome

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.039 
not so I guess we'll turn it on awesome
I<00:02:22.400> guess<00:02:23.400> it's<00:02:23.579> just<00:02:23.640> because<00:02:24.030> if<00:02:24.180> data<00:02:24.420> rates

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
I guess it's just because if data rates

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.319 
I guess it's just because if data rates
