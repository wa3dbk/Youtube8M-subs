00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.560 

ten<00:00:08.780> years<00:00:09.110> ago<00:00:09.200> I<00:00:09.740> have<00:00:10.190> a<00:00:10.220> guitar<00:00:10.580> stolen<00:00:11.180> and

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
ten years ago I have a guitar stolen and

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.210 
ten years ago I have a guitar stolen and
I<00:00:11.690> didn't<00:00:11.930> have<00:00:12.020> any<00:00:12.140> money<00:00:12.350> at<00:00:12.530> the<00:00:12.650> time<00:00:12.860> and

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:13.220 
I didn't have any money at the time and

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.760 
I didn't have any money at the time and
it<00:00:13.610> would<00:00:13.730> always<00:00:13.990> interested<00:00:14.990> me<00:00:15.020> Charlie

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
it would always interested me Charlie

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.820 
it would always interested me Charlie
and<00:00:16.220> I<00:00:16.730> thought<00:00:17.240> it<00:00:17.420> would<00:00:17.570> be<00:00:18.110> a<00:00:18.140> good<00:00:18.560> chance

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
and I thought it would be a good chance

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.859 
and I thought it would be a good chance
to<00:00:19.160> start<00:00:19.430> I<00:00:19.670> learned<00:00:20.060> most<00:00:20.240> of<00:00:20.450> the<00:00:20.540> skills

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
to start I learned most of the skills

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.690 
to start I learned most of the skills
from<00:00:21.170> my<00:00:21.230> father<00:00:21.590> at<00:00:21.920> work<00:00:22.220> in<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:22.580> aircraft

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700

great<00:00:30.710> importance<00:00:31.460> on<00:00:31.849> the<00:00:31.910> wood<00:00:32.810> I<00:00:32.930> select

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
great importance on the wood I select

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.150 
great importance on the wood I select
for<00:00:33.470> the<00:00:33.560> soundboard<00:00:34.100> I<00:00:34.400> use<00:00:35.410> Alpine<00:00:36.410> spruce<00:00:36.860> I

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
for the soundboard I use Alpine spruce I

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.729 
for the soundboard I use Alpine spruce I
believe<00:00:38.000> that<00:00:38.180> this<00:00:38.300> gives<00:00:38.690> a<00:00:38.930> better<00:00:39.140> tonal

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
believe that this gives a better tonal

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.180 
believe that this gives a better tonal
range<00:00:40.220> than<00:00:40.520> same<00:00:40.820> cedar<00:00:41.540> and<00:00:42.290> I<00:00:42.560> believe<00:00:42.980> it's

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
range than same cedar and I believe it's

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.360 
range than same cedar and I believe it's
central<00:00:43.670> for<00:00:43.850> making<00:00:44.180> of<00:00:44.270> a<00:00:44.390> good<00:00:44.600> instrument
