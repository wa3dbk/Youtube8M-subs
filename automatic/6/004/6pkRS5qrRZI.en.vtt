00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello everyone i hope you 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.180
 okay today I'm coming for 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.429
 you realize so this little hairstyle 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.059
 the ultra ultra simple and very very 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.730
 quick to do 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.309
 so I hope you'll like it so 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.640
 it's something that I do pretty much 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.320
 often it's true that my never seen in 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.939
 video like that but it's really a 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.189
 thing that I 'm pretty often who's me 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.900
 allows to have the hair a little bit 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.279
 attached and at the same time that you can 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.390
 to style to change a little bit 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.080
 to have hair any time 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.000
 completely unleashed personally me 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.090
 for this cut there when this hairstyle 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.620
 the gel and my hair but after 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.260
 it's how you want you can 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.300
 leave it slightly waved it's 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.280
 as you want so to begin 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.989
 you need a hair brush 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.360
 so me it's a pneumatic spindle 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.300
 it does not matter to you it's a little bit 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.969
 the hair then you need 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.520
 a clip so I'm trying this bread 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.930
 that I'm pretty much all the time 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.739
 it's a black you take while 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.190
 you want and so you brush your 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.190
 hair 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.870
 so that's once you have 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.700
 to style your hair so you put them on 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.380
 normally so I like doing well 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.910
 this to give a little more 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.560
 volume at my hair level because 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.110
 that I have enough hair 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.410
 flat here is so you put a little bit 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.850
 your hair a little as you want it 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.620
 not do that is simple enough to 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.750
 realize but that is maybe very 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.490
 very bitchy also so he he 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.450
 lost putting it in your mouth and I 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.280
 will show you a little bit how 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.990
 I am doing so I was turning so this 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.080
 what you do is that you go 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.320
 take from the top of your ears 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.970
 in fact so that you will take 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.190
 hair but not take everything in 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.060
 do it's still a little bit of 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.790
 hair in fact simply passed 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.690
 you take your hair like that and m 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.510
 this side so like that as if in fact 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.250
 you in that on the match and half 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.709
 hair in fact from the top and so 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.480
 So here I am I like I leave 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.270
 always small game like that by 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:29.100
 here and there you take I hope you 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:30.420
 are never the day so what I 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.790
 do I take my little ones 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.720
 fingers and in fact I am a high level 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.830
 from here so I'm going to make a 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.980
 separation actually at level 2 from the top 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.780
 and the bottom of my hair here so I 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.650
 do one as if I was going to do one 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.600
 tail in fact 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.730
 and then julien turn a little bit my 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.040
 hair a little bit like that a little 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.450
 little to the snatch mix and then I put 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.130
 my little clip like those here after I 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.340
 get me back and then good times it's okay 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.709
 facades not and in this case there so 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.620
 we look at pawns removes hair 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.280
 we need or not so if we want 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.930
 to have wicks or not so that's it 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.700
 threw me a few small locks when 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.580
 even because I like it I'm going to have 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.930
 wicks to make a hairstyle a 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.220
 little bit the plug so here is so 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.030
 after me I leave my hair like that 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.280
 you can 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.130
 you can try a little bit like you 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.690
 I want to apologize for the sun 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.830
 because it is a little bit painful in 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.900
 this moment but hey we will not complain 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.520
 because we do not have many 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.530
 so here's for the hairstyle so pretty 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.500
 simple i'll get you back for 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.590
 that you see a little what it gives to the 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.360
 side level when we see like that 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:57.690
 no I think it's pretty cool so 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:59.330
 here is behind that so after that 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.830
 falls 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.140
 it takes a little oddly more or 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.220
 less according to how we will put our 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.420
 tongs and it's true that this season 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.100
 so here are the girls hoping that this 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.390
 you will have liked a hairdresser 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.269
 to ask me a lot of 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.140
 hairdressing tutorials but personally I 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.160
 not really much 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.169
 inspiration 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.489
 if you have pictures of inspiration 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.320
 that you want me to realize 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.570
 why not but send that it is in 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.919
 makeup hairstyle 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.500
 do not hesitate to send them to me so we 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.000
 email address that I'm going to put that in 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.700
 done under the info bar so his 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.669
 brands and my email address you can 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.010
 very well but sent and I will achieve 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.910
 if if I can so that's what I have 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.000
 made 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.520
 hairstyle you will have liked so something 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.169
 pretty simple enough actually to endorse who 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.419
 does a little bit its little effect a 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.729
 little nice so I apologize for this 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.490
 small square of sun which is a small 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.080
 little painful play admits so here is so 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.090
 I hope this video we have it 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.310
 more than the sun will not have you too much 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.450
 too embarrassed I make you full of huge 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.450
 kiss and very soon
