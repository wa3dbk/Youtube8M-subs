either<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.970> shock<00:02:24.390> or<00:02:24.629> corrosive<00:02:25.050> would<00:02:25.440> be

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
either a shock or corrosive would be

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.100 
either a shock or corrosive would be
good<00:02:25.739> for<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.010> gun<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:27.420> don't<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.930> don't<00:02:27.989> know

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
good for this gun I don't I don't know

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.600 
good for this gun I don't I don't know
about<00:02:28.230> fire<00:02:28.530> because<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.040> don't<00:02:29.310> know<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.400> just

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
about fire because I don't know I just

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.320 
about fire because I don't know I just
feel<00:02:29.819> like<00:02:29.849> most<00:02:30.840> enemies<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.319> fight<00:02:31.620> like<00:02:32.340> are

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
feel like most enemies I fight like are

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.420 
feel like most enemies I fight like are
able<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.900> die<00:02:34.080> with<00:02:34.319> fire<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.920> feel<00:02:35.129> like<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.400> just

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
able to die with fire I feel like I just

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.809 
able to die with fire I feel like I just
end<00:02:35.819> up<00:02:35.910> using<00:02:37.069> like<00:02:38.069> unkempt<00:02:38.430> heralds<00:02:38.760> or

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
end up using like unkempt heralds or

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.970 
end up using like unkempt heralds or
something<00:02:39.000> like<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.209> but<00:02:39.989> like<00:02:40.440> if<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.830> had<00:02:40.950> a

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
something like that but like if I had a

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.500 
something like that but like if I had a
corrosive<00:02:41.519> I<00:02:41.760> would<00:02:41.879> definitely<00:02:42.180> be<00:02:42.300> using

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
corrosive I would definitely be using

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.630 
corrosive I would definitely be using
this<00:02:42.720> all<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.170> time<00:02:43.379> against<00:02:43.800> loaders

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
this all the time against loaders

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.940 
this all the time against loaders
because<00:02:45.060> it's<00:02:45.239> got<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.480> accuracy<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:46.739> can

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
because it's got that accuracy so I can

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.619 
because it's got that accuracy so I can
take<00:02:47.190> off<00:02:47.370> their<00:02:47.550> arms<00:02:47.760> really<00:02:47.879> quick<00:02:48.150> or<00:02:48.390> legs

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
take off their arms really quick or legs

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.210 
take off their arms really quick or legs
or<00:02:48.870> shoot<00:02:49.110> their<00:02:49.260> eye<00:02:49.290> out<00:02:49.590> if<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:49.950> need<00:02:50.099> to

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
or shoot their eye out if I need to

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.220 
or shoot their eye out if I need to
really<00:02:50.459> quick<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.660> helped<00:02:51.930> me<00:02:52.019> a<00:02:52.050> lot

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230
