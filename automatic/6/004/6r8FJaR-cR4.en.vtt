00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello how about band how are you in that 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.210
 video we will see tricks or functions 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.930
 Hidden from the Samsung Galaxy S 5 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.930
 let's go with the video 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.630
 during the presentation of the galaxy is 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.490
 5 some of the functions were highlighted 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.029
 more relevant as the fingerprint sensor 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.050
 touch or the heart rate sensor 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.939
 personally none of them more than 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.369
 want to buy it but instead to 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.780
 investigate and discover that the s5 saves 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.180
 very interesting features 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.680
 my opinion changed slightly and good 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.870
 let's start with this list of tricks 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.850
 or hidden functions and well let's 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.309
 start and the first is to hide images 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.230
 and videos sure that more than one has 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.420
 happened that teaching points of the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.789
 gallery has sneaked some scene a 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.379
 little incident or embarrassing to avoid 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.629
 this kind of situations the best is 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.699
 hide those images and videos that 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.980
 be more personal this is possible in 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.899
 The Samsung Galaxy S 5 through mode 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.640
 private that can be activated easily 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.379
 in the quick settings menu 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.600
 once activated we just have to enter 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.880
 to the image gallery open the menu and 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.380
 select to move to private and one other 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.990
 of the functions is to change the aspect 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.550
 from the settings menu we start with something 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.080
 very basic one of the main 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.969
 changes to the user interface of the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.890
 touch with is that the settings menu 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.570
 show another appearance here 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.729
 those who have found the new menu 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.950
 a little confused they will be happy to know 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.260
 that can change and configure it to 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.210
 make it a new list in the style of 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.010
 previous menu for it you just have to 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.380
 open select the button settings 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.540

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.759
 top right and choose view of 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.400
 tab other function of which I 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.140
 loved it is virtual tour the only way to 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.330
 shot that has been added as great 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.060
 Novelty compared to the Samsung 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.500
 galaxy s 4 is the virtual tour with 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.820
 this mode the smartphone will take 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.860
 photographs of the scene from 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.229
 different perspectives so that 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.420
 as the result we will obtain a small 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.330
 tour in one of the best functions that 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.770
 brings the galaxy s 5 is this and consists is 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.380

 help message not with this we just 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.130
 this video and is to use the s5 with a 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.610
 pencil may the galaxy s 5 not bring 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.280
 a 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.290
 standard but does not need a post 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.200
 which like the Sony Xperia Z 2 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.390
 Ultra the 5 s can also be used 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.860
 with any pencil for this to be 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.080
 possible just increase the 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.240
 Screen sensitivity when doing it 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.550
 the s5 screen will detect when 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.800
 let's use with a pencil or if we do 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.720
