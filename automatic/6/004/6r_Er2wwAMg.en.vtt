00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
for you so you've obviously got the same

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.710 
for you so you've obviously got the same
options<00:01:56.770> but<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:57.860> does<00:01:58.040> look<00:01:58.660> perfect<00:01:59.660> for

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
options but it does look perfect for

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.960 
options but it does look perfect for
horizontal<00:02:00.320> of<00:02:00.440> you<00:02:00.530> I<00:02:00.740> haven't<00:02:01.520> seen<00:02:01.730> any

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
horizontal of you I haven't seen any

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.130 
horizontal of you I haven't seen any
games<00:02:02.180> that<00:02:02.330> do<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:02.810> far<00:02:03.020> I<00:02:03.080> mean

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
games that do that so far I mean

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.960 
games that do that so far I mean
obviously<00:02:03.650> shout<00:02:04.370> me<00:02:04.460> out<00:02:04.550> in<00:02:04.730> the<00:02:04.790> comments

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
obviously shout me out in the comments

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.360 
obviously shout me out in the comments
if<00:02:05.330> you<00:02:05.600> know<00:02:05.960> of<00:02:05.990> any<00:02:06.200> other<00:02:06.260> games<00:02:06.590> or<00:02:07.160> any

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
if you know of any other games or any

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.330 
if you know of any other games or any
other<00:02:07.520> applications<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:08.239> make<00:02:08.390> use<00:02:08.629> of<00:02:08.660> that

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
other applications that make use of that

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.770 
other applications that make use of that
but<00:02:10.340> for<00:02:10.489> now<00:02:10.610> we're<00:02:10.759> going<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:11.060> single<00:02:11.629> player

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
but for now we're going to single player

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.660 
but for now we're going to single player
mode<00:02:11.870> will<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:12.200> just<00:02:12.349> do<00:02:12.530> a<00:02:12.560> quick<00:02:12.769> game<00:02:13.010> so

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
mode will you just do a quick game so

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.309 
mode will you just do a quick game so
now<00:02:13.849> this<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.629> quite<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:14.870> nifty<00:02:15.019> thing

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
now this is quite a nifty thing

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.170 
now this is quite a nifty thing
obviously<00:02:15.440> it's<00:02:15.709> cover<00:02:15.920> flow<00:02:16.220> but<00:02:16.879> letting

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
obviously it's cover flow but letting

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.910 
obviously it's cover flow but letting
you<00:02:17.269> choose<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.690> levels<00:02:18.019> and<00:02:18.230> obviously<00:02:18.620> from

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
you choose the levels and obviously from

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.880 
you choose the levels and obviously from
the<00:02:19.040> left<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.579> the<00:02:20.030> right<00:02:20.209> is<00:02:20.569> the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
the left to the right is the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.430 
the left to the right is the
the<00:02:21.510> difficulty<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.750> game<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.290> have

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
the difficulty of the game and you have

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.710 
the difficulty of the game and you have
to<00:02:23.530> become<00:02:23.890> more<00:02:24.160> experienced<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.850> go<00:02:25.000> further

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
to become more experienced to go further

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.390 
to become more experienced to go further
through<00:02:26.080> these<00:02:26.230> obviously<00:02:26.620> as<00:02:26.800> you<00:02:26.860> win<00:02:27.160> more

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
through these obviously as you win more

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.000 
through these obviously as you win more
and<00:02:27.550> more<00:02:27.670> money<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:29.290> can<00:02:29.410> go<00:02:29.560> through<00:02:29.860> this

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
and more money you can go through this

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.590 
and more money you can go through this
but<00:02:30.250> this<00:02:30.430> I<00:02:30.580> mean<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:30.790> is<00:02:31.060> just<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.330> nifty

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
but this I mean this is just a nifty

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.820 
but this I mean this is just a nifty
little<00:02:31.630> way<00:02:31.990> I<00:02:32.230> think<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:34.620> selecting<00:02:35.620> what<00:02:35.770> you

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
little way I think of selecting what you

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.500 
little way I think of selecting what you
want<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.010> do<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.220> obviously<00:02:36.310> Apple<00:02:36.880> cannot

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
want to do and obviously Apple cannot

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.699 
want to do and obviously Apple cannot
really<00:02:37.660> have<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.020> do<00:02:38.140> this<00:02:38.170> because<00:02:38.440> it's

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
really have to do this because it's

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.150 
really have to do this because it's
their<00:02:38.890> cup<00:02:39.130> of<00:02:39.220> low<00:02:39.370> technology<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:41.160> it's

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
their cup of low technology and it's

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.770 
their cup of low technology and it's
quite<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.370> cool<00:02:42.640> thing<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:42.910> do<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.360> let's<00:02:43.600> say

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
quite a cool thing to do so let's say

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.690 
quite a cool thing to do so let's say
went<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.740> garage<00:02:44.890> which<00:02:45.250> is<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.490> first

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
went to the garage which is the first

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.910 
went to the garage which is the first
level<00:02:45.910> you<00:02:46.420> have<00:02:46.480> no<00:02:46.720> buying<00:02:47.170> that<00:02:47.560> tells<00:02:47.830> you

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
level you have no buying that tells you

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.650 
level you have no buying that tells you
all<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.250> information<00:02:48.580> about<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.000> prizes<00:02:49.330> for

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
all the information about the prizes for

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.750 
all the information about the prizes for
a<00:02:49.870> second<00:02:50.200> or<00:02:50.290> third<00:02:50.470> place<00:02:50.709> so<00:02:51.520> we're<00:02:51.700> going

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
a second or third place so we're going

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.470

to<00:02:51.880> go<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:51.970> play<00:02:53.940> since<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.060> pause<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.450> game

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
to go to play since the pause the game

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
touch the screen in any two corners so

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.449 
touch the screen in any two corners so
if<00:02:57.790> i<00:02:57.880> do<00:02:57.940> this<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:59.500> pauses<00:02:59.769> the<00:03:00.070> game<00:03:00.100> so<00:03:00.400> i

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
if i do this that pauses the game so i

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.460 
if i do this that pauses the game so i
can<00:03:00.610> obviously<00:03:00.790> now<00:03:01.000> resume<00:03:01.330> again<00:03:01.630> I<00:03:01.870> go<00:03:02.440> back

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
can obviously now resume again I go back

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.050 
can obviously now resume again I go back
and<00:03:02.830> you're<00:03:02.920> so<00:03:03.130> everybody<00:03:03.580> else<00:03:03.610> around<00:03:03.850> the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
shouldn't really done that because i

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.340 
shouldn't really done that because i
only<00:03:12.670> got<00:03:12.820> a<00:03:12.880> six<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.300> a<00:03:13.390> seven<00:03:13.600> but<00:03:13.780> it's<00:03:13.989> okay

only got a six and a seven but it's okay

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.710 
only got a six and a seven but it's okay

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
but what is actually pretty neat about

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.780 
but what is actually pretty neat about
this<00:03:16.870> is<00:03:17.380> if<00:03:17.680> you<00:03:17.800> turn<00:03:18.070> it<00:03:18.220> back<00:03:18.550> to<00:03:18.580> portrait

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
this is if you turn it back to portrait

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.190 
this is if you turn it back to portrait
it<00:03:21.790> will<00:03:21.910> actually<00:03:22.150> take<00:03:22.480> you<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.780> a<00:03:22.810> video<00:03:22.959> of

so yeah that's that's my skills of a
plane

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
plane

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.760 
plane
I<00:04:31.210> was<00:04:31.450> complete<00:04:31.750> fluke<00:04:31.960> as<00:04:32.290> you<00:04:32.470> can<00:04:32.530> see<00:04:32.680> how

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
I was complete fluke as you can see how

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.840 
I was complete fluke as you can see how
it<00:04:32.800> makes<00:04:33.220> it<00:04:33.370> a<00:04:33.430> little<00:04:33.520> bit<00:04:33.730> more

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
it makes it a little bit more

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.330 
it makes it a little bit more
interactive<00:04:34.390> and<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:35.710> think<00:04:35.890> this<00:04:36.010> is<00:04:36.160> one<00:04:36.310> of

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
interactive and I think this is one of

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.790 
interactive and I think this is one of
the<00:04:37.090> most<00:04:37.600> highly<00:04:37.900> developed<00:04:38.110> games<00:04:38.530> but

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
the most highly developed games but

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.900 
the most highly developed games but
obviously<00:04:39.130> it's<00:04:39.280> because<00:04:39.550> it<00:04:39.670> was<00:04:39.730> developed

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
obviously it's because it was developed

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.550 
obviously it's because it was developed
by<00:04:40.150> Apple<00:04:40.450> so<00:04:40.960> I'm<00:04:41.050> going<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.200> go<00:04:41.320> ahead<00:04:41.350> and

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
by Apple so I'm going to go ahead and

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.280 
by Apple so I'm going to go ahead and
give<00:04:41.770> this<00:04:41.800> one<00:04:42.160> a<00:04:42.190> 9<00:04:42.490> out<00:04:42.670> of<00:04:42.700> 10<00:04:43.030> and<00:04:43.330> very
