other<00:01:27.409> things<00:01:27.710> we're<00:01:27.920> testing<00:01:28.540> playing<00:01:29.540> with

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
other things we're testing playing with

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.389 
other things we're testing playing with

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
and plastic on the car you'll notice

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.649 
and plastic on the car you'll notice
that<00:01:33.470> I<00:01:33.530> have<00:01:33.619> carbon<00:01:34.039> arms<00:01:34.340> Carbon<00:01:35.180> top<00:01:35.390> play

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
that I have carbon arms Carbon top play

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.359 
that I have carbon arms Carbon top play
makes<00:01:36.259> that<00:01:36.380> everything<00:01:36.680> carbon<00:01:37.070> I<00:01:37.159> can

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
makes that everything carbon I can

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.279 
makes that everything carbon I can
trying<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:37.729> reduce<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.180> plexuses<00:01:38.810> chassis

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
trying to reduce the plexuses chassis

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.469 
trying to reduce the plexuses chassis
compared<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:40.030> suspension<00:01:41.030> trying<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.299> really

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
compared to suspension trying to really

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.109 
compared to suspension trying to really
isolate<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:42.080> suspension<00:01:42.560> itself<00:01:43.119> something

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
isolate the suspension itself something

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.639 
isolate the suspension itself something
we've<00:01:44.360> done<00:01:44.509> for<00:01:44.750> quite<00:01:44.929> a<00:01:44.960> while<00:01:45.170> over<00:01:45.950> the

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.569 

different<00:01:51.649> in<00:01:51.710> weight<00:01:51.950> that's<00:01:52.280> all<00:01:52.460> the

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
different in weight that's all the

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.429 
different in weight that's all the
different<00:01:52.970> events<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:53.600> it's<00:01:54.049> a<00:01:54.110> really<00:01:54.320> good

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
different events so it's a really good

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:01.649 
different events so it's a really good
way<00:01:54.619> to<00:01:54.649> really<00:01:55.640> bow<00:01:55.880> your<00:01:56.179> car
