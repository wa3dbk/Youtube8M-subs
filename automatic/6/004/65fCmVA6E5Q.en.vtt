00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:09.750
 Good today, I 'm alone here in the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:12.840
 server to serve you saints and good 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:20.130
 I just came to record a video with a template that 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:25.019
 I found the internet that retarded. 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.519
 Anyway, I'm here on the goal team. 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.140
 made the obvious 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:35.210
 they have a jetpack and it was exactly the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.210
 jetpack that was shot 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.770
 these wings here they have the animation of 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.860
 a wing 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.480
 good actually a character does not hit 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:53.430
 the wings so the arms 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:57.030
 the needle is very scrotal but I can not remember the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.960
 year I found and who should be great 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.960
 space at last 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.600
 You can still use the weapons normally 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.520
 what you can only mass 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.520
 and this is what the artist 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.340
 they should be aware of my exit 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.790
 I'm going to the court 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.690
 the pilots 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.550
 do not leave it still 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.550
 here's the match 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.500
 there when I want to attack someone always 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.700
 ventures 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.700
 and ended up killing 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.440
 the attack 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.569
 the cold area 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.569
 usually the servant paulo happens 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.159
 it's also easy disturbances 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.159
 they switch 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.970
 these heights 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.520
 We should be tired. 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.770
 clapping his arms 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.660
 like here 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.660
 Rodrigo's character al 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.750
 the text 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.770
 patients 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.750
 I think so 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.190
 Apparently 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.660
 these houses 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.660
 the fluid is terena 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.300
 the character can only reach a 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.710
 certain height 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.710
 He can have life. 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:55.340
 the company is the base people 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.140
 far away 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.210
 comes 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.720
 ae 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.830
 very striking in dust here 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:25.119
 It's detail given 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:34.550
 besides being very you have what you 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.550
 It's your most likely name. 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:47.569
 our language, it's okay with me 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.569
 would you like 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.020
 good finish the video and said that I 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.020
 die spoken
