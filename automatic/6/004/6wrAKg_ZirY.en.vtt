out of the street a little bit more

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.480 
out of the street a little bit more
should<00:02:08.640> come<00:02:08.850> right<00:02:09.030> down<00:02:09.980> the<00:02:10.980> height<00:02:11.220> will

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.130 
people flying over us at 17,000 miles an
hour<00:02:32.490> here<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.030> about<00:02:33.320> three<00:02:34.320> or<00:02:34.350> four<00:02:34.470> minutes

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
hour here in about three or four minutes

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.110 
hour here in about three or four minutes
I'm<00:02:37.140> not<00:02:37.350> sure<00:02:37.410> if<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.040> clock<00:02:38.340> on<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.670> camera

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
I'm not sure if the clock on the camera

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.330 
I'm not sure if the clock on the camera
is<00:02:39.300> synchronized<00:02:40.140> with<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.410> good<00:02:40.770> time<00:02:41.040> but

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
is synchronized with the good time but

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.220 
is synchronized with the good time but
it's<00:02:41.490> got<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:41.970> be<00:02:42.090> within<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.510> minute<00:02:42.750> or<00:02:42.990> so

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
it's got to be within a minute or so

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.690 
it's got to be within a minute or so
we'll<00:02:43.440> see<00:02:43.680> it's<00:02:43.920> supposed<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.280> start

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
we'll see it's supposed to start

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.190 
we'll see it's supposed to start
appearing<00:02:45.300> about<00:02:46.280> 6<00:02:47.280> 45<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:48.240> 30<00:02:48.420> seconds<00:02:49.050> I

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
appearing about 6 45 and 30 seconds I

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.760 
appearing about 6 45 and 30 seconds I
think<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:50.090> go<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.390> northeast<00:02:52.020> for<00:02:52.440> about

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
think and go to the northeast for about

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.720 
think and go to the northeast for about
till<00:02:53.130> about<00:02:53.220> 650<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.180> think

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
till about 650 I think

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.970 
till about 650 I think
it<00:02:56.730> comes<00:03:00.260> right<00:03:01.260> in<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.590> middle<00:03:01.830> of<00:03:01.920> the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
it comes right in the middle of the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.490 
it comes right in the middle of the
screen<00:03:05.180> okay<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.210> was<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.480> little<00:03:06.840> bit<00:03:06.990> off<00:03:07.110> on<00:03:07.350> my

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
screen okay I was a little bit off on my

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.470 
screen okay I was a little bit off on my
angles<00:03:07.980> but<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.370> sounds<00:03:08.790> less<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.330> it's

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
angles but that sounds less and it's

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.360 
angles but that sounds less and it's
going<00:03:09.720> i'm<00:03:10.170> going<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.410> move<00:03:10.590> around<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:11.070> tree

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
going i'm going to move around the tree

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.990 
going i'm going to move around the tree
so<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:11.670> can<00:03:12.050> try<00:03:13.050> to<00:03:13.110> keep<00:03:13.350> it<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:14.000> center

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
so you can try to keep it in the center

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.840 
so you can try to keep it in the center
of<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.270> viewfinder<00:03:16.250> that's<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.550> space

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
of the viewfinder that's the space

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.410 
of the viewfinder that's the space
station<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.840> shuttle<00:03:19.230> together

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:33.809 

Southwest<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.720> Northeast

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.460 

move<00:03:34.819> again<00:03:35.240> to<00:03:35.480> try<00:03:35.660> to<00:03:35.810> keep<00:03:35.990> it<00:03:36.200> in<00:03:36.319> the

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
move again to try to keep it in the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:50.690 
move again to try to keep it in the
screen

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:04:07.390 

I've<00:03:51.700> been<00:03:51.879> there<00:03:52.060> playing<00:03:52.420> that

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.670 

cross<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:08.090> let<00:04:08.540> it<00:04:08.569> just<00:04:08.689> move<00:04:09.200> across<00:04:09.560> the

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
cross and let it just move across the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:18.009 
cross and let it just move across the
face<00:04:10.099> of<00:04:10.159> the<00:04:10.400> camera

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.510 

almost<00:04:18.709> directly<00:04:19.099> overhead<00:04:19.750> Wow<00:04:21.430> look<00:04:22.430> at

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
almost directly overhead Wow look at

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.420 
almost directly overhead Wow look at
that<00:04:22.580> thing<00:04:22.910> move<00:04:23.410> hey<00:04:24.410> guys<00:04:24.710> how<00:04:25.069> are<00:04:25.099> you

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.460 
that thing move hey guys how are you
that's<00:04:27.430> it<00:04:29.550> we<00:04:30.550> keep<00:04:30.880> the<00:04:31.060> camera<00:04:31.510> still<00:04:31.840> let

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
that's it we keep the camera still let

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:43.690 
that's it we keep the camera still let
it<00:04:32.620> move<00:04:32.800> across<00:04:33.100> the<00:04:33.220> base<00:04:33.640> of<00:04:33.850> the<00:04:33.940> camera

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.460 

she's<00:04:44.700> gonna<00:04:44.820> go<00:04:45.090> into<00:04:45.390> this<00:04:45.540> tree<00:04:45.960> here<00:04:46.230> in<00:04:46.380> a

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
she's gonna go into this tree here in a

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.420 
she's gonna go into this tree here in a
second<00:04:46.950> there<00:04:47.130> it<00:04:47.250> goes

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.520 

that's<00:04:52.030> going<00:04:52.480> through<00:04:52.630> the<00:04:52.840> leaves<00:04:53.140> in<00:04:53.440> a

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
that's going through the leaves in a

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.650 
that's going through the leaves in a
tree<00:04:53.830> I<00:04:55.860> hold<00:04:56.860> that<00:04:56.980> few<00:04:57.520> more<00:04:57.730> steps<00:04:58.120> there<00:04:58.480> so

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
tree I hold that few more steps there so

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:16.210 
tree I hold that few more steps there so
we<00:04:58.780> can<00:05:00.270> through<00:05:01.270> the<00:05:01.510> leaves<00:05:01.720> in<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:02.050> tree

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:30.780 

should<00:05:16.910> break<00:05:17.180> up<00:05:17.390> the<00:05:17.780> open<00:05:18.260> here

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:42.679 

hold<00:05:31.790> it<00:05:32.060> if<00:05:32.510> I<00:05:32.720> can

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:42.689 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:49.420 

and<00:05:43.259> so<00:05:43.529> astronauts<00:05:44.219> on<00:05:44.429> the<00:05:44.459> space<00:05:44.610> station

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:06:08.550 

yeah<00:05:50.430> is<00:05:50.610> it<00:05:50.820> back<00:05:51.120> out<00:05:51.300> to<00:05:51.540> keep<00:05:51.750> it<00:05:51.960> steady

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.790 

until<00:06:09.400> you<00:06:09.700> encounter<00:06:10.270> still<00:06:11.110> so<00:06:11.350> you<00:06:11.440> can<00:06:11.590> see

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
until you encounter still so you can see

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:21.520 
until you encounter still so you can see
it<00:06:11.919> pass<00:06:12.160> through<00:06:12.550> your<00:06:13.060> anger<00:06:13.780> again

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.770 

and<00:06:22.530> it<00:06:22.680> should<00:06:22.950> be<00:06:23.280> an<00:06:23.460> emotional<00:06:23.850> train<00:06:24.360> from

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
and it should be an emotional train from

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.050 
and it should be an emotional train from
me
