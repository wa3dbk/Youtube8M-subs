protected<00:02:28.569> places<00:02:29.219> should<00:02:30.219> rank<00:02:30.489> up<00:02:30.670> six

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
protected places should rank up six

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.229 
protected places should rank up six
effect<00:02:32.069> it's<00:02:33.069> a<00:02:33.159> lot<00:02:33.340> considering<00:02:33.760> its<00:02:34.030> that

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
effect it's a lot considering its that

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.729 
effect it's a lot considering its that
for<00:02:34.450> every<00:02:34.719> single<00:02:34.870> part<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.439> has<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:37.739> okay
