table tennis table you used it like

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.950 
table tennis table you used it like
three<00:00:41.739> or<00:00:41.769> four<00:00:41.890> times<00:00:42.040> and<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:43.660> don't<00:00:43.840> even

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
three or four times and you don't even

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.689 
three or four times and you don't even
have<00:00:44.230> all<00:00:44.589> the<00:00:44.710> bats<00:00:44.890> but<00:00:45.280> you've<00:00:45.519> at<00:00:45.670> least

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
have all the bats but you've at least

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.460 
have all the bats but you've at least
got<00:00:45.940> one<00:00:46.269> ping<00:00:46.570> pong<00:00:46.720> ball<00:00:46.960> lying<00:00:47.260> around

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
got one ping pong ball lying around

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.369 
got one ping pong ball lying around
somewhere<00:00:48.129> in<00:00:48.159> a<00:00:48.370> cupboard<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.930> grab<00:00:50.170> that<00:00:50.199> and

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
somewhere in a cupboard so grab that and

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.680 
somewhere in a cupboard so grab that and
find<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.530> midpoint<00:00:53.739> and<00:00:54.190> then<00:00:54.280> measure<00:00:54.690> 1/4

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
find the midpoint and then measure 1/4

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.250 
find the midpoint and then measure 1/4
of<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:55.930> way<00:00:56.050> from<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:56.440> edge<00:00:56.589> and<00:00:58.229> trace<00:00:59.229> a

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
of the way from the edge and trace a

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.420 
of the way from the edge and trace a
line<00:00:59.350> around<00:00:59.769> it<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:00.579> that<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.899> have<00:01:02.440> 1/4<00:01:03.160> for

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
line around it so that you have 1/4 for

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.430 
line around it so that you have 1/4 for
the<00:01:03.550> top<00:01:03.730> which<00:01:04.269> will<00:01:04.330> become<00:01:04.509> the<00:01:04.629> lid<00:01:04.869> and

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
the top which will become the lid and

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.650 
the top which will become the lid and
then<00:01:05.619> you<00:01:05.860> use<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.460> craft<00:01:06.670> knife<00:01:06.910> to<00:01:06.940> just

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
then you use the craft knife to just

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.300 
then you use the craft knife to just
pierce<00:01:07.990> it<00:01:08.140> pierce<00:01:08.380> it<00:01:08.530> slowly<00:01:08.770> it<00:01:09.009> so<00:01:09.160> that

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
pierce it pierce it slowly it so that

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.520 
pierce it pierce it slowly it so that
the<00:01:09.369> gas<00:01:09.550> will<00:01:09.789> release<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.539> then<00:01:11.110> cut<00:01:11.410> it

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
the gas will release and then cut it

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.650 
the gas will release and then cut it
around<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:12.399> you<00:01:12.670> get<00:01:12.789> to<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:12.970> end<00:01:13.090> you<00:01:13.479> just

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
around and you get to the end you just

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.450 
around and you get to the end you just
do<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:13.869> last<00:01:14.020> bit<00:01:14.289> with<00:01:14.470> the<00:01:14.560> scissors<00:01:14.890> very

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
do the last bit with the scissors very

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.260 
do the last bit with the scissors very
very<00:01:15.759> easy<00:01:16.410> so<00:01:17.410> now<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:17.619> just<00:01:17.950> cut<00:01:18.820> around<00:01:18.970> the

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
very easy so now you just cut around the

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.510 
very easy so now you just cut around the
edge<00:01:19.330> to<00:01:19.390> smooth<00:01:20.140> it<00:01:20.380> out<00:01:20.590> just<00:01:21.009> using<00:01:21.399> the

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
edge to smooth it out just using the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.810 
edge to smooth it out just using the
scissors<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.229> do<00:01:23.229> that<00:01:23.410> on<00:01:24.009> both<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.520> base

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
scissors and do that on both the base

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.270 
scissors and do that on both the base
the<00:01:25.300> actual<00:01:25.570> cauldron<00:01:25.960> and<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.740> lid<00:01:26.920> itself

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
the actual cauldron and the lid itself

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.779 
the actual cauldron and the lid itself
as<00:01:27.610> well<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:29.350> is<00:01:29.470> just<00:01:29.679> to<00:01:29.920> sort<00:01:30.640> of<00:01:30.729> make

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
as well this is just to sort of make

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.100 
as well this is just to sort of make
everything<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.360> level<00:01:31.630> and<00:01:32.250> keep<00:01:33.250> it<00:01:33.369> clean<00:01:34.110> so

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
everything a level and keep it clean so

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.749 
everything a level and keep it clean so
and<00:01:35.500> then<00:01:35.770> we're<00:01:35.890> going<00:01:36.069> to<00:01:36.099> take<00:01:36.340> those<00:01:36.489> just

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
and then we're going to take those just

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.540 
and then we're going to take those just
put<00:01:36.910> it<00:01:36.970> on<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.270> some<00:01:37.770> parchment<00:01:38.770> paper<00:01:39.009> it's

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
put it on to some parchment paper it's

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.839 
put it on to some parchment paper it's
cold<00:01:39.759> in<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.119> u.s.<00:01:40.420> I<00:01:40.630> believe<00:01:41.580> baking<00:01:42.580> paper

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:42.849 
cold in the u.s. I believe baking paper

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:45.479 
cold in the u.s. I believe baking paper
it's<00:01:43.090> cold<00:01:43.300> here<00:01:43.599> in<00:01:43.630> Australia<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:44.560> it's

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:45.489 
it's cold here in Australia and it's

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:48.419 
it's cold here in Australia and it's
basically<00:01:45.940> a<00:01:46.030> wax<00:01:46.270> like<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:46.810> wax<00:01:47.080> paper<00:01:47.429> cooking

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
basically a wax like a wax paper cooking

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.410 
basically a wax like a wax paper cooking
baking<00:01:48.940> on<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.679> just<00:01:50.729> draw<00:01:51.729> a<00:01:51.759> circle<00:01:52.060> around

talk and just stick on the four pieces

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.059 
talk and just stick on the four pieces
of<00:02:19.239> matchsticks<00:02:19.660> these<00:02:20.260> are<00:02:20.410> just<00:02:20.530> form<00:02:20.830> the

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
of matchsticks these are just form the

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.259 
of matchsticks these are just form the
legs<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.720> cauldron<00:02:23.110> itself<00:02:23.440> Oh<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:25.090> South

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
legs of the cauldron itself Oh in South

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.650 
legs of the cauldron itself Oh in South
Africa<00:02:25.569> call<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.870> up<00:02:25.989> poking<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.590> small<00:02:26.950> one<00:02:27.129> a

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
Africa call it up poking a small one a

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.650 
Africa call it up poking a small one a
small<00:02:28.660> pot<00:02:29.519> but<00:02:30.519> obviously<00:02:31.180> this<00:02:31.599> is

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
small pot but obviously this is

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.660 
small pot but obviously this is
representing<00:02:32.349> a<00:02:32.379> much<00:02:32.500> larger<00:02:32.920> one<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.220> the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
representing a much larger one so the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.670 
representing a much larger one so the
legs<00:02:33.849> are<00:02:33.970> quite<00:02:34.180> long<00:02:34.420> but<00:02:34.629> we<00:02:34.780> will<00:02:34.989> change

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
legs are quite long but we will change

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.860 
legs are quite long but we will change
that<00:02:35.920> later<00:02:36.099> so<00:02:37.060> now<00:02:37.180> I'm<00:02:37.300> just<00:02:37.390> gonna<00:02:37.540> use

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
that later so now I'm just gonna use

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.460 
that later so now I'm just gonna use
some<00:02:38.320> old<00:02:38.890> bits<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:40.000> cardboard<00:02:40.570> from<00:02:40.870> ripping

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
some old bits of cardboard from ripping

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.700 
some old bits of cardboard from ripping
out<00:02:41.730> layers<00:02:42.730> of<00:02:43.030> cardboard<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.810> use<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.530> as

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
out layers of cardboard and use that as

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.190 
out layers of cardboard and use that as
a<00:02:44.740> wadding<00:02:45.220> in<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.520> base<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:46.060> then<00:02:46.720> apply

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
a wadding in the base and then apply

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.800 
a wadding in the base and then apply
some<00:02:47.230> hot<00:02:47.770> glue<00:02:48.010> over<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.400> top<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:49.480> wadding

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
some hot glue over the top the wadding

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.150 
some hot glue over the top the wadding
is<00:02:49.900> just<00:02:50.080> that<00:02:50.230> we<00:02:50.380> don't<00:02:50.470> have<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.740> use<00:02:50.890> tons

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
is just that we don't have to use tons

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.190 
is just that we don't have to use tons
and<00:02:51.430> tons<00:02:51.460> of<00:02:51.700> hot<00:02:51.880> glue<00:02:52.030> take<00:02:52.420> forever<00:02:52.660> to

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
and tons of hot glue take forever to

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.490 
and tons of hot glue take forever to
cure<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:54.700> just<00:02:55.390> place<00:02:55.630> that<00:02:55.660> in<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.080> base<00:02:56.230> push

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
cure so just place that in the base push

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.920 
cure so just place that in the base push
it<00:02:56.650> down<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.280> apply<00:02:57.970> hot<00:02:58.210> glue<00:02:58.240> and<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:58.810> can

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
it down and apply hot glue and you can

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.750 
it down and apply hot glue and you can
add<00:02:59.080> just<00:02:59.260> more<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.530> more<00:02:59.590> to<00:03:00.130> whatever<00:03:00.520> level

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
add just more and more to whatever level

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.420 
add just more and more to whatever level
you<00:03:00.940> like<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.540> then<00:03:02.230> around<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.830> edge<00:03:03.100> of<00:03:03.370> the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
you like and then around the edge of the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.950 
you like and then around the edge of the
quarter<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:03.819> I'm<00:03:04.060> just<00:03:04.270> placing<00:03:04.450> more<00:03:04.750> hot

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
quarter and I'm just placing more hot

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.860 
quarter and I'm just placing more hot
glue<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.920> this<00:03:06.069> would<00:03:06.370> be<00:03:06.490> the<00:03:06.700> crustiness<00:03:07.569> of

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
glue so this would be the crustiness of

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.110 
glue so this would be the crustiness of
old<00:03:08.470> food<00:03:09.040> there's<00:03:09.490> probably<00:03:09.760> never<00:03:09.940> been

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
old food there's probably never been

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.250 
old food there's probably never been
cleaned<00:03:10.450> I<00:03:10.600> mean<00:03:10.720> we're<00:03:10.930> talking<00:03:11.080> about

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
cleaned I mean we're talking about

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.130 
cleaned I mean we're talking about
kobolds<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.040> go<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.540> goblins<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.720> things<00:03:13.960> in

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
kobolds and go and goblins and things in

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.680 
kobolds and go and goblins and things in
the<00:03:14.260> dungeon<00:03:14.800> that'll<00:03:15.010> be<00:03:15.130> preparing<00:03:16.060> food<00:03:16.480> in

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
the dungeon that'll be preparing food in

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.470 
the dungeon that'll be preparing food in
this<00:03:16.810> way<00:03:17.020> and<00:03:17.740> do<00:03:18.460> the<00:03:18.580> same<00:03:18.790> around<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.330> edge

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
this way and do the same around the edge

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.010 
this way and do the same around the edge
of<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.900> lid<00:03:20.140> as<00:03:20.500> well<00:03:20.830> so<00:03:21.700> you<00:03:21.760> can<00:03:21.970> also<00:03:22.120> place

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
of the lid as well so you can also place

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.800 
of the lid as well so you can also place
hot<00:03:23.290> glue<00:03:23.560> sort<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.790> food<00:03:25.120> running<00:03:25.480> down

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
hot glue sort of the food running down

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.830 
hot glue sort of the food running down
the<00:03:25.990> side<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.530> cauldron<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.569> so<00:03:28.569> then<00:03:28.690> while

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
the side of cauldron to so then while

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.570 
the side of cauldron to so then while
qudoos<00:03:29.140> grab<00:03:29.440> little<00:03:29.709> rings<00:03:30.010> we've<00:03:30.310> used

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
qudoos grab little rings we've used

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.510 
qudoos grab little rings we've used
before<00:03:30.819> and<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.420> doors<00:03:31.780> so<00:03:32.590> we<00:03:32.890> use<00:03:33.069> these<00:03:33.250> for

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
before and the doors so we use these for

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.070 
before and the doors so we use these for
door<00:03:33.730> handles<00:03:34.209> I'm<00:03:34.330> now<00:03:34.450> just<00:03:34.569> gonna<00:03:34.720> use<00:03:34.959> this

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
door handles I'm now just gonna use this

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.080 
door handles I'm now just gonna use this
for<00:03:35.319> a<00:03:35.380> handle<00:03:35.709> on<00:03:35.770> the<00:03:35.890> lid<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:36.459> can<00:03:36.700> also<00:03:36.850> use

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
it just handles on the side of the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.000 
it just handles on the side of the
cauldron<00:03:38.860> as<00:03:38.980> well<00:03:39.160> if<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.459> wish<00:03:40.080> it<00:03:41.080> depends

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
on what you want to look what sort of

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.480 
on what you want to look what sort of
level<00:03:43.690> of<00:03:43.750> detail<00:03:44.080> you<00:03:44.140> want<00:03:44.319> to<00:03:44.410> go<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.560> and

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
level of detail you want to go to and

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.000 
level of detail you want to go to and
I'm<00:03:45.819> just<00:03:45.850> adding<00:03:46.209> some<00:03:46.390> more<00:03:46.870> wadding<00:03:47.650> this

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
I'm just adding some more wadding this

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.460 
I'm just adding some more wadding this
time<00:03:48.220> I'm<00:03:48.340> using<00:03:48.550> some<00:03:49.000> polystyrene<00:03:49.810> and

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
time I'm using some polystyrene and

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.520 
time I'm using some polystyrene and
mainly<00:03:50.800> because<00:03:50.830> it<00:03:51.160> all<00:03:51.450> look<00:03:52.450> like<00:03:52.660> bits<00:03:53.380> and

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
mainly because it all look like bits and

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.360 
mainly because it all look like bits and
pieces<00:03:53.709> of<00:03:53.830> stuff<00:03:54.160> floating<00:03:54.310> around<00:03:54.700> in<00:03:55.270> this

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
pieces of stuff floating around in this

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.400 
pieces of stuff floating around in this
chili<00:03:57.370> soup

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
chili soup

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.130 
chili soup
kind<00:03:59.410> of<00:03:59.530> weird<00:04:00.000> mix<00:04:01.000> that<00:04:01.630> they're<00:04:01.780> cooking

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
kind of weird mix that they're cooking

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.400 
kind of weird mix that they're cooking
here<00:04:02.410> so<00:04:02.740> now<00:04:03.459> with<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.910> bases<00:04:03.940> don't<00:04:04.870> cut

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
here so now with the bases don't cut

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.990 
here so now with the bases don't cut
with<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.650> scissors<00:04:05.860> at<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.250> front<00:04:06.610> so<00:04:06.970> people

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
with the scissors at the front so people

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.570 
with the scissors at the front so people
always<00:04:07.480> ask<00:04:07.720> me<00:04:07.930> why<00:04:08.080> why<00:04:08.770> does<00:04:09.340> it<00:04:09.400> look<00:04:09.459> so

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
always ask me why why does it look so

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.460 
always ask me why why does it look so
easy<00:04:09.910> that<00:04:10.090> my<00:04:10.450> scissors<00:04:10.900> cut<00:04:11.110> through<00:04:11.319> things

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
easy that my scissors cut through things

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.290 
easy that my scissors cut through things
because<00:04:12.190> I<00:04:12.280> don't<00:04:12.459> use<00:04:12.640> the<00:04:12.819> front<00:04:13.090> of<00:04:13.209> the

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
because I don't use the front of the

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.940 
because I don't use the front of the
scissors<00:04:13.599> you<00:04:13.630> slide<00:04:13.990> it<00:04:14.200> all<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.650> way<00:04:14.770> back

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
scissors you slide it all the way back

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.909 
scissors you slide it all the way back
into<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:15.970> scissors<00:04:16.299> because<00:04:17.049> you're<00:04:17.769> going

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
into the scissors because you're going

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.080 
into the scissors because you're going
to<00:04:18.009> get<00:04:18.130> a<00:04:18.160> little<00:04:18.340> bit<00:04:18.459> more<00:04:18.609> leverage<00:04:18.789> it's

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
to get a little bit more leverage it's

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.849 
to get a little bit more leverage it's
gonna<00:04:19.209> be<00:04:19.299> easier<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:19.810> cut<00:04:20.079> through<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.680> wood

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
gonna be easier to cut through the wood

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.010 
gonna be easier to cut through the wood
when<00:04:21.069> you<00:04:21.190> do<00:04:21.310> this<00:04:21.459> and<00:04:21.759> you're<00:04:22.419> less<00:04:22.599> likely

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
when you do this and you're less likely

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.930 
when you do this and you're less likely
to<00:04:23.050> break<00:04:23.259> it<00:04:23.500> so<00:04:23.650> cut<00:04:23.919> it<00:04:23.949> very<00:04:24.310> slowly<00:04:24.699> you

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
to break it so cut it very slowly you

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.990 
to break it so cut it very slowly you
don't<00:04:25.150> go<00:04:26.020> very<00:04:26.259> quick<00:04:26.500> so<00:04:26.889> that<00:04:27.220> will<00:04:27.639> reduce

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
don't go very quick so that will reduce

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.900 
don't go very quick so that will reduce
the<00:04:28.180> size<00:04:28.509> of<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.720> legs<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:29.860> then<00:04:30.729> I'm<00:04:30.880> just

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
the size of the legs and then I'm just

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.330 
the size of the legs and then I'm just
going<00:04:31.180> to<00:04:31.270> stick<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.960> lid<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.770> side<00:04:33.130> of

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
going to stick the lid to the side of

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.860 
going to stick the lid to the side of
the<00:04:33.400> cauldron<00:04:33.910> just<00:04:34.120> so<00:04:34.419> there's<00:04:34.630> going<00:04:34.810> to

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
the cauldron just so there's going to

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.600 
the cauldron just so there's going to
form<00:04:35.080> one<00:04:35.229> piece<00:04:35.530> rather<00:04:35.919> than<00:04:36.250> having<00:04:36.400> to

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
form one piece rather than having to

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.100 
form one piece rather than having to
have<00:04:36.639> lots<00:04:37.090> of<00:04:37.210> different<00:04:37.509> pieces<00:04:37.660> of<00:04:37.840> stuff

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
have lots of different pieces of stuff

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.930 
have lots of different pieces of stuff
all<00:04:38.410> over<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:38.770> show<00:04:38.949> there<00:04:39.639> should<00:04:39.789> be<00:04:39.910> a

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
all over the show there should be a

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.660 
all over the show there should be a
permanent<00:04:40.240> feature<00:04:40.630> on<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.080> side

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
permanent feature on the side

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.760 
permanent feature on the side
the<00:04:41.880> cauldron<00:04:42.270> never<00:04:42.990> grabbed<00:04:43.230> some<00:04:43.530> thin

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
the cauldron never grabbed some thin

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.010 
the cauldron never grabbed some thin
cardstock<00:04:44.370> and<00:04:44.730> we'll<00:04:45.120> just<00:04:45.270> measure<00:04:45.540> out<00:04:45.780> a

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
cardstock and we'll just measure out a

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.940 
cardstock and we'll just measure out a
base<00:04:46.440> cut<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.340> out<00:04:48.020> and<00:04:49.020> apply<00:04:49.320> some<00:04:49.350> hot<00:04:49.710> glue

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
base cut it out and apply some hot glue

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.970 
base cut it out and apply some hot glue
to<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.400> bottoms<00:04:50.700> of<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.240> feet<00:04:51.830> of<00:04:52.830> the

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
to the bottoms of the feet of the

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.580 
to the bottoms of the feet of the
cauldron<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:53.610> also<00:04:54.480> to<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:54.750> bottom<00:04:54.900> of<00:04:55.200> the

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
cauldron and also to the bottom of the

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.220 
cauldron and also to the bottom of the
lid<00:04:55.980> that's<00:04:56.250> attached<00:04:56.580> on<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:56.850> side<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.750> then

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
lid that's attached on the side and then

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.710 
lid that's attached on the side and then
paste<00:04:58.770> that<00:04:58.980> down<00:04:59.040> onto<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.900> base<00:05:01.460> and<00:05:02.460> that's

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
paste that down onto the base and that's

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.930 
paste that down onto the base and that's
pretty<00:05:03.720> much<00:05:03.930> it<00:05:04.170> so<00:05:04.440> there<00:05:05.370> it<00:05:05.460> is<00:05:05.550> that's

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
pretty much it so there it is that's

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.120 
pretty much it so there it is that's
what<00:05:06.120> it<00:05:06.150> looks<00:05:06.360> like<00:05:06.540> and<00:05:06.870> now<00:05:07.830> we're<00:05:08.010> going

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
what it looks like and now we're going

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.060 
what it looks like and now we're going
to<00:05:08.190> base<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.460> black<00:05:08.880> as<00:05:09.720> in<00:05:10.140> video<00:05:10.380> three<00:05:10.710> and

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
to base it black as in video three and

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.330 
to base it black as in video three and
apply<00:05:12.030> some<00:05:12.480> paint<00:05:12.810> so<00:05:13.710> we're<00:05:14.010> going<00:05:14.100> to<00:05:14.160> mix

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
apply some paint so we're going to mix

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.610 
apply some paint so we're going to mix
up<00:05:14.550> some<00:05:14.610> white<00:05:15.330> and<00:05:15.570> black<00:05:15.750> to<00:05:16.140> make<00:05:16.290> some

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
up some white and black to make some

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.930 
up some white and black to make some
gray<00:05:16.830> and<00:05:17.190> I'm<00:05:17.250> just<00:05:17.400> going<00:05:17.550> to<00:05:17.580> apply<00:05:17.910> that

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
gray and I'm just going to apply that

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.690 
gray and I'm just going to apply that
halfway<00:05:18.450> down<00:05:18.900> so<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:19.860> base<00:05:20.100> of<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.370> cauldron

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
halfway down so the base of the cauldron

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.470 
halfway down so the base of the cauldron
will<00:05:20.970> remain<00:05:21.360> black<00:05:21.750> and<00:05:22.910> just<00:05:23.910> apply<00:05:24.240> that

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
will remain black and just apply that

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.500 
will remain black and just apply that
and<00:05:24.720> skip<00:05:25.440> whether<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:26.340> food<00:05:26.640> texture<00:05:27.090> is<00:05:27.300> and

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
and skip whether the food texture is and

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.260 
and skip whether the food texture is and
go<00:05:27.840> all<00:05:28.080> over<00:05:28.110> the<00:05:28.500> lid<00:05:28.650> and<00:05:29.130> you<00:05:30.030> want<00:05:30.210> to

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
go all over the lid and you want to

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.150 
go all over the lid and you want to
smooth<00:05:30.540> that<00:05:30.720> out<00:05:30.870> with<00:05:31.110> your<00:05:31.140> finger<00:05:31.350> just<00:05:31.740> so

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
smooth that out with your finger just so

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.950 
smooth that out with your finger just so
it<00:05:32.280> reduces<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:32.970> the<00:05:35.480> brushstroke<00:05:36.480> look<00:05:36.720> off

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
it reduces the the brushstroke look off

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.190 
it reduces the the brushstroke look off
of<00:05:37.410> the<00:05:37.590> paint<00:05:37.830> and<00:05:38.160> then<00:05:38.940> just<00:05:39.210> add<00:05:39.480> some<00:05:39.990> more

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
of the paint and then just add some more

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.490 
of the paint and then just add some more
white<00:05:40.440> and<00:05:40.860> slowly<00:05:41.810> build<00:05:42.810> up<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.260> gray

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
white and slowly build up the gray

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.410 
white and slowly build up the gray
towards<00:05:44.100> the<00:05:44.250> top<00:05:44.460> getting<00:05:44.970> lighter<00:05:45.210> and

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
towards the top getting lighter and

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.700 
towards the top getting lighter and
lighter<00:05:45.600> and<00:05:45.750> lighter<00:05:45.810> so<00:05:46.050> this<00:05:46.350> seems<00:05:46.530> there

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
lighter and lighter so this seems there

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.590 
lighter and lighter so this seems there
would<00:05:46.800> have<00:05:46.860> been<00:05:46.950> a<00:05:47.040> fire<00:05:47.340> underneath<00:05:47.640> that's

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
would have been a fire underneath that's

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.870 
would have been a fire underneath that's
black<00:05:48.990> and<00:05:49.020> into<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:49.530> base<00:05:49.710> of<00:05:49.920> the<00:05:49.980> pot<00:05:50.190> so

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
black and into the base of the pot so

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.490 
black and into the base of the pot so
now<00:05:50.970> I'm<00:05:51.060> just<00:05:51.150> applying<00:05:51.420> some<00:05:51.750> straight

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
now I'm just applying some straight

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.210 
now I'm just applying some straight
Brown<00:05:53.300> to<00:05:54.300> the<00:05:54.330> to<00:05:55.020> the<00:05:55.200> actual<00:05:55.470> food<00:05:55.800> inside

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
Brown to the to the actual food inside

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.140 
Brown to the to the actual food inside
and<00:05:56.640> running<00:05:57.000> down<00:05:57.150> the<00:05:57.330> edges<00:05:57.480> and<00:05:59.150> that's

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
and running down the edges and that's

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.910 
and running down the edges and that's
you<00:06:00.780> can<00:06:00.960> use<00:06:01.140> whatever<00:06:01.380> color<00:06:01.740> you<00:06:01.890> like

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
you can use whatever color you like

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.520 
you can use whatever color you like
really<00:06:02.580> I'm<00:06:02.790> just<00:06:03.030> I'm<00:06:03.900> sticking<00:06:04.350> with<00:06:04.380> the

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
really I'm just I'm sticking with the
