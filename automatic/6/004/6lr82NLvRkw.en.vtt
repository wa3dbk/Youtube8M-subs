doing the cayenne pepper I just don't

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.360 
doing the cayenne pepper I just don't
like<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.080> taste<00:02:33.230> of<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:33.650> what<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:33.860> do<00:02:33.950> is<00:02:34.040> I

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
like the taste of it so what I do is I

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.550 
like the taste of it so what I do is I
bought<00:02:34.640> capsules<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.600> I<00:02:35.720> just<00:02:35.960> actually<00:02:36.260> take

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
bought capsules and I just actually take

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.680 
bought capsules and I just actually take
a<00:02:36.590> capture<00:02:37.040> of<00:02:37.160> that<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.580> take<00:02:38.360> one<00:02:38.540> in<00:02:38.630> the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
a capture of that I take one in the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.200 
a capture of that I take one in the
morning<00:02:38.840> one<00:02:38.990> and<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:40.010> how<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.910> do<00:02:40.970> it

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
morning one and I and that how I do it

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.570 
morning one and I and that how I do it
so<00:02:41.690> it's<00:02:41.990> not<00:02:42.260> 100-percent<00:02:43.070> following<00:02:43.430> the

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
so it's not 100-percent following the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.210 
so it's not 100-percent following the
trick<00:02:43.790> but<00:02:44.060> that's<00:02:44.900> why<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.170> do<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.860> so

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
trick but that's why I do it so

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.490 
trick but that's why I do it so
