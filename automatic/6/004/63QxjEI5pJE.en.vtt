crept into the lead I thought it was

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.329 
crept into the lead I thought it was
still<00:01:04.229> cheap<00:01:04.439> points<00:01:04.650> behind

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339

so just brown and blue needed what a

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.399 
so just brown and blue needed what a

red<00:01:13.710> well<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.490> questioned<00:01:15.270> whether<00:01:15.299> he<00:01:15.570> even

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
red well I questioned whether he even

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.690 
red well I questioned whether he even
played<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.200> pot<00:01:16.409> but<00:01:17.159> he's<00:01:17.280> turned<00:01:17.549> this

but that is a wonderful shot from dink
and<00:03:06.440> it's<00:03:07.440> just<00:03:07.710> got<00:03:07.920> enough<00:03:08.220> space<00:03:08.550> to<00:03:08.850> go

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
and it's just got enough space to go

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.820 
and it's just got enough space to go
around<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.510> back<00:03:09.660> of<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:09.960> it's<00:03:10.410> one<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.680> those

if it was nearly the jaws there's been

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.230 
if it was nearly the jaws there's been
virtually<00:03:12.900> unmissable<00:03:13.620> but<00:03:13.950> what<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.340> it's
