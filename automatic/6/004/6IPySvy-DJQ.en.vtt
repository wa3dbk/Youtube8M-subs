00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.300
 Welcome to the second part of the old joinery as I can be right in and 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.589
 There are plans in Montpellier these days 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:11.699
 More so it says in English 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.639
 a Blue Line clouded for the tenth time 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.329
 and minstrel speak with speech bubbles work 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:22.109
 Start number at first once I've already done that 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.550
 Canceled the cancellation by 9 and announces that Hajek looks into goals and 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.359
 Enlarge Zander so much as in the template 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.800
 and when we did that, CDs still make the bigger ones 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.270
 that together 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.270
 two pictures 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.810
 then we have that how can of course arbitrary in size 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.810
 change 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.080
 Sins come to brawls we have three choices below 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.310
 Focus point Explor and Cachaça 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.840
 Capture also knows how to capture her Palmetshofer 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.380
 recognize 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.790
 I do not have it now 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.790
 and games we can search them in Veneto 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.640
 others my livelihood have more choices in the focus of the people 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.590
 To take pictures 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.390
 the forehead Odenthal Gómez Month Explorer and now from the start view 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.740
 Munich saved a few pictures 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.740
 Among other things, the Santa Claus take the team 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.590
 APA 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.150
 expressly one of a bat jungle we can here 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 the goal as we would like 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.090
 and Trier also still customize children 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.400
 so if we did that we could have come to the speech bubbles 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.610
 For example, this could be done here once 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.240
 to insert a normal speech bubble 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.590
 and that comes now and the first trial round the against each other 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.419
 Hann 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.419
 very funny 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:21.599
 and Hero we do something else again, for example, he something more meaningful 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.709
 is 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.709
 Now do not be angry below 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:35.009
 we watch these balloons far away from the track possibilities 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.399
 use and the whole thing happens then simply by drag and drop 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:42.179
 of course you want to have Mainz you can pull it bigger, so that 

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:45.439
 It makes it fun and you can start the speech bubbles 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:48.209
 fits the skis 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.379
 SCIS does not always have to be more direct to me, but just in front of it so that something 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.590
 in between is free 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.590
 Sit down turn lights Grundig 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:00.029
 that's fast telling everyone 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:03.439
 that is mine 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.699
 and here we can put it in the same way again 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:11.859
 and what is now in Coles one can also cross the subject Herne 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.859
 you just have to go this way 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.959
 and now we have the picture border already mentioned and that looks exactly the same 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.609
 come out like a real one 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.170
 so now everyone can do something 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.239
 and they can just insert that 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.709
 many doctors do not 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.839
 the Gezerre Berlin 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:31.989
 a serve 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.909
 and now they are wondering what that is supposed to be and now he can just blister 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.679
 do so 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:41.909
 Zehnder once said that her son is different 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.829
 Canada Place or simply solution 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.709
 then make sootworm 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.709
 Now anyone can pass this sentence 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:59.559
 the 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:04.579
 and Spirk Anna then just as Simon Cziommer 

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:07.679
 they can easily 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.679
 what is that supposed to be writing 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:17.189
 pointless but since when is comic around with very pretty 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:20.189
 in the case I mean that's what that is supposed to be 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:22.610
 I 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.200
 and already the Irish have 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.939
 our little come 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:29.729
 and now you can just get back on the trend 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:31.960
 a new one was more 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.480
 and already El Sheikh opens all the talk was out and have 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.029
 your own concept 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:40.840
 and yes that was part two 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.330
 and that was actually none 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.699
 If you have any questions about the same thing, Chile is too expensive or 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.520
 write Frankens answers just there 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.710
 Write your comment and communication of the videos 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.850
 is first time a guest shoots
