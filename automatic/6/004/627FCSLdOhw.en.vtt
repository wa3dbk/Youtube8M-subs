 tech michelle friend tec my 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.660
 name is mario and today we are going to 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.460
 see an application of the category 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.980
 photography this application is called 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.560
 You can download the photos directly from 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.180
 the google play app or windows app 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.650
 phone in this case the three options 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.750
 for our devices work 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.550
 perfectly the best of all is that it is 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.470
 free however there is an application 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.360
 that has a cost 79 that is paid 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.340
 but with the free you will be able to do 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.019
 everything that I am going to show you before 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.000
 can see what is the option for what 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.550
 that is our phone I want 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.379
 show them that the official page 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.440
 photos.com in it you will be able to find 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.720
 a certain variety of options for 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.250
 to be able to touch up your photographs is 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.390
 true that not all the time all one 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.250
 has a device for the cairn 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.930
 you find an image that you would like 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.210
 make a collage to do some retouching 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.280
 add a filter and be able to work 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.170
 in a simple way and also free 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.030
 and that you can add to your 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.100
 device plus you can 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.840
 handle it on a pc or you can use it 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.190
 in one hand what interests me is that 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.049
 you can find different 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.040
 varieties of options to be able 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.690
 to work 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.250
 now that we are in the application of 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.960
 for in this case the photo application 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.030
 What you can do is that there are two 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.070
 options the first is that there is a gray 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.810
 free there is one that is paid the 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.380
 payment then to 39 pesos are more or less 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.730
 about three dollars and really the 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.440
 payment application the download for 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.930
 try it and bayern to see if he could 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.670
 talk about it but the free one brings 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.290
 all options do not need anything else 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.450
 besides that with what they like in the 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.580
 page really is very complete 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.110
 this application remembers the one of 39 pesos 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.820
 what it allows you is that you can create 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.380
 everything from scratch that is to say you can 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.600
 add your type of lines after 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.300
 add funds you can add frames 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.130
 you create your sun and everything that you 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.869
 like and instead the rule for free 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.430
 everything has predetermined and there is no 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.540
 than to configure more than what it gives you without 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.400
 need in which you can handle 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.830
 a series of menus in which you have 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.440
 some some types of images we're going 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.390
 to add this to the microphone and it handles you 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.830
 several instructions that the truth is 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.619
 very good and face and what is 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.390
 free is the option height are the 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.570
 border types you can add you 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.820
 in this case to your image you can 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.580
 cut it out like the other images 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.350
 complete 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.450
 the fading and that only 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.770
 see a part of what is essential 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.020
 the microphone everything else looks 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.360
 so you can give them a little bit 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.850
 I like this one more because it has several 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.260
 options not just one goes to one 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.970
 the cut you can add lead effects 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.040
 and those are the basic ones the difference of 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.460
 the payment is that you create all this the 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.620
 edge and that you can dedicate 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.140
 and we're going to add the option to rotate 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.810
 if I want to change the image 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.830
 if I want to change it sideways and all this 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.020
 what am I doing with this application 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.440
 that really to me to my liking is 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.750
 free and it is very complete 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.850
 some types of scenes this by 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.380
 example here comes demo options in 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.450
 which you will have to decide if 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.610
 buy those options but if not 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.810
 they want to buy is not necessary just like 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.190
 that the vouchers as discussed 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.860
 option to edit you can add 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.720
 some types of effects to your images 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.390
 you can adjust what can you give him what is 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.680
 the rotation the handling of the effects that 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.760
 are the ones in this case the basics does not bring 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.040
 but with that I think that they will be able to 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.140
 do many things as well as power 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.130
 create a type of border if there is some type 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.230
 of stylish mold we can create this and 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.660
 can you create what is some 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.880
 effects of those blurring so 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.590
 that are some images that everything 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.350
 others look like blurring and the part 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.970
 from the inside it looks complete if that is a 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.220
 very good option can be by lines 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.830
 Well, if you want to highlight something and everything else 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.030
 that is blurred and all this well 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.650
 in the free option since you have 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.640
 finished you can share it with the 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.460
 right side button 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.260
 facebook twitter save the image or 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.030
 you can save it and save it in your 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.130
 photo section 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.100
 if we go back to what it is in this case 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.600
 we're going to give her that yes let's save her 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.270
 to return in this case also to what 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.580
 is our little house the little house is like 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.050
 option of return menu since it 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.600
 saved the image we're going to go in this 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.850
 case to tails and tails is the same as 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.459
 I showed on page 1 you are going to 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.230
 add different photos the only thing 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.799
 you have to charge them are the edges add 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.560
 the images the themes that you want 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.790
 handle and the photo box option that is 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.230
 It is where they go when all your 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.570
 photographs so that you can 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.850
 import or you can continue to take more 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.560
 photos I think it is a very very good 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.510
 option is a good bits tool 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.580
 a very good tool besides that 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.180
 allows you to make different types of 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.830
 effects 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.050
