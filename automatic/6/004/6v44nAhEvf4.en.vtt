00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.569
 hi friends with you parkin frezer and 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.300
 Now I begin a series of installation of the fence 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.400
 from A to Z 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.250
 the fence will look like this 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.880
 way this is the front side I'm on it 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:23.760
 tested all the technology that you need 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:28.699
 mean when installing the fence and now 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:34.399
 then proceed to install the fence 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:38.610
 on 2 means side by side 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:43.190
 This means that the first thing is not on 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:48.510
 do the first thing you need to drill 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:53.039
 angular pillar to the other side means y 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.250
 me he already installed how to do it you 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:02.730
 can look at my channel here 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:04.729
 it is already installed and how you see the pillar 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.890
 profile pipe 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:13.729
 fifty fifty inside a dad 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:17.310
 it is covered with concrete and why is it angular 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:23.790
 table on so sorry dog ​​barks here 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.680
 very much I'll go back to that 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.530
 side and show 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.530
 that means you need to do the first thing 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:43.470
 so the first thing was welded here 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:46.380
 This is a small ring in the middle 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.020
 a pillar at its very top 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.549
 here and using a small loop was 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.579
 wire is inserted into this ring 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.500
 steel wire glow diameter 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.810
 approximately millimeter steel 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.039
 wire here is such a hatch 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.940
 there is a surplus 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:14.790
 here it means the wire is fixed 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:18.140
 But for such a fixture, well , it is tight 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.370
 to the opposite post on 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.640
 opposite the post I'll go up now 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.660
 and show there is the same ring 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:32.580
 which is located the middlemen of the pillar and 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:35.220
 wire under the weight of 5 bricks stretched 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.950
 in this little ring and with the help of bricks 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.260
 stretched why stretched precisely with 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.690
 using bricks because it is not enough 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.250
 some kind of sagging wire bricks 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.340
 always him and this cork tightened and 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.680
 stretched to a certain elasticity 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.579
 I will try to speak louder to 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:02.849
 switch the dog here you see this 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:04.819
 tick and here's the wire means 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:09.290
 goes through this little ring and 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:13.950
 stretched here these bricks 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:18.739
 weight I think about 20 kilograms of these 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.739
 bricks and they pull this string 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:29.700
 so pretty tense enough if 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.400
 Look here in a straight line I do not know what 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.630
 I can hardly see but in general 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.739
 sag minimum sag 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:43.709
 minimal it means he can prove 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.980
 like that the fence that was made by 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.740
 the same technology 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.580
 that's him 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:57.350
 straightness and very high so 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:04:02.990
 It means that further on it will mean 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:06.500
 us preparing to dig the first channel and 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:09.860
 I will not accept the ditches from the first post. 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.800
 to drill with a drill 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.050
 use this wire like this 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.800
 Landmark on it I will be equal 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:21.650
 for all the following ones would be here in 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.870
 about 20 meters the span length of this 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.990
 post and will be installed 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.480
 if we count the corner pillars along with 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.150
 Here is this pillar and the extreme will 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.230
 I have 8 pillars 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:38.980
 approximately span between the pillars 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:42.050
 will be equal to three meters the soil here 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:47.320
 clay bog tap dance so i will 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:51.410
 drill to a depth of 1 whole 70s to 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:54.710
 became the table stood exactly and nowhere 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:58.090
 licked lisap and the fence while serving 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.680
 long and nowhere to say so 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:05.390
 Thank you for your attention was pashkin 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:09.460
 frezer this series installation of the fence 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.460
 hands from A to Z
