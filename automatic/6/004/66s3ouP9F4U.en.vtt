so the first one is how high is a very

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.450 
so the first one is how high is a very
rare<00:00:39.420> ounded<00:00:39.809> deck<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.469> saw<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.860> was<00:00:40.950> very<00:00:41.190> I

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
rare ounded deck as we saw it was very I

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.770 
rare ounded deck as we saw it was very I
had<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> very<00:00:41.940> strong<00:00:42.149> performance<00:00:42.629> on

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
had a very strong performance on

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.270 
had a very strong performance on
Nationals<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.500> did<00:00:43.590> not<00:00:43.770> get<00:00:43.920> hit<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
Nationals and it did not get hit on the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.950 
Nationals and it did not get hit on the
list<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.879> think<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.360> will<00:00:45.480> still<00:00:45.690> continue

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
list so I think it will still continue

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.170 
list so I think it will still continue
to<00:00:46.110> do<00:00:46.379> well<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.829> has<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> very<00:00:47.520> strong<00:00:47.820> grind

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
tired of this deck as I said before

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.140 
tired of this deck as I said before
because<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:08.460> been<00:01:08.640> around<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> while

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
but I think it's still one of the best x

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.679 
but I think it's still one of the best x

things like mythic rulers run like the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.800 
things like mythic rulers run like the
mythics<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.000> same<00:01:48.180> concept<00:01:48.659> they're

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
mythics it's the same concept they're

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.270 
mythics it's the same concept they're
both<00:01:48.990> really<00:01:49.409> good<00:01:49.500> decks<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> thing<00:01:50.130> with

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
both really good decks the thing with

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.520 
both really good decks the thing with
lights<00:01:50.579> ones<00:01:50.880> though<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.720> does<00:01:52.110> heavily

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
lights ones though is that does heavily

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.870 
lights ones though is that does heavily
rely<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.009> milling<00:01:53.280> concept<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
rely on the milling concept and the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.340 
rely on the milling concept and the
reason<00:01:54.149> why<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.299> don't<00:01:54.479> feel<00:01:54.659> comfortable<00:01:54.899> with

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
reason why I don't feel comfortable with

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.780 
reason why I don't feel comfortable with
bringing<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> major<00:01:56.189> event<00:01:56.460> is

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
bringing that to a major event is

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.810 
bringing that to a major event is
because<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.149> don't<00:01:57.450> want<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.689> lose<00:01:57.930> around<00:01:58.820> say

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
because I don't want to lose around say

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.910 
because I don't want to lose around say
game<00:02:00.149> one<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.420> brick<00:02:00.719> terribly<00:02:01.110> game<00:02:01.380> two<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.619> win

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
game one I brick terribly game two I win

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.350 
game one I brick terribly game two I win
and<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.189> game<00:02:02.340> three<00:02:02.369> after<00:02:02.700> rely<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.210> not

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
and in game three after rely on not

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.420 
and in game three after rely on not
breaking<00:02:03.719> again<00:02:03.930> which<00:02:04.110> really<00:02:04.350> sucks<00:02:04.649> with

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
breaking again which really sucks with

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.800 
breaking again which really sucks with
mythic<00:02:05.729> rulers<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.149> really<00:02:06.420> like<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.689> too

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
because they have easy access to phil

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.040 
because they have easy access to phil

gramm which is amazing card but that

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.470 
gramm which is amazing card but that

think I like about prophecy though is

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.630 
think I like about prophecy though is
that<00:02:34.490> you<00:02:36.680> you<00:02:37.680> can<00:02:37.860> have<00:02:38.010> like<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.190> really<00:02:38.400> bad

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
that you you can have like a really bad

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.610 
that you you can have like a really bad
hand<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.180> draw<00:02:39.330> one<00:02:39.600> secret<00:02:39.990> to<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.170> magician

and<00:02:40.800> make<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.460> tent<00:02:41.700> totally<00:02:42.600> good<00:02:42.750> but<00:02:42.930> the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
and make that tent totally good but the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.660 
and make that tent totally good but the
thing<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.200> that's<00:02:43.800> changing<00:02:44.310> from<00:02:44.460> mass

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
thing is that's changing from mass

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.580 
thing is that's changing from mass
formats<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.270> we<00:02:45.330> have<00:02:45.600> this<00:02:45.750> new<00:02:45.960> draw<00:02:46.290> rule

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
formats that we have this new draw rule

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.560 
formats that we have this new draw rule
and<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:46.860> forget<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.400> didn't<00:02:47.730> mention<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.330> for

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
and I forget I didn't mention that for

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.660 
and I forget I didn't mention that for
the<00:02:48.630> other<00:02:48.750> dicks<00:02:49.050> but<00:02:49.620> especially<00:02:49.890> let's<00:02:50.550> go

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
the other dicks but especially let's go

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.100 
the other dicks but especially let's go
back<00:02:50.850> from<00:02:51.060> mermail<00:02:51.390> for<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.600> second<00:02:51.900> sir<00:02:51.990> I'm

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.660 
back from mermail for a second sir I'm
skipping<00:02:52.350> backwards<00:02:52.890> but<00:02:53.040> mermail<00:02:53.400> like<00:02:53.580> it

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
skipping backwards but mermail like it

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.370 
skipping backwards but mermail like it
also<00:02:54.060> like<00:02:54.270> this<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.540> an<00:02:54.630> example<00:02:54.870> why<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.170> feel

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
also like this is an example why I feel

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.260 
also like this is an example why I feel
like<00:02:55.470> it's<00:02:55.650> strong<00:02:55.890> because<00:02:56.220> going<00:02:56.880> first<00:02:57.120> or

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
like it's strong because going first or

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.610 
like it's strong because going first or
sucking<00:02:57.600> like<00:02:57.720> going<00:02:57.960> first<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.380> get<00:02:58.500> to

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
sucking like going first you get to

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.960 
sucking like going first you get to
establish<00:02:59.070> your<00:02:59.250> place<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.670> make<00:02:59.760> sure<00:02:59.790> they

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
establish your place and make sure they

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.970 
establish your place and make sure they
go<00:03:00.090> through<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.540> going<00:03:00.780> second<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.650> get<00:03:01.800> that

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
go through and going second you get that

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.530 
go through and going second you get that
extra<00:03:02.250> card<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.820> get<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.060> pop<00:03:03.270> things

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
extra card and you get to pop things

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.970 
extra card and you get to pop things
with<00:03:03.690> things<00:03:03.840> like<00:03:03.900> marksmen<00:03:04.380> infantry<00:03:04.860> and

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
with things like marksmen infantry and

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.650 
with things like marksmen infantry and
stuff<00:03:05.100> so<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.250> feel<00:03:05.430> like<00:03:05.490> the<00:03:05.670> deck<00:03:06.150> has<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.390> very

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
stuff so I feel like the deck has a very

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.300 
stuff so I feel like the deck has a very
strong<00:03:06.870> boy<00:03:07.080> first<00:03:07.380> or<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.560> second<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.190> know

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
strong boy first or a second you know

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.740 
strong boy first or a second you know
and<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:08.520> goes<00:03:08.700> for<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:08.970> same<00:03:09.180> was<00:03:09.390> with<00:03:09.540> hat

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
and that goes for the same was with hat

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.600 
and that goes for the same was with hat
I<00:03:09.990> think<00:03:10.260> that's<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.470> little<00:03:10.590> bit<00:03:10.830> uh<00:03:11.010> with

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
I think that's a little bit uh with

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.130 
I think that's a little bit uh with
light<00:03:11.820> when<00:03:12.090> it's<00:03:12.210> kind<00:03:12.390> of<00:03:12.510> same<00:03:12.660> concept

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
light when it's kind of same concept

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.380 
light when it's kind of same concept
because<00:03:13.410> going<00:03:13.710> first<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.760> get<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.060> make<00:03:15.210> sure

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
because going first you get to make sure

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.730 
because going first you get to make sure
you're<00:03:15.510> recharged<00:03:15.930> plays<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.350> everything<00:03:16.620> go

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
you're recharged plays and everything go

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.440 
you're recharged plays and everything go
through<00:03:16.980> if<00:03:17.550> you<00:03:17.670> go<00:03:17.760> second<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.150> get<00:03:18.270> that

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
through if you go second you get that

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.300 
through if you go second you get that
extra<00:03:18.660> card<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.020> know<00:03:19.140> however<00:03:19.950> with<00:03:20.100> lights

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
extra card you know however with lights

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.680 
extra card you know however with lights
ones<00:03:20.550> I<00:03:20.670> think<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.910> kind<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.180> sucks<00:03:21.450> going

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
ones I think it kind of sucks going

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.150 
ones I think it kind of sucks going
second<00:03:22.050> because<00:03:22.230> if<00:03:22.350> they<00:03:22.440> have<00:03:22.530> answers<00:03:23.010> to

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
second because if they have answers to

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.620 
second because if they have answers to
your<00:03:23.250> normal<00:03:23.459> summons<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:23.970> kareeb<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.480> a

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
your normal summons I kareeb and a

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.970 
your normal summons I kareeb and a
Lumina<00:03:25.020> it<00:03:25.110> makes<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.410> back<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.530> little<00:03:25.650> bit

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
Lumina it makes it back a little bit

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.890 
Lumina it makes it back a little bit
weaker<00:03:26.310> with<00:03:26.940> prophecy<00:03:27.390> I<00:03:27.510> think<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:27.810> would

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
weaker with prophecy I think it would

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.449 
weaker with prophecy I think it would
kind<00:03:28.110> of<00:03:28.170> suck<00:03:28.410> going<00:03:28.680> first<00:03:28.920> with<00:03:29.100> those<00:03:29.220> five

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
kind of suck going first with those five

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.010 
kind of suck going first with those five

is<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.850> good<00:03:33.030> chance<00:03:33.330> but<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.570> know<00:03:33.660> sometimes

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
is a good chance but you know sometimes

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.990 
is a good chance but you know sometimes
it<00:03:34.290> would<00:03:34.380> be<00:03:34.440> very<00:03:34.620> unfortunate<00:03:35.250> what

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
it would be very unfortunate what

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.340 
it would be very unfortunate what
processing<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:36.480> actually<00:03:36.630> might<00:03:36.990> like<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.320> go

evilswarm because i feel like the deck

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.140 
evilswarm because i feel like the deck
is<00:04:10.860> extremely<00:04:11.340> linear<00:04:11.520> and<00:04:11.790> to<00:04:11.880> play<00:04:12.030> around

it's one of the mote it sly qone of the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.979

worst X you know I would play like I

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.570 
worst X you know I would play like I
guess<00:04:19.200> like<00:04:19.230> it's<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.620> good<00:04:19.739> medical<00:04:20.160> at<00:04:20.340> times

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
guess like it's a good medical at times

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.700 
guess like it's a good medical at times
but<00:04:20.880> you<00:04:21.030> know<00:04:21.150> that<00:04:21.960> definitely<00:04:22.320> has<00:04:22.500> its

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
but you know that definitely has its

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.040 
but you know that definitely has its
flaws<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.580> next<00:04:23.850> deck<00:04:24.000> even<00:04:24.570> though<00:04:24.780> I<00:04:24.810> got

flaws the next deck even though I got

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.360 
flaws the next deck even though I got
here

I'm gonna put your gear on my top 10 and
the<00:04:27.199> reason<00:04:27.470> why<00:04:27.590> is<00:04:27.620> because<00:04:27.830> I<00:04:28.040> still<00:04:28.370> think

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
the reason why is because I still think

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.530

you can really run into some trouble so

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.909 
you can really run into some trouble so
that's<00:05:14.750> one<00:05:14.960> of<00:05:14.990> the<00:05:15.110> major<00:05:15.260> problems<00:05:15.410> I<00:05:15.800> have

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
that's one of the major problems I have

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.320 
that's one of the major problems I have
with<00:05:15.949> that<00:05:16.220> deck<00:05:16.430> but<00:05:16.639> I<00:05:16.669> still<00:05:16.910> think<00:05:17.120> it's<00:05:17.240> in

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
with that deck but I still think it's in

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.029 
with that deck but I still think it's in
the<00:05:17.419> top<00:05:17.570> ten<00:05:17.630> definitely<00:05:18.289> like<00:05:18.440> a<00:05:18.590> jelly<00:05:18.830> such

tricks it's very similar to have
obviously<00:05:28.850> instead<00:05:29.210> of<00:05:29.270> hands<00:05:29.450> you<00:05:29.630> play<00:05:29.780> a

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
obviously instead of hands you play a

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.110 
obviously instead of hands you play a
fire<00:05:30.050> fist<00:05:30.349> engine<00:05:30.680> and<00:05:30.860> i<00:05:31.550> really<00:05:31.849> like<00:05:31.970> this

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
deck too because I do feel like it has a

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.620 
deck too because I do feel like it has a
strong<00:05:33.770> going<00:05:34.070> first<00:05:34.430> or<00:05:34.580> second<00:05:34.910> like<00:05:35.060> going

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
strong going first or second like going

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.719 
strong going first or second like going
first<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:36.560> can<00:05:36.680> always<00:05:36.770> activate<00:05:37.190> tanky<00:05:37.580> and

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
first you can always activate tanky and

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.520 
first you can always activate tanky and
get<00:05:37.849> that<00:05:38.000> extra<00:05:38.180> card<00:05:38.450> you<00:05:38.599> know<00:05:38.720> make<00:05:39.410> sure

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
get that extra card you know make sure

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.870 
get that extra card you know make sure
your<00:05:39.650> ten<00:05:39.800> keys<00:05:39.979> go<00:05:40.099> through<00:05:40.370> and<00:05:40.520> stuff<00:05:40.729> and

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
your ten keys go through and stuff and

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.219 
your ten keys go through and stuff and
then<00:05:41.000> you<00:05:41.090> can<00:05:41.210> like<00:05:41.300> set<00:05:41.570> traps<00:05:41.810> and<00:05:41.990> all<00:05:42.080> that

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
then you can like set traps and all that

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.879 
then you can like set traps and all that
however<00:05:42.440> going<00:05:42.830> on<00:05:43.990> going<00:05:44.990> second<00:05:45.410> I<00:05:45.500> guess<00:05:45.680> if

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
however going on going second I guess if

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.440 
however going on going second I guess if
you<00:05:46.010> ran<00:05:46.220> things<00:05:46.430> like<00:05:46.639> Forbidden<00:05:47.060> Lands<00:05:47.270> and

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
you ran things like Forbidden Lands and

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.640 
you ran things like Forbidden Lands and
stuff<00:05:47.599> the<00:05:47.690> thing<00:05:47.810> about<00:05:47.960> going<00:05:48.110> seconds<00:05:48.560> that

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
stuff the thing about going seconds that

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.080 
stuff the thing about going seconds that
you<00:05:48.710> get<00:05:48.830> the<00:05:48.919> extra<00:05:49.190> car<00:05:49.370> but<00:05:49.550> then<00:05:49.669> you're

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
you get the extra car but then you're

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.150 
you get the extra car but then you're
more<00:05:50.240> vulnerable<00:05:50.810> to<00:05:51.020> your<00:05:51.139> opponent's<00:05:51.680> traps

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
more vulnerable to your opponent's traps

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.370 
more vulnerable to your opponent's traps
and<00:05:52.370> stuff<00:05:52.550> so<00:05:53.090> that's<00:05:53.479> a<00:05:53.599> thing<00:05:53.750> too<00:05:53.960> and<00:05:54.199> then

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
and stuff so that's a thing too and then

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.800 
and stuff so that's a thing too and then
the<00:05:54.560> tenth<00:05:54.800> one<00:05:55.070> is<00:05:55.280> sylvan<00:05:55.880> now<00:05:56.060> sylvan<00:05:56.570> is

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
the tenth one is sylvan now sylvan is

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.180 
the tenth one is sylvan now sylvan is
something<00:05:57.260> I<00:05:57.349> thought<00:05:57.560> was<00:05:57.740> going<00:05:57.979> to<00:05:58.070> do<00:05:58.160> a

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
something I thought was going to do a

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.830 
something I thought was going to do a
lot<00:05:58.370> better<00:05:58.550> at<00:05:58.789> Nationals<00:05:59.330> to<00:05:59.419> be<00:05:59.539> on<00:05:59.660> it's

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
lot better at Nationals to be on it's

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.870 
lot better at Nationals to be on it's
like<00:06:00.050> a<00:06:00.250> lot<00:06:01.250> of<00:06:01.340> the<00:06:01.430> better<00:06:01.610> players

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
like a lot of the better players

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.370 
like a lot of the better players
repairing<00:06:02.389> Sylvan<00:06:02.810> and<00:06:02.960> I<00:06:03.020> think<00:06:03.229> the<00:06:03.349> reason

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
repairing Sylvan and I think the reason

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.330 
repairing Sylvan and I think the reason
why<00:06:03.770> we<00:06:03.949> didn't<00:06:04.130> see<00:06:04.250> as<00:06:04.430> as<00:06:05.180> much<00:06:06.020> as<00:06:06.199> like<00:06:06.440> a

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
why we didn't see as as much as like a

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.180 
why we didn't see as as much as like a
very<00:06:07.789> good<00:06:08.380> outcome<00:06:09.380> from<00:06:09.590> the<00:06:09.889> people

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
very good outcome from the people

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.589 
very good outcome from the people
playing<00:06:10.370> this<00:06:10.520> deck<00:06:10.699> is<00:06:10.729> because<00:06:11.210> it<00:06:11.449> does

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 
playing this deck is because it does

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:12.820 
playing this deck is because it does
rickel<00:06:11.960> I<00:06:12.050> you<00:06:12.110> know<00:06:12.260> it<00:06:12.380> does<00:06:12.530> have<00:06:12.680> its

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
rickel I you know it does have its

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.529 
rickel I you know it does have its
problems<00:06:13.010> like<00:06:13.340> when<00:06:13.820> it<00:06:13.910> does<00:06:14.060> get<00:06:14.240> going

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
problems like when it does get going

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.240 
problems like when it does get going
it's<00:06:14.780> really<00:06:15.080> good<00:06:15.260> like<00:06:15.470> you<00:06:15.650> go<00:06:15.770> into<00:06:16.010> fell

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
that's what I really like about the deck

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.450 
that's what I really like about the deck
it's<00:06:26.690> pretty<00:06:27.380> difficult<00:06:27.650> to<00:06:27.949> play<00:06:28.099> I<00:06:28.130> won't

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
it's pretty difficult to play I won't

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.089 
it's pretty difficult to play I won't
lie<00:06:28.639> like<00:06:28.880> if<00:06:29.060> you<00:06:29.180> say<00:06:29.449> it's<00:06:29.660> not<00:06:29.870> I<00:06:30.080> feel<00:06:30.919> free

to<00:06:31.250> disagree<00:06:31.490> with<00:06:31.610> me<00:06:31.789> but<00:06:31.820> i<00:06:31.970> believe<00:06:32.060> the

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 
to disagree with me but i believe the

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.360 
to disagree with me but i believe the
deck<00:06:32.570> is<00:06:32.720> more<00:06:32.930> complicated<00:06:33.260> to<00:06:33.500> play<00:06:33.680> than

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
deck is more complicated to play than

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.070 
deck is more complicated to play than
something<00:06:34.610> like<00:06:34.760> gear<00:06:35.090> gear<00:06:35.300> for<00:06:35.479> sure<00:06:35.599> like<00:06:35.840> I

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
something like gear gear for sure like I

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.390 
something like gear gear for sure like I
think<00:06:36.320> Sylvan<00:06:36.650> so<00:06:36.800> you<00:06:36.860> definitely<00:06:37.130> have<00:06:37.370> to

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
think Sylvan so you definitely have to

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.770 
think Sylvan so you definitely have to
get<00:06:37.550> used<00:06:37.729> to<00:06:37.880> sure<00:06:38.090> you're<00:06:38.240> gonna<00:06:38.330> play<00:06:38.539> that

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
get used to sure you're gonna play that

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.360 
get used to sure you're gonna play that
that<00:06:38.900> make<00:06:39.410> sure<00:06:39.560> you<00:06:39.650> practice<00:06:39.800> it<00:06:40.070> and<00:06:40.190> get

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
that make sure you practice it and get

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.680 
that make sure you practice it and get
used<00:06:40.520> to<00:06:40.610> all<00:06:40.639> the<00:06:40.910> combos<00:06:41.240> because<00:06:41.570> it's
