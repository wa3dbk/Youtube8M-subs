00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:23.099
 Hello everyone today, let's talk about how 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:27.520
 remove here such windows pop-up 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:30.310
 some thread of error or just some 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.860
 a program that does not work already but 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.110
 it is available for download and every time 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.260
 only you reboot the computer or 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.720
 loads the operating system you 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.750
 pops up like this window 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.640
 they may be different 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:52.809
 on top of what is written and remember this 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.210
 The name here has jumped out the index 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.190
 writes stopped the program Yandex 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.309
 but this is most likely when it is 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.230
 downloaded on the Internet forgot checkboxes 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.100
 remove some kind of program and she 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.960
 automatically went to autoload 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.290
 what can be done in this case in 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:17.740
 first close this program further 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.520
 go to the control panel I have 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.110
 control panel right on the table icon 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.070
 by the way how to do it I already had 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.810
 shot video if you are looking, see 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.070
 very comfortable when on the table but since 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:36.540
 This not all have I will show so 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:40.510
 as it is in the installed system 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.640
 windows 7 without displaying this panel on 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.450
 Desktop 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:52.200
 So go to the start menu go panel 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:56.050
 control here not to look long 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.120
 what we need to go on the cat 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.150
 Search 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:11.910
 and here in this window we type 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:17.090
 administration and stretching 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.090
 Here we have an administration 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.920
 click on this link 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:29.330
 a new window has opened 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:34.610
 system administration here we find 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:40.560
 system configuration and open it 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:45.720
 double click on this link here 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.520
 opened in system configuration here 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.960
 there are different tabs but at the moment 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.410
 we are interested in 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:57.420
 autoload go to this tab 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:00.270
 and look and see what we are there 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.100
 remembered the index here is present and 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:08.000
 checkbox is ticked 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:11.400
 so that more she did not jump out 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.080
 didn't unnerve us as they say well 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.280
 how when popping up just this one 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:20.820
 such a window can be very much with 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:25.760
 time and very remove the tick remove 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:31.160
 check button to apply 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:35.850
 if the antivirus program requests it means 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:40.620
 give him good to resolve after that 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.120
 press the ok button and see write to 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.769
 changes take effect may 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.680
 need to restart computers 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:52.739
 can cancel for reboot then 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.730
 just when you reboot the system 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:04:01.500
 or reboot this window with 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.420
 the warning will no longer appear here 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.200
 in this way 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:14.489
 can find such pop-up windows when 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:17.470
 boot the system and disable them such 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.120
 There are many nuances in the operating room 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.609
 systems 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.190
 we will consider all of them therefore 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:28.300
 subscribe to my channel put 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:32.280
 likes and dislikes and to 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.280
