British main base on this while it's a

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.210 
British main base on this while it's a
big<00:00:24.000> deal<00:00:24.269> it's<00:00:24.689> more<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.199> an<00:00:25.289> opportunity<00:00:25.680> to

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
useful thing all on its own but it

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.000 
useful thing all on its own but it
allows<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.870> if<00:00:34.380> you've<00:00:34.559> got<00:00:34.800> lots

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
allows you to do is if you've got lots

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.520 
allows you to do is if you've got lots
of<00:00:35.250> people<00:00:35.460> who<00:00:35.700> spawn<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.870> at<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.110> back<00:00:37.260> base

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
of people who spawn in at the back base

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.610 
of people who spawn in at the back base
with<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.280> allows<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.760> get<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.969> foothold

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
with you it allows you to get a foothold

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.580 
with you it allows you to get a foothold
and<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.980> draws<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.149> enemy<00:00:42.629> away<00:00:43.170> from<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
and it draws the enemy away from the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.340 
and it draws the enemy away from the
front<00:00:43.860> lines<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> middle<00:00:44.719> which<00:00:45.719> enables

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
front lines in the middle which enables

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.590 
front lines in the middle which enables
other<00:00:46.530> people<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.129> your<00:00:47.280> team<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.760> make<00:00:48.360> real

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
other people on your team to make real

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.350 
other people on your team to make real
progress<00:00:48.809> they're<00:00:49.530> usually<00:00:50.399> just<00:00:50.670> taking<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
progress they're usually just taking the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.840 
progress they're usually just taking the
back<00:00:51.510> base<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:52.079> its<00:00:52.230> own<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:53.160> may<00:00:53.340> invite<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
back base on its own it may invite the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.060 
back base on its own it may invite the
enemy<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.510> retake<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.440> quick<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
enemy to just retake it really quick and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.250 
enemy to just retake it really quick and
it<00:00:56.550> usually<00:00:56.910> takes<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.329> while<00:00:57.539> for<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.109> have

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
it usually takes a while for it to have

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.229 
it usually takes a while for it to have
an<00:00:58.379> effect<00:00:58.500> because<00:00:59.160> there's<00:00:59.460> two<00:00:59.789> tanks

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
an effect because there's two tanks

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.670 
an effect because there's two tanks
that's<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> main<00:01:01.109> base<00:01:01.320> that's

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
that's going to the main base that's

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.100 
that's going to the main base that's
what<00:01:01.829> makes<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.629> makes<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.780> such<00:01:03.989> an

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
what makes it so makes it such an

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.750 
what makes it so makes it such an
important<00:01:04.530> base<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:04.949> got<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> heavy<00:01:05.369> tank

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
important base it's got the heavy tank

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.539 
important base it's got the heavy tank
and<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.659> light<00:01:06.869> tank<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.920> course<00:01:08.220> there<00:01:08.460> are

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
and one light tank of course there are

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.370 
and one light tank of course there are
three<00:01:08.880> other<00:01:09.060> tanks<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.659> spawn<00:01:09.930> at<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
three other tanks that spawn at the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.590 
three other tanks that spawn at the
capturable<00:01:11.010> bases

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
capturable bases

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.580 
capturable bases
so<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:14.460> gonna<00:01:14.670> take<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> while<00:01:15.300> to<00:01:15.590> destroy

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
so it's gonna take a while to destroy

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.920 
so it's gonna take a while to destroy
the<00:01:17.070> tanks<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.150> had<00:01:18.330> already<00:01:18.510> been<00:01:18.780> taken

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the tanks that had already been taken

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.320 
the tanks that had already been taken
from<00:01:19.260> the<00:01:19.380> main<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.430> respawn<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
from the main this is the respawn of the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.300 
from the main this is the respawn of the
main<00:01:21.510> and<00:01:21.870> then<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.410> you've<00:01:22.590> still<00:01:22.920> got<00:01:23.160> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
main and then if you've still got the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.340 
main and then if you've still got the
main<00:01:23.520> at<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.820> point<00:01:24.120> then<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.140> take

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
main at that point then you can take

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.380 
main at that point then you can take
those<00:01:25.560> tanks<00:01:26.010> and<00:01:26.250> use<00:01:26.760> them<00:01:26.970> against<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
those tanks and use them against the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.320 
those tanks and use them against the
enemy

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.710 

so<00:01:31.900> you've<00:01:32.050> really<00:01:32.080> got<00:01:32.530> a<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:33.070> can't<00:01:33.720> you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
so you've really got a you can't you

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.800 
so you've really got a you can't you
can't<00:01:34.990> go<00:01:35.140> half<00:01:35.410> way<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:36.700> your<00:01:36.970> strategy<00:01:37.510> is<00:01:37.660> to

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
can't go half way if your strategy is to

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.510 
can't go half way if your strategy is to
take<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.140> main<00:01:38.320> base<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.800> sometimes<00:01:39.160> people

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
take the main base and sometimes people

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.220 
take the main base and sometimes people
will<00:01:39.610> take<00:01:39.820> too<00:01:40.030> much<00:01:40.210> time<00:01:40.510> to<00:01:40.570> go<00:01:40.780> with<00:01:40.990> all

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
will take too much time to go with all

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.410 
will take too much time to go with all
the<00:01:41.320> way<00:01:41.410> back<00:01:41.650> there<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.130> then<00:01:42.880> not<00:01:43.120> follow

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
the way back there and then not follow

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.940 
the way back there and then not follow
up<00:01:43.690> on<00:01:43.870> it<00:01:44.020> enough<00:01:45.900> well<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:47.020> Allies<00:01:47.380> managed

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
up on it enough well the Allies managed

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.190 
up on it enough well the Allies managed
to<00:01:48.130> get<00:01:48.250> two<00:01:48.640> different<00:01:49.060> flags<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:49.990> they<00:01:50.050> made

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
to get two different flags and they made

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.870 
to get two different flags and they made
a<00:01:50.230> play<00:01:50.470> for<00:01:50.740> two<00:01:50.860> different<00:01:51.160> flags<00:01:51.400> and<00:01:51.730> got<00:01:51.850> a

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
a play for two different flags and got a

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.040 
a play for two different flags and got a
gray<00:01:53.490> again<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:55.000> ticket<00:01:55.390> lead<00:01:55.570> goes<00:01:55.810> so

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
gray again the ticket lead goes so

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.880
