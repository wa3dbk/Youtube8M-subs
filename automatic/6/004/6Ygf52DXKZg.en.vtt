00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.740 
about I always was interested in
quilting<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:52.640> I<00:02:52.760> made<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.000> lot<00:02:53.150> of<00:02:53.180> very

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
quilting and I made a lot of very

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.420 
quilting and I made a lot of very
terrible<00:02:54.440> quilts<00:02:54.890> when<00:02:55.040> I<00:02:55.070> was<00:02:55.220> in<00:02:55.310> high

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
terrible quilts when I was in high

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.199 
terrible quilts when I was in high
school<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.500> mean<00:02:57.800> never<00:02:58.070> pursued<00:02:58.640> fiber

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
school and I mean never pursued fiber

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.509 
school and I mean never pursued fiber
arts<00:02:59.690> in<00:02:59.989> any<00:03:00.200> sort<00:03:00.500> of<00:03:00.530> serious<00:03:00.800> way<00:03:01.160> a

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
arts in any sort of serious way a

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.630 
arts in any sort of serious way a
trained<00:03:02.300> designer<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.050> illustrator<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.739> it

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
trained designer and illustrator and it

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.040 
trained designer and illustrator and it
was<00:03:04.730> just<00:03:04.850> something<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.090> wanted<00:03:05.180> to<00:03:05.330> try<00:03:05.600> it

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
was just something I wanted to try it

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.990 
was just something I wanted to try it
seemed<00:03:06.440> like<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:06.650> medium<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.190> would

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
seemed like a medium that would

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.100 
seemed like a medium that would
translate<00:03:08.510> well<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:09.640> my<00:03:10.640> illustration<00:03:11.390> so<00:03:11.840> it

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
translate well to my illustration so it

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.699 
translate well to my illustration so it
was<00:03:12.260> really<00:03:12.650> just<00:03:12.950> I<00:03:14.410> made<00:03:15.410> something<00:03:15.620> that

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
was really just I made something that

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.380 
was really just I made something that
was<00:03:15.799> kind<00:03:15.980> of<00:03:16.010> just<00:03:16.190> a<00:03:16.250> sandbox<00:03:16.640> you<00:03:17.150> know<00:03:17.239> it

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
was kind of just a sandbox you know it

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.830 
was kind of just a sandbox you know it
was<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:17.959> quilt<00:03:18.500> of<00:03:18.769> little<00:03:19.670> monsters<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:20.780> it

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
was a quilt of little monsters and it

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.509 
was a quilt of little monsters and it
was<00:03:20.959> a<00:03:20.989> learning<00:03:21.140> process<00:03:21.350> to<00:03:22.070> in<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.370> end

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
was a learning process to in the end

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.220 
was a learning process to in the end
that<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:23.209> very<00:03:23.420> end<00:03:23.570> of<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.720> project<00:03:24.170> they

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
that the very end of the project they

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.750 
that the very end of the project they
went<00:03:24.410> back<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:24.890> like<00:03:25.070> pulled<00:03:25.370> out<00:03:25.519> all<00:03:25.730> the

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
went back and like pulled out all the

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.069 
went back and like pulled out all the
things<00:03:25.880> that<00:03:26.150> done<00:03:26.329> the<00:03:26.450> beginning<00:03:26.930> is<00:03:27.049> you

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
things that done the beginning is you

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.130 
things that done the beginning is you
know<00:03:27.260> good<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.470> prove<00:03:27.829> so<00:03:28.130> much<00:03:28.340> by<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.579> end

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
know good to prove so much by the end

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.630 
know good to prove so much by the end
but<00:03:30.140> I<00:03:30.170> mean<00:03:30.350> it<00:03:30.440> took<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.590> million<00:03:30.980> years<00:03:31.220> to<00:03:31.519> do

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
but I mean it took a million years to do

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.580 
but I mean it took a million years to do
and<00:03:31.940> I<00:03:31.970> just<00:03:32.180> put<00:03:32.360> it<00:03:32.450> up<00:03:32.570> it's<00:03:33.200> just<00:03:33.290> so

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
and I just put it up it's just so

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.920 
and I just put it up it's just so
time-consuming<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.760> so<00:03:37.299> laborious<00:03:38.299> and<00:03:38.870> you

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
time-consuming and so laborious and you

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.660 
time-consuming and so laborious and you
can't<00:03:39.110> fix<00:03:39.380> it<00:03:39.620> I<00:03:39.680> mean<00:03:39.950> I<00:03:40.070> think<00:03:40.100> that<00:03:40.459> the

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
can't fix it I mean I think that the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.310 
can't fix it I mean I think that the
editorial<00:03:41.150> process<00:03:41.600> these<00:03:41.750> days<00:03:41.989> working

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
editorial process these days working

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.690 
editorial process these days working
with<00:03:42.440> books<00:03:42.680> is<00:03:42.890> that<00:03:42.920> you<00:03:43.160> have<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.519> be<00:03:43.610> able

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
with books is that you have to be able

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.819 
with books is that you have to be able
to<00:03:43.850> go<00:03:44.060> in<00:03:44.180> and<00:03:44.329> kind<00:03:44.390> of<00:03:44.510> fix<00:03:44.900> stuff<00:03:45.110> up<00:03:45.350> if<00:03:45.590> you

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
to go in and kind of fix stuff up if you

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.800 
to go in and kind of fix stuff up if you
needed<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.280> changing<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:46.970> they're<00:03:47.420> kind<00:03:47.750> of

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
needed and changing and they're kind of

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.960 
needed and changing and they're kind of
isn't<00:03:48.170> a<00:03:48.230> lot<00:03:48.620> of<00:03:48.650> room<00:03:48.980> for<00:03:49.040> that<00:03:49.250> with<00:03:49.820> the

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
isn't a lot of room for that with the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.940 
isn't a lot of room for that with the
particular<00:03:50.209> technique<00:03:50.900> so<00:03:51.140> I<00:03:51.380> got<00:03:51.739> a<00:03:51.769> lot<00:03:51.920> of

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
particular technique so I got a lot of

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.410 
particular technique so I got a lot of
great<00:03:52.310> response<00:03:52.640> for<00:03:52.910> her<00:03:52.970> but<00:03:53.090> I'm<00:03:53.180> like<00:03:53.239> I'm

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
great response for her but I'm like I'm

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.880 
great response for her but I'm like I'm
not<00:03:53.570> gonna<00:03:53.840> take<00:03:54.019> commissions<00:03:54.530> with<00:03:54.709> this

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
not gonna take commissions with this

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.229 
not gonna take commissions with this
because<00:03:55.070> it's<00:03:55.310> just<00:03:55.519> it's<00:03:56.030> kind<00:03:56.150> of

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
because it's just it's kind of

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.710 
because it's just it's kind of
inflexible<00:03:56.870> I<00:03:57.110> was<00:03:57.829> like<00:03:57.920> unless<00:03:58.720> penguin

inflexible I was like unless penguin

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.690 
inflexible I was like unless penguin
