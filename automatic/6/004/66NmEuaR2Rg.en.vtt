00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:12.280
 two 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:16.410
 Hi, I'm maribel and this beauty 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.410
 you always have 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.199
 I'm very pleased how much time you have 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:26.750
 puppy four months ago today that this 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.669
 such with tyrone what problems do you have then 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.099
 to know is very good but it is a little 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:34.879
 naughty when he came for a day a little 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.400
 what are the furniture the walls the 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.620
 little corner tyrone was separated from his 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.659
 mother a month and a half to be born ideally 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.320
 would have been doing it after two months 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:44.320
 I 'm late 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:54.620
 to entertain we have more than one 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.829
 stroller and always has it to its 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.170
 disposition these two toys worth 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.149
 first what we have to do is 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.379
 have more toys more variety and about 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.390
 everything that does not always have its 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.030
 disposition is like a child always 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.770
 he has the toys at his reach and he 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.810
 it's important to have a variety of 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.300
 toys especially super toys 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.580
 resistant is for your denture and 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.619
 You also vary if you can be 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.360
 they can fill them with awards much 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.209
 better with this we will have the puppy 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.890
 entertaining and not biting into furniture the 

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:26.209
 Early weaning of a puppy implies 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.250
 that his mother has not had time to 

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:31.720
 teach him certain guidelines such as not 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.720
 bite very hard when playing 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.590
 and we have to do when it starts 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.170
 play with us and bite us if 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.750
 we want to as if it hurt us and 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.280
 let's stop playing for a few seconds 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.079
 idea that he has to associate is that if 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.460
 dies too strong the 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.590
 game 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.260
 It is very common for puppies to bite 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.640
 objects that are valuable to us 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.229
 we must remember that a puppy does not know 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.630
 distinguish between what is allowed or 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.950
 we can not change the object that does not 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.380
 we want you to bite for a snack 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.540
 appetizing or for one of your toys by 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.670
 example if you choose a shoe not that 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.430
 it's a very typical situation we can 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.140
 Find a toy motivate and 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.140
 exchange the shoe for the toy 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.250
 it pees everywhere in all the 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.680
 sites and then when I went down to the street 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.569
 he does not pee on the street until 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.340
 our puppy learns that he should not 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.140
 pee all over the house spends time 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.270
 that we must fill with patience and 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.250
 some guidelines that teach us maribel 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.319
 Ideally, if you can not have it 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.220
 controlled because it works that because you 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.230
 you could if this is the area area 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.560
 of the puppy close this area then 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.130
 here put on one side as has the 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.290
 feeder and feeder a carrier and 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.450
 Normally if you sleep at night 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.620
 it will be a period that does not make teepees since 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.260
 you do not usually do what you have in your 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.549
 bed and also at the same time I would put 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.950
 Some newspapers 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.810
 Well, if you can not be supervised 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.519
 puppy has to be here a puppy 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.500
 two months when urine takes longer or 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.420
 to do it again in one hour 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.459
 we should be waiting for in that 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.970
 moment go out to the street for a walk 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.970
 with them 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.580
 positive training teaches us 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.950
 that the puppy should never be punished 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.620
 but redirect it with prizes and caresses 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.580
 and with a motivating tone of voice for him 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.440
 there is nothing wrong 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.410
 a dog with four is also linked 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.959
 months that nothing what I do is bad there 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.959
 to go teaching him little by little how handsome 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.959
 what 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.630
 it is important that we expose our 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.700
 puppy as soon as possible to the environment 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.220
 just as it is very important to expose 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.860
 our puppies to the people and to the 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.030
 environment is just as important to expose it 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.030
 to other dogs 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.770
 a dog well socialized so much with 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.180
 people as with other animals is a 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.180
 security guarantee for the future
