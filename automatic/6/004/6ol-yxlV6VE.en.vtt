hard work this summer and we're looking

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.570 
hard work this summer and we're looking

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.209 

it's<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.660> lot<00:00:45.780> easier<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.140> think<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.649> because

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
it's a lot easier I think that because

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.619 
it's a lot easier I think that because
we<00:00:47.340> know<00:00:47.489> what<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> expect<00:00:47.789> as<00:00:48.270> far<00:00:48.300> as

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
we know what to expect as far as

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.540 
we know what to expect as far as
facility<00:00:49.289> wise<00:00:49.469> what<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.800> layout<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.129> we're

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
facility wise what the layout is we're

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.709 
facility wise what the layout is we're
obviously<00:00:50.640> playing<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> later<00:00:51.269> game<00:00:51.510> which

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
obviously playing the later game which

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.030 
obviously playing the later game which
should<00:00:51.930> should<00:00:52.230> help<00:00:52.440> us<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.620> little<00:00:52.710> bit<00:00:52.860> more

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040
