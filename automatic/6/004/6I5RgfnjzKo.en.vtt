00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.270 
won't fall into a cave lava etc this is
especially<00:04:08.300> necessary<00:04:08.690> who<00:04:09.650> happened<00:04:10.130> to

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
especially necessary who happened to

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:21.629 
especially necessary who happened to

when I was recording this happened to be

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.850 
when I was recording this happened to be
a<00:04:24.009> perfect<00:04:24.669> example<00:04:24.819> as<00:04:25.479> if<00:04:26.050> I<00:04:26.139> had<00:04:26.349> just<00:04:26.560> mined

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
a perfect example as if I had just mined

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.320 
a perfect example as if I had just mined
those<00:04:27.009> diamonds<00:04:27.310> they<00:04:27.789> would<00:04:27.939> have<00:04:28.120> fallen

those diamonds they would have fallen

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.600

into<00:04:28.689> the<00:04:28.900> lava<00:04:29.110> below<00:04:29.349> and<00:04:29.710> I<00:04:30.280> would<00:04:30.340> always

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
into the lava below and I would always

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.510 
into the lava below and I would always
regret<00:04:31.120> that<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:31.990> I<00:04:32.110> would<00:04:32.259> be<00:04:32.289> sad<00:04:32.469> forever

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.709 

even<00:04:36.520> though<00:04:36.669> I<00:04:36.699> mined<00:04:37.090> every<00:04:37.300> single<00:04:37.569> one<00:04:37.659> of

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:37.719
