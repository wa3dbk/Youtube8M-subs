00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.820
 hi to all guys and well found in 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.090
 this new game we are here on next 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:21.050
 card game new game in short came out 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.600
 still some time ago now 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.820
 I got to download it more than 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.510
 elsewhere the line as you know is 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.989
 quite slow then I play that again 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.879
 a beta and I found the only one 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.449
 problem the menu that feeds a 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:41.810
 mouse missile but oh so it can 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.310
 go a little to choose here and there is a 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.060
 nice game because as you see also 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.780
 from the image the little one here 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.540
 first they must destroy the others 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.450
 machines for example in this map there is 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.880
 a three maps in all here is and you have to 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.790
 just try to destroy more cars 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.449
 possible without destroying your e 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.690
 so without making you destroy so a little 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.170
 then there are two other maps where exactly 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.370
 run a little forgotten i ii iii 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.470
 g competition networks 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.180
 and you have two machines available 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.540
 this is the small red one here 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.090
 let's say yellow which is a little more lipstick 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.450
 you have the possibility to change the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.830
 tire types of tires that you should 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.810
 be in theory unpaved and unpaved 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:39.540
 track or in short another 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.870
 you have only three maps you can't do 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.690
 many however we start the race a little 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.760
 of which we then upload to 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.610
 very nice game that i hope will point bait 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.280
 in full version also because more 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.620
 does he then made a career 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.450
 career because in theory it should 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.280
 buy the machines to buy the pieces 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.490
 of the machines 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.510
 as you can see we are in this map 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.780
 precisely to destroy the machines I see 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.970
 which I can do for example first 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.220
 on the site getting first there is always one 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.890
 small black machine with lines 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.130
 yellow the one next to mine that 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.000
 really every time 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:30.170
 in short, it always manages to arrive last 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:35.410
 however I would say to start fair guys 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.410
 and on the parts handcuffed disasters 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.510
 just as you see meager mentioned 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:48.010
 destroy each other and how 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.940
 you also see your car but then 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.940
 it damages us 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.410
 in short, a game can last five 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.330
 minutes if you are destroyed right away or 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.980
 maybe it can last a little longer now 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:15.290
 he doesn't know how the rubber embarked 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:15.290
 front morin cursed reminder roda 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.610
 no 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:29.959
 here I go strong shouting means that 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:32.370
 you destroyed a car and my mom 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.280
 guys this game is nice because 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.920
 you have this institution 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.540
 remain 22 machinery was then sure 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.299
 point precisely the seizure that yes 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.299
 everyone is the only point 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.800
 then one of the many solutions and go 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.090
 away in reverse because maybe the 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:03.170
 rear of the machine hands is that 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:07.400
 which remains more safe, let's say and why 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:10.040
 here every race is practically developed 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.560
 in a different way 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:18.229
 it is not that you are destroyed ways 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:21.229
 always the same cars and so here 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:23.600
 another made out 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.759
 anyway maybe some of you maybe 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.630
 he must have already seen this 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:31.220
 game is that just around Pisa too 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.820
 anyway guys 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.560
 I also did install it as soon 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:43.210
 see also the map is destroyed 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:46.250
 so together with mum I would like cartoccio 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.230
 point still a bit to improve if 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:53.740
 still maybe manga and new machines 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.740
 but now that empty 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:02.419
 there is a cartridge for your machine 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:14.190
 I don't even play that heavy 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:17.789
 let's say it makes itself felt if marijuana 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.560
 a good video card we are 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.770
 you see the gam and not anyone 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.770
 problem 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:30.160
 first standing still I arrived at 105 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:34.150
 fps in short, even beyond why not 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:37.930
 has the pitching for the limitation of the 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.910
 fps 60 usual that if I had butterflies 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.979
 screen and various miscellaneous 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.260
 we see if we can do something 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:47.919
 but I know that when it is reversed yes 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.320
 therefore it does little if it goes on like this until 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.120
 there is human 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:55.660
 on your part another mar 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:06:00.510
 at 32 perfect so none is missing 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.510
 genion mangiona 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.860
 I see fuck they are 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:14.320
 the water is yellow 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.320
 for the i have to go apple 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.890
 yes but impossible to drive like that 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.910
 now he takes me out and then 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.770
 one is missing 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.190
 where the hell is the other car 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.980
 go away 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:54.389
 that's why sometimes I find that 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.310
 marie stuck around hands to go 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:57.169
 towards other machines here I lost of 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.910
 new 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:04.350
 pity that there is no visual seas a 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:09.330
 can be moved with what brings us 

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:11.639
 maybe move with the mouse is won with 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.680
 six cars destroyed 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:16.680
 you have to take some hands not 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:19.560
 it always comes this way however you see it is 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.270
 a bit of time wetting the sea ​​to fuck around 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.530
 a little because precisely being 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.300
 still a beta 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:29.220
 in the meantime my car that sn 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:32.910
 como blinds me excuse 25 meters up su 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:36.300
 car guys still too 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:37.780
 for this video and everything is right like that 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:42.160
 a presentation 

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:44.560
 of the game I can not from the link of 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.350
 download because you see davide ray only 

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.500
 those that I know and that's it 

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:52.650
 you immediately find the weight of about 1 gb 

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:57.450
 is in English 

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.450
 good bye to all to next hello hello
