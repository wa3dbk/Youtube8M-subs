00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
actually make a pivotal decision that

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.410

changed<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.129> course<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.550> game<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.940> I

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
changed the course of the game and I

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.210 
changed the course of the game and I
pull<00:01:03.690> their<00:01:03.870> flag<00:01:04.140> away<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.710> I've<00:01:05.010> now

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
pull their flag away and I've now

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.340 
pull their flag away and I've now
diverted<00:01:05.729> their<00:01:05.850> attention<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:07.170> kind

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
diverted their attention and it's kind

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.870 
diverted their attention and it's kind
of<00:01:07.380> like<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> safety<00:01:07.890> net<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.310> even<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:08.760> they

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
of like a safety net that even if they

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.370 
of like a safety net that even if they
get<00:01:09.090> all<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.450> way<00:01:09.479> back<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.869> their<00:01:09.990> base<00:01:10.140> if<00:01:10.290> I

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
get all the way back to their base if I

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.810 
get all the way back to their base if I
still<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.740> their<00:01:10.890> flag<00:01:11.100> they<00:01:11.369> can't<00:01:11.610> capture

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820

stalemate<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.340> tactic<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.880> not

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
stalemate but this this tactic is not

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.210 
stalemate but this this tactic is not
only<00:01:27.450> useful<00:01:27.750> for<00:01:27.960> creating<00:01:28.229> stalemates<00:01:28.979> in

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
only useful for creating stalemates in

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.670 
only useful for creating stalemates in
clutch<00:01:29.430> situations<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.600> also<00:01:30.840> useful<00:01:31.380> for

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
clutch situations it's also useful for

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.920 
clutch situations it's also useful for
diverting<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.460> enemy<00:01:32.729> team's<00:01:32.970> attention<00:01:33.540> you

diverting the enemy team's attention you

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.450 
diverting the enemy team's attention you
want<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.170> keep<00:01:34.380> putting<00:01:34.680> pressure<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:35.070> their

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
base as much as you can you want to keep

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.469

and<00:01:39.750> divert<00:01:40.110> their<00:01:40.290> attention<00:01:40.320> away<00:01:40.710> because

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
and divert their attention away because

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.039 
and divert their attention away because
let's<00:01:41.460> say<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> one<00:01:42.840> flag

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
let's say that you have a one flag

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.870 
let's say that you have a one flag
advantage<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> last<00:01:43.920> 30<00:01:44.250> seconds<00:01:44.729> right

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
advantage in the last 30 seconds right

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.940 
advantage in the last 30 seconds right
they're<00:01:45.329> gonna<00:01:45.450> go<00:01:45.659> balls<00:01:46.049> deep<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.590> your<00:01:46.740> flag

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
