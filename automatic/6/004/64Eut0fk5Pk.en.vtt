the<00:00:11.540> energy<00:00:11.900> management<00:00:12.230> program<00:00:12.410> has<00:00:13.040> three

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
the energy management program has three

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.480 
the energy management program has three
basic<00:00:13.760> parts<00:00:14.000> we<00:00:14.900> learn<00:00:15.139> energy<00:00:15.740> fundamentals

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
basic parts we learn energy fundamentals

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.620 
basic parts we learn energy fundamentals
what<00:00:17.240> is<00:00:17.390> energy<00:00:17.630> and<00:00:18.200> how<00:00:18.619> it<00:00:18.800> works<00:00:19.330> then<00:00:20.330> we

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
what is energy and how it works then we

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
what is energy and how it works then we
learn<00:00:21.070> about<00:00:22.070> the<00:00:22.580> economics<00:00:23.240> of<00:00:23.390> energy<00:00:23.840> what

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
learn about the economics of energy what

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.980 
learn about the economics of energy what
energy<00:00:25.070> costs<00:00:25.640> and<00:00:25.789> how<00:00:26.090> much<00:00:26.269> we<00:00:26.480> could<00:00:26.660> save

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
energy costs and how much we could save

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.579 
energy costs and how much we could save
if<00:00:27.320> we<00:00:27.769> learn<00:00:27.949> to<00:00:28.099> use<00:00:28.310> energy<00:00:28.519> more<00:00:28.759> wisely

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:29.589 
if we learn to use energy more wisely

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.520 
if we learn to use energy more wisely
third<00:00:30.589> we<00:00:31.130> learn<00:00:32.029> to<00:00:32.240> walk<00:00:32.810> through<00:00:33.050> buildings

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
third we learn to walk through buildings

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.850 
third we learn to walk through buildings
and<00:00:33.860> identify<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:35.330> areas<00:00:35.900> in<00:00:36.200> which<00:00:36.380> a

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
and identify the areas in which a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.650 
and identify the areas in which a
building<00:00:37.430> is<00:00:37.550> either<00:00:37.730> using<00:00:38.120> energy

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
building is either using energy

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.300 
building is either using energy
efficiently<00:00:39.230> or<00:00:39.640> wasting<00:00:40.640> energy<00:00:41.090> what<00:00:41.930> our

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
efficiently or wasting energy what our

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.580 
efficiently or wasting energy what our
industry<00:00:43.310> advisory<00:00:44.030> committee<00:00:44.690> tells<00:00:45.050> us<00:00:45.320> is

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
industry advisory committee tells us is

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.070 
industry advisory committee tells us is
that<00:00:45.670> they<00:00:46.670> need<00:00:46.700> people<00:00:47.270> who<00:00:47.300> understand

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
that they need people who understand

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.950 
that they need people who understand
energy<00:00:48.650> and<00:00:48.950> energy<00:00:49.340> efficiency<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:50.150> also

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
energy and energy efficiency and also

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.380 
energy and energy efficiency and also
business<00:00:51.500> and<00:00:51.770> so<00:00:52.010> we<00:00:52.250> combined<00:00:52.880> those

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
business and so we combined those

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.450 
business and so we combined those
elements<00:00:53.840> into<00:00:54.470> the<00:00:54.800> two-year<00:00:55.160> degree
