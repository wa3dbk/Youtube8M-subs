I'll just when I'm father or predicting
the<00:01:51.960> fire<00:01:52.170> move<00:01:52.409> but<00:01:53.009> whatever<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.549> works

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the fire move but whatever it works

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.370 
the fire move but whatever it works
because<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.240> got<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.420> flash<00:01:54.630> fire<00:01:54.930> boost<00:01:55.200> I'm

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
should be able to tell that it's not go

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.770 
should be able to tell that it's not go
warm<00:02:30.490> move<00:02:30.730> because<00:02:30.910> he's<00:02:31.060> not<00:02:31.240> using<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.630> and

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
warm move because he's not using it and

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.050 
warm move because he's not using it and
rain<00:02:32.080> he's<00:02:32.620> your<00:02:32.800> son<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.520> mortgage<00:02:33.910> then

rain he's your son and mortgage then

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.440 
rain he's your son and mortgage then
decrease<00:02:34.540> more<00:02:34.870> moves<00:02:35.470> get<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:36.000> drop<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.060> sun

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
decrease more moves get the drop and sun

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.570 
decrease more moves get the drop and sun
which<00:02:37.960> I<00:02:38.110> guess<00:02:38.350> I'm<00:02:38.590> just<00:02:38.680> not<00:02:39.190> smart<00:02:39.370> enough

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
which I guess I'm just not smart enough

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.220 
which I guess I'm just not smart enough
to<00:02:39.760> figure<00:02:39.880> it<00:02:40.030> out<00:02:40.060> then<00:02:40.330> they<00:02:40.780> realize<00:02:41.200> that

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
to figure it out then they realize that

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.200 
to figure it out then they realize that
but<00:02:41.590> whatever<00:02:41.770> i'm<00:02:42.340> gonna<00:02:42.490> go<00:02:42.610> into<00:02:42.820> bail<00:02:43.000> end

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
but whatever i'm gonna go into bail end

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.330 
but whatever i'm gonna go into bail end
as<00:02:43.420> i<00:02:43.810> get<00:02:43.960> forced<00:02:44.320> out<00:02:44.410> with<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.650> dragon<00:02:45.100> tail

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340
