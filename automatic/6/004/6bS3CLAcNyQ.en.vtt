tool is based around stock tire metal
bust<00:00:17.830> bead<00:00:18.250> on<00:00:18.400> any<00:00:18.640> tire<00:00:19.029> wheel<00:00:19.210> package<00:00:19.570> all

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
bust bead on any tire wheel package all

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.300 
bust bead on any tire wheel package all
the<00:00:19.779> way<00:00:19.869> down<00:00:20.050> to<00:00:20.260> an<00:00:20.349> ATV<00:00:20.710> which<00:00:21.039> is<00:00:21.189> this

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
the way down to an ATV which is this

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.689 
the way down to an ATV which is this
little<00:00:21.580> small<00:00:21.849> foot<00:00:22.180> right<00:00:22.420> here<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:24.160> what<00:00:24.609> we

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
little small foot right here so what we

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.120 
little small foot right here so what we
figured<00:00:25.000> out<00:00:25.119> is<00:00:25.269> that<00:00:25.740> because<00:00:26.740> of<00:00:26.830> the<00:00:26.920> shape

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
figured out is that because of the shape

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.730 
figured out is that because of the shape
of<00:00:27.340> a<00:00:27.490> drag<00:00:27.820> racing<00:00:28.269> tire<00:00:28.660> and<00:00:28.990> wheel<00:00:29.289> there's

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
of a drag racing tire and wheel there's

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.299 
of a drag racing tire and wheel there's
a<00:00:29.830> lot<00:00:29.980> more<00:00:30.099> bulbs<00:00:30.550> past<00:00:30.849> the<00:00:31.119> rim<00:00:31.390> so<00:00:32.309> based

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
a lot more bulbs past the rim so based

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.010 
a lot more bulbs past the rim so based
on<00:00:33.460> these<00:00:33.610> numbers<00:00:33.879> here<00:00:34.329> if<00:00:34.540> you<00:00:34.629> go<00:00:34.750> a<00:00:34.780> little

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
on these numbers here if you go a little

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.780 
on these numbers here if you go a little
smaller<00:00:35.440> than<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:35.829> actual<00:00:36.160> rim<00:00:36.460> width<00:00:36.610> for

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
smaller than the actual rim width for

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.090 
smaller than the actual rim width for
instance<00:00:37.059> this<00:00:37.149> is<00:00:37.329> a<00:00:37.420> 15<00:00:37.809> inch<00:00:37.840> rim<00:00:38.590> and<00:00:38.860> I'm

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
instance this is a 15 inch rim and I'm

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.619 
instance this is a 15 inch rim and I'm
going<00:00:39.250> to<00:00:39.280> put<00:00:39.460> this<00:00:39.610> in<00:00:39.789> the<00:00:39.879> 14<00:00:40.239> inch<00:00:40.420> hole

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
going to put this in the 14 inch hole

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.360 
going to put this in the 14 inch hole
and<00:00:40.870> it's<00:00:41.289> a<00:00:41.350> little<00:00:41.590> easier<00:00:41.890> to<00:00:42.039> start

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
and it's a little easier to start

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.750 
and it's a little easier to start
because<00:00:43.059> obviously<00:00:43.510> a<00:00:44.010> stock<00:00:45.010> tire<00:00:45.489> wheel

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
because obviously a stock tire wheel

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.369 
because obviously a stock tire wheel
package<00:00:46.000> like<00:00:46.300> off<00:00:46.449> of<00:00:46.480> your<00:00:46.780> car<00:00:46.989> truck

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
package like off of your car truck

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:48.840 
package like off of your car truck
doesn't<00:00:47.980> have<00:00:48.100> near<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.399> bulge<00:00:48.610> in<00:00:48.789> the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
doesn't have near the bulge in the

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.670 
doesn't have near the bulge in the
sidewall<00:00:49.390> so<00:00:49.809> it's<00:00:49.960> much<00:00:50.110> easier<00:00:50.469> to<00:00:50.590> get

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
sidewall so it's much easier to get

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.680 
sidewall so it's much easier to get
under<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.039> lip<00:00:51.219> of<00:00:51.399> that<00:00:51.430> rim<00:00:51.969> and<00:00:52.300> push<00:00:52.510> this

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
under the lip of that rim and push this

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.040 
under the lip of that rim and push this
down<00:00:52.930> so<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.890> way<00:00:54.010> this<00:00:54.190> works<00:00:54.550> is<00:00:55.050> this

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
down so the way this works is this

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.680 
down so the way this works is this
little<00:00:56.609> foot<00:00:57.609> here<00:00:57.940> is<00:00:57.969> going<00:00:58.180> to<00:00:58.239> hook<00:00:58.420> on<00:00:58.600> the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
little foot here is going to hook on the

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.430 
little foot here is going to hook on the
opposite<00:00:59.050> side<00:00:59.260> of<00:00:59.289> the<00:00:59.410> rim<00:00:59.789> these<00:01:00.989> feet<00:01:01.989> here

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
opposite side of the rim these feet here

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.530 
opposite side of the rim these feet here
are<00:01:02.620> going<00:01:02.710> to<00:01:02.800> hook<00:01:02.980> 180<00:01:03.579> degrees<00:01:03.879> across<00:01:04.150> and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
are going to hook 180 degrees across and

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.290 
are going to hook 180 degrees across and
then<00:01:05.050> when<00:01:05.680> you<00:01:05.800> pull<00:01:06.340> it<00:01:06.490> in<00:01:06.610> and<00:01:06.760> hook<00:01:06.940> it<00:01:07.120> you

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
then when you pull it in and hook it you

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.910 
then when you pull it in and hook it you
pull<00:01:07.540> it<00:01:07.660> like<00:01:07.750> this<00:01:07.810> and<00:01:08.170> that<00:01:08.260> clamps<00:01:08.710> it<00:01:08.800> in

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
pull it like this and that clamps it in

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.190 
pull it like this and that clamps it in
underneath<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.540> rim<00:01:10.540> now<00:01:10.660> this<00:01:10.840> is<00:01:10.960> going<00:01:11.140> to

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
underneath the rim now this is going to

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.720 
underneath the rim now this is going to
stay<00:01:11.440> straight<00:01:11.920> across<00:01:12.160> but<00:01:12.490> I'm<00:01:12.550> going<00:01:12.700> to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
stay straight across but I'm going to

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.030 
stay straight across but I'm going to
show<00:01:12.910> you<00:01:12.940> that<00:01:13.540> once<00:01:14.320> it's<00:01:14.560> hooked<00:01:14.770> and<00:01:15.010> then

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
show you that once it's hooked and then

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.340 
show you that once it's hooked and then
you<00:01:15.190> pull<00:01:15.430> on<00:01:15.580> this<00:01:15.730> handle<00:01:15.900> you're<00:01:16.900> going<00:01:17.200> to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
you pull on this handle you're going to

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.740 
you pull on this handle you're going to
be<00:01:17.500> pushing<00:01:17.950> on<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:18.490> bottom<00:01:18.850> side<00:01:19.090> of<00:01:19.300> the<00:01:19.450> rim

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
be pushing on the bottom side of the rim

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.260 
be pushing on the bottom side of the rim
and<00:01:20.110> then<00:01:20.500> in<00:01:20.770> it's<00:01:21.490> going<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:21.760> in<00:01:21.880> return<00:01:22.120> it's

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
and then in it's going to in return it's

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.550 
and then in it's going to in return it's
going<00:01:22.390> to<00:01:22.450> drive<00:01:22.750> these<00:01:22.960> little<00:01:23.290> pads

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
going to drive these little pads

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.660 
going to drive these little pads
downward<00:01:24.490> so<00:01:25.330> this<00:01:26.020> hooks<00:01:26.440> it<00:01:26.740> this<00:01:27.220> handle

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
downward so this hooks it this handle

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.310 
downward so this hooks it this handle
locks<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:28.000> into<00:01:28.150> place<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.750> then<00:01:28.930> you<00:01:29.050> push

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
locks it into place and then you push

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.890 
locks it into place and then you push
this<00:01:29.530> down<00:01:29.590> and<00:01:30.130> that<00:01:30.670> will<00:01:30.880> drive<00:01:31.330> that<00:01:31.630> bead

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
this down and that will drive that bead

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.530 
this down and that will drive that bead
down<00:01:32.200> so<00:01:32.710> you're<00:01:32.830> going<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:32.980> go<00:01:33.390> around<00:01:34.390> a

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
down so you're going to go around a

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.850 
down so you're going to go around a
couple<00:01:34.840> of<00:01:34.960> steps<00:01:35.170> here<00:01:35.350> once<00:01:35.500> you<00:01:35.590> get<00:01:35.680> about

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
couple of steps here once you get about

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.190 
couple of steps here once you get about
a<00:01:35.920> quarter<00:01:36.160> of<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.400> way<00:01:36.490> around<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.880> rim<00:01:37.600> you

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
a quarter of the way around the rim you

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.740 
a quarter of the way around the rim you
can<00:01:38.230> push<00:01:38.560> it<00:01:38.710> down<00:01:38.860> with<00:01:39.070> your<00:01:39.100> foot<00:01:39.550> so<00:01:39.880> this

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
can push it down with your foot so this

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.670 
can push it down with your foot so this
is<00:01:40.930> how<00:01:41.050> it<00:01:41.170> goes<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.450> you<00:01:43.540> can<00:01:43.690> see<00:01:43.840> here<00:01:44.110> I've

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
is how it goes so you can see here I've

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.140 
is how it goes so you can see here I've
got<00:01:44.740> it<00:01:45.010> like<00:01:45.160> I<00:01:45.220> said<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.430> little<00:01:45.550> bit<00:01:45.700> short

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
got it like I said a little bit short

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.870 
got it like I said a little bit short
but<00:01:46.360> it's<00:01:46.540> it's<00:01:46.720> real<00:01:46.990> close<00:01:47.230> because

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
but it's it's real close because

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.520 
but it's it's real close because
normally<00:01:48.880> it<00:01:49.000> would<00:01:49.120> be<00:01:49.150> like<00:01:49.780> this<00:01:50.110> but<00:01:50.380> it's

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
normally it would be like this but it's

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.450 
normally it would be like this but it's
hard<00:01:50.710> to<00:01:50.770> get<00:01:50.890> under<00:01:51.070> there<00:01:51.190> so<00:01:51.280> we're<00:01:51.370> going

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
hard to get under there so we're going

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.830 
hard to get under there so we're going
to<00:01:51.550> do<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:52.000> at<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.120> little<00:01:52.240> angle

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
to do it at a little angle

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.320 
to do it at a little angle
and<00:01:52.990> then<00:01:53.620> you<00:01:54.550> just<00:01:54.700> kind<00:01:54.850> of<00:01:54.880> put<00:01:55.030> your<00:01:55.180> foot

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
and then you just kind of put your foot

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.060 
and then you just kind of put your foot
on<00:01:55.360> here<00:01:55.450> get<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.170> down<00:01:56.470> underneath<00:01:56.500> there

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
on here get that down underneath there

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.190 
on here get that down underneath there
and<00:01:57.250> then<00:01:57.370> see<00:01:57.580> how<00:01:57.700> it<00:01:57.730> popped<00:01:58.200> underneath

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
and then see how it popped underneath

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.560 
and then see how it popped underneath
that<00:01:59.380> RIM<00:01:59.650> so<00:01:59.980> now<00:02:00.100> I'm<00:02:00.220> locked<00:02:00.490> in<00:02:00.790> there<00:02:01.000> okay

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
that RIM so now I'm locked in there okay

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.510 
that RIM so now I'm locked in there okay
and<00:02:01.780> because<00:02:02.470> of<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.680> leverage<00:02:03.040> how<00:02:03.190> you<00:02:03.250> use

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
and because of the leverage how you use

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.920 
and because of the leverage how you use
this<00:02:03.670> as<00:02:03.850> you<00:02:03.940> put<00:02:04.120> your<00:02:04.150> foot<00:02:04.300> here<00:02:04.690> so<00:02:04.870> you

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
this as you put your foot here so you

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.540 
this as you put your foot here so you
don't<00:02:05.050> tip<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.530> tire<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:05.950> wheel<00:02:06.070> over<00:02:06.280> but

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
don't tip the tire and wheel over but

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.190 
don't tip the tire and wheel over but
now<00:02:07.000> that<00:02:07.210> I've<00:02:07.300> got<00:02:07.450> this<00:02:07.600> locked<00:02:07.870> in<00:02:08.020> there<00:02:08.140> I

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
now that I've got this locked in there I

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.570 
now that I've got this locked in there I
put<00:02:08.350> a<00:02:08.410> little<00:02:08.560> pressure<00:02:08.770> on<00:02:08.979> this<00:02:09.220> handle

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
put a little pressure on this handle

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.020 
put a little pressure on this handle
then<00:02:10.570> I'm<00:02:10.660> going<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.810> push<00:02:11.020> this<00:02:11.170> one<00:02:11.380> down

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
then I'm going to push this one down

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.670 
then I'm going to push this one down
you<00:02:12.240> can<00:02:12.390> see<00:02:12.600> how<00:02:12.750> it's<00:02:12.900> pushing<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.290> bead

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
you can see how it's pushing that bead

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.880 
you can see how it's pushing that bead
down<00:02:14.520> away<00:02:14.850> from<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.240> rim<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.530> an<00:02:16.650> old

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
down away from that rim this is an old

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.380 
down away from that rim this is an old
piece-of-crap<00:02:17.160> tire<00:02:17.850> we've<00:02:18.060> had<00:02:18.209> laying

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
piece-of-crap tire we've had laying

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.940 
piece-of-crap tire we've had laying
around<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:18.750> it's<00:02:18.870> been<00:02:19.020> on<00:02:19.050> this<00:02:19.260> rim<00:02:19.560> forever

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
around so it's been on this rim forever

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.400 
around so it's been on this rim forever
but<00:02:20.250> see<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:20.819> was<00:02:20.970> just<00:02:21.330> one<00:02:21.600> push<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.230> see

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
but see that was just one push and see

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.090 
but see that was just one push and see
that's<00:02:23.400> already<00:02:23.700> done<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.420> if<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:25.080> was<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.290> liner

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
that's already done so if it was a liner

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.699 
that's already done so if it was a liner
tire<00:02:26.430> with<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.060> liner<00:02:27.330> inside<00:02:27.780> you'd<00:02:28.500> have<00:02:28.620> to

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
tire with a liner inside you'd have to

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.199 
tire with a liner inside you'd have to
go<00:02:28.800> around<00:02:28.920> again<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.580> you'd<00:02:29.700> move<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.030> about

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
go around again so you'd move it about

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.390 
go around again so you'd move it about
four<00:02:30.930> or<00:02:31.020> five<00:02:31.170> inches<00:02:31.200> around<00:02:31.650> there<00:02:31.950> take

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
four or five inches around there take

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.880 
four or five inches around there take
another<00:02:32.670> bite
