leave<00:04:48.169> a<00:04:48.229> flange<00:04:48.680> on<00:04:48.950> one<00:04:49.190> side<00:04:49.520> if<00:04:49.820> you<00:04:49.910> can

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.140 

most<00:04:54.080> experienced<00:04:54.919> installers<00:04:55.250> cut<00:04:55.729> against

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
most experienced installers cut against

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.529 
most experienced installers cut against
a<00:04:56.270> stud<00:04:56.570> like<00:04:56.599> this<00:04:57.789> but<00:04:58.789> you<00:04:58.940> might<00:04:59.120> find<00:04:59.360> it

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
a stud like this but you might find it

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:01.420 
a stud like this but you might find it
easier<00:04:59.660> to<00:04:59.930> measure<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:00.680> cut<00:05:00.860> on<00:05:01.010> the<00:05:01.160> floor

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
easier to measure and cut on the floor

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.379 
easier to measure and cut on the floor
like<00:05:01.760> this<00:05:01.789> with<00:05:02.419> the<00:05:02.570> facing<00:05:03.020> down<00:05:04.030> never<00:05:05.030> cut

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
like this with the facing down never cut

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
against finished flooring there are two

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.939

like<00:05:16.520> this<00:05:17.229> the<00:05:18.229> right<00:05:18.500> way<00:05:18.680> to<00:05:18.740> install<00:05:19.190> bats

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
like this the right way to install bats

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.879 
like this the right way to install bats
by<00:05:19.820> face<00:05:20.150> stapling<00:05:20.660> is<00:05:20.840> to<00:05:21.110> overlap<00:05:21.650> the

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
by face stapling is to overlap the

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.129 
by face stapling is to overlap the
flanges<00:05:22.370> like<00:05:22.580> this<00:05:25.419> the<00:05:26.419> most<00:05:26.630> common

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
flanges like this the most common

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.950

practice<00:05:27.590> is<00:05:27.770> inset<00:05:28.190> stapling<00:05:28.699> the<00:05:29.449> flanges

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
practice is inset stapling the flanges

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.620 
practice is inset stapling the flanges
