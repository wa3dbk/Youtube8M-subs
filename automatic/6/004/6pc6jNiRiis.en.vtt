00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
got me a much better form and technique

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.090 
got me a much better form and technique
and<00:01:08.580> really<00:01:09.390> that's<00:01:10.200> what<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.560> start<00:01:10.799> out<00:01:10.950> with

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
and really that's what we start out with

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.679 
and really that's what we start out with
then<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.430> start<00:01:11.700> ramping<00:01:11.880> up<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.240> weight<00:01:12.420> it's

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
then we start ramping up the weight it's

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.609 
then we start ramping up the weight it's
a<00:01:12.780> technique<00:01:14.360> I've<00:01:15.360> seen<00:01:15.630> kids<00:01:15.840> actually<00:01:16.259> lift

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
a technique I've seen kids actually lift

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.590 
a technique I've seen kids actually lift
some<00:01:17.130> good<00:01:17.310> weight<00:01:17.490> at<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.670> age<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.939> 12<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.270> 14

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
some good weight at the age of 12 to 14

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.719 
some good weight at the age of 12 to 14
years<00:01:18.750> old<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.170> here<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.740> really<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.490> stress

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
years old but here we really just stress

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.190 
years old but here we really just stress
technique<00:01:21.210> kids<00:01:21.479> are<00:01:21.600> still<00:01:21.750> growing<00:01:21.930> at<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
technique kids are still growing at the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.440 
technique kids are still growing at the
age<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.380> 12<00:01:22.590> 14<00:01:22.830> muscles<00:01:23.369> are<00:01:23.430> developing<00:01:23.939> so

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
age of 12 14 muscles are developing so

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.910 
age of 12 14 muscles are developing so
what<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.720> do<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.140> teach<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.500> technique

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
what we do is we teach the technique

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.249 
what we do is we teach the technique
