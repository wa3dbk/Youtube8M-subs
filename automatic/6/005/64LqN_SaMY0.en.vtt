00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.980
 it rained metro is then do two 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.690
 measurements in the day one more measurement or 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.269
 except at seven in the morning and the other 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:17.500
 measurement about seven o'clock in the 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:20.859
 night and record that information in the 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.640
 social network format then here 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:26.320
 we have the day the hour if it is the measurement 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.240
 of in the morning or measuring by the 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.779
 late but it is important to record the 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.550
 hour reading and observations then 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.520
 at this moment we have the rain or 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.890
 meter with a quantity of water that 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.250
 I would have picked up in a rain 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.200
 so how do we measure that reading here 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.989
 there is an important consideration 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.850
 when we installed the subiÃ³ metro 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.620
 we make sure that the base was 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.110
 leveled because that facilitates the 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.960
 reading and we can know more or less 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.570
 how much was it raining in a period 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.839
 determined let's start then with 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.309
 Reading the idea is to mine at 7 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.650
 in the morning and at 7 at night 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.040
 then this is like it's the 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.039
 day 1 true and we will do the reading 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:18.250
 in the morning, so it's 7 o'clock in the morning 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.250
 tomorrow I put here 7 in the morning 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:26.010
 this is the morning reading to m 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.440
 and I'm going to look at how much it rained in a thousand and 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.590
 we had told them that one millimeter is 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.760
 the same amount of water equivalent to 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.680
 a meter with a liter of water that 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.800
 accumulates in one square meter of area 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.310
 this magazine that has the blonde meter already 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.070
 is in millimeters true since the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.400
 conversion and it is known that this reading of 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.500
 100 millimeters this is like a height 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.230
 how much it rained yesterday night in 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.710
 this blonde subway then fell here 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.540
 is reading 105 millimeters here 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.870
 there are 10 millimeters 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.160
 here is 15 millimeters and we have 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.160
 measurements every 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:18.310
 2 mm true then here is 16 18 20 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:20.980
 is a little bit beyond 18 a 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.340
 little above 18 as between 18 and 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.150
 twenty 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.239
 in the middle between 18 and 20 then that 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.050
 means half between 18 and 20 are 19 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.860
 millimeters 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.860
 then I put here 19 millimeters 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.090
 when I record this when I already 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.409
 record the rain that fell at night 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.240
 I simply remove the rain gauge 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:51.240
 from the base 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.240
 another the water left it at zero again 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.310
 I return and I install it and I am back at 7 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.320
 at night to see how much it has 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.660
 accumulated in this period between 7 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.990
 am and 7 pm 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.450
 the format also has other columns 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.520
 which is called observations in those 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.770
 observations let's say for example 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.080
 what is happening in this 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.790
 moment to notice what it is that is 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.160
 happening at this time with the weather 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.290
 or write down what happened 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.790
 example at night with the weather because 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.220
 this is the measurement of 7 of the 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.920
 tomorrow then I can say that to see 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.770
 it's 7 in the morning the sky is 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.870
 cloudy 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.270
 but the sun is starting to rise 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.730
 heat the clouds are clearing or 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.430
 I can say the rain I just 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.190
 register here that they were 18 19 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.860
 mm at 7 in the morning it happened 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.880
 in a very strong storm that there was for 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.500
 the night I realized that last night there 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.690
 very loud thunder that kind of 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.060
 observations are what we put in 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.020
 is in this column that says 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.020
 observations
