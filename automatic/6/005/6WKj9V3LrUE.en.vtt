kind of well that's the yellow path like

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:40.689 
kind of well that's the yellow path like
anything<00:05:39.409> that<00:05:39.560> like<00:05:39.740> connects<00:05:40.099> to<00:05:40.280> those<00:05:40.490> is

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
anything that like connects to those is

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.390 
anything that like connects to those is
yellow<00:05:41.740> anything<00:05:42.740> that<00:05:42.889> connects<00:05:43.159> to<00:05:43.280> these

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
yellow anything that connects to these

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.200 
yellow anything that connects to these
planets<00:05:43.849> on<00:05:43.969> this<00:05:44.120> side<00:05:44.389> and<00:05:44.780> are<00:05:44.870> red<00:05:45.289> and

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
planets on this side and are red and

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.129 
planets on this side and are red and
anything<00:05:47.210> that<00:05:47.300> connects<00:05:47.539> on<00:05:47.659> this<00:05:47.840> side<00:05:47.990> the

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:52.879 
these three planets are kinda hard in

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.610 
these three planets are kinda hard in
the<00:05:53.000> center<00:05:53.330> and<00:05:53.479> not<00:05:53.689> really<00:05:53.960> connected<00:05:54.349> to<00:05:54.379> a

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
the center and not really connected to a

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.170 
the center and not really connected to a
path<00:05:54.919> post<00:05:55.370> you<00:05:55.490> can't<00:05:55.669> get<00:05:55.879> there<00:05:56.029> from

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
path post you can't get there from

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.029 
path post you can't get there from
corneria<00:05:56.889> so<00:05:57.889> they're<00:05:58.129> considered<00:05:58.490> yellow

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
corneria so they're considered yellow

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:03.429 
corneria so they're considered yellow
but<00:06:01.039> anyways<00:06:01.580> we<00:06:02.240> will<00:06:02.330> do<00:06:02.479> sector<00:06:02.810> y<00:06:02.960> for<00:06:03.379> the

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:03.439 
but anyways we will do sector y for the

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:06.520 
but anyways we will do sector y for the
last<00:06:03.590> time<00:06:03.740> next<00:06:04.009> video<00:06:04.219> bye
