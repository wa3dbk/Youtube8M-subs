00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.580
 hacker episode 7 to 5 online is this 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.930

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.090
 support has the truth is that every time 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.490
 flipo plus the last time we have arrived 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.289
 to 5,000 likes and only two days ago 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.520
 as I always say kids if you 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.080
 still like bashir and all that 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.270
 pop the button like I'm 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.190
 very grateful of all this and well then 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.800
 As you know today I bring you some weapons 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.510
 which are new hidden from the edition 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.300
 previous special and all that good 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.380
 the takes the hacker and as I always say 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.239
 your channel will also have it in the 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.460
 description and good for the weapons that 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.989
 I will teach first is the taser that is 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.550
 a weapon that I have not seen yet and 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.110
 is from the special edition I do not think either 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.640
 so it's a weapon 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.100
 right now it hides that I think that 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.510
 will take out later or something I do not know how to 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.700
 you can get nothing 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.860
 good as you encourage in the team and 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.870
 good shoots electricity vale is a 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.090
 electric pistol they usually carry 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.140
 The police and the police 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.399
 it's really funny 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.960
 because you shoot someone and he stays 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.059
 shaking on the ground 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.710
 basically electrocuted and if you what 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.299
 they do to you too it's pretty funny 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.050
 we had a good time there 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.690
 electrocuting 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.520
 and good is a pretty good weapon and 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.490
 fun that I like a lot and I 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.320
 It gives a lot of play so good me 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.300
 I hope you get it out soon or good if 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.560
 someone knows how to get it or something 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.690
 I put it in the description or in the 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.820
 comments because I the truth is that 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.380
 I do not know and none of my friends knows 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.300
 so good is a pretty cool weapon 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.040
 and good another weapon also quite rare 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.270
 what good can not be considered a weapon 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.580
 but it is on the menu of weapons 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.960
 basically that is an extinguisher is worth what 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.330
 well right now you will see it in the background 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.130
 It's quite fun also because 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.560
 it goes out as smoke throws and all that and the 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.600
 It's true that I loved it and turned it off 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.000
 the fire yes that is if I knew that you were going to 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.550
 ask or you were going to think we were 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.010
 trying the truth throw vital fire or 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.630
 to make a fire by burning anything and 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.580
 you shoot him with the extinguisher and the truth 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.000
 is that it goes off is pretty fun and 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.680
 damage does good because I think I 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.390
 spent a good time shooting and not no 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.040
 it hurts the other person so 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.080
 well, it 's something quite curious and that 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.670
 also quite fun to use it like that 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.200
 that nothing also something else that we have 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.550
 to the ninja that good are more things 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.560
 hard to get 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.850
 are the molotov cocktails what good yes 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.920
 that you can get but in places 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.390
 very difficult and I do not know if it's still 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.770
 get or have it removed in the 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.420
 new patches but good is something 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.970
 quite difficult to get so 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.370
 here the hacker is good and the rest 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.650
 so that we can use them and everything and good 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.450
 it's one thing that you can replace 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.980
 simply calling to bring you 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.110
 ammunition if for example is that you have left 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.970
 Few you call and it is replenished by what 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.860
 you can not do is ask for it and what 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.110
 bring vale they will only bring cos we have 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.730
 both if you already have other things 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.739
 rare, also here in the 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.590
 down menu where the fists are 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.510
 the dagger bottle or the knife and everything 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.069
 that here also you have things that are 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.120
 quite strange to see as for example 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.470
 the golf club baseball bat 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.060
 you have the hammer that is of the edition 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.920
 special also that here you can see 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.239
 and well several more things that you are going to go 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.730
 seeing that I will leave it in the background 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.080
 video and several things that are giving me 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.180
 and then I'm testing it so that 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.040
 you can see it is also a 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.200
 kind of lever that is as good a 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.430
 kickstand or I do not know what's called what 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.260
 well, it's pretty fun, so 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.060
 good are enough things not and good 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.049
 because you also have weapons like a 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.760
 shotgun that since the edition 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.620
 collector and also a gun 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.000
 50 gauge that good because he could not 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.040
 get the hacker and all that is 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.769
 these weapons are from the special edition 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.939
 they are the shotgun the 50 caliber weapon and 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.739
 the hammer are from the edition 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.329
 collector worth the others did not come out 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.129
 well at least you do not know where 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.930
 get still and well then the weapons 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.969
 like the taser bone the electric gun 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.189
 and the extinguisher I hope they come out 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:38.379
 soon I do not think that they put them 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.939
 really not going to leave or be yes and 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.250
 is not a hacker can get it 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:43.359
 it will be because they will come out in some dlc or there will be 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.739
 some way in the game of 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.120
 get them as I said if someone does not 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.829
 know that I put it for the comments and 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.120
 all that and well, now I'm going to 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.340
 teach things also pretty 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.040
 incredible as for example now you are going to 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.870
 see how a tank shoots very very 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.310
 fast for example these are hacks of 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.409
 good has to do with the 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.000
 weapons that is a hack to shoot a lot 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.980
 faster much stronger and all that 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.720
 I will also teach some things like that 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.579
 that here you have as a tank shoots 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.799
 very fast is it shoots like it's a 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.209
 missile machine gun totally 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.340
 incredible and good you also see how it 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.260
 get in the water and start shooting inside 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.630
 of the water and it acts as if it were a source 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.070
 of these as if it were a typical source 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.570
 of these American casinos where 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.220
 you start to raise the water on one side and 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.660
 on the other as if it were a party 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.910
 or that the truth was prepared something 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.260
 is that I found it quite funny and 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.610
 well then also what else can you see 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.310
 here as is a 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.009
 normal you shoot an incredible blast of 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.870
 rpg this you can see how good what 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.509
 out that shoots is basically a 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.919
 rpg missile and one shoots it in series 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.419
 not like it was a machine gun and the 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.099
 it's really quite incredible here 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.930
 good we stuck at a party 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.189
 truth is that an incredible laugh and 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.750
 Well, you can also equip yourself 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:49.270
 apart from rpg you can shoot what 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.979
 want in missiles can shoot bombs 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.020
 nuclear as I already showed in a video 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.509
 previous of hackers as well can 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.189
 shoot grenades or whatever 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.379
 directly explosions new pretty 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:00.550
 big so good is very good 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:02.800
 local the truth is that they are quite 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.389
 fun more than anything else I do not 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.849
 I know that the hacker does not use it in this 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.169
 sense to abuse the game or anything 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.300
 that but simply he likes 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.169
 teach us what and what we can see as 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.849
 I said you have your channel in the 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.500
 description and all that and nothing was 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.210
 then as I always say this guy leaves 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.550
 neither does it hurt anybody's weapons 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.080
 new hidden weapons and all this too 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.229
 I wanted to tell you a couple of other things what 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.449
 first is that today, the 15th of the 1st of 2014 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.789
 they are going to close gta 5 servers 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:30.039
 online since 3 am --hora 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:32.409
 Spanish-- up to 24 hours have 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.120
 said okay I think that this they are going to 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:37.090
 do is to fix many 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.410
 glitch hack we'll see if we do not 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.389
 we are left with nothing or if they start 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.210
 handle people or whatever because they do not 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:46.419
 understands very well because he needs 24 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.190
 hours or more for I do not know what you'll be for 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.870
 I think it's to remove hack for 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.120
 fix bitches and all that but good 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.000
 it's a theory of mine, so to speak 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.650
 hypothesis but good I do not know why else 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.270
 it could be also you can comment it with 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.190
 the comments that you want and 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.510
 all that and good also another thing more 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.130
 What I wanted to say is that there are so many 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.010
 people on the consoles pretending to be 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.900
 by me adding people and asking 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.580
 games asking for money and all that is worth 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.400
 do not listen to him I never go out there 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.990
 asking for nothing or money or games like that 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.820
 that you do not listen and do not believe if 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.010
 they say that I am the only account that 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:21.400
 I have of play is xx 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.840
 iván forever xx I have it private or 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.430
 that you can not add me or anything like that 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.770
 because good if you do not hit me on the play 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.389
 right away and good is only from the 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.530
 play is also worth another person who 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:32.229
 I have been told that he is passing 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.229
 by me that is a playstation 4 that 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:37.539
 it's called xx band forever xx same as me 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:38.830
 but instead of having one has a zero 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:40.520
 It is also worth looking at those details 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.560
 that is not me 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.419

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.310
 correctly all the letters each 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.720
 of them is worth and some kids 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.819
