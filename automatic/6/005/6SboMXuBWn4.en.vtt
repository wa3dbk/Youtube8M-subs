bit different kind of compost this is

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.859 
bit different kind of compost this is
what<00:00:24.619> I<00:00:24.650> call<00:00:24.980> least<00:00:25.279> mold<00:00:25.580> and<00:00:25.910> I<00:00:26.600> learned

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
what I call least mold and I learned

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.510 
what I call least mold and I learned
about<00:00:26.960> leaf<00:00:27.290> mold<00:00:27.590> as<00:00:27.800> a<00:00:27.830> student<00:00:28.279> at<00:00:28.369> michigan

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
about leaf mold as a student at michigan

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.820 
about leaf mold as a student at michigan
state<00:00:28.939> university<00:00:28.970> years<00:00:29.900> and<00:00:30.110> years<00:00:30.259> ago<00:00:30.560> and

leaf<00:00:31.520> mold<00:00:31.790> is<00:00:31.910> something<00:00:32.239> that<00:00:32.330> i<00:00:32.390> use<00:00:32.750> for<00:00:33.110> my

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
leaf mold is something that i use for my

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.340 
leaf mold is something that i use for my
perennials<00:00:34.370> and<00:00:34.640> it<00:00:35.480> starts<00:00:35.900> reeling<00:00:36.199> with

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
perennials and it starts reeling with

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.950 
perennials and it starts reeling with
the<00:00:36.769> leaves<00:00:37.340> that<00:00:37.640> were<00:00:37.850> collected<00:00:38.360> last<00:00:38.540> fall

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
the leaves that were collected last fall

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.320 
the leaves that were collected last fall
and<00:00:39.260> then<00:00:39.949> I<00:00:40.010> put<00:00:40.400> these<00:00:40.550> leaves<00:00:40.850> into<00:00:41.300> a

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
and then I put these leaves into a

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.900 
and then I put these leaves into a
compost<00:00:41.960> bin<00:00:42.080> and<00:00:42.500> I<00:00:42.559> usually<00:00:42.949> collect<00:00:43.730> them

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
compost bin and I usually collect them

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.479 
compost bin and I usually collect them
in<00:00:44.090> a<00:00:44.120> in<00:00:44.510> a<00:00:44.629> plastic<00:00:44.840> bag<00:00:45.230> or<00:00:45.590> a<00:00:45.650> paper<00:00:45.890> bag<00:00:46.190> and

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
in a in a plastic bag or a paper bag and

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.610 
in a in a plastic bag or a paper bag and
then<00:00:47.000> I<00:00:47.090> layer<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.600> compost<00:00:48.019> pile<00:00:48.290> so<00:00:48.530> I'll

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
then I layer the compost pile so I'll

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.829 
then I layer the compost pile so I'll
put<00:00:48.800> a<00:00:48.860> bag<00:00:49.250> of<00:00:49.430> leaves<00:00:49.640> on<00:00:49.850> and<00:00:50.449> then<00:00:50.570> I'll<00:00:50.660> put

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
put a bag of leaves on and then I'll put

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.619 
put a bag of leaves on and then I'll put
a<00:00:50.870> little<00:00:51.550> last<00:00:52.550> year's<00:00:52.790> compost<00:00:53.270> down<00:00:53.420> the

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
a little last year's compost down the

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.720 
a little last year's compost down the
top<00:00:53.840> of<00:00:53.960> that<00:00:54.110> other<00:00:54.649> bag<00:00:54.890> of<00:00:55.100> leaves<00:00:55.340> and<00:00:55.640> then

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
top of that other bag of leaves and then

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.389 
top of that other bag of leaves and then
more<00:00:55.910> compost<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:56.930> so<00:00:57.230> in<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:58.100> in<00:00:58.370> the

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
more compost and so in the in the

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.270 
more compost and so in the in the
springtime<00:00:59.350> these<00:01:00.350> leaves<00:01:00.590> are<00:01:00.829> really<00:01:01.129> not

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
springtime these leaves are really not

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.100 
springtime these leaves are really not
broken<00:01:01.610> down<00:01:01.940> yet<00:01:02.239> they're<00:01:02.420> starting<00:01:02.870> to<00:01:02.960> be

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
broken down yet they're starting to be

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.200 
broken down yet they're starting to be
broken<00:01:03.469> down<00:01:03.500> but<00:01:04.339> they're<00:01:04.489> not<00:01:04.640> quite<00:01:04.850> there

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
broken down but they're not quite there

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.139 
broken down but they're not quite there
yet<00:01:05.239> now<00:01:06.020> throughout<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.680> summer<00:01:07.149> this

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
yet now throughout the summer this

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.800 
yet now throughout the summer this
compost<00:01:08.720> will<00:01:09.200> turn<00:01:09.800> into<00:01:09.920> a<00:01:10.100> light<00:01:10.810> fluffy

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
compost will turn into a light fluffy

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.120 
compost will turn into a light fluffy
material<00:01:12.320> that<00:01:13.310> in<00:01:13.550> the<00:01:13.670> fall<00:01:13.940> I<00:01:14.330> simply<00:01:15.130> side

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
material that in the fall I simply side

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.710 
material that in the fall I simply side
dress<00:01:16.460> or<00:01:16.670> put<00:01:16.820> over<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.240> top<00:01:17.270> of<00:01:17.630> my

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
dress or put over the top of my

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.020 
dress or put over the top of my
perennials<00:01:18.289> when<00:01:18.830> I<00:01:18.920> cut<00:01:19.190> them<00:01:19.310> back<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:19.850> so

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
perennials when I cut them back and so

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.639 
perennials when I cut them back and so
it's<00:01:20.180> a<00:01:20.270> wonderful<00:01:20.840> addition<00:01:21.050> to<00:01:21.289> help

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
it's a wonderful addition to help

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.370 
it's a wonderful addition to help
improve<00:01:22.160> the<00:01:22.369> soil<00:01:22.610> of<00:01:22.940> a<00:01:23.539> perennial<00:01:23.990> garden

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
improve the soil of a perennial garden

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.800 
improve the soil of a perennial garden
and<00:01:24.649> something<00:01:25.190> that<00:01:25.310> I<00:01:25.340> think<00:01:25.459> gardeners<00:01:26.060> you

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
and something that I think gardeners you

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.620 
and something that I think gardeners you
need<00:01:26.959> to<00:01:27.050> do<00:01:27.200> more<00:01:27.380> with<00:01:27.619> because<00:01:28.009> it<00:01:28.160> does<00:01:28.630> use

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
need to do more with because it does use

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.740 
need to do more with because it does use
a<00:01:29.660> waste<00:01:30.319> product<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:30.860> leaves<00:01:31.099> and<00:01:31.569> helps<00:01:32.569> to

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
a waste product and leaves and helps to

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.480 
a waste product and leaves and helps to
improve<00:01:32.929> the<00:01:33.289> soil<00:01:33.470> at<00:01:33.709> the<00:01:33.830> same<00:01:34.009> time<00:01:34.250> it

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
improve the soil at the same time it

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.550 
improve the soil at the same time it
also<00:01:34.580> helps<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.119> reduce<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:35.990> amount<00:01:36.289> of

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
also helps to reduce the amount of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.370 
also helps to reduce the amount of
material<00:01:37.250> going<00:01:37.429> into<00:01:37.729> landfills<00:01:38.209> so<00:01:39.020> this<00:01:39.259> is

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
material going into landfills so this is

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.960 
material going into landfills so this is
a<00:01:39.440> little<00:01:39.649> different<00:01:39.950> kind<00:01:40.190> of<00:01:40.310> composting

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
a little different kind of composting

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.910 
a little different kind of composting
today<00:01:41.660> we've<00:01:41.899> really<00:01:42.380> talked<00:01:42.619> about

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
today we've really talked about

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.219 
today we've really talked about
different<00:01:43.160> compost<00:01:43.910> systems<00:01:44.330> and<00:01:44.720> I<00:01:45.020> hope

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
different compost systems and I hope

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.169 
different compost systems and I hope
that<00:01:45.440> if<00:01:46.190> you<00:01:46.280> have<00:01:46.429> them<00:01:46.520> count<00:01:46.729> posted<00:01:47.090> in

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
that if you have them count posted in

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:48.580 
that if you have them count posted in
the<00:01:47.240> past<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:47.690> maybe<00:01:47.899> I'll<00:01:48.050> try<00:01:48.229> it<00:01:48.319> in<00:01:48.500> the

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
the past that maybe I'll try it in the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.999 
the past that maybe I'll try it in the
future<00:01:49.810> here's<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.899> different<00:01:51.080> system<00:01:51.440> for<00:01:51.979> a

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
future here's a different system for a

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.190 
future here's a different system for a
bin<00:01:52.310> for<00:01:52.630> composting<00:01:53.630> we're<00:01:53.840> over<00:01:54.080> the

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
bin for composting we're over the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.199 
bin for composting we're over the
neighbors<00:01:54.530> compost<00:01:55.009> pile<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:55.640> here<00:01:55.940> you<00:01:56.060> can

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209 
neighbors compost pile and here you can

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:59.889 
neighbors compost pile and here you can
see<00:01:56.420> that<00:01:56.470> it<00:01:57.470> was<00:01:57.649> constructed<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.569> frame<00:01:59.569> with

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
see that it was constructed a frame with
