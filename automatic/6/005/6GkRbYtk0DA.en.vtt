that plus sign is for in a little bit it
was<00:00:14.990> sent<00:00:15.230> to<00:00:15.290> me<00:00:15.440> reviewed<00:00:15.769> by<00:00:15.920> the<00:00:15.980> company

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
was sent to me reviewed by the company

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.620 
was sent to me reviewed by the company
and<00:00:16.640> at<00:00:16.790> first<00:00:16.939> it<00:00:17.119> was<00:00:17.210> a<00:00:17.240> bit<00:00:17.450> hesitant

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
and at first it was a bit hesitant

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.390 
and at first it was a bit hesitant
because<00:00:18.200> if<00:00:18.320> you've<00:00:18.470> watched<00:00:18.710> my<00:00:18.860> videos<00:00:19.220> you

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
because if you've watched my videos you

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.980 
because if you've watched my videos you
know<00:00:19.550> that<00:00:19.580> I<00:00:19.850> have<00:00:20.029> not<00:00:20.240> been<00:00:20.420> one<00:00:20.539> to<00:00:20.630> jump<00:00:20.810> on

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
know that I have not been one to jump on

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.200 
know that I have not been one to jump on
the<00:00:21.080> BB<00:00:21.320> cream<00:00:21.439> bandwagon<00:00:21.920> but<00:00:22.640> I<00:00:22.670> was<00:00:22.880> curious

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
the BB cream bandwagon but I was curious

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.939 
the BB cream bandwagon but I was curious
because<00:00:23.689> it's<00:00:23.810> by<00:00:23.930> ponds<00:00:24.230> it's<00:00:24.529> a<00:00:24.590> brand<00:00:24.830> I

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
because it's by ponds it's a brand I

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.099 
because it's by ponds it's a brand I
trust<00:00:25.250> it's<00:00:25.460> been<00:00:25.609> around<00:00:25.789> well<00:00:26.359> forever<00:00:26.660> and

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
trust it's been around well forever and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.890 
trust it's been around well forever and
so<00:00:28.039> I<00:00:28.279> gave<00:00:28.699> it<00:00:28.820> a<00:00:28.880> shot<00:00:28.910> I've<00:00:29.240> been<00:00:29.269> wearing<00:00:29.660> it

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
so I gave it a shot I've been wearing it

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.530 
so I gave it a shot I've been wearing it
a<00:00:30.109> lot<00:00:30.140> in<00:00:30.710> recent<00:00:31.429> videos<00:00:31.849> this<00:00:32.029> month<00:00:32.239> I<00:00:32.509> have

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
a lot in recent videos this month I have

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.500 
a lot in recent videos this month I have
it<00:00:32.900> on<00:00:32.989> today<00:00:33.170> and<00:00:33.820> I<00:00:34.820> want<00:00:35.210> to<00:00:35.269> tell<00:00:35.390> you<00:00:35.479> a

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
it on today and I want to tell you a

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.610 
it on today and I want to tell you a
little<00:00:35.720> bit<00:00:35.839> more<00:00:35.960> about<00:00:36.290> it

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
little bit more about it

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.070 
little bit more about it
it<00:00:36.710> comes<00:00:37.100> with<00:00:37.370> SPF<00:00:37.940> 15<00:00:38.089> which<00:00:38.570> is<00:00:38.750> great

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
it comes with SPF 15 which is great

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.689 
it comes with SPF 15 which is great
because<00:00:39.440> we<00:00:39.949> all<00:00:40.070> need<00:00:40.220> a<00:00:40.280> little<00:00:40.370> extra

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
because we all need a little extra

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.100 
because we all need a little extra
protection<00:00:40.820> especially<00:00:41.390> in<00:00:41.659> the<00:00:41.720> summer

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
protection especially in the summer

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.549 
protection especially in the summer
it<00:00:42.530> does<00:00:43.070> have<00:00:43.250> some<00:00:43.280> skin<00:00:43.760> care<00:00:44.690> benefits<00:00:45.019> it

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
it does have some skin care benefits it

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.680 
it does have some skin care benefits it
contains<00:00:45.949> vitamin<00:00:46.400> E<00:00:46.580> and<00:00:46.790> glycerin<00:00:47.420> which

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
contains vitamin E and glycerin which

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.140 
contains vitamin E and glycerin which
are<00:00:47.900> good<00:00:48.049> for<00:00:48.080> moisturizing<00:00:48.830> but<00:00:49.519> it<00:00:49.879> dries

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
are good for moisturizing but it dries

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.969 
are good for moisturizing but it dries
to<00:00:50.180> met<00:00:50.510> finish<00:00:50.900> so<00:00:51.260> I<00:00:51.290> really<00:00:51.650> think<00:00:51.769> it's

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:51.979 
to met finish so I really think it's

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:53.590 
to met finish so I really think it's
suitable<00:00:52.129> for<00:00:52.339> all<00:00:52.519> skin<00:00:52.909> types<00:00:52.940> whether<00:00:53.330> you

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
suitable for all skin types whether you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.259 
suitable for all skin types whether you
have<00:00:53.809> oily<00:00:54.290> skin<00:00:54.320> or<00:00:54.680> dry<00:00:54.769> skin<00:00:54.860> like<00:00:55.220> me<00:00:55.460> now

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
have oily skin or dry skin like me now

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.240 
have oily skin or dry skin like me now
that's<00:00:56.869> all<00:00:57.049> well<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:57.320> good<00:00:57.379> but<00:00:57.530> what<00:00:57.860> I<00:00:58.040> like

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
that's all well and good but what I like

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.509 
that's all well and good but what I like
is<00:00:58.280> how<00:00:58.430> it<00:00:58.670> actually<00:00:59.030> performs<00:00:59.510> so<00:01:00.350> as<00:01:00.769> you

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
is how it actually performs so as you

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.179 
is how it actually performs so as you
can<00:01:01.699> see<00:01:01.970> it<00:01:02.360> gives<00:01:02.689> really<00:01:03.140> good<00:01:03.290> coverage<00:01:04.010> I

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
can see it gives really good coverage I

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.070 
can see it gives really good coverage I
mean<00:01:04.280> it's<00:01:04.430> not<00:01:04.519> a<00:01:04.580> heavy<00:01:04.850> full<00:01:05.330> coverage<00:01:05.750> kind

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
mean it's not a heavy full coverage kind

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.540 
mean it's not a heavy full coverage kind
of<00:01:06.170> foundation<00:01:06.680> but<00:01:06.830> it's<00:01:06.979> not<00:01:07.130> a<00:01:07.160> foundation

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
of foundation but it's not a foundation

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.390 
of foundation but it's not a foundation
it's<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:08.000> BB<00:01:08.300> cream<00:01:08.330> I<00:01:08.750> like<00:01:09.530> it<00:01:09.770> on<00:01:09.980> days<00:01:10.370> and

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
it's a BB cream I like it on days and

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.460 
it's a BB cream I like it on days and
normal<00:01:11.090> summer<00:01:11.300> days<00:01:11.570> when<00:01:11.870> I'm<00:01:11.960> just<00:01:12.170> hanging

I've<00:01:23.150> been<00:01:23.180> wearing<00:01:23.480> it<00:01:23.570> in<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:23.780> evening

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
I've been wearing it in the evening

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.230 
I've been wearing it in the evening
underneath<00:01:24.920> my<00:01:25.070> foundation<00:01:25.730> it<00:01:25.880> makes<00:01:26.060> a

underneath my foundation it makes a

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.390 
underneath my foundation it makes a
great<00:01:26.540> makeup<00:01:27.020> primer<00:01:27.350> I<00:01:27.740> found<00:01:28.160> that<00:01:28.280> my

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
great makeup primer I found that my

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.190 
great makeup primer I found that my
makeup<00:01:28.730> is<00:01:28.850> less<00:01:29.120> likely<00:01:29.450> to<00:01:29.480> settle<00:01:29.840> into<00:01:30.170> my

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.890 
makeup is less likely to settle into my
lines<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:30.890> I<00:01:31.550> get<00:01:31.730> a<00:01:31.760> really<00:01:31.970> nice<00:01:32.300> airbrushed

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
lines and I get a really nice airbrushed

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.630 
lines and I get a really nice airbrushed
finish<00:01:32.960> on<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:33.440> actual<00:01:33.710> foundation<00:01:34.040> so<00:01:34.460> it's

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
finish on the actual foundation so it's

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.350 
finish on the actual foundation so it's
a<00:01:34.760> win-win

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
a win-win

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.230 
a win-win
