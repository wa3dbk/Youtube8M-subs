00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.709 
could if you want to and rate please but
I<00:01:41.710> know<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.909> beginning<00:01:43.240> sounds<00:01:43.539> something

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
I know the beginning sounds something

00:01:43.719 --> 00:02:01.210 
I know the beginning sounds something
like<00:01:43.810> this

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.850 

the<00:02:01.790> drums<00:02:02.240> kick<00:02:02.510> in<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:03.110> it<00:02:03.200> sounds<00:02:03.620> badass

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
the drums kick in and it sounds badass

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.520 
the drums kick in and it sounds badass
right<00:02:04.430> so<00:02:04.700> i<00:02:05.300> think<00:02:05.660> the<00:02:05.810> opening<00:02:06.260> lake<00:02:06.380> is

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
right so i think the opening lake is

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.620 
right so i think the opening lake is
repeated<00:02:06.980> like<00:02:07.160> three<00:02:07.580> or<00:02:07.670> four<00:02:07.700> times<00:02:08.090> and

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
repeated like three or four times and

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.110 
repeated like three or four times and
then<00:02:09.229> we<00:02:09.350> jump<00:02:09.560> into<00:02:09.680> the<00:02:09.920> second<00:02:10.340> lick<00:02:10.490> which

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
then we jump into the second lick which

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.670 
then we jump into the second lick which
i'm<00:02:11.390> going<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.660> explain<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:11.990> you<00:02:12.170> in<00:02:12.320> part<00:02:12.530> two
