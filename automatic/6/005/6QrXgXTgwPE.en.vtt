00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.700
 The hydroponic vegetable garden consists of growing vegetables, fruit vegetables and spices and 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.929
 medicinal herbs without the use of pesticides and in an ecologically 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:16.150
 without burning and with the ideal treatment for vegetables. 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.480
 plants develop in water 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.180
 or replaced in the soil for its development by water and is 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.180
 necessary to add adults in liquid form 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.329
 there is an irrigation system that does not let it dry and at the same time 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.639
 that we can breathe the vegetable garden is cultivated high from the ground by indication 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.470
 for weeks what is taught 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.600
 we ready a truck's wallet such weapons tray a statement 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.550
 of support to the work tries to close with the victory 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.550
 to pass this bring and the fauna 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.500
 to stay in the maracana 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.880
 in defense 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.979
 to maintain the development of the vegetables very well 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.899
 water used in irrigation contain a number of nutrients that 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.360
 davi of the plants 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.380
 At least 11 types of fertilizer are placed in the water 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.830
 stored in a very large box 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.010
 and then pumped to the entire flowerbed, we searched back home and 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.369
 becomes pumping from the same water to the vegetables 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.130
 through bombs it is good to play here along the back through the sewer 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.320
 by decree 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.770
 the trim on the screen 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.200
 level and another artistic part returning to the highway 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.710
 so let's play here there's a 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.640
 we have registered for regularized 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.670
 the amount of the pair was in the na na na 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.649
 in each canoe for each one that the world produces and distributes and August 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.250
 what's up 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.470
 Back to caijing 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.550
 logically pumped back there we make a title 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.980
 the seeds are stored in a special plate 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.769
 and stayed for two days in a greenhouse 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.230
 then placed on a bench for later replanting in the 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.199
 definitive locations 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:18.999
 each of these according to the owner contains approximately 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:22.149
 700 pieces of vegetables 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:26.989
 that besides tasty are rich in proteins the return of this investment 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.889
 is fully obtained from the third month of operation 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.740
 he said the organic hydroponic order adds even more value to the 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.909
 product with lower operating cost 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.180
 gi giving sustainability to the system and in plants 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.340
 you do not see some days you expect some
