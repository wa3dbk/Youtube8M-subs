moon and masks we have to plan for that

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.330 
moon and masks we have to plan for that
so<00:06:14.850> that<00:06:15.450> would<00:06:15.600> be<00:06:15.630> much<00:06:15.870> better<00:06:16.100> than<00:06:17.100> just

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
so that would be much better than just

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.240 
so that would be much better than just

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.170 
there and coming back we should now

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.440 
there and coming back we should now

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
think for colonization we should now

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.480 
think for colonization we should now
think<00:06:24.780> for<00:06:24.890> utilizing<00:06:25.890> the<00:06:25.980> resources<00:06:26.010> of
