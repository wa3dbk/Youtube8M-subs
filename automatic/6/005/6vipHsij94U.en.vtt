00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Today we are doing a delicious job 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.000
 Christmas gingerbread cake pops that 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.859
 recipe with the exact quantities in 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.400
 the infobox links or you will find it 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.290
 directly on american cooking.de as 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:21.350
 First we need soft gingerbread 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:21.350
 To do this, stir your brown sugar 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.939
 vanilla sugar 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.990
 ws 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.210
 melted butter 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.750
 and honey until I mix everything well 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.750
 Has 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.000
 then come more common hazelnuts 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.000
 to 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:22.140
 the flour is mixed with baking powder salt 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.740
 and gingerbread spice and gives it to the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.740
 remaining ingredients 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.790
 when everything is well connected 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.770
 distributed the dough evenly on a 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.020
 baking sheet coated with baking paper and 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.860
 Bakes the gingerbread in a preheated oven 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.490
 at 200 degrees above bottom heat 20 to 25 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.380
 minutes 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.150
 if known by the rods per 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.890
 remains hanging seems to me he's done 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.720
 so he does not dry out let her in 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.060
 best cool under aluminum foil 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.810
 when the cake has cooled it crumbles 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.810
 very fine 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.050
 then the nut nougat cream are to 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.670
 and knead the mass well 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.930
 She does that with one-off gloves because 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.930
 the whole thing is pretty sticky 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.270
 to shape little snowmen front 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.610
 in the dough in each case to small balls 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.260
 always one of the two something 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.260
 should be smaller than the other 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.340
 for Christmas trees and will use the 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.340
 dough shaped into small balls 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.640
 After that they have to wait half an hour 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.780
 hour in the fridge and good 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.320
 to cool and get tighter 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.970
 then you dive in the 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.400
 snowman at the end of the cake pops 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.110
 Styles in white couverture and put the 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.240
 bigger ball on the style 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.680
 while you should style up approximately one 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.680
 ask for half an inch 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.160
 then it comes a little blob 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.600
 Covers and the little ball on top 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.580
 As a holder you can for example in 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.710
 wrapping paper wrapped styrofoam 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.370
 Just use the tecops in it 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.370
 can plug in 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.690
 at the Christmas trees the 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.800
 stalks in green colored couverture and 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.800
 put the cones on it 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.440
 her caps dive with the broad ones 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.480
 side in white couverture afterwards in 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.019
 coconut flakes and then put them on 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.019
 the silence 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.690
 So he gives it again 15 20 minutes 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.690
 in the refrigerator 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.050
 if they are well cooled by it can 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.030
 The snowmen will go on 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.960
 up to twice complete in white couverture 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.960
 dipped 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.660
 Once the glaze firm you can 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.240
 to be decorated 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.470
 for scarf and nose are best 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.470
 from land or marzipan 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:12.879
 the small details are great 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.879
 with dark writing on mine 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.729
 as well is ice-confectionery what they are 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.930
 attached to a chocolate plate 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.610
 you can make chocolate chips 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.999
 closed couverture quite simply 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.999
 do it Yourself 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:13.979
 The Christmas trees dive into green 

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:17.179
 couverture and bring it with you 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:17.179
 toothpick still something in shape 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.500
 as a tree ornaments you can for example 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.500
 take sugar pearls or sugar sprinkles 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:49.860
 and as a star fondant or marzipan the 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.930
 small caps you dive to the white 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.680
 knew in red overture and let her 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.680
 drain well 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.920
 then you can still do it with white 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.920
