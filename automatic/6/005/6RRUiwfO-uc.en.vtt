 for this 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.960
 I think we're not going to shoot here if 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.620
 they have here they are going to send them to a 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.780
 island 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.020
 I do not know if they do not tell me the boy but 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.340
 they already know they arrive and they throw themselves easy 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.340
 and simple to see 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.250
 I think I do not remember how 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.250
 come back 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.690

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.430

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.430

 the guys are already on skype sorry 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.220
 that all the faults to be able to enter 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.860
 to the server already and get it transported from 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.350
 a good sky blog visa my parents 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.660
 will not appreciate compass lean sky blog and it 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.250
 come here I think these with those 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.900
 organs can trade 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.280
 if I'm not wrong if they can trade 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.280
 a very cool guy 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:23.290
 the written commands and set com 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.290
 is visit and this 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.550
 luis crÃ©ate 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.770
 is on the island 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.940
 another gives them many things so I say it is 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.790
 that 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.790
 you can start and you do not have the 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.420
 yet 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.870
 to this one 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:50.870
 I think to upload them home if they put the 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.870
 eat 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.180
 I think that around here I grow a lot 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.310
 if you can trade many things is what 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.290
 waths up 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.890
