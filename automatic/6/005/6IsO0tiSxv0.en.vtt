00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
to have a floating raft system so in all

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.859 
to have a floating raft system so in all
those<00:00:29.699> cases<00:00:29.940> you<00:00:30.300> wouldn't<00:00:30.510> want<00:00:30.810> something

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
those cases you wouldn't want something

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.630 
those cases you wouldn't want something
where<00:00:31.440> the<00:00:31.590> water<00:00:31.770> is<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.070> up<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.489> down

where the water is going up and down

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.060 
where the water is going up and down
like<00:00:33.030> you'll<00:00:33.210> have<00:00:33.239> with<00:00:33.539> a<00:00:33.570> bell<00:00:33.750> siphon<00:00:34.070> you

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
like you'll have with a bell siphon you

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.079 
like you'll have with a bell siphon you
could<00:00:35.340> just<00:00:35.609> stick<00:00:35.909> a<00:00:36.239> pipe<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:37.589> your<00:00:37.800> boat

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:38.089 
could just stick a pipe in your boat

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:40.849 
could just stick a pipe in your boat
like<00:00:39.089> that<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:40.079> what<00:00:40.260> will<00:00:40.350> happen<00:00:40.679> is<00:00:40.769> the

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
like that and what will happen is the

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:42.259 
like that and what will happen is the
water<00:00:40.890> will<00:00:41.129> get<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.519> to<00:00:41.699> this<00:00:41.789> level<00:00:41.999> and

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
water will get up to this level and

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.660 
water will get up to this level and
it'll<00:00:42.449> stay<00:00:42.659> at<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.899> level<00:00:43.579> assuming<00:00:44.579> you've

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
it'll stay at this level assuming you've

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.430 
it'll stay at this level assuming you've
got<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.510> water<00:00:45.719> flowing<00:00:46.019> in<00:00:46.140> from<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.379> other

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
got the water flowing in from the other

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.009 
got the water flowing in from the other
side<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.670> only<00:00:47.879> problem<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:48.389> a<00:00:48.449> simple<00:00:48.899> up

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
side the only problem with a simple up

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.779 
side the only problem with a simple up
stand<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.859> is<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.309> really<00:00:50.550> loud

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
stand like this is it's really loud

stand like this is it's really loud
people<00:00:53.789> who<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.769> saltwater<00:00:55.769> aquariums<00:00:56.429> have

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:57.389 
people who have saltwater aquariums have

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:59.209 
people who have saltwater aquariums have
struggled<00:00:57.839> with<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.139> for<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.409> long<00:00:58.559> time<00:00:58.859> and

struggled with this for a long time and
in<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.679> community<00:01:01.679> you'll<00:01:01.829> find<00:01:02.100> they've

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
in that community you'll find they've

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.860 
in that community you'll find they've
come<00:01:02.999> up<00:01:03.030> with<00:01:03.149> something<00:01:03.539> they<00:01:03.629> call<00:01:03.839> the

Durso siphon mr. Durst Oh as I recall

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.800 
Durso siphon mr. Durst Oh as I recall
so<00:01:08.579> Durso<00:01:09.509> siphon<00:01:11.210> these<00:01:12.210> are<00:01:12.390> all<00:01:12.509> three

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
so Durso siphon these are all three

so Durso siphon these are all three
quarter<00:01:13.200> inch<00:01:13.350> bits<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.490> these<00:01:14.640> little

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
quarter inch bits and these little

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.179 
quarter inch bits and these little
lengths<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.840> I'm<00:01:15.960> using<00:01:16.140> here<00:01:16.469> are<00:01:16.740> an<00:01:16.979> inch

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
lengths that I'm using here are an inch

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.370 
lengths that I'm using here are an inch
and<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.399> half<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.880> perfect<00:01:18.570> length<00:01:18.750> for<00:01:19.049> what

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
and a half that perfect length for what

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.959 
and a half that perfect length for what
I'm<00:01:19.500> doing<00:01:21.109> so<00:01:22.109> you<00:01:22.140> put<00:01:22.439> together<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.920> tee<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
I'm doing so you put together a tee and

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.840 
I'm doing so you put together a tee and
a<00:01:24.390> 90-degree<00:01:24.719> elbow

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
a 90-degree elbow

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.599 
a 90-degree elbow
stick<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.090> your<00:01:27.149> pipe<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.369> now<00:01:29.369> what's

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
stick it on your pipe and now what's

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:31.670 
stick it on your pipe and now what's
going<00:01:29.789> to<00:01:29.820> happen<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:31.020> water<00:01:31.049> will<00:01:31.500> flow

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
going to happen is the water will flow

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.090 
going to happen is the water will flow
in<00:01:32.039> through<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.549> bottom<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.810> elbow<00:01:34.289> to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
in through the bottom of this elbow to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.300 
in through the bottom of this elbow to
come<00:01:35.340> down<00:01:36.530> one<00:01:37.530> nice<00:01:37.679> thing<00:01:37.710> about<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.130> is

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
come down one nice thing about that is

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.999 
come down one nice thing about that is
it<00:01:38.759> significantly<00:01:39.750> reduces<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.469> swirl<00:01:40.799> on

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
it significantly reduces the swirl on

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.730 
it significantly reduces the swirl on
the<00:01:41.130> surface<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.609> your<00:01:41.789> water<00:01:42.380> which<00:01:43.380> can<00:01:43.560> be<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
the surface of your water which can be a

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.169 
the surface of your water which can be a
good<00:01:43.920> thing<00:01:44.130> especially<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.759> you're<00:01:44.969> growing

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
good thing especially if you're growing

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.929 
good thing especially if you're growing
duckweed<00:01:45.920> but<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.009> addition<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.429> that<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.700> is

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
duckweed but in addition to that this is

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.510 
duckweed but in addition to that this is
still<00:01:48.179> going<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.359> be<00:01:48.479> kind<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.869> noisy<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.920> to

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
still going to be kind of noisy so to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.149 
still going to be kind of noisy so to
knock<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.119> noise<00:01:51.270> down<00:01:51.570> all<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.020> way<00:01:52.170> you

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
knock the noise down all the way you

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.800 
knock the noise down all the way you
want<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.460> go<00:01:53.549> ahead<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.850> put<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> cap<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.659> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
want to go ahead and put a cap on the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.389 
want to go ahead and put a cap on the
top<00:01:55.219> with<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.609> a<00:01:56.759> small<00:01:57.210> little<00:01:57.600> hole<00:01:57.780> here

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
top with just a small little hole here

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.550 
top with just a small little hole here
and<00:01:59.399> what<00:01:59.999> that<00:02:00.149> hole<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.569> going<00:02:00.749> to<00:02:00.810> do<00:02:01.109> is

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
and what that hole is going to do is

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.480 
and what that hole is going to do is

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
it's going to slowly let air in so that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.480 
it's going to slowly let air in so that
you<00:02:05.609> don't<00:02:05.640> get<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.969> siphon<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:06.780> me

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
slight a bit of back pressure on the air

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.610 
slight a bit of back pressure on the air
is<00:02:17.670> going<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:17.970> prevent<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:18.680> sucking<00:02:19.680> noise
