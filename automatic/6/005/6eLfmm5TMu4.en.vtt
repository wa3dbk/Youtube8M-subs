00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.139
 and greet everyone it's huge 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.610
 I hope you all are well 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.900
 find today for a new 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.639
 gameplay on battlefield 4 couple 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.130
 days before its release if you know 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.810
 as I can not wait for them to go out there 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.730
 it's starting to get long 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.470
 in any case I had kept a 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.039
 video in case an ad had been 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.990
 done 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.490
 and just these cases I do not know if you 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.080
 have followed the news esport these 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.120
 last days on battlefield 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.170
 but the first official competition 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.320
 has just been announced ie the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.370
 ems one if you want to know more 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.760
 it's a competition that's 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.800
 directly organized by electronic art 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.530
 in partnership with es l and who 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.039
 will run on pc for the moment it's 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.829
 that pc with a prize pool of 120000 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.050
 euros which is not nothing distributed on 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.270
 a year and over four seasons to know 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.550
 so thirty thousand euros per season at 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.350
 level of qualifications 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.359
 in any case for France I know he 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.220
 will be a species of the ader a ranking 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.710
 1 series where only the two best 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.780
 French teams will be able to qualify 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.619
 so I think it will be by season 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.030
 that each time the qualifications 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.340
 will start over for the next one 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.020
 but in any case it was happening 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.159
 like that in France I think it will be 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.830
 about the same system 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.420
 a little bit everywhere in europe in all 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.670
 case I do not know if you remember it 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.470
 a few months ago I told you by 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.119
 report at the arrival of the spec mode that it 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.549
 was going to announce great things for 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.560
 this boat file I think I had 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.729
 not deceived and in my opinion in my opinion 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.560
 it's not over yet there will be 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.820
 other ads 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.890
 maybe a cup of France maybe 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.270
 even something that something at 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.650
 world level because there for 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.960
 the moment I believe that if I'm wrong 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.520
 no ems it will concern that europe 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.829
 so for us 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.710
 our American friends will have to wait 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.210
 still a little bit we are not yet 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.250
 safe from a world cup if I can 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.750
 to say it like that and even of course 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.070
 French events when we forget 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.829
 not the two cuts of France who saw 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.500
 organized by paris she and the two 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.619
 seasons on bf3 so the machine comes 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.299
 to be launched that's pretty cool we have 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.299
 good news at the mode level 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.890
 of play they chose am not fan it 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.000
 there are a lot of disputes we will say 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.980
 that it is domination mode 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.209
 so we could see on the beta it's 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.920
 still so for the public it's going 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.989
 to establish strata on spawn 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.380
 we do not know who are enough 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.239
 random in domination mode 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.650
 it's quite difficult in relation to the 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.000
 conquest mode we knew about to 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.890
 what place were we going to spawn 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.599
 what were we going to do like 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.860
 attac the only approach is completely 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.280
 different because it's going to change in 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.510
 function of who holds how much 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.880
 so I do not know if it's spawn go 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.230
 change I hope in any case for the 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.680
 first season it will be like that it has 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.290
 been announced 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.549
 if ever there are problems of people 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.680
 who too many people who complain I 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:53.970
 think they can come back on their 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:57.750
 decision but not before before there of the 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.190
 second season also there are others 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.319
 things that were put in place at 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.510
 know from the first cup on the dry 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.920
 we will start the cres around 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.819
 November 10 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.920
 if I do not run I think that's it 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.510
 there will also go forth is scratched I 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.510
 do not know if you knew this on bf3 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.510
 it was strippers line by week 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.880
 with a final per month according to the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.579
 qualified of which there are twelve thousand euros 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.620
 over the year if I do the math and if 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.340
 I know I'm if I'm still pretty 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.109
 good in math 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.180
 it's 1000 euros a month to 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.380
 to share is always that it is 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.599
 always nice these little tubes that 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.500
 allows to train to occupy a 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:40.230
 little time the evenings on bfm 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.610
 apart from that so i talked about ems i 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.090
 talked about go for 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.530
 I said it will be on pc for the 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.380
 for our console friends may be 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.080
 still wait a little bit see what 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.850
 csl and it's all these small 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.380
 organizations offer on the console 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.870
 because sl unfortunately is that 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.370
 I think I have pretty much done 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.980
 the turn of all I wanted to say to 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.240
 about ems and competitions I 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.430
 talked a little bit now about 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.280
 teams that we can see we could see 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.900
 appear serves these days 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.250
 especially a team from europe who 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.350
 is called formerly 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.269
 the six films what were recruited 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.709
 by the dignitas team 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.980
 so it's a big structure 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.810
 European now we wait to see 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.340
 a little bit of what's going on 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.150
 develop at the level for example of 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.710
 big French structures like 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.500
 millenium other structures 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.630
 Europeans as I do not know fanatical 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.919
 epsilon have their their team 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.110
 had everything remember Europe level I 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.510
 believe they do not change as soon as they 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.160
 will be available so that they are 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.620
 present on two platforms namely 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.640
 the xbox one and the pc if I'm not mistaken 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.490
 finally that's it, it promises beautiful 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.860
 things of the beautiful competition for this 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.030

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.540
