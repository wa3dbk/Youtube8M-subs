00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
I just wanted to show you guys a machine

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.349 
I just wanted to show you guys a machine
that<00:00:03.270> I<00:00:03.300> had<00:00:03.510> built<00:00:03.780> in<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.910> one<00:00:05.910> point<00:00:06.150> four

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
that I had built in the one point four

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.820 
that I had built in the one point four
point<00:00:06.390> six<00:00:06.930> server<00:00:07.259> that<00:00:07.529> I<00:00:07.560> finally<00:00:07.799> got<00:00:08.040> up

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
point six server that I finally got up

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.320 
point six server that I finally got up
put<00:00:10.830> together<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.130> machine<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.700> go<00:00:11.820> from<00:00:12.120> our

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
put together a machine to go from our

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.650 
put together a machine to go from our
home<00:00:12.630> Waypoint<00:00:13.200> way<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.920> heck<00:00:14.040> over<00:00:14.309> there

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
home Waypoint way the heck over there

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.090 
home Waypoint way the heck over there
all<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.900> way<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.260> spawn<00:00:16.500> point<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:16.890> had<00:00:16.980> to

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
all the way to the spawn point I had to

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.920 
all the way to the spawn point I had to
make<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> 90-degree<00:00:17.609> corner<00:00:18.270> with<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.660> which

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
make a 90-degree corner with it which

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.810 
make a 90-degree corner with it which
meant<00:00:19.230> dismantling<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.220> entire<00:00:20.520> thing<00:00:20.550> and

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
meant dismantling the entire thing and

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.740 
meant dismantling the entire thing and
rebuilding<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:22.730> Kylie<00:00:23.730> kind<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.390> hear<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.689> in

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
rebuilding it Kylie kind of hear it in

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.390 
rebuilding it Kylie kind of hear it in
the<00:00:24.779> background<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.320> little<00:00:25.350> bit<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.099> let's

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
the background a little bit so let's

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.130 
the background a little bit so let's
just<00:00:26.609> pan<00:00:26.849> over<00:00:27.119> here<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.570> take<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.779> look<00:00:27.869> at

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
just pan over here and take a look at

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.630 
just pan over here and take a look at
what<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.410> got<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:31.439> original<00:00:31.529> one<00:00:32.130> before<00:00:32.610> I

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
what we got the original one before I

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
what we got the original one before I
took<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.270> apart<00:00:33.710> was<00:00:34.760> 30-some<00:00:35.760> blocks<00:00:36.270> long

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
took it apart was 30-some blocks long

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.090 
took it apart was 30-some blocks long
this<00:00:37.200> one's<00:00:37.500> leave<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> little<00:00:38.790> bit<00:00:38.969> shorter<00:00:40.100> as

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
this one's leave a little bit shorter as

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.380 
this one's leave a little bit shorter as
you<00:00:41.250> can<00:00:41.370> see<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.670> front<00:00:41.910> here<00:00:42.090> has<00:00:42.210> got<00:00:42.329> a

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
you can see the front here has got a

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.799 
you can see the front here has got a
couple<00:00:42.600> block<00:00:43.440> breakers<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.100> front<00:00:44.430> for

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
couple block breakers on the front for

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.020 
couple block breakers on the front for
pouring<00:00:45.809> through<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.610> mountains<00:00:47.610> if<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.910> came

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
pouring through the mountains if it came

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
pouring through the mountains if it came
across<00:00:48.090> any<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:51.120> course<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.570> red<00:00:51.840> power

across any and the course of red power
batteries<00:00:52.789> to<00:00:53.789> being<00:00:54.030> some<00:00:54.930> deployers<00:00:56.239> for

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
batteries to being some deployers for

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.220 
batteries to being some deployers for
building<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.199> road<00:00:58.410> deck<00:00:58.789> the<00:00:59.789> entire<00:01:00.059> way<00:01:00.359> this

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
building a road deck the entire way this

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.910 
building a road deck the entire way this
believe<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.770> or<00:01:01.859> not<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.760> altitude<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
believe it or not is the altitude of the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.440 
believe it or not is the altitude of the
spawn<00:01:04.920> area<00:01:05.960> 375<00:01:06.960> walks<00:01:07.950> high<00:01:08.450> which

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
spawn area 375 walks high which

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.719 
spawn area 375 walks high which
consequently<00:01:10.049> spend<00:01:10.680> almost<00:01:10.979> airborne<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
consequently spend almost airborne the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.580 
consequently spend almost airborne the
entire<00:01:12.180> way<00:01:13.250> from<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> little<00:01:14.670> weird<00:01:15.590> and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
entire way from that a little weird and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.060 
entire way from that a little weird and
as<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.100> see<00:01:17.130> there<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.430> am<00:01:17.790> actually<00:01:19.070> just

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
as you can see there I am actually just

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.899 
as you can see there I am actually just
the<00:01:20.369> set<00:01:20.909> made<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> crew<00:01:22.369> spot<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.729> one

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the set made a crew spot on this one

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.830 
the set made a crew spot on this one
this<00:01:24.060> side<00:01:24.330> I'm<00:01:25.170> chillin<00:01:25.950> right<00:01:26.100> there<00:01:26.840> and

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
this side I'm chillin right there and

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.560 
this side I'm chillin right there and
yeah<00:01:28.740> that's<00:01:28.979> pretty<00:01:29.250> much<00:01:29.640> machine<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.390> just

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
yeah that's pretty much machine it just

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.050 
yeah that's pretty much machine it just
kind<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.229> looks<00:01:31.500> like<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.220> picked<00:01:32.490> up<00:01:32.610> some<00:01:32.759> snow

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
kind of looks like a picked up some snow

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.399 
kind of looks like a picked up some snow
somewhere<00:01:33.799> but<00:01:34.850> they<00:01:35.850> had<00:01:36.079> suggested<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> make

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
somewhere but they had suggested I make

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.270 
somewhere but they had suggested I make

a video let show you guys the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.969 
a video let show you guys the
contraption<00:01:41.280> at<00:01:41.460> least<00:01:41.899> so<00:01:42.899> here's<00:01:43.799> our

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
contraption at least so here's our

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.590 
contraption at least so here's our
filter<00:01:44.430> pulling<00:01:44.759> out<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.000> gravel<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
filter pulling out the gravel for the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.679 
filter pulling out the gravel for the
deplorable<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:47.790> cobblestone<00:01:48.299> for<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
deplorable the cobblestone for the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.320 
deplorable the cobblestone for the
employer

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.260 

there's<00:01:55.330> solar<00:01:55.659> panels<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.790> engines<00:01:58.090> and

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
there's solar panels the engines and

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.390 
there's solar panels the engines and
make<00:01:58.390> fig<00:01:58.630> up<00:01:58.780> and<00:01:58.960> down<00:01:59.110> that's<00:01:59.680> pretty<00:02:00.250> much

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
make fig up and down that's pretty much

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.650 
make fig up and down that's pretty much
it<00:02:00.460> so<00:02:02.220> crazy<00:02:03.220> contraption<00:02:03.910> never<00:02:04.090> made<00:02:04.479> one

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
it so crazy contraption never made one

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.050 
it so crazy contraption never made one
three<00:02:05.229> blocks<00:02:05.500> wide<00:02:05.770> before<00:02:06.100> so<00:02:06.729> making

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
three blocks wide before so making

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.900 
three blocks wide before so making
everything<00:02:07.690> fit<00:02:08.050> on<00:02:08.170> here<00:02:08.610> it's<00:02:09.610> quite<00:02:09.820> a

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
everything fit on here it's quite a

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.970 
everything fit on here it's quite a
challenge
