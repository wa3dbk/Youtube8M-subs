00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.910
 hello to all of you 14 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.830
 today I will make you a 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.750
 little presentation of the purchases I have 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.950
 made in london 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.389
 I left a week in London so 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.039
 I found some video games I'm going 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.600
 introduce yourself to that I'm going to start 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.130
 before you introduce that I will 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.560
 start with a small exchange that I have 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.840
 done with like ea games that separated from 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.949
 a few I took him from play 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.480
 i took in london to on ps1 complete i 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.910
 I'm glad I had it on the 2nd 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.829
 I did not have the 1 and the final fantasy 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.350
 anthology so this one he does not have the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.050
 6 ours but good if he inhaled 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.059
 game I have not tested yet but 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.100
 I am glad to have you go 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.440
 so chain with what I found at 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.539
 london so to know what are we going to 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.940
 do not go where I was at all 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.770
 case does not have a lot of stores 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.390
 cash video games it's pretty complicated 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.980
 I still managed to find 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.559
 some because we can not 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.140
 to leave a week without without looking for the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.010
 good deal and I found some 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.489
 nice stuff 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.689
 so I already found the tales guide 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.189
 of xillia 2 in collector version so 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.229
 it's a rigid version 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.600
 he was in blister at he was all 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.549
 nine so that's cool to have found 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.159
 that's good of course it's guides that 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.600
 are in English but I do not think so 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.369
 that it's guides that came out in 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.939
 France so it's cool to find 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.500
 I also found the guide to 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.869
 mario kart 8 so that's cool too 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.119
 because in there are all of them all 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.840
 secret passages of the different circuits 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.299
 etc. 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.220
 tulle the state a dozen euros so 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.460
 so that's cool there was also 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.630
 a dragon guide origins origin 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.790
 non acquisition 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.590
 it's a guide I was looking for but 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.110
 as I just finished the game 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.880
 So I hesitated I hesitated 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.649
 take and finally I did not take 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.509
 I preferred to learn the mario guide 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.570
 kart wii who is still 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.939
 more useful is super happy to have 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.170
 found that the legend of zelda's guide 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.600
 skyward sword 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.369
 so he was at a pound so that makes 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.119
 about 1 euro 30 so so that's 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.099
 really that slab 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.660
 he was like that in super condition he in 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.390
 had one he was not blistered 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.700
 he was bedridden 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.580
 unpack like that and in addition there is a 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.170
 post inside so so that's 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.120
 cool to have found what was 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.010
 I was so happy when I found 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.410
 that and yes because I'm super 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.440
 glad I already find video then 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.290
 we will follow up with video games 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.810
 I found my note 2 on wii 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.250
 so that's a game I know it's 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.030
 a game that was censored because it 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.220
 was really very very violent limit 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.709
 limit that makes it uncomfortable I did not know 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.360
 that he was out on wii besides I 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.739
 actually wonder if it's a game that 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.680
 was released in France because when I 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.680
 looked at amazon I found that 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.900
 the English import actually so having 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.870
 apparently he is he is much better 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.280
 on wii that on that on ps2 so I 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.260
 really can not wait to test it there really 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.940
 I come back from England so I have 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.640
 only test my games ds because 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.340
 I had my ds with me the others I 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.590
 have not tested them yet I got 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.630
 found the last remnant so that's 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.640
 a rpg made by square enix it's a game 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.660
 I had unfortunately resold 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.209
 so I found them it is 2 euros 50 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.360
 so suddenly I took it back I got 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.340
 also found catherine so that's 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.019
 a little UFO it's a game we see 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.190
 not often 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.290
 I think I 'll do some gameplay on it 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.430
 it will be easier to explain 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.650
 the story because it's a little bit 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.600
 complicated but it's a game that has been 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.049
 very very well rated which is not easy to 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.840
 find 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.130
 I paid them 10 euros so so you 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.239
 see that it's really not my 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:47.030
 used to pay 10 euros a 360 game 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.829
 as old but but that one is worth 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.480
 really blow and I think I 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.730
 will do a gameplay on it for really 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.690
 you explain the story it's a game 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.230
 which is still forbidden to less 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.549
 of 18 years and is not by chance that's 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.920
 really a game for an audience 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.500
 adult 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.560
 Then I found a tales of graces f 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.630
 am the state apparatus at 12 euros so 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.310
 so I have not hesitated a long time could not 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.859
 take it because because rpg 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.739
 like that at that price we do not see it 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.510
 often to know that of course the box 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.400
 is in English since since I 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.289
 bought it in England but to know 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.769
 only from the moment it's games 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.020
 European 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.800
 it goes into French if the game is in 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.030
 french well 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.400
 there are games we buy in France 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.379
 who are in English anyway but 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.780
 there we can still see that the text 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:34.340
 is in French so really that 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.409
 change nothing at all it's just that the 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.849
 box is in English that's otherwise it's 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.860
 exactly the same games so 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:41.720
 so we will not deprive ourselves what for 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.240
 the moment I say well for the moment 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.120
 prices are a little bit cheaper 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.830
 for the occaz in any case the prices are 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.050
 a little bit cheaper in england 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.919
 but I think it will not last 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.409
 he starts to get in and I 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:00.620
 think they are going they are going they are going 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:02.710
 to align very quickly with France I have 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.780
 found a little final fantasy tactics 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.430
 so that's good it's cool I have not tested 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.500
 I did not have my psp with me see to 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.449
 eat with my ds and then well I was in 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.520
 holiday it was not for day video game 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.979
 it was really I had just taken my 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.449
 ds for the trip so so that's just me 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:22.969
 allowed to test my games ds then a 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:25.270
 little layton teacher and the mask of 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:27.460
 miracles on nintendo 3ds so his 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.710
 professor layton it's a safe bet 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:34.159
 if we like this kind of game it was 10 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.669
 euros so low 10 euros a game 3ds we go 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:36.669
 not missing 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:42.050
 then a little rainbow island 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.940
 revolution so that if there is a remake in 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.400
 did the rainbow island that was out 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.310
 on nes the only difference which is 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.990
 play with the stylus here otherwise it's 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.190
 and then his head was a little bit 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:57.340
 remastered but otherwise it's pretty much 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:01.819
 about the same things 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:03.800
 an ace attorney justice for all so bah 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:06.139
 here and his tour I think I 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:11.060
 think everyone knows he's at 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:12.800
 10 euros 12 to 12 I think so I was 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.849
 a little bit too and then I got 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.770
 says it's games we did not see 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:18.710
 often have not been so so that's 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.740
 always cool to find that and and then 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.620
 I think the price was right 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:27.529
 then a final fantasy tactics a2 so 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.629
 like the box is in English but in 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:31.909
 did I have it on the spot I just had to 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:33.469
 go change the language that's not put 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:35.449
 automatically to take in French 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:36.190
 but I just had to change the language 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:38.050
 and 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:42.310
 or suddenly everything goes in French 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:43.570
 so flawless it's cool it's 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.700
 games we do not see often so 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.740
 so when we see it on the shelf we are 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.900
 always like crazy and then and 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.260
 then for the price finally less than 15 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.680
 euros 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.060
 really worth it and finally 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:58.180
 my first find when I'm 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:00.550
 arrived and for me my most beautiful in all 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:03.430
 good case it's still a game ds but he 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:07.060
 this is carvi mouse attack so in 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:08.290
 french kirby the mice attack then 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.520
 I'm here for once 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.100
 directly better french 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.990
 it's a great game really if you 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.660
 like kirby if you like the first 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.790
 quarter be on nes it's really a game to 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.080
 to do because well that's exactly the 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:24.640
 same thing it's exactly the same 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.180
 gameplay you have you have different 

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.550
 powers 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:31.480
 fire 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:33.070
 the stacks crazy and it's like in the 

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.390
 first quarter be sure on the stage of 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.160
 anyway it's exactly the same 

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.750
 gameplay it's a platform game 

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.000
 exactly the same with a few 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.220
 more features because it's 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.900
 a game ds but otherwise it's exactly the 

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.700
 same thing and it's really a super 

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.090
 game that apparently is not easy to 

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.010
 find 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.480
 I said to you like crazy when I 

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.790
 when I saw them in the store I 

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.260
 urges right away and I really 

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.070
 you advise if one day you have 

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.160
 the chance to find him 

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.630
 after because life is a safe bet 

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:02.230
 so anyways I teach you 

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:03.580
 nothing so here for the purchases in 

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.740
 England 

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.660
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:10.980

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.980
