00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
covers snapping the battery at the angle

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.740 
covers snapping the battery at the angle
kind<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.709> folded<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.130> put<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.400> cover<00:02:28.549> on<00:02:28.750> and

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
kind of folded and put the cover on and

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
kind of folded and put the cover on and
then<00:02:30.109> it<00:02:30.230> orange<00:02:30.440> me<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.680> charging<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.549> once

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
then it orange me the charging and once

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.530 
then it orange me the charging and once
you<00:02:33.430> connected<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.290> oops<00:02:35.430> USB<00:02:36.430> plug<00:02:36.760> on

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
you connected to the oops USB plug on

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.230 
you connected to the oops USB plug on
the<00:02:38.050> side<00:02:38.320> of<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.620> Xbox<00:02:39.160> that<00:02:39.850> plug<00:02:40.090> right

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
the side of the Xbox that plug right

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.720 
the side of the Xbox that plug right
there<00:02:40.560> plug<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.650> in<00:02:41.740> there<00:02:41.920> if<00:02:42.070> you<00:02:42.190> want<00:02:42.400> I

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
there plug it in there if you want I

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.580 
there plug it in there if you want I
think<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.720> could<00:02:43.840> just<00:02:43.990> plug<00:02:44.110> it<00:02:44.260> into<00:02:44.380> really

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
think you could just plug it into really

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.870 
think you could just plug it into really
any<00:02:45.060> USB<00:02:46.060> port<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:47.400> if<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.460> had<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:48.580> computer

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
any USB port so if you had a computer

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.610 
any USB port so if you had a computer
that<00:02:49.030> was<00:02:49.300> closer<00:02:49.570> instead<00:02:50.110> of<00:02:50.320> stretching

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
that was closer instead of stretching

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.910 
that was closer instead of stretching
something<00:02:51.100> across<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.430> room<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:52.780> sit<00:02:53.680> up<00:02:53.710> my

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
the other batteries if flash is kind of

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.470 
the other batteries if flash is kind of
like<00:04:08.680> a<00:04:08.740> red<00:04:08.980> you<00:04:09.610> can<00:04:09.760> see<00:04:09.790> those<00:04:10.060> lights

like a red you can see those lights

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.610 
like a red you can see those lights
right<00:04:10.690> there<00:04:10.840> they're<00:04:11.020> actually<00:04:11.110> red<00:04:11.470> it

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
right there they're actually red it

right there they're actually red it
looks<00:04:11.650> pink<00:04:11.950> from<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.370> camera<00:04:12.850> but<00:04:13.030> that

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
looks pink from the camera but that

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.020 
looks pink from the camera but that
means<00:04:13.930> it<00:04:14.080> needs<00:04:14.140> to<00:04:14.260> be<00:04:14.350> charged<00:04:14.709> so<00:04:14.950> you<00:04:15.760> plug

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030
