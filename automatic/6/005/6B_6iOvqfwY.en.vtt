00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.170
 let's go then our first video 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.809
 Let's start with notes of 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.029
 Engineering measures already speak a little 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.439
 more about what an annotation is because 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.039
 use in action 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.560
 what are the votes how to use and 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.710
 ingestion to facilitate these 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.779
 annotations took because it is a notation 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.220
 voting is nothing more than a way of 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.170
 jot down something 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.020
 is a way for you to get information 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.480
 wrote the times in a way 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.510
 purpose is to make it easier for you 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.730
 doing what I like to write 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.340
 so we use it to facilitate the 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.070
 understanding of some information without 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.200
 damage loyalty sometimes 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.100
 you need to pass on a lot of information 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.690
 extensive and various information existence 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.000
 you can get lost in there half 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.470
 people who say they get lost in this environment 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.240
 so we use notes to 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.750
 facilitate such transmission of 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.750
 information 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.620
 so we have an example there are some 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.870
 because we have to go through several 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:21.500
 details of a very small 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:22.280
 details of the order of 1 000 00 two 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.400
 meters 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.740
 imagine with several data so then 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.020
 would overload the role of data 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.770
 or multiple data with a bunch of zero 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.770
 another handy example that generates 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.670
 twenty-five million watts 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.470
 so if I put more explanations 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.900
 then power from power plants 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.810
 generators would then overload deserts 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.650
 information to the details of the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.350
 equipment 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.730
 so we'll use it to make it easier on 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.350
 Yes, but they are annotations. 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.430
 we use the power notation of 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:09.130
 there's the so-called scientific annotation 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:13.870
 so we'll make the note 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:16.570
 in a number between 1 and 10 times a 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:23.320
 power of ideas such as this 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:26.170
 number and we will turn the day 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.290
 from that shame until the number 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.720
 is between 1 and 10 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.540
 so we still have one two three 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.750
 four five 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.470
 these two in the case of the idea where 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.470
 It will be 12 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:50.739
 times 10 to the power that this 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.079
 case is going to be minus five because one of them 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.500
 with the right row 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:03:15.609
 did you see the daughter in this case the fifth 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:18.190
 9 in attack 1234567 2010 10 left to 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:20.530
 left positive power 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.359
 if I never opened it right to 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:28.950
 negative power then a general form 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:32.530
 of a scientific annotation is a number 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.709
 10 to power 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.459
 this number 25 thousand and ten and this power 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.379
 has to be an integer and in the case 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.810
 there is no left over there 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:47.579
 it's a positive integer if I 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.579
 not the right has no negative ground 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.680
 engineering has made it even easier to 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.409
 the process 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.650
 We'll get this 10 HP 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.419
 organize them multiples of 3 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.609
 so it always goes every three or 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:14.769
 be this third of this sixth on the 9th 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:18.519
 12th or 10 -3 10 - 31 - norton of a thousand 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:29.169
 there are going to be given names for these powers 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:46.000
 then this third third will be 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:50.270
 called that of 3d and there we have a 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:54.020
 table of several powers generally 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:59.990
 we use between minus 15 and over 12 in hair 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:02.930
 at least 15 years 12 of 91 16 years 30 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:07.720
 would be 10 the third of this sixth in the 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:10.790
 9th and there is a table 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.390
 speaking of any name of each one 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.010
 of these we facilitate even more aa 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.390
 our notation 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:23.030
 then for example a number that justin 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:25.760
 2010 as we write one 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.890
 engineering capacity as bad as 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:33.530
 was a scientific season to improve 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:36.650
 so let's say so 2010 anyway 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.440
 people can go back 10 they had there and even 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.660
 this power is the last day 3 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.870
 today you can add them here and 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:50.870
 further decrease this power by 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:54.500
 example put 10 and certain 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:06:11.720
 then in this case this is 20 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:26.600
 according to the table if you can get 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:28.010
 from 10 to 15 that use good people we have 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:32.620
 to remember that our intention is to 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:41.950
 make it easier to write 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:44.840
 02 02 for sure and that facilitates 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.850
 so we will usually use the 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.370
 first burden this information 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.920
 which is most commonly used in the case of 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.210
 mills 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.880
 for example if the powers are 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:57.060
 usually given to the mega-watt agent 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:00.000
 even if it is 7 thousand megawatts 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.520
 that could be Serbian war but then 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.490
 or we use what is commonly 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:13.530
 used or we use what is most 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:15.720
 easy for our writing and that's what I 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.730
 I spoke with the intention of improving the 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.010
 some information transmission 

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:23.910
 Exercises 

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:25.860
 I answer to you and work 

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.780
 stay until the next month sign up for 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.080
 channel to keep an eye on what people 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.080
 is betting
