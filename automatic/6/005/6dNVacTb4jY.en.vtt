00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.650
 The first thing you have to do is install this application in your 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.220
 cell phone what works with most cell phones in my case I 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.760
 I have a 200 double vicson sounding and it works perfectly 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.970
 Now I'm going to show you how this application already installed in the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.070
 cell phone but instead of viewing it on the buoy phone 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.710

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.760

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.780

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.669
 after the disappointment

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:22.719

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:27.089
 you sport 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:31.149
 now 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:34.719
 in more 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.659
 and finally with the fire brigade mann 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.470
 ain come ape 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.500
 p petkoff 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:14.529
 remember that they can also cause the game when they like 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:17.659
 low 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:20.659
 low 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.620
 you have to know that this application came consumed but you have to activate what 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.620
 the first time in the following way 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.840
 we go to the bottom right of the phone screen where it says 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.090
 menu then 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.090
 setien then saul min 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.860
 in the first option of sahún where it says disabled and enabled we mark the 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.860
 option in the network 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.430
 it is important to know that when we change the configuration we must mark know 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.430
 to keep the changes we make 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.369
 we should also know that some cell phones the most games 

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:26.369
 fast they are slower than others 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.680
 for that we go to the option sentinel then in movies i in the last option 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.159
 down where leaves frame of the law pal we raise or lower the bars according to 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:45.159
 if we want to accelerate the emulation or lower it 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.150
 if we lower the bar the game will be faster and if we upload it will be 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.039
 slower 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.039
 we can go up or down with the number four i 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.680
 It's from our phone keypad 

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:17.949
 and if we want to change the order of our keyboard buttons as more 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:23.569
 you settle in we go to the option you have then control there we see the 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:26.569
 Default configuration that our application already has 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:01.409
 good as we already know we give him the menu and then he knows to save the changes 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:04.409
 what we do 

00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:17.779
 the application weighs only 3 megabytes or is the same nothing 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:23.420
 Well I wish you liked it then I leave the application link to 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.930
 that you download it from mega cloud 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.580
 and install it on your phones anything you ask about anything 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.349

00:07:33.349 --> 00:07:38.020
