 hydroelectric project cheves 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.120
 cheves is an energy project that 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.970
 consists of building a 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.220
 run-of-the-river hydroelectric power station 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.950
 huawei water from rivers is used 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.080
 checkbooks which is captured for 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.380
 generate clean electric energy and 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.000
 renewable after which the water is 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.590
 returned under the same conditions 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.710
 Chemicals to the riverbed 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.869
 Cheves hydroelectric plant located 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.179
 Between the towns of Sayán and Dzoni 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:43.619
 will have an installed capacity 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:46.240
 of 168 megawatts and 837 gigawatts / hour 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.399
 as part of the facilities for the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.350
 construction have been built 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.689
 Pampa works camps and 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.750
 mir water and the same feature 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.670
 spaces for offices accommodation and 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.280
 to give comfort to the staff that 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.750
 elaborates on the sn power project and 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.750
 its main contractors 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.140
 Also, the 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.480
 exploitation of checkbook quarries 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.819
 855 to produce materials for 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.740
 construction that will serve to execute 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:22.010
 fillings and concrete 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.980
 over the huaura river , a 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.770
 cofferdam to derive the river and it is 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.900
 building the huaura dam which 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.040
 so far has an advance 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.650
 of 9 percent 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.870
 for these works has been done the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.810
 improvement of road damage 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.760
 Goat court or iron baths for 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.510
 allow the transit of vehicles 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.489
 public and heavy for construction 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.189
 the water collected will be conducted by the 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.459
 transfer tunnel which has a 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:56.069
 approximate extension of 2.5 kilometers 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.859
 until its mouth in the bed of the 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:02.000
 river checkers and has an advance of 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.000
 5 percent 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.780
 on the river checkbooks have been built 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.880
 a cofferdam to derive the river for 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.580
 construction works reservoir 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:27.100
 checkbooks intended to regulate the flow 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:30.010
 of the rivers chacras and huaura in low water 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.740
 this work was made up of the dam 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.930
 chacras the catchment works the 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.930
 sand trap and loading chamber 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.520
 on this front the 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.280
 variant the former aura where 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.600
 transit vehicles will transit 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.550
 individuals thus allowing the 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.280
 reservoir construction checkbooks 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:57.120
 the driving tunnel whose length is 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.120
 of 9.8 km is being excavated from three 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.450
 fronts on the front checkbooks you have 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.720
 an advance of 820 meters 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:10.590
 from window one to checkbooks the 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.019
 tunnel has an advance of 117 meters and 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.070
 from window one towards the house of 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:20.489
 machines you have an advance of 52 meters 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:25.720
 which means a total advance of 989 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:29.500
 meters is 10% of the total 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:33.129
 the window one of 915 meters was 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.349
 completely excavated in its first stage 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:39.369
 the access tunnel to the powerhouse 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:40.840
 of 960 meters was also excavated in its 

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:44.260
 whole 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.949
 On the other hand, the discharge tunnel 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.979
 3.25 km is being excavated by two 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:54.729
 fronts from the access tunnel and a 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:59.020
 advance of 22 meters and by the exit a 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:03.520
 advance of 880 meters this represents a 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.569
 advance of 902 meters that is to say 28 by 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.999
 percent of the total 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:11.479
 is in the process of designing the 

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:14.719
 mechanical and design electrical equipment 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:16.580
 Hydro mechanic is completing the 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:19.969
 design of the towers of the line 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.949
 220 kilowatt transmission that 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:24.529
 will carry the energy produced in the 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:27.740
 hydroelectric power station cheves up 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:30.689
 huacho substation which means a 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.999
 20 percent advance 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:36.330
 the average transmission line 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:38.189
 attention of 13.8 kilowatts that 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.849
 will supply energy to the dams 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:44.069
 huaura czech and picunche is the 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:46.529
 final design process then 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:49.429
 get the necessary permits to 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:49.429
 start its construction 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.610
 the construction work of the plant 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:06.280
 hydroelectric plant is underway and 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.380
 follows high standards both in its 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.140
 engineering as in the work of 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:14.560
 social responsibility and care of 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:17.020
 environment is so the project seeks 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.720
 generate value in their communities 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.520
 Area of influence through various 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.950
 productive projects 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.100
 'I have lucrative training and assistance 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:29.440
 technique for the villagers 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:32.020
 this is the work that unites our 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.470
 vision the same one that commits us to be 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.940
 leaders in hydroelectric generation 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.940
 applying the best practices of 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:44.550
 business management and contributing to 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.550
 sustainable development of the country
