00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.490
 Hello everyone welcome to Ingushetia 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.290
 kraft for not a new episode of 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.660
 let's time lapse unfortunately but 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.919
 a little update because 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.749
 maybe you can help me 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:14.919
 so this opportunity for you to 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.630
 visit the map 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:19.660
 it's true that you've been a lot to 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.160
 ask me from there that I visit her at the 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.240
 first person and I did not have it 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.550
 is that because it is this that it is not 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.330
 not in the format of the show but there 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.279
 it's a little episode 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.320
 particular why not why 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.060
 no visit is so that allows you to 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.260
 see things a little bit closer 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.390
 but why do I do this 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.650
 video because I 'm not going 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.940
 unfortunately can not publish my 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.400
 episode tomorrow as planned 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.730
 because good as you know I have 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.430
 summer in the usa a week for for 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.750
 personal reasons and I do not have 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.000
 could turn around during this week 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.980
 out and because precisely in front of a 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.750
 computer and now I came back 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.050
 I 've been trying for three days 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.690
 non-stop working on my second 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.239
 episode and my laptop does not 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.680
 not want a computer when my 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.850
 laptop really do not want 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.710
 you may have seen it in the series 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.150
 with bread from time to time I had 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.400
 bugs or I went all alone and all 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.320
 is it getting worse and worse the 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.490
 maintenance and genres every 30 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.040
 seconds I'm typing this bug 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.840
 which makes it completely unplayable 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.520
 because every 30 seconds the object 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.130
 to be escaped on foot on escapes 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.400
 be rapped on the key in question 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.610
 and suddenly bah ie it is 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.869
 make 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.250
 I am always doing 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.890
 movements that I do not want to do and 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.470
 it's ugly so it's really 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.030
 difficult to play is impossible to 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.280
 build mostly stuff details and 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.200
 still just survival with sandwich 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.270
 go but then do some detail stuff is this 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.119
 impossible 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.590
 so I tried everything I have one and 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.039
 other versions I have everything 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.280
 remove minecraft and reinstall it 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:55.640
 not want I can not do it so suddenly 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.319
 what I'm going to do is I 'm going 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.710
 see for maybe borrow just 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:02.080
 told them out of sandwiches may 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.640
 but hey it's not not a beast I 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.890
 think he 's really going galley on 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.030
 Minecraft 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.420
 so we'll see I think I'm going 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.700
 do this and then after that maybe 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.260
 it may be time to invest 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.480
 on us in a new laptop 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.280
 I do not like it because it costs 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.350
 really expensive but good and then if not 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.300
 if you have any suggestions game actually 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.760
 the bug is that here is my personal walk 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.080
 all alone in directions it takes 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.780
 that I press the key then that 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.240
 had happened to me from time to time 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.910
 but this really is all 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.260
 30 seconds but that's jimmy 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.480
 never happened that much 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.650
 so I have I think it's 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.920
 maybe it may be due to 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.010
 the computer itself in fact in the 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.849
 meaning where he has 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.620
 I feel like he's doing chores 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.989
 all by himself from time to time he will put 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.340
 on the menu is everything from minecraft everything 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.900
 only as if I pressed escape 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.060
 and so I really feel that he 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.609
 do something on my own and that makes me 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.900
 not like the masses I do not think this 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.189
 either a virus or anything but 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.709
 I will still do a scan we know 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.030
 never but here it is said if ever 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.450
 you have ideas they are the 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.069
 welcome believe me and then good bah I 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.900
 see here I'm going to do I'm going to do that 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.129
 as soon as possible 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.989
 in the meantime I know what I'm doing 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.430
 proposes is that for those who are not 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.120
 aware I started the series in 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.870

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.790
 let's times in english on the channel 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.560
 English on this fountain and the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.120
 news did not see it's an opportunity 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.409
 then the little fountain 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.450
 I see that nice you want the sea 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.299
 during the episode we forgot so here we go 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.609
 a fountain coming out of this building 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.709
 up is there then you time lapse in 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.720
 English it's happening on the channel the 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.629
 left kraft tv the links are in the 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.680
 descriptions and so that's it I have 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.989
 am at the episode I'm going to publish 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.879
 episode 4 tomorrow so suddenly it's 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.379
 the opportunity for you to review the cei 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.349
 in a new language to progress 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.989
 why not and that's it it should be 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.010
 it must be pretty good 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:05.109
 here you can really see what 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:09.349
 point everything is laid out but not furnished 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:12.220
 even though that or announce to this people there is 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.220
 an interior everywhere 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.580
 pressure plate 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.300
 hop and yeah there I have not installed yet 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:30.510
 the stairs to climb any time but 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.800
 that's it and that's about all 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.700
 so I encourage you to watch 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.870
 this series there she is really nice 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.550
 it's basically the same thing but it's 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.990
 in another language it's suddenly 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.940
 feeling of the series is a little bit 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.740
 different but I say consuming the same 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.330
 thing but in another language so if 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.790
 never learn english you 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.830
 interested or see it in English 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.260
 you are interested this is the opportunity 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.120
 dream 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.169
 So this is sponsorship is built 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.320
 full of new houses since the 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.300
 last time thanks to mimi and myla and 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.030
 teo son who helped me and who 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.070
 have built some houses also from 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.210
 blow that allows it to run a 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.400
 little village between each episode 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.770
 as we said there must be a 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.570
 just way there way up 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.350
 so here are all these houses there 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.700
 are new and it's almost a 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.550
 new a new neighborhood and more 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.880
 so that's how you are at 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.050
 current 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.310
 I really do everything I can 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.470
 you know how much this protrusion 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.810
 is important and if the episodes do not come out 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.850
 not that there is a real reason and 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.370
 it annoys me because I see your 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.350
 past comments in still not mode to 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.620
 time and or thing and well yeah I 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:41.800
 know it's unfortunate that's really it 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.450
 annoys me but but I can not do 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.040
 other 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.660
 so that's so or so if you ever 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.570
 can give me donations to two 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.720
 nations for a live good point tv stuff 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:54.670

 buy me a new portable clothes this 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.270

 moving or even jose united states i 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.550
