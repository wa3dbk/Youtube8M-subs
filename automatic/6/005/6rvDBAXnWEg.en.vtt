00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.100
 good friends of the inco community this 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.580
 day I come to talk to you about a problem 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.160
 I had with the inco delta tablet and 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.950
 also by the hand ask for an apology 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.480
 I could not make videos that 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.989
 you have asked me about doubts of the 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.099
 same because here they talk about it in 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:28.980
 I do not have the anecdote in my hands 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:31.439
 because a video has been up for days 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.360
 sharing what had arrived 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.430
 windows 10 to the way tablet 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.980
 official 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.489
 we could book the and on the 29th 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:46.839
 July this one was going to arrive to us as well it was 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.760
 came install the update and what 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.269
 surprise I found that the tour did not 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.390
 it works with many already they have commented to me 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:59.650
 who have shared and like me 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.800
 the same thing happened to them 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:06.100
 the touch is calibrated 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.440
 and there is no way to fix it 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.940
 I was several days 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.940
 trying to find the solution 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.720
 I have a similar tablet extracted from 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.030
 drivers I installed them averaged driver 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.060
 winks 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.750
 I have other drivers like what is the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.810
 lives 110 and others as would the sling 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.810
 which are Chinese tablets with windows 8.1 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.270
 or similar characteristics and apparently 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.940
 this did not work I had hope with 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.780
 a fix from a youtuber that is from this 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.440
 same tablet 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.710
 installed and apparently it worked in his 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.380
 I had similar problems as I was 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.470
 that the screen is not calibrated 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.470
 it worked so what was my solution 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.399
 When the warranty under warranty 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.210
 they reported that this is not this problem 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.210
 you could see 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.450
 this problem could not be this 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.370
 occasioned due to the update 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.100
 and most likely it was from 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.660
 factory 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.580
 it does not make sense to me, but then 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.280
 I can not find a true science 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.870
 another solution since initially 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.210
 I thought it was because of 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.580
 incompatibility of the driver with windows 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:35.710
 10 as many will have done 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.150
 I went back to windows 8.1 and nothing happened 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:41.750
 he continued to persist with the same 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.530
 problem so now it only remains 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.830
 wait for the tablet to arrive and 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.819
 they go two weeks and you can apparently like 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.329
 I was told 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.870
 to install the whole system as 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.640
 conclusion that we have left 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.360
 I do not special 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.130
 and I'm afraid that I can no longer 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.310
 install any other system that is not 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.010
 the factory because the driver 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.160
 is going to be incompatible and is stop 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.160
 function 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.409
 As a contribution, I could only leave you 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.409
 drivers 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.600
 that I have is a very simple way of 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.970
 install them 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.520
 here they have that they have to execute 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.960
 this file and automatically 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.180
 will install all the drivers of the 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.450
 Tablet 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.020
 the link will be dropbox and here it will come in 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.120
 RAR format 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.450
 In case you need some 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.700
 driver I will also leave them if it is that 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.850
 they will need it since they are 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.530
 It seems that some drivers are missing because the 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.420
 another way would be to install the cons and 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.970
 see bananas but it's a very 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.230
 difficult if you need it are the 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.990
 tutorial on how to do it because 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.930
 you need to patch the program to be able to 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.360
 use correctly and it is a way 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.960
 very tedious to do it 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.080
 Well, hopefully, the community will continue 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.820
 growing so that someone with 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.010
 superior programming knowledge 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.820
 do us the favor of seeing if later 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:21.350
 help us with this problem and it would be 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.350
 all thank you very much
