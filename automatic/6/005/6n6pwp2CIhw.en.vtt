 good staff as you approach official sony products 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.690
 for the playstation 3 session 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.179
 whatever he asks of them 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.629
 r 7 7 wages 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:15.949
 both with bluetooth technology 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.960
 né cordial 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.960
 were starting first talking seibert 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:23.819
 the organ 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:27.230
 felipe melo grandson in this context to live 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.630
 he has 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.970
 these two keys up here that work as shift 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.570
 for you to take the functions 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.400
 here until the glass 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.780
 has shift keys too for you uppercase boot 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.840
 curtis north lehmann keys real curtain 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.060
 with the numbers also teaches 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.660
 in this key here would be a shortcut to messages 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.340
 on this key, the shortcut stops 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.050
 the friends list 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.720
 this time here 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.840
 that she the cool thing of the keyboard if you have so many buildings 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.100
 so if you repair 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.190
 these terms are brighter than those of the tip 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.880
 it's because they have sensors and when you walk away from here 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.020
 if you have for example internet browser and you get that way 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.600
 if I had the team 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.830
 in the last lot 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.370
 So 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.230
 it is not very precise nor comfortable because they are good people it is not really 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.289
 but for those who like technology, it's also a very interesting thing 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.030
 fernandinha seriously analogous prescription of 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.390
 the control 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.750
 I'll fit him in here. 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.750
 five tracks pick on me 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.420
 I never got here 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.370
 W 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.920
 kaka 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.630
 I clicked 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.070
 the mother 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.690
 It's a bit strange because there's a very high stop here. 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.510
 but until now it does not feel so happy 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.950
 and it does not disturb the gameplay 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.240
 I identify myself as levels 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.299
 Mothers at the time of typing if you have 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.269
 I lost a little time 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.230
 people can even lose lives you have to take your hand off the 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.659
 control 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.129
 there is a school bus that is very high up 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.319
 so you can not leave the government here 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.289
 the hand down here control and stretched of dementia 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:33.249
 you have to have love but it's not the time 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.489
 if he were maybe the commander vote down here 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.189
 it would be better because there you just click here 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:45.959
 more respect 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.579
 your physical type connector enter 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.709
 fdp you load 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.829
 italy it for the first time 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.839
 only connect fifth 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:59.979
 if you carry 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:03.819
 also free of control so you do not have to take the keyboard 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:07.339
 whenever it loads the control 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.709
 the new program frankly speaking 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.829
 no bounce 7 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.999
 who wins here 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.509
 it is also very beautiful also bluetooth technology 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:26.529
 it comes with the latest atp ranking which is one of them it also require 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:27.879
 many different 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.159
 this shrimp justification is that not everything is put in the shape of the face 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:39.900
 he has 4 buttons 6 7 the coolest maestro for me the differential 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.780
 the buffet changed and landed from the south kate the note on which was the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.000
 present you talk to someone but do not want anyone to realize why 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.629
 You tighten up what you wanted. 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.999
 microphone cut 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:53.419
 Paulo 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.049
 with the idea of ​​calling 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.149
 volume 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:00.319
 here in the state 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.309
 correct planting receive 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:05.469
 but what you just need to give him for the first time 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:08.229
 she seemed imminent 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:11.529
 because then had heavy and rechargeable 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.950
 if you plug the usb cable back here 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.969
 7 5 when I was with your bike 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:27.969
 and here you connect it the führer st if it was a cordless phone I left it 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:29.879
 what does he carry 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.430
 It does not take long in elevation. 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.149
 it was not for the load it's completely 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:40.779
 this consortium a cordless phone will use 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:43.080
 smells ranked 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.750
 it is working from the steering position on the base it automatically shuts off as if 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.080
 it was even a phone without success 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.460
 who is it then 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.469
 and if it is I think it's important because 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:58.550
 because of this technique was rené does not seem but sometimes you do not have 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.919
 I do not want anyone dare you're talking about playing with me. 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.249
 so it's important 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:06.110
 So 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.650
 I understand that you do not understand your home. 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.879
 exactly because of that 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.879
 still kid too because he has in me 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.840
 how is your information here battery level information 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:25.110
 this quality everything that appears on the screen that 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.909
 and others does not appear 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:29.930
 do not betray both products 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.569
 happiness because the birth 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:35.189
 on the internet portuguese 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:37.740
 also has control c 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.790
 denounce multimedia for you controls video and movies music and literature 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:45.990
 the mistake with building with trulli 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.889
 neither remote nor on television 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:50.289
 but I do not have 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.550
 a lot of students are missing it to complete 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.690
 are these three teachers who are needed in this respect 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.529
 for this I hope you have enjoyed 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:04.999
 but it's worth buying the two they have 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:08.409
 Seriously, 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:12.199
 not only in relation to a keyboard for example that you connect a keyboard of 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:15.440
 a computer the keyboard is significantly 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.780
 netanyahu does not work very well and the promotion in business I think a lot 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.189
 important until now also the facility that one has to pay 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.849
 that's it
