and you can have it with two classes of

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.979 
and you can have it with two classes of
brown<00:01:41.590> bread<00:01:42.009> I<00:01:42.869> believe<00:01:43.869> the<00:01:45.539> carrot<00:01:46.539> soup<00:01:46.780> is

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:46.989 
brown bread I believe the carrot soup is

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:49.109 
brown bread I believe the carrot soup is
no<00:01:47.259> points<00:01:47.829> because<00:01:48.640> it's<00:01:48.819> made<00:01:48.969> with

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
no points because it's made with

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.600 
no points because it's made with
vegetables<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.719> the<00:01:50.560> bread<00:01:50.890> i<00:01:50.920> think<00:01:51.280> is<00:01:51.399> two

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
vegetables and the bread i think is two

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.660 
vegetables and the bread i think is two
points<00:01:51.939> each<00:01:52.119> so<00:01:52.719> I<00:01:52.750> mean<00:01:53.429> it's<00:01:54.429> quite<00:01:54.579> a

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
points each so I mean it's quite a

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.359 
points each so I mean it's quite a
relatively<00:01:55.329> so<00:01:55.840> it's<00:01:56.379> more<00:01:56.649> than<00:01:56.770> relatively

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
relatively so it's more than relatively

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.270 
relatively so it's more than relatively
it's<00:01:57.549> a<00:01:57.640> very<00:01:57.909> healthy<00:01:58.289> lunch<00:01:59.289> or<00:01:59.829> if<00:02:00.129> you<00:02:00.250> just
