 chicks and beginners grid and 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.419

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.279
 that my mother had told me but you want 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.169

 that and well played I played until 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.199
 what I do not exclude being able to evolve with 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.120
 the boys and then under these at 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.830
 term of those years I had decided 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.000
 even to stop playing football or 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.979
 simply the richer people she who 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.080

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.699
 the castle contacted but jean pierre 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.460
 who was the president of the olympic his 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.070
 enemy to say it wait for me I have the 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.170
 game when you have to be summoned in 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.490
 selection was not bad so I'm 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.430
 party selection champagne ardenne 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.320
 I exploded all the tests beat all 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.729
 the world at the seams and and that was 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.080
 the beginning of my career in movies 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.700
 it was for me and for my parents 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.500
 important to have a club that we 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.790
 attracted kim would welcome in the 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.979
 better conditions that's why 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.179
 I spent so many years to sow 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.920
 but because it was a second 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.920
 family that I felt really good 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.000
 I thought because we proposed 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.410
 professionalism but in return 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.730
 I was very salty I had a job 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:42.020
 I started my little football team 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.150
 I did not have a caress day at all 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.610
 hope to say that I could be 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.860
 professional I decided to cross the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.600

 I cried almost every night 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.100
 when returning from workouts is what 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.240

 phone that made me tilt I 'm going to 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.630
 sunset and gold I woke up 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.780
 saying it's good with my leave them 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.540
 two matches that followed I found 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.489
 the path of the nets and then after I 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.620
 we see there I scored 14 goals the 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.239
 first season I do not know how many 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.500
 assists and we're done 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.030
 second of the championship that he was 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.410
 become the star of the Greek league 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.690
 I stayed three years in the United States 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.950
 in 2003 the league during the cup of 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.880
 world in the united states the league to 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.489
 the announced bankruptcy 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.959
 I took a big slap to what I 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.090
 I already imagined doing a lot of things 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.840
 there over I was riding a wave of 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:12.370
 recognition that would have allowed me to 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.370
 stay to beat and in the united states 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.430
 we won 3-0 is a manager play 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:25.430
 abducted in June had to curtain some 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.990
 boys who play and chili and that's 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.680
 a whole story is a whole 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.680
 history of 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.970
 bad luck for a player and 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.489
 luck for him since I was not 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.510
 in the list 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.830
 I was not a starter I was not in 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.840
 the list of hopes of my first 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.489
 selection and a girl got hurt 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.709
 it's done the crusaders I integrated come 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.930
 from there on I was in hopes and 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.220
 his own vat and that's why I 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.549
 known my first selection in the month of 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.620
 March 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:57.319
 finally me demers and I made a pass 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:04:01.190
 decisive this one I remember because 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.260
 that he is it is super important that 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.030
 I continue 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.860
 a cross shot that goes the guardian 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.400
 and we win 1-0 away 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.950
 and obviously we knew that if we 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.500
 managed to win in England in 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.500
 France and gave them a hard time 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.820
 this is the first time there has been so much at 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.440
 time to call together I'm doing mine 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.720
 all these people who has you full but who 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.320
 greet you this team from France 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.229
 female 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.850
 wow, sure it was his life so much 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.800
 that the whistle at the final whistle 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.380
 sounds it's wonderful I'm 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.960
 recalls pictures at the end of the match on 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.580
 is on top of each other and we are 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:45.010
 congratulate me and I throw my 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:48.220
 shoes I told myself it's nice 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.300
 because I'm going to live finally I'm going 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.169
 you in the world cup under the shirt 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.250
 tricolor with my American fans I 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.229
 spent hours signing 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.350
 autographs at the end of each match and 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:01.120
 I felt on the contrary inhabited 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.010
 of an extra force to say yeah 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.590
 I have my team from France but I have 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.960
 also this recognition there was 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.370
 a lot of American fans coming 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.710
 support the french team because 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.880
 because I flew within this one 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.560
 and it was nice it was 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.020
 and besides I did not put any 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.570
 pressure even though the first match one is 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.070
 passed through the second it took 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.169
 absolutely make a result and win 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.620
 we won a victory 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:28.139
 against korea in extremis at 1-0 on 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.200
 it's me who marks 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.650
 here 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.720
 and then we finish with super match 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.800
 brazil tied for a draw 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:44.900
 me who marks level and we leave the 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:47.710
 competition like that but but but we 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.710
 had a beautiful union 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.090
 draw 1 anywhere 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.310
 not to take a goal would win 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.600
 with a goal of gap I have not a lot of 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.820
 play time so 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.470
 so that's the first match in England 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.980
 by the way I'm on the right I get in 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.139
 even by 20 minutes half an hour to play 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.919
 return 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:11.780
 I am aligned but I have not I do not have the 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:14.419
 sew a game then the physical form that 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:18.590
 I can see what I'm taking a little 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:20.509
 sweetie so in the end I I believe the 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.870
 subject I decided in three quarter of 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.150
 second 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.979
 it's over if I stop the team 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.930
 France ends a year as my club 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:32.210
 and then and then after I pull my 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:35.360
 reverence it is a course rather 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.909
 flattering since there are 112 selections 88 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.259
 it is rather a good ratio wise two 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:40.960
 voice my colleagues and my girlfriends 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:44.300
 when we put cases well 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.430
 in the feet or services 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.530
 said well I had more than push a 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.490
 trick and even round ball after there 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.580
 also goals or to fetch 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:55.220
 myself but it's a work of equipped 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.650
 I'm really proud to have had 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:00.289
 the chance to wear this jersey of france 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.360
 102 times without being part of 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:05.300
 land and then came to have scored 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.780
 maybe the way the footprint of the 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.780
 women's football
