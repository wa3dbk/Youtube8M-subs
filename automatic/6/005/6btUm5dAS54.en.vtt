but<00:03:06.900> what<00:03:07.079> I<00:03:07.109> don't<00:03:07.500> really<00:03:07.769> prefer<00:03:07.980> from<00:03:08.459> this

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:08.669 
but what I don't really prefer from this

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.539 
but what I don't really prefer from this
is<00:03:08.849> that<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.239> takes<00:03:09.599> a<00:03:09.870> lot<00:03:10.139> of<00:03:10.169> time<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.919> to<00:03:11.400> get

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
is that it takes a lot of time to to get

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.729 
is that it takes a lot of time to to get
it<00:03:11.700> like<00:03:12.060> one<00:03:12.510> more<00:03:12.840> day<00:03:13.049> but<00:03:13.260> it's<00:03:13.379> not<00:03:13.560> very

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
it like one more day but it's not very

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.280 
it like one more day but it's not very
bad<00:03:13.980> it's<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.370> pretty<00:03:14.609> deep<00:03:14.879> so<00:03:15.540> if<00:03:15.780> we<00:03:15.959> look<00:03:15.989> at

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
bad it's a pretty deep so if we look at

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.379 
bad it's a pretty deep so if we look at
this<00:03:16.500> test<00:03:16.799> of<00:03:17.010> this<00:03:17.250> armor<00:03:17.879> it<00:03:18.090> has<00:03:19.939> so<00:03:20.939> if<00:03:21.180> we

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
this test of this armor it has so if we

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.420 
this test of this armor it has so if we
look<00:03:21.419> at<00:03:21.689> the<00:03:21.989> stats<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.409> the<00:03:22.650> armor<00:03:23.069> we<00:03:23.280> can

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
look at the stats of the armor we can

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.539 
look at the stats of the armor we can
compare<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.060> would<00:03:24.480> be<00:03:24.629> performers

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
compare it would be performers

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.940 
compare it would be performers
performers<00:03:26.549> war<00:03:27.120> gear<00:03:27.419> so<00:03:28.079> this<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.469> the<00:03:28.680> most

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
performers war gear so this is the most
