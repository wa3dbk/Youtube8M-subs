00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.550
 We appeared in the transfer so good 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.520
 tradition of talking about homemade 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.230
 I decided to brag too today 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.690
 self-made fishing rod truth honestly 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.240
 I admit that nothing new I especially 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.230
 not invented and more on manufacturing 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.960
 this model 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.769
 I was an example of Izhevsk fisherman 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.449
 Alexander 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.220
 im ermakova only modification 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.340
 Alexander found somewhere for the handles 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.250
 reel big fat cork i 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.320
 I did not find such a traffic jam and made it from 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.510
 three wine corks glued together 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.520
 just generally turned out too 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.030
 quite comfortable and maybe these 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.730
 irregularities even somehow in hand 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.800
 nice feeling yourself would say so here 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.500
 means the advantage of this model 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.040
 firstly it is very light and secondly 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.170
 it is warm to the touch even today 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.210
 quite unpleasant weather I'm quite 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:06.520
 calmly i do without mittens very 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.450
 light, respectively, very sensitive 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:14.380
 can all sorts of maneuvers and or maneuvers 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:18.520
 to perform in the mormyskoy cons of this model 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.380
 it means in the first sometimes jumps off 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.509
 fishing line so we must bear in mind that 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.990
 similar fishing pole most likely for 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.289
 shallow depths and small shallow 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.619
 fish 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.270
 another plus is what we say 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.630
 since its weight is almost zero 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.310
 like fishing rods that you can 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.200
 think how much it costs 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.080
 they are also somewhat like not at all 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.130
 weighs you can fill a full box and in 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.080
 If the hook is broken, then so on. 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.619
 bandage nothing wise on 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.599
 frost just change the bait for the bait 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.429
 if someone is interested in such 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:00.849
 model will try to make it 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:04.420
 the only warning on your 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:06.690
 your reel should already have a reel 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.720
 as little burrs as possible 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:16.530
 otherwise there will be trouble with a thin line. 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.530
 and in all other respects neither tail nor scales
