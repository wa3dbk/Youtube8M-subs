00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
and then use microSD storage for things

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.030 
and then use microSD storage for things
like<00:02:18.030> music<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.840> audio<00:02:19.050> books<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.650> movies

it works it can be glitchy the audio

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.430 
it works it can be glitchy the audio

from the microphone can go out of sync
pretty<00:03:28.680> easily<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:29.370> there's<00:03:29.640> not<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:29.940> way<00:03:30.209> to

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.089 
after you've finished the recording now
a<00:03:33.780> neat<00:03:33.959> feature<00:03:34.139> to<00:03:34.319> go<00:03:34.410> along<00:03:34.650> with<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:34.950> is

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
a neat feature to go along with that is

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.920 
a neat feature to go along with that is
if<00:03:35.310> you're<00:03:35.459> using<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.940> controller<00:03:36.359> it

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
if you're using the controller it

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.479 
if you're using the controller it
actually<00:03:37.230> uses<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.620> microphone<00:03:38.010> built<00:03:38.280> into

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
actually uses the microphone built into

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.800 
actually uses the microphone built into
the<00:03:38.700> controller<00:03:39.090> as<00:03:39.329> a<00:03:39.359> part<00:03:39.690> of<00:03:39.720> the

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
the controller as a part of the

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.379 
the controller as a part of the
recording<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.859> downside<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.549> that<00:03:41.579> is<00:03:41.970> the

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
recording the downside to that is the

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.809 
recording the downside to that is the
microphone<00:03:42.780> in<00:03:42.959> that<00:03:43.079> controller<00:03:43.530> is<00:03:43.799> kind<00:03:44.639> of

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
microphone in that controller is kind of

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.699 
microphone in that controller is kind of
terrible<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.780> one<00:03:45.900> in<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.079> tablet<00:03:46.410> sounds

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
terrible the one in the tablet sounds

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.440 
terrible the one in the tablet sounds
pretty<00:03:47.040> nice<00:03:47.280> though<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:47.760> I<00:03:48.000> wish<00:03:48.239> they

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
pretty nice though and I wish they

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.059 
pretty nice though and I wish they
provided<00:03:48.870> an<00:03:48.989> option<00:03:49.290> in<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.470> settings<00:03:49.500> to

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
provided an option in the settings to

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.009 
provided an option in the settings to
always<00:03:50.579> use<00:03:50.819> that<00:03:50.849> microphone<00:03:51.480> even<00:03:51.930> if

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
always use that microphone even if

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.120 
always use that microphone even if
you're<00:03:52.139> using<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.530> paired<00:03:52.739> controller

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
you're using the paired controller

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.129 
you're using the paired controller
normally<00:03:53.849> I<00:03:53.880> play<00:03:54.239> from<00:03:54.480> like<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:54.810> foot<00:03:55.019> and<00:03:55.109> a

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
normally I play from like a foot and a

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.509 
normally I play from like a foot and a
half<00:03:55.200> away<00:03:55.380> and<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.739> sounds<00:03:56.069> good<00:03:56.250> from<00:03:56.489> that

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
half away and it sounds good from that

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.280 
half away and it sounds good from that
distance<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.239> worked<00:03:57.540> around<00:03:57.660> this<00:03:57.900> by<00:03:58.049> just

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
distance I worked around this by just

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.500 
distance I worked around this by just
picking<00:03:58.530> up<00:03:58.799> a<00:03:58.980> halfway-decent<00:03:59.400> headset<00:04:00.329> with

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
picking up a halfway-decent headset with

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.940 
picking up a halfway-decent headset with
the<00:04:00.630> microphone<00:04:01.049> in<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.230> that'll<00:04:01.590> wrap<00:04:01.739> things

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
the microphone in it that'll wrap things

the microphone in it that'll wrap things
up<00:04:02.069> let's<00:04:02.280> talk<00:04:02.489> about<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.880> accessories<00:04:03.419> a

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
up let's talk about the accessories a

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.360 
up let's talk about the accessories a
little<00:04:03.599> bit<00:04:03.870> more<00:04:04.109> for<00:04:04.410> just<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:04.620> minute<00:04:04.769> the

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
little bit more for just a minute the

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.920 
little bit more for just a minute the
controller<00:04:05.700> just<00:04:06.150> like<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.389> one<00:04:06.510> built<00:04:06.750> into

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
controller just like the one built into

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.720 
controller just like the one built into
the<00:04:07.019> original<00:04:07.169> shield<00:04:07.590> has<00:04:07.859> been<00:04:08.190> excellent

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
the original shield has been excellent

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.879 
the original shield has been excellent
for<00:04:08.910> me<00:04:09.180> very<00:04:09.810> comfortable<00:04:10.290> in<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.440> hand<00:04:10.590> and

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
for me very comfortable in the hand and

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.129 
for me very comfortable in the hand and
the<00:04:10.980> battery<00:04:11.250> life<00:04:11.459> seems<00:04:11.790> amazing<00:04:12.480> when<00:04:13.049> you

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
the battery life seems amazing when you

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.479 
the battery life seems amazing when you
look<00:04:13.319> at<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.530> notification<00:04:14.129> tray<00:04:14.250> on<00:04:14.400> the

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
look at the notification tray on the

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.190 
look at the notification tray on the
tablet<00:04:14.849> you<00:04:15.030> can<00:04:15.180> see<00:04:15.359> where<00:04:15.690> it's<00:04:15.840> paired<00:04:16.079> to

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
tablet you can see where it's paired to

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.750 
tablet you can see where it's paired to
a<00:04:16.229> controller<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:16.919> you<00:04:17.099> can<00:04:17.220> even<00:04:17.340> see<00:04:17.609> the

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
a controller and you can even see the

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.159 
a controller and you can even see the
controller's<00:04:18.180> current<00:04:18.570> battery<00:04:18.720> level<00:04:18.840> in

controller's current battery level in
there<00:04:19.349> I've<00:04:19.859> been<00:04:20.160> using<00:04:20.340> it<00:04:20.579> off<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:21.060> on<00:04:21.150> for

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
there I've been using it off and on for

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.000 
there I've been using it off and on for
a<00:04:21.359> few<00:04:21.539> weeks<00:04:21.660> now<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:21.930> I<00:04:22.229> still<00:04:22.500> haven't<00:04:22.889> had

a few weeks now and I still haven't had

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.740 
a few weeks now and I still haven't had
to<00:04:23.220> charge<00:04:23.490> it<00:04:23.669> still<00:04:24.000> going<00:04:24.270> strong

according<00:04:25.590> to<00:04:25.620> Nvidia<00:04:25.979> you<00:04:26.190> can<00:04:26.310> even<00:04:26.460> pair<00:04:26.729> up

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
according to Nvidia you can even pair up

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.490 
according to Nvidia you can even pair up
to<00:04:27.090> four<00:04:27.419> different<00:04:27.630> shield<00:04:27.990> controllers
