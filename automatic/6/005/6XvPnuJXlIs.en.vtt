what<00:02:21.950> happened<00:02:21.980> last<00:02:22.400> round<00:02:22.790> Cody's<00:02:23.720> ultra<00:02:24.080> is

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
what happened last round Cody's ultra is

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.960 
what happened last round Cody's ultra is
very<00:02:24.320> fast<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.709> that<00:02:24.830> overhead<00:02:25.310> reaches<00:02:25.700> so

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
very fast and that overhead reaches so

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.230 
very fast and that overhead reaches so
far<00:02:26.620> that's<00:02:27.620> about<00:02:27.860> some<00:02:28.100> limb<00:02:28.310> yeah<00:02:31.240> little

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
far that's about some limb yeah little

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.090 
far that's about some limb yeah little
known<00:02:32.390> fact<00:02:32.420> Cody<00:02:33.110> actually<00:02:33.650> had<00:02:33.890> that

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
known fact Cody actually had that

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.930 
known fact Cody actually had that
overhead<00:02:34.580> attack<00:02:34.940> I<00:02:35.120> believe<00:02:35.480> in<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:37.459> Alpha

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
overhead attack I believe in the Alpha

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.720 
overhead attack I believe in the Alpha
anthology<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:39.050> you<00:02:39.800> needed<00:02:40.070> one<00:02:40.430> mode<00:02:40.700> of

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
anthology that you needed one mode of

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.730 
anthology that you needed one mode of
cook<00:02:41.120> like<00:02:41.330> one<00:02:41.600> mode<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:41.900> Cody<00:02:42.320> in<00:02:42.530> that

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
cook like one mode of Cody in that

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.830 
cook like one mode of Cody in that
anthology<00:02:43.490> mode<00:02:43.700> actually<00:02:44.510> had<00:02:44.690> that

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
anthology mode actually had that

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.750 
anthology mode actually had that
overhead<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:45.770> think<00:02:45.950> he<00:02:46.040> added<00:02:46.310> in<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.400> PSP

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
overhead and I think he added in the PSP

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.630 
overhead and I think he added in the PSP
version<00:02:47.390> as<00:02:47.540> well<00:02:47.570> a<00:02:48.080> lot<00:02:48.860> of<00:02:48.890> people<00:02:49.010> in<00:02:49.310> super

I<00:03:33.240> don't<00:03:34.240> want<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:34.450> fast<00:03:34.660> overhead<00:03:35.110> like<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.500> use

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
I don't want to fast overhead like I use

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.280
