00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 yes she finds she gets to the reform of 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.490
 peace cup endorsement 90 I almost even 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.200
 do not even realize that at all 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.059
 a chapter has come out because of it 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.519
 actually is not as standard 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.639
 that it appears on Wednesday and one 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.500
 thing today exactly 18 years ago the rock 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.340
 is the first time a possible already in 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.320
 the machine 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.390
 that's really awesome and so on 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.519
 now 18 years of age, so to speak 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.080
 that's exactly what he appeared on his kombis 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.990
 is it crazy how long is that 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.609
 I have been following since rc2 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.869
 broadcast he said exactly first consequence 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.059
 I know that I'm with her buddy 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.649
 has looked and since then read optimal 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.600
 and whatever else you can all in 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.250
 the comments write since when should 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.899
 the band let it be you look at it 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.040
 let the wall do not care I'll be soon 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.780
 If I would like that would rise to me 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.600
 Now the question of the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.129
 region his question of these consequences come 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.020
 the chapter first the campaign 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.670
 this time is really interesting cage 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.620
 yes not often the case but we have 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.879
 but a flamingo of a pretty 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.010
 certain face does with his 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.289
 facebook and his glasses to flaminio 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.359
 given the player controlled 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.160
 dolls and these dolls are the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.379
 main actor of the wizard of 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.560
 Wehrendorf the tin man and heart the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.330
 cowardly lions and the scarecrow without 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.369
 understood and we know balls me 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.900
 once mentioned the emerald city and 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.240
 since then the theory is that somewhere 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.640
 times as a server from the east will give 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.340
 what is easy now by this cajun 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.890
 is reinforced because you can do everything in the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.150
 ps1 small in the back 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.640
 I do not know German words but 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.530
 no matter as a toddler and it can always 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.509
 really important and in the future 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.680
 So I'm looking forward to everything 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.740
 in connection with too, especially since we 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.770
 In this chapter I wish people 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.450
 have been that for a long time already 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.820
 bellamy comes into the crew and who have 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.890
 We also live there in the Schuppen Berlin 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.530
 People if you do not feel like me 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.840
 was pleased that bellamy camp came almost 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.430
 Turn it out because it's on again 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.659
 Pieces closer in the direction of me goes 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.610
 I wish that and that bellamy 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.460
 come true I hope so much 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.090
 never that's just there to the stroth 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.970
 train stop samu berliner offices and monument 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.049
 saarburg asks to go 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.450
 I think I do not join the 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.100
 stay daughter and then we still have 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.500
 bellamy there as an addition to the straw hat 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.959
 bande curious how it goes and I 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.730
 just kienemann and kangoo and such are 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.830
 because they have to travel with them 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.870
 are likely to be yourself 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.790
 to drive like that which is funny 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.300
 because the son he is the Spaniard 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.100
 but had to Bellamy is just real 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.630
 a little bit more in the direction 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.060
 maybe the battle went with me 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.430
 actually I would have had with life 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.630
 he has wanted this for so long 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.890
 and many are saying a lot to me now 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.750
 weak people now honestly 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.750
 he is totally in midfield the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.640
 he always said weak for the straw hats 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.110
 new picture yes what is then the half of 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.820
 stroth band now honestly so 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.500
 bellamy is not too weak for that 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.519
 but straw hats to the character to be 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.200
 it obviously did not go the whole 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.519
 chapter finally got it 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.810
 turned I did not expect that 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.760
 we have such a cafÃ© that still get 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.650
 just before the apple stores so comes the 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.090
 That's exactly what we all have 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.230
 still want to show then in the app 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.459
 store on the eye have a small 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.860
 description of this episode already 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.870
 get the official description is 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.670
 time that we flashbacks again 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.070
 get from the children's so 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.190
 from rafi sybase and that we are the way 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.500
 see it until it grows pink is going to be there 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.470
 gone to drosa since the child has been 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.880
 which was completed by the graduation 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.519
 and that was now in this chapter 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.989
 very compressed what showed me 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.700
 Little wondered and I have mine 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.590
 Last week I said so I want 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.630
 dragon verso the most glaring thing now 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.730
 I somehow in a form 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.079
 get though as flash back diaz but 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.239
 we really see everything now 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.340
 happened and was shot down 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.260
 and one thing got me right dragon 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.670
 got him out of the water 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.880
 But how could there towards where he stood 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.530
 or he is hovering over it 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.650
 What is it like? 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:53.070
 I would like to have a widescreen picture 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.109
 seen an environmental image as urgent 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.350
 right there now if you are 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.440
 But he sees only recovered water 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.030
 where does get right up to how did he get there? 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.380
 Ship was not going to be there and 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.490
 Of course , as always, everything goes into it 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.040
 direction that can somehow fly 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.200
 because he has an air or a weather 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.400
 control or something has and I want 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.920
 finally see he sums ever 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.070
 on it has and his look people this 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.920
 look has done everything well for me yes 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.910
 to have that look of dragon where 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.830
 fished out and probably in 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.570
 direction of the pace has looked this 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.060
 look where behind the veins here so 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.860
 go up and everything is natural that everything 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.450
 in a detailed inform what we 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.520
 Everything already got said then 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.290
 is he as a revolution then passed away 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.610
 At some point on his way, he has 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.860
 ace hit and it has him on 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.960
 Restrict some memories 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.480
 brought and then AIDS died 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.980
 it all came back and reminded 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.180
 remember everything happy 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.460
 Anna Fischer remembers AIDS and 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.190
 then, of course, it is disengaged as he 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.320
 died because to know at once 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.480
 who this person is, it really makes me feel 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.100
 bad before you get him just before 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.870
 still form the but says that it is in 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.690
 this chapter is a shitty one 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.330
 time the 110 degrees it meets 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.830
 after exactly that happens because it seems 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.280
 there has not been much time between 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.020
 his 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.270
 Of course, then two years go by 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.650
 gone the water and met dettily 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.120
 had the conversation with him and indeed 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.010
 funny robbies reaction again 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.300
 to see a different view of the 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.290
 Storm then wanders a bible 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.550
 cards says if likely 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.530
 still see someday again and 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.120
 this situation as well as zorro says yes 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.900
 That's what he said to us back then 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.310
 something like that 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.470
 I thought so what 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.880
 strange situation was that now 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.410
 hopefully it is not going to happen 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.030
 we just hope we get that again 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.080
 Best but I'm really curious how it 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.210
 We are now going on 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.460
 probably see nothing for a long time 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.990
 for that media docks us one more 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.660
 bit back probably as a small one 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.150
 say goodbye I once gives and then yes 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.440
 probably for a few years 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.940
 again a little bit of the character 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.120
 goodbye at viva save money 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.860
 save at once yes elsbeth picture 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.390
 fought or in a sexual context 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.960
 recognizes when you blackbeard him and becomes 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.250
 captured 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.560
 that was what we at one time thought 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.980
 next from fhb and savo flies 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.750
 flock of fish from crowing what 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.280
 so weird why where did not come up again 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.750
 once here and now honest i think 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.260
 that the front crow 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:08.500
 a person was i do not ask me yes 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.360
 but it was for me so sarow asks 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.400
 you can always bring them out then 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.870
 when you want and for me it was 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.520
 Speech bubbles like so much before 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.380
 front kreeb places it that way 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.210
 acts as if the crisis answers and says 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.620
 yes I can and it was a cabin 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.760
 quite a bridge to what 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.590
 will happen soon and I'm curious 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.720
 making him the next chapter what here 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.880
 after the break so in two weeks 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.310
 everyone will wake up the 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.320
 Sleep are probably times to look 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.700
 as well as soaps reaction he had to 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.040
 sometimes realize what he there 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.620
 actually everything has spent pink 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.350
 wanted or unintentionally java it is already 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.330
 our focus has been pretty much on 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.980
 the first half of troy and it may 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.180
 do not forget of course you forget 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.860
 is after all that's all now 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.750
 happened then still has me bellamy 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.890
 in the second half of course, too 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.020
 wakes up and I'm curious like him 

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.430
 would react if at all 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.550
 bellamy and the two together and 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.680
 say come in my body and then 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.540
 That 's it from the event 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.830
 Can you give your thumbs up and 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.460
 also likes to look at the teamspeak 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.110
 past 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.550
 ddp can be found below in the description 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.990
 I'm on it too we can 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.970
 the people talk to me and with the 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.080
 people talk there and become natural 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.820
 the next few days then again 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.930
 podcast added to this chapter since 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.970
 you probably complete again 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.920
 thought other than I have always 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.750
 very cool then in small heap 45 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.490
 Just go over this chapter 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.190
 discuss and one more thing and that 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.960
 I have a stark airy figure 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.910
 I can not afford the war 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.430
 not really on the picture on it a pvp 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.540
 and that is really high quality 

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.010
 the highest quality figure I in 

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.860
 I'll have them for my collection 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:37.240
 Unpack and ask a question to you and indeed 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.350
 we can do such unboxing 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.710
 like to write the comments 

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:44.020
 just hashtag unboxing because yes you 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.300
 is just crass the figures has 

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.660
 Generally merchandise of anime and 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.860
 manga I am 

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.720
 and pretty much the nerd when it comes to this 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.610
 What people's background is synonymous 

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.980
 not forgive no not at all 

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:58.230
 You know that I cost real brands 

00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.210
 And you do not want to win java 

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.640
 comments and that's it then 

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:06.350
 really i am everything and here 

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.350
