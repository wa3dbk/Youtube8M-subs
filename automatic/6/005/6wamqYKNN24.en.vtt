00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hi all guys i'm never that 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.210
 today we are here on chip italy for 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.340
 speak a little bit of the 0.11 zero point 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.400
 and when it could come out then 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.460
 let's start with talking that 0.11 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.609
 the first build came out at around one 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.990
 a month and a half ago, so it's been a long time 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.869
 that we are in this phase we say of 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.859
 updating and therefore most likely 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.390
 soon the official version will be released 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.250
 furthermore we arrived up to 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.769
 build version 13 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.510
 and indeed it was is one of them that not 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.000
 we have never reached with these bild 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.120
 because we had all the beers of 0.8 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.760
 0.90 public serious maximum night if not 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.980
 mistake to the number 10 13 really says 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.680
 very high and therefore it is thought that 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.340
 maybe around the beginning of June 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.629
 have the official 0.11 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.690
 summarizing a little what they have 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.850
 added and therefore what is confirmed 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.399
 completely we can immediately see how 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.489
 added language change 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.049
 added a new seen 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.950
 of the sharpening of the worlds have 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:11.369
 added new fashions like iman but cube e 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.820
 iran of caves and also gas 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.479
 however it was still of hidden quality 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.360
 they added let's say the skins 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.970
 built suitcase in the settings 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.710
 game presets added 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.990
 english skins also the option to be able to 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.420
 put the skins from others that 4 pixels 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.590
 of arms added to 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.360
 lapresse dirt villages which is a block 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.150
 exclusive both for lamonic mockridge and 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.670
 one for now added boats 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.439
 very important especially thanks to 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.420
 arrived a little bit older 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.729
 finished demons that with these boats yes 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.799
 the sea will be able to pass much more 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.500
 simply instead of swimming as you do 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.630
 did before they added together to 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.610
 so to this boat also the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.460
 possibility of fishing therefore have 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.229
 filled the sea also with script that was 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.909
 what made it a little bit empty 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.860
 these let's say these bodies of water 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.409
 which were really very flat without 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.929
 these little additions have said 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.390
 also also with a very important i 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.560
 effects of the potions added to 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.950
 example 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.420
 put many effects for commands to 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.550
 example of server or with various fashions 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.630
 but even some groom would say game like 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.430
 when you could eat meat of 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.230
 chicken or you get hit by a 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.230
 spider from caverni then we will challenge immediately 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.569
 our effect added that 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.560
 also in the latest solution versions 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.840
 in xi nabil 11 in build 13 to a 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.430
 inventory wizard to have various 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.950
 instruments and thus have a 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.500
 complete inventory of all this 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.900
 could have survival even in 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.480
 creative then with these two things that 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.819
 reached gradually during the builds is 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.560
 arrived up to one 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.750
 size of an update then 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.420
 almost official and so we hope that 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.280
 be released very soon and that 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.220
 maybe be added that maybe some 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.530
 something else exclusive like I don't know maybe 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.480
 hopefully still in a small or by 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.019
 some changes, but unfortunately 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.360
 been very complaining about colors then 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.390
 nothing i leave you conquered question on 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.760
 when it comes out in my opinion very soon 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.160
 left a nice comment on what you think 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.140
 certain well-secular prince channel 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.950
 italy to mine and you see this video 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.950
