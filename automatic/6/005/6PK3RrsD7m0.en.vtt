00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.989

 island channel of very very good 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.770
 guardians of the island that was boosted the 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.230
 last week week its biggest 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.570

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.640

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.219
 lucas worthy it was either it's bedimo 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.690
 I preferred to take him in defense 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.870
 central decline it's simple thiago 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.320
 silva and nkoulou the two pillars we go 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.220

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.689
 hinge a right defender aurier his 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.520
 snow break at the expense of fanny saw 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.290

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.450
 rarely very good left striker 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.820
 middle left rather because so 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.110
