00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.080
 new video tutorial where I will need 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.419
 showing this mode that is called see if 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.970
 facebook when its function in this way 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:24.970
 is to show us all the crafting that 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.199
 has the minecraft so far 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:33.080
 as much as minecraft or as for also 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:36.019
 this the amounts that we install that 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.560
 have some crafting then it is not 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:41.070
 we need 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.190
 and go to a wiki page for Internet 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.400
 in this mode what he does is 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.280
 show us the whole minecraft wiki 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.360
 both minecraft and also some 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.010
 Ok ways that have crafting good how 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.220
 works this mod simply 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.580
 we select obviously in this case it's 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.610
 a book we're going to right click and it 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.380
 is going to open this list ok we are going to 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.320
 open this list that teaches us all 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.410
 the crafting ok this is page 1 in 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.940
 this case has 31 if we install mods 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:21.270
 is going to add to this library and it's not going 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.970
 to be 31 is going to be 32 or more ok then 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.210
 to change the page we just go 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.430
 to give we are going to use the wheel of our 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.640
 mouse ok 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.670
 and we just go through and we want to 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.830
 use for example make an armor of 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.350
 diamond we look for in this case 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:46.080
 here is ok and just this one we 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.820
 shows how it's done ok ok here is 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.820
 the pants how it is done 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.369
 how boots are made and all that 

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:58.659
 the helmet and the boots because here is here 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.710
 is all the crafting key 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:05.229
 and to exit we simply press the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.990
 key they have by default when accessing 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.730
 his rafting in this case is the and 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.110
 but there are some people that is the 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:19.120
 good ok key as it is treated to 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.840
 only we need is this 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.610
 it's squid ink 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.610
 what we need squid ink 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.760
 I think if it's ink squid ink 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.920
 squid 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.220
 one squid ink and one book

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.620
 either you can create this 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.440
 book on your crafter table or in the 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.940
 inventory that have by default or that 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.420

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.180
 inventory because we access and good 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.650

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.000
