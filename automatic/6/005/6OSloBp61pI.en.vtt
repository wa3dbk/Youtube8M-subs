00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.119
 Last time is 

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:43.159

 only now when I am very happy 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.469

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:33.529
 I will never take it 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:35.739

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:15.599
 Hopefully the game follows with a defiant looking for others to suspect 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.709
 Munich did not approve 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:27.080
