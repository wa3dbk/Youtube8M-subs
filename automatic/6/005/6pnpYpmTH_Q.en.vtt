00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.170
 the service people and welcome 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.480
 And yes, I do not know exactly what I mean 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.680
 the last time said how 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.029
 actually in every row where I do not 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.619
 know more what you 've said now 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:29.140
 but well I wanted something for you today 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:33.430
 nice show and i think it knows 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:38.260
 her not yet three thick stage 6 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:41.680
 rocket launcher then a new village what 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.420
 it was trimmed on resource conservation 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.219
 ask yourself bright values â€‹â€‹that has yet 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:53.170
 No money why do you do that? 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:57.370
 Legendary creatures are on the way up 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.940
 Stage six to go because here's the little one 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.770
 here 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.119
 he will soon look really fat and 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.670
 then we can look around the other maria 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.800
 towers, but we have so many 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:14.770
 written in the comments 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:17.619
 I should look here that's exactly the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:24.310
 rocket launcher are up and then the 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:25.390
 maria towers and then the tesla and 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.240
 maybe a bit more besides 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.929
 the air defense because this is yes 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.800
 comparatively cheap and right here 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:39.099
 I'm already on a tesla 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:43.539
 yes and then come the cannons and 

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:46.030
 the archer towers and though 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:49.360
 I thought it was so weird city hall 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.440
 I do not know that has changed now 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.710
 funny when I say we will 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.620
 relatively soon go to city hall 9 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.200
 but if so, that's no more 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.790
 so much so clear the walls I do 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.270
 I have to go and work in the lab 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:10.009
 finally put in the stuff so that 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:13.520
 Here's something ahead comes as I know 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:18.080
 of course on bubis 5 is doing relatively well 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.300
 right now, yes, that's just us 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.700
 the village the defense village I have 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.709
 someone from precious clan pictures again 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:31.239
 looked at now we go straight 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:38.600
 when we ship so much of this 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:41.570
 Let's move the gold 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.570
 to the outside and the elixir one 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.650
 a little bit in the middle 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.670
 that is the way we can now 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.920
 let's save on that a little elixir 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.630
 what I call the next time instructor is 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.900
 probably be a collector again 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.560
 there are still a few left over 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.840
 maybe I should have two more 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.760
 make attacks which also do 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.430
 but that should be a relatively short consequence 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.100
 because I just wanted to say it 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.930
 here varies clock and yes it was me 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.000
 I now have more than I license 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.440
 I learned it at the age of nine 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.830
 fault points would have stood well 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.180
 can be better but well plus me 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.150
 Yesterday I drove so blatantly 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.000
 all day on mobile phone and theory 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.470
 learned that he had failed there 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.510
 i dont search that for them 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.549
 caught but also clicked next to it 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.440
 but yes I have so mainly 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.530
 nothing spectacular as they always are 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.260
 say you have to find inactive opponents 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.340
 you can pretty much do with the clouds 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.340
 expect a lot and you already have 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.380
 200,000 gold was now actually 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.580
 not worth talking about 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.900
 only a thick but defense 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.910
 that was my problem yesterday 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:56.120
 evening 25 million I'm not a construction worker 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:59.230
 redding the parts are brimming and then 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.470
 he comes to a fold leaves here 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.470
 maria tour 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.320
 the used parsberg 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.050
 and here they let these glare and 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:16.780
 then hold on 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.139
 next kobold witches archer 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.009
 has on 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:23.379
 you do not have much and the sex there 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.689
 proven 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:28.810
 they are not bad and of that he has 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:31.849
 yes, a few really hewn out 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:36.499
 So it did not work out 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:38.779
 I believe in time but yes the the 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:39.889
 opponent was not bad he got me 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:40.999
 a little bit scratched so much money 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.800
 that's why I have 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:44.689
 even now I wanted to start 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.219
 but in the end I start 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.990
 was just on the way and have 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:49.460
 If I think about it again 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.469
 three quarters of an hour 300,000 gold 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.150
 get ripped off that's not me 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:55.340
 worth and there I just expand 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.439
 clicked and now but that five days 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.500
 and a few higher measured correctly 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:03.259
 thick minerva and yes that was it 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.759
 actually already from this consequence 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.870
 will be glad if we at the 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.270
 See you again next time write me 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.860
 still happen because then do everything 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.719
 before you go to city â€‹â€‹hall 9 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.469
 I really want to know too much 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:16.550
 but yes, yes, the miner wall think 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:18.370
 I'm not the worst of the magic of 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.120
 Towers are the worst 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.979
 that's about it soon 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.699
 So yes, no idea writes it in me 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.270
 the comments 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:30.580
 What else needs to be done? 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.080
 and then I would be happy if you 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.180
 leave me a positive rating there 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.010
 if you liked it of course only 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.690
 otherwise we'll just see you 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.830
 xth hopefully again 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.830
 bye bye
