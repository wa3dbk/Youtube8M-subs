00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.400
 and yes so this weekend it was 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.140
 spotlight on the u17 1 who were playing 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.420
 their second league match 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.950
 desert against the montrouge team the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.860
 first game I was a defeat on the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.450
 trap land two goals then the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.109
 greens count well in the game 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.310
 very slowly they take the ascendancy 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.199
 first action at 6th minute a center 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.010
 input and typing 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.250
 unfortunately a little too much talk despite 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.460
 all the 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.510
 the match is open and the little iq hand 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.150
 just in front of the penalty area 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.620
 the referee does not whistle a two and 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.780
 this is montrouge's first opportunity 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.790
 but stopped by the defender who 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.580
 deviates for a corner 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.720
 he goes on to the ninth minute with the 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.330
 real nice opportunity of montrouge 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.300
 yes it starts on the left side of the field 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:55.059
 wing change a 2 3 1 that I bat 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.210
 1 2 the third face to face in front of the 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.040
 guardian the red the blue who wins his 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.399
 duel and that's the opening score for 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.050
 So show a beautiful action 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.780
 which ended well unfortunately 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.220
 for saint brice we make good and fair 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.130
 a little bit of feet protruding 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.670
 that it is enough for the keeper to lose 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.810
 his duel against move 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.220
 yet it shines it does not drop 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.950
 arm and that's to play the first 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.700
 well-timed shot by the 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.350
 guardian monge and the defensive clr who 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.509
 expensive 1 ball lost but ground 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.340
 the captain of montrouge makes a red 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.670
 solo star crosses his strike well 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.189
 and double the bet so it's a little 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.570
 rough for saint brisson because two 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.250
 two real scoring opportunities for 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.619
 montrouge success is total and we 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.000
 see this lost ball 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.020
 a good ball starts from my fields but 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.479
 That's it, it makes it fly to difficult 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.200
 for young players the young people of 17 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.670
 and at that moment of the match we feel that 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.820
 still saint-brice has the morale in 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.820
 socks 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.600
 and that's where this montrouge and 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.580
 enjoy and more in the game there so we 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.890
 can see slow motion a little dribble 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.399
 small wheels from 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.830
 montrouge south tries to act as well 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.170
 that badly but the attacks are gone 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.740
 on the contrary, the greens are exposed 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.690
 at cons 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.550
 a bit like this one the third minute 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.830
 really here are the dribbles are successful 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.280
 from montrouge 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.140
 fortunately defense and valiant and 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.870
 this action will not end with 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:38.060
 a strike then in this debacle 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.160
 an opening an opening that was 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.360
 apparently without much danger is there there 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.860
 there is a small disagreement between the 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.620
 goalkeeper and the defender who falls back 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.810
 on the chest of yanis belhadi who is 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.380
 ask no question and very beautiful 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.080
 equalization 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.960
 so we see a technical sequence 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.240
 perfect 1 of high class this is the 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.070
 chest control chained to the 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.700
 volleyball the balloon does not have the 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.580
 time to bounce 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.870
 a control a hit and especially the 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.670
 which is well framed that is well 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.010
 dosed and that's the goal that stimulates 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.770
 saint-brice who is they were bad 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.200
 until then and yet 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.120
 good I have not left out and continue to 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.129
 attack in goals two in contention 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.220
 that's the stage defense that's struggling to get 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.769
 clear the ball is recovered his total 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.680
 and a striking blue and it takes very 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.680
 beautiful parade of the gan saint-brice whose 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.000
 aggravated soap score at half time 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.590
 so we go into the second half 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.540
 coach hank's speech to duras had to 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.680
 have its effect because saint brice and 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.170
 much better in the game 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.489
 so here we see a corner and again a 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.989
 misses unfortunately not framed 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.370
 the match is more balanced more open 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.440
 there are opportunities on both sides 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.840
 weary around montrouge with a 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.569
 first strike, followed by a 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.700
 second passing next to the window 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.370
 and here is the free kick that will take 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.060
 to the goal strikes the run on city that is 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.769
 countered and anthony ferreira repent a 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.359
 like a fox of surfaces that money 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.620
 to be able to see in slow motion because we can 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.629
 to ask the question was there offside 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.549
 or not and no berlanty shows that no 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.810
 so we see the striking a stop on 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.340
 images one can look at by taking the 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.880
 line surface of the 16 meters we see 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.620
 that a defender who who cover and and 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.160
 anthony tp was gone before her 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.919
 defender 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.889
 these two meters of advanced allowed to 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.289
 make the difference and the momentum of 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.759
 minutes later it's 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.180
 win what's jostled in on 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.499
 federate not spend much of 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.149
 flagrant there is a stroller 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:40.580
 so it deserves it still deserves a 

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:42.889
 penalty although that's it's generous 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.559
 overall on the aboubacar penalty 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:49.009
 fofana does not pray and it is on 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:50.689
 a nice skylight that Hilton giving 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:55.490
 the advantage without risking the prima 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:58.430
 part in the 67th minute and so we can 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.830
 see this penalty that was shot side 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.249
 left is really in him canes in 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.330
 force 1 needed to have 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:08.899
 the confidence of conviction 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.099
 so obviously the one made of match without 

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:11.779
 besson tends to go back 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.270
 demuru I will do everything to equalize 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:16.909
 and montrouge is really going to be dangerous 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.209
 so it starts on a corner the ball 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:22.069
 goes by little but especially a 

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:24.409
 the occasion of the matisse and the 84th 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:28.069
 minute or a precious blue effective 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:30.830
 ball recovery a little dribble 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:33.229
 that works and especially the openness and 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.360
 the face to face really yes like that 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.699
 it's easy and then defenders with 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.689
 just the guardian and thankfully for 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.169
 saint brice and unfortunately for 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:42.259
 montrouge 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.789
 the striker did not frame his ball and 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.789
 know that the equalizer ball was 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:48.709
 really very very close where she comes in 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:51.309
 in stoppage time so that's the goal 

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:54.319
 it's really about poplar 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:56.029
 3000 three minutes of stopping play and 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:06:01.939
 laure gobin here is the defense of services 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:04.580
 and that prevents the game drawn so here so 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:07.069
 the end of the match victory of saint-brice 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.229
 on the score and peak of 3 goals to 2 and one 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:13.159
 will see the reaction of the players and 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:14.749
 coaches right away did not believe 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:23.119
 too much because we took two goals 

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:32.209
 defensive fouls of 

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:35.119
 the opponent and the match was correct 

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:37.819
 two teams that have a level of play 

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:40.999
 pretty much similar so we had each 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:43.219
 our half time it led 2-0 and then a 

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:45.680
 little moment of deconcentration on the 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:47.659
 end of the half time that allows for 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.959
 revive the team of Saint Brice I 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:52.939
 nothing wrong with a big fat I 

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:54.709
 satisfied in the whole we do 

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:56.689
 some defensive mistakes but at 

00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:59.559
 level of the game we answered present and 

00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:01.879
 then at the level of the occasions a mount 

00:06:59.559 --> 00:07:03.559
 some opportunities at the bottom 

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:07.069
 i thank saint-brice for its welcome 

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:09.499
 and then and then saint brice bravo for 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:11.449
 their victory and then good luck 

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:14.589
 and we will welcome them from the same register 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:14.589
 on the photo mode
