00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
the first message I got for this was

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.670 
the first message I got for this was
well<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.220> am<00:00:26.519> intimidated<00:00:27.000> by<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.869> last<00:00:28.289> year's

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680
