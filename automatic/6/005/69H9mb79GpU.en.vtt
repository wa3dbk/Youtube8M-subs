00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.400
 Hello, this is Santiago drops of without 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:10.200
 birds our company representative of 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.589
 bergara bergara is a company 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.539
 North American that produces 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:19.929
 electronic scarecrows and 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.810
 Well maybe you wonder what is the 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:27.070
 application of this product I'm here 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:32.520
 to show you some plums that has 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:35.640
 gone great damage are heard calenders 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.130
 and the parrots attacking the fruit is 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.950
 mature at this time that the fruit is 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.260
 mature in which the moment of the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.840
 next harvest when 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.750
 to collect the work of a whole year is that 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:56.520
 flocks of birds pounce on 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.940
 the plantation and ruin the fruit the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.280
 they eat the pike, they throw it on the floor or 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.610
 they leave directly at the mercy of the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.500
 insects at the mercy of adversity 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.900
 of the weather 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.770
 this tree that now has a few 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:18.119
 plums two days ago was full 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.440
 it was full it was a red ball and now 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.720
 those plums the most is on the floor 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:29.369
 a few have remained in the plant 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.760
 many of them already shot like this 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.690
 for example 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:40.580
 and subsequently attacked 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:46.360
 by insects then full of wasps 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.360
 the floor is full of ants 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:58.290
 all the leaves are dotted 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:58.290
 look at the leaves dotted with plums 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:05.680
 in short a disaster what a disaster 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:09.160
 have made this producer really going to 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.770
 have a very bad season and this 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.520
 phenomenon maybe in other years it had been 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.920
 less 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:21.070
 go to know why if the lack of 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:25.510
 foods in boundary fields or what is 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.640
 the factor that made thousands of birds 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.220
 pounce on your crop and you will 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.610
 will ruin but the good news is that 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.530
 this can be avoided with a 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.170
 electronic scarecrow 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.260
 I'll see that now I'm going to show you this 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.810
 It is the smallest model 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.650
 this is the bergara but it has a cap 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.560
 to cover the controls works with 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.060
 12 volts can be plugged into a 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.060
 battery this battery can be 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:59.180
 powered by a solar panel or 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.969
 simply be recharged every 34 days 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.300
 and if not you can also plug in a 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:08.120
 transformer directly to the network 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.799
 lighting here 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.720
 start emitting the sounds are sounds 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:18.840
 I'm going to lower it a little bit in this case 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.910
 they are electronic sounds are mixed 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:26.310
 here also digitally created sounds 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.290
 and here we start with the sounds of birds 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.510
 raptors in this case you will listen 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.840
 many sounds of birds of prey but 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.629
 It is convenient to place there, there is another convenient 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.840
 place one at a time and vary the 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.910
 once a week for example a 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.160
 week one eagle sets another 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.060
 week gets an owl another week it 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.760
 puts a hawk and it is changing from that 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.810
 way in this case it has sounds 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:58.110
 coming from recordings of 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.870
 South America Vergara works in all the 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.510
 world and without birds an argentine company 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.379
 has jointly developed to compare 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.989
 all the sounds of South American birds 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.930
 of raptors and also the call of 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.450
 help of the same species here 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.299
 reboots has cycles in that 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.489
 the silences vary the order of 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.130
 the sounds too and in this way the 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:27.050
 birds do not get used to 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:30.560
 it is really a very valuable tool 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.690
 for anyone who has a harvest 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.640
 mainly of fine fruit the more 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.760
 high is the sales value of course 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.010
 More important it will be a level 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.440
 economic damage to the plantation and 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.830
 more expense or investment is justified 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:50.910
 in one of these products of course 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.640
 that there is this can be used not for not 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.520
 only for agriculture but I'm also going to 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.770
 lower a bit more for mining to 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.530
 industry or any place where the 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.380
 birds have become plague this 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.330
 is the smallest equipment covers 60 meters 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.480
 wide by 100 meters deep 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.240
 are 6,000 square meters that are 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.700
 protected by the sound of these 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.060
 recordings there are also teams that 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:21.990
 they have 24 and up 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:25.910
 16 speakers the largest covers two 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:30.060
 acres listen listen to the parrots 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:33.419
 listen to the parrots this is not 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.080
 there we put some sounds to him 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.080
 repair them 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.060
 if there are they flew but 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.300
 this work has to be done and it went down 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.789
 the volume again must be done 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.289
 before the fruit turns red 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:56.210
 because now even if the team is 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:58.970
 already approved and approved and is more 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.409
 difficult to eradicate it will know when the 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.710
 fruit is still green that is not yet 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:05.750
 they approved we scare them they go to another 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.759
 zone another batch and feed in another 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.220
 place the pressure is much lower for 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:14.569
 more information about the equipment truth 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:19.479
