00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.570
 good evening friends fishermen today i 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.150
 I want to share so little 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.890
 cunning that I learned Dnieper 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.340
 fishermen they 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.279
 catching on feeder came to the conclusion that all 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.519
 feeders 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.490
 online to you trough-type bullet type 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:34.120
 watermelons for and square feeders too 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.250
 not so good keep on for their bears 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.900
 need to take big vesa to feed 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:43.570
 stood still therefore they apply not 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.210
 tough feeders and such here I am 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.490
 I saw on sale 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:53.790
 mesh feeders this is how it looks 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:58.000
 this small mesh in which inside 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:02.160
 fixed weight which is 30 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.040
 fortified so tied cargo means 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.100
 the only thing that the only thing 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.570
 bags inside i think you understand what 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.870
 you are inside stuffed porridge 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:18.570
 then this thing drags on and clings 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.600
 straight to the line 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:26.920
 the only thing that it can be used 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.150
 with snap garnishes or same 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.380
 asymmetrical loop 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.860
 where straight to the sliding connector or 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.740
 same just to the top with a carabiner 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.570
 here is such a feeding trough what is its 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.090
 dignity is that for the course she 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.500
 lays down at plus plus as 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.270
 pressed against the current pressed to the ground 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:55.600
 and does not pull the ground and nipples do not roll 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.450
 as a feeder does not roll it along the bottom she 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.960
 lay diy and lies nestled 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.110
 a little bit to the ground and lies the mesh of course 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.590
 it's very small here and it's for 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.890
 small fractional waka 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.680
 here we are of course desirable I will change 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.629
 bags will leave a little bit more 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.599
 and the hole is what I wanted for you 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:19.200
 say about the feeders used on 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.200
 flow
