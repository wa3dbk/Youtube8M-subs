00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.270
 hello pretty that 's not it yet 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.480
 the video and that's what I thought 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.730
 I have a new category today 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.590
 English hijacker was the video as 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.199
 normal outfit of the day thought up 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.820
 I came up with the idea that I came 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.040
 yes, make some kind of style money 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.490
 that could mean when i'm in outfits 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.690
 some pieces trend pieces integrate the 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.800
 he's a bit harder too 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.500
 combine like are 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.780
 now this medio rock what he is now 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.119
 currently is super up to date and 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.649
 everywhere I think that's me 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.030
 Maybe I or you with me 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.660
 you may so a few tips and 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.539
 Tricks like this, I agree 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.090
 difficult to combine pieces just 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.770
 would wear and yes that was just like that 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.720
 the have a bit in common tanks 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.160
 I thought the first tip would be the 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.600
 length if you midi rock I find it 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.110
 very important the right length too 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.560
 Find 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.180
 that would mean for rather smaller women 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.860
 I say that the knee length is there on 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.450
 best fits then we get too 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.640
 already for the second point and that are 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.069
 that now I think that it is very important 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.750
 is high shoes to wear at medi today 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.979
 that does not even have to be super high yield 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.560
 that's enough but already 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.990
 Small to small paragraph of 78 cm 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.470
 easily around the leg again visually 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.179
 stretch and harmoniously too 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.009
 to make such a drop a lot 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.400
 is female and I think it fits then 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.470
 such a harmonious high heels quite well 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.060
 we come to point 3 that would be the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.700
 I think it is also very important 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.470
 that one wears the skirts on file too 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.090
 again because it is the one 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.340
 to restore proportions and to 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.380
 the whole thing has gotten into the other one again 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.890
 height and thus easy 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.099
 not so small and 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.620
 shrunk or 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.510
 The fourth tip is compressed 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.069
 goes in the direction of a video rock 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.739
 does not have to be the problem again and again 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.209
 the video back is yes that you the whole 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.950
 fast with the fifties and joins 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.380
 and thus this house will be continuous 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.840
 and yes, the whole thing is very bitter 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.280
 feels and I find around there as well 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.260
 again such an overly pure 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.849
 must get it all simply with 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.370
 such a few modern accessories or 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.590
 with must with modern patterns and 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.870
 to hot materials exchange 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.970
 find just this metallic 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.550
 history whether it is in shoes in 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.319
 chains in bags is quite exciting and 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.140
 the whole thing a bit too 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.300
 modernize as well as fallen out 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.129
 that's why there had to be some animal prints 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.480
 if that's your zebra, if it's the leo 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.569
 just never again so a certain 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.220
 bring in pep and also different ones 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.599
 materials the media council does not have to 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.680
 from normal substance transmitter can indeed 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.319
 be made of leather or 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.970
 yes so in the direction of giving that 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.650
 you tried a little something and 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.630
 you experiment around that maybe 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.790
 also a leather jacket to wear around 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.739
 to bring back to the rocky touch 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.239
 or instead of a normal sunglasses 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.220
 a mirrored sunglasses what so 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.049
 is also more modern and contemporary 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.519
 and then just make this break 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.590
 and the whole thing but again 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.370
 harmonious in our time to adapt 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.739
 will say 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.900
 and the last tip is in direction 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.879
 top part and indeed I find it completely 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.920
 important that the top part of the 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.209
 upper clothing then but relatively tight 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.980
 hero was downstairs 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.480
 the whole volume sits and the video 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.910
 Backs are usually right as well 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.019
 voluminous swinging and find there 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.639
 I just nice if you are here too 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.019
 ensures harmony again and above 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:05.739
 a very tight top who chooses and 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.660
 simply again about the proportions 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.609
 and especially beautiful 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.130
 I'm currently on this kropp top 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.299
 trend you already in my top 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.419
 could see five videos 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.099
 that is, if your top part above one 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.019
 just below the breast ends so on 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:22.930
 I say the ribs and then 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.820
 between split conclusion of brock and 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.280
 then top part so two three centimeters 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.930
 air is where you then the zwerchfell 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.430
 I think that's also very nice 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.710
 and it is an unexpected and too 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.570
 slightly sexy twist to that rather 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.070
 turn video on if you just 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.720
 not expected that was mine , of course 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.770
 tips and tricks I hope it was something 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.970
 for you and it for you 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.800
 maybe a lot 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.050
 Tried out my outfit was now rather 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.460
 closer but very smart I have advised 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.800
 Although trying with the team one 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.030
 a bit again the casual touch 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.620
 and to get in but will not 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.789
 knows if my outfits on the blog 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.099
 sees because they are rather in the 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.450
 more elegant type and for everyday life 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.250
 maybe I would rather flat 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.700
 I prefer shoes that are comfortable 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.320
 are yes and maybe less hair 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.240
 you can do less sunglasses 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.870
 modify quite well and last but not least 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.140
 I will 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.970
 still ask because the feedback to this 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.560
 Outfit videos are always very, very good 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.570
 and many more of this 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.340
 would like to see video and I would like to 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.080
 Generally, if I decide 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.700
 I would have to be between fashion and beauty 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.040
 i or clearly beats my heart 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.650
 stronger for fashion that's why i do that 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.660
 whole even more often or better 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.020
 integrate with the youtube channel 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.760
 and my question to you is now 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.650
 you just want such short ones more often 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.400
 one to one and a half minutes outfit of the 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.110
 see date so it is you rarely 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.420
 just to watch such outfit videos for that 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.460
 but lookbook like several lux 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.990
 in a video to see that you stop there 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.810
 maybe such a four-minute video 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.340
 cuts that together would be another 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.800
 question that would interest me 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.210
 simply also to the organization because that 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.360
 a bit more elaborate than 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.520
 the other and yes we like that 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.280
 which frequency you would like to see there 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.620
 he would do this more often or rather longer 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.600
 say yes that would like to me in the 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.190
 leave comments there and I wish 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.990
 just people day and we just 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.380
 See you on Sunday again until 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.380
 soon
