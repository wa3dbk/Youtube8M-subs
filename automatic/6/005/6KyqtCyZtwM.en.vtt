00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
scubs so all the cars are starting to

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.950 
scubs so all the cars are starting to
come<00:00:05.670> up<00:00:05.819> now<00:00:05.970> on<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.180> internet<00:00:06.540> I<00:00:06.690> think<00:00:06.870> we

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
come up now on the internet I think we

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.360 
come up now on the internet I think we
should<00:00:07.140> give<00:00:07.290> up<00:00:07.319> ever<00:00:07.680> hoping<00:00:08.099> that<00:00:08.250> we're

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
should give up ever hoping that we're

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.549 
should give up ever hoping that we're
going<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.519> attend<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.030> proper<00:00:09.450> new<00:00:10.050> car<00:00:10.320> launch

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
going to attend a proper new car launch

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.890 
going to attend a proper new car launch
in<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.950> way<00:00:11.040> they<00:00:11.190> used<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.550> be<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.750> can

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
in the way they used to be and you can

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.780 
in the way they used to be and you can
hover<00:00:13.139> around<00:00:13.380> technical<00:00:14.130> directors<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.670> ask

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
hover around technical directors and ask

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.310 
hover around technical directors and ask
questions<00:00:15.269> ad<00:00:15.420> nauseam<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:16.049> ain't<00:00:16.199> gonna

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
questions ad nauseam that ain't gonna

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.870 
questions ad nauseam that ain't gonna
happen<00:00:16.619> anymore<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.010> think<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:19.550> what<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:20.640> can<00:00:20.730> do

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
happen anymore I think so what we can do

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.010 
happen anymore I think so what we can do
is<00:00:20.970> look<00:00:21.090> at<00:00:21.240> these<00:00:21.330> pictures<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.779> think<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
is look at these pictures I think the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.120 
is look at these pictures I think the
first<00:00:22.230> question<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.710> do<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.830> think<00:00:22.920> there

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
first question is do you think there

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.660 
first question is do you think there
that's<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.550> real<00:00:23.699> car<00:00:24.230> I<00:00:25.230> think<00:00:25.920> experience<00:00:26.460> in

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
that's a real car I think experience in

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.009 
that's a real car I think experience in
the<00:00:26.730> past<00:00:26.880> has<00:00:27.119> taught<00:00:27.330> us<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.720> when<00:00:27.900> these

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
the past has taught us that when these

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.450 
the past has taught us that when these
renders<00:00:28.529> come<00:00:28.740> out<00:00:28.890> particularly<00:00:29.310> from

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
renders come out particularly from

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.099 
renders come out particularly from
writers<00:00:29.820> who<00:00:29.939> have<00:00:30.060> done<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> few<00:00:30.449> times<00:00:30.840> now

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
writers who have done it a few times now

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.280 
writers who have done it a few times now
the<00:00:31.980> renders<00:00:32.279> are<00:00:32.399> fairly<00:00:32.579> accurate<00:00:33.170> they<00:00:34.170> may

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
the renders are fairly accurate they may

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.080 
the renders are fairly accurate they may
not<00:00:34.500> be<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.770> most<00:00:34.950> sort<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.309> polished

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090

Toro Rosso and Red Bull but that's

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.360 
Toro Rosso and Red Bull but that's
another<00:01:00.149> story<00:01:00.270> absolutely<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.039> seems

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
another story absolutely and it seems

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.369 
another story absolutely and it seems
strange<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.480> car<00:01:03.809> coming<00:01:04.019> at<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> 10

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
strange to have a car coming at a 10

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.810 
strange to have a car coming at a 10
stone<00:01:04.650> with<00:01:04.890> anything<00:01:05.220> other<00:01:05.430> than<00:01:05.580> Renault

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
stone with anything other than Renault

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.149 
stone with anything other than Renault
engines<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.420> mean<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.750> goes<00:01:06.990> back<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
engines I mean it goes back to the the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.030 
engines I mean it goes back to the the
Ford<00:01:08.430> engines<00:01:08.909> back<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.590> mid<00:01:10.590> nineties

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
Ford engines back in the mid nineties

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.440 
Ford engines back in the mid nineties
since<00:01:11.340> they've<00:01:11.549> had<00:01:11.580> anything<00:01:11.970> other<00:01:12.150> than<00:01:12.330> a

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
since they've had anything other than a

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.640 
since they've had anything other than a
Renault<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> back<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> car<00:01:13.409> which<00:01:13.619> is

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
Renault in the back of the car which is

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.240 
Renault in the back of the car which is
a<00:01:14.549> big<00:01:14.970> change<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.330> them<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.680> think<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
a big change for them but I think the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.070 
a big change for them but I think the
car<00:01:17.430> basically<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.090> back-to-basics<00:01:18.540> car

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
car basically it's a back-to-basics car

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.590 
car basically it's a back-to-basics car
for<00:01:19.350> them<00:01:19.560> there's<00:01:19.830> there's<00:01:20.070> nothing

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
for them there's there's nothing

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.050 
for them there's there's nothing
outwardly<00:01:21.860> innovative<00:01:22.860> or<00:01:23.009> really<00:01:23.790> pushing

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
outwardly innovative or really pushing

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.210 
outwardly innovative or really pushing
the<00:01:24.119> boundaries<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:25.590> as<00:01:25.740> we<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:25.979> tell<00:01:26.189> that

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
the boundaries and as we can tell that

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.859 
the boundaries and as we can tell that
the<00:01:26.460> first<00:01:26.700> thing<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.970> strikes<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
the first thing that strikes you on the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.870 
the first thing that strikes you on the
car<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.290> what<00:01:28.710> was<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.070> twin<00:01:29.280> tusk<00:01:29.579> knows

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
car is that what was the twin tusk knows

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.149 
car is that what was the twin tusk knows
has<00:01:30.540> changed<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.200> year<00:01:31.259> partly<00:01:31.770> because<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
has changed this year partly because of

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.770 
has changed this year partly because of
regulations<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.850> think<00:01:32.880> also<00:01:33.329> parted<00:01:33.689> because

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
regulations I think also parted because

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.870 
regulations I think also parted because
Lowe<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.320> won<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> more<00:01:34.740> conventional<00:01:35.040> setup

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
Lowe just won a more conventional setup

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.840 
Lowe just won a more conventional setup
on<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.390> car<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.320> what<00:01:37.799> they've<00:01:37.950> gone<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.579> is

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
on the car so what they've gone for is

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.730 
on the car so what they've gone for is
slightly<00:01:39.509> different<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:40.020> what<00:01:40.200> we've<00:01:40.350> seen<00:01:40.380> on

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
slightly different to what we've seen on

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.950 
slightly different to what we've seen on
the<00:01:40.829> Williams<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.400> far<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.570> they've<00:01:42.750> gone

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the Williams so far in that they've gone

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.990 
the Williams so far in that they've gone
for<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.530> very<00:01:43.560> short<00:01:43.829> nose<00:01:44.250> again<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> very

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
for a very short nose again but a very

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.149 
for a very short nose again but a very
narrow<00:01:45.329> nose<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.079> we've<00:01:46.619> spoken<00:01:46.829> before

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
narrow nose and we've spoken before

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.230 
narrow nose and we've spoken before
about<00:01:47.310> they've<00:01:47.670> gotta<00:01:47.850> have<00:01:47.939> these<00:01:48.000> two

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
about they've gotta have these two

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.569 
about they've gotta have these two

the nose and rather than creating this

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.620 
the nose and rather than creating this
sort<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.799> thumb<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.310> sticking<00:01:53.880> out<00:01:54.149> section

most of those two cross sections they've

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.490 
most of those two cross sections they've
actually<00:01:59.340> stacked<00:01:59.820> them<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.570> same<00:02:00.780> width<00:02:01.020> one

is slightly different and brings to mind

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.150 
is slightly different and brings to mind
some<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.200> ideas<00:02:10.530> they<00:02:10.679> have<00:02:10.890> with<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
some of the ideas they have with the the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160 
some of the ideas they have with the the
big<00:02:11.340> box<00:02:11.730> he<00:02:11.910> knows<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.330> with<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.569> big<00:02:12.720> steps

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
big box he knows is with the big steps

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.850 
big box he knows is with the big steps
underneath<00:02:13.380> them<00:02:13.709> back<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.610> 2009<00:02:15.510> 2010<00:02:16.319> so

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
underneath them back in 2009 2010 so

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.699 
underneath them back in 2009 2010 so
that's<00:02:17.550> all<00:02:17.880> about<00:02:18.239> making<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:19.080> middle<00:02:19.650> of

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
that's all about making the middle of

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.410 
that's all about making the middle of
the<00:02:19.800> front<00:02:20.040> wing<00:02:20.459> section<00:02:20.940> worth<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.239> little

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
the front wing section worth a little

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.839 
the front wing section worth a little
bit<00:02:21.690> better<00:02:21.930> by<00:02:22.650> creating<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.310> change<00:02:23.640> in<00:02:23.760> the

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
bit better by creating a change in the

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.630 
bit better by creating a change in the
airflow<00:02:24.209> just<00:02:24.959> above<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.340> where<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.489> the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
airflow just above it where is the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.940 
airflow just above it where is the
square<00:02:27.030> with<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.569> nose<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.410> think<00:02:28.440> they<00:02:28.680> tried

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
square with the nose I think they tried

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.080 
square with the nose I think they tried
it<00:02:29.069> in<00:02:29.190> Japan<00:02:29.940> was<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.330> right<00:02:31.850> last<00:02:32.850> year

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
it in Japan was that right last year

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.780 
it in Japan was that right last year
they<00:02:33.270> tested<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.920> very<00:02:35.340> similar-looking

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
they tested a very similar-looking

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.250 
they tested a very similar-looking
version<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.600> most<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.900> what<00:02:36.989> we've<00:02:37.110> seen

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
version of the most of what we've seen

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.340 
version of the most of what we've seen
here<00:02:37.560> but<00:02:38.130> they've<00:02:38.250> just<00:02:38.360> arranged<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.690> these

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
here but they've just arranged the these

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.540 
here but they've just arranged the these
cross<00:02:40.590> sections<00:02:40.980> at<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.190> front<00:02:41.400> very

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
cross sections at the front very

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.100 
cross sections at the front very
slightly<00:02:41.910> differently<00:02:42.390> as<00:02:42.599> I<00:02:42.690> said<00:02:42.870> crate

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
slightly differently as I said crate

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.070 
slightly differently as I said crate
loss<00:02:43.319> or<00:02:43.470> step<00:02:43.769> setup<00:02:44.250> but<00:02:44.910> apart<00:02:45.810> from<00:02:45.900> that

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
loss or step setup but apart from that

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.290 
loss or step setup but apart from that
in<00:02:46.709> practice<00:02:47.100> it's<00:02:47.280> very<00:02:47.489> much<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.730> same<00:02:48.000> sort

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
in practice it's very much the same sort

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.059 
in practice it's very much the same sort
of<00:02:48.480> nose<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.989> they<00:02:49.140> were<00:02:49.440> testing<00:02:49.890> that's

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
of nose that they were testing that's

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.170 
of nose that they were testing that's
now<00:02:50.220> code<00:02:50.489> on<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.790> car

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
now code on the car

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.960 
now code on the car
well<00:02:52.019> we<00:02:52.110> think<00:02:52.350> they're<00:02:52.560> running<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.580> their

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
well we think they're running the their

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.550 
well we think they're running the their
own<00:02:54.090> gearbox<00:02:54.600> I'm<00:02:54.810> not<00:02:54.989> absolutely<00:02:55.230> sure

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
own gearbox I'm not absolutely sure

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.590 
own gearbox I'm not absolutely sure
about<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:56.069> but<00:02:56.370> we<00:02:56.519> will<00:02:56.730> confirm<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.150> as

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
about that but we will confirm that as

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.470 
about that but we will confirm that as
time<00:02:58.260> goes<00:02:58.440> on<00:02:58.560> over<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.890> next<00:02:59.010> few<00:02:59.160> days<00:02:59.480> but

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
time goes on over the next few days but

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.360 
time goes on over the next few days but
what<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.780> your<00:03:00.930> take<00:03:01.200> on<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.769> back<00:03:02.160> of<00:03:02.310> the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
what is your take on the the back of the

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.740 
what is your take on the the back of the
car<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.819> inlets<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.480> way<00:03:03.569> they've<00:03:03.720> got

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
car the inlets and the way they've got

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.289 
car the inlets and the way they've got
the<00:03:03.930> air<00:03:04.049> flowing<00:03:04.440> around<00:03:04.709> there<00:03:05.299> well

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
the air flowing around there well

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.729 
the air flowing around there well
obviously<00:03:06.420> they<00:03:06.750> have<00:03:07.019> switched<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.500> the

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
obviously they have switched to the the

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.130 
obviously they have switched to the the
Mercedes<00:03:08.040> power<00:03:08.310> units<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:08.970> Lotus<00:03:09.959> were

Mercedes power units and Lotus were

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.530 
Mercedes power units and Lotus were
quite<00:03:10.410> innovative<00:03:10.650> with<00:03:11.069> their<00:03:11.310> own<00:03:11.610> cooling

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
quite innovative with their own cooling

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.060 
was the only of the Renault runners that
did<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.390> but<00:03:18.630> what<00:03:19.230> we've<00:03:19.380> seen<00:03:19.410> on<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.859> car

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
did that but what we've seen on the car

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.590 
did that but what we've seen on the car
now<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.609> you've<00:03:20.730> got<00:03:20.850> these<00:03:20.940> these<00:03:21.359> two

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
now is that you've got these these two

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.120 
now is that you've got these these two
intakes<00:03:22.019> either<00:03:22.260> side<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.739> roll<00:03:22.890> hoop

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
intakes either side of the roll hoop

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.490 
intakes either side of the roll hoop
which<00:03:24.060> feed<00:03:24.359> down<00:03:24.570> along<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.989> flanks<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.380> the

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
which feed down along the flanks of the

at<00:03:30.359> the<00:03:30.450> back<00:03:30.630> of<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.930> car<00:03:31.140> now<00:03:31.920> we<00:03:32.549> actually

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
at the back of the car now we actually

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.970 
at the back of the car now we actually
did<00:03:32.940> see<00:03:33.209> this<00:03:33.510> setup<00:03:33.810> tested<00:03:34.470> briefly<00:03:34.829> in

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
did see this setup tested briefly in

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.390 
did see this setup tested briefly in
Germany<00:03:35.489> last<00:03:35.700> year<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.829> that<00:03:37.829> was<00:03:37.890> at<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
Germany last year and that was at the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.069 
Germany last year and that was at the
time<00:03:38.579> it<00:03:38.760> Chester<00:03:39.000> told<00:03:39.299> me<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:39.480> was<00:03:39.630> for<00:03:39.810> an

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
time it Chester told me it was for an

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.660 
time it Chester told me it was for an
oil<00:03:40.200> cooler<00:03:40.560> they<00:03:40.829> were<00:03:40.950> testing<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:41.640> I

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
oil cooler they were testing so I

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.310 
oil cooler they were testing so I
imagined<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.299> these<00:03:42.480> side<00:03:42.750> ducts<00:03:43.170> are

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
imagined that these side ducts are

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.280 
imagined that these side ducts are
feeding<00:03:43.880> to<00:03:44.880> oil<00:03:45.209> coolers<00:03:45.630> which<00:03:45.780> are<00:03:45.930> mounted

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
feeding to oil coolers which are mounted

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.140 
feeding to oil coolers which are mounted
to<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.530> side<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:46.980> engine<00:03:47.340> which<00:03:47.880> just

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
to the side of the engine which just

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.670 
to the side of the engine which just
takes<00:03:48.269> them<00:03:48.510> up<00:03:48.720> out<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:49.140> way<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.470> side

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
takes them up out of the way of the side

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.440 
takes them up out of the way of the side
pods<00:03:49.980> allowing<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.430> side<00:03:50.850> posts<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.209> be<00:03:51.239> that

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
pods allowing the side posts to be that

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.330 
pods allowing the side posts to be that
much<00:03:51.630> narrower<00:03:52.019> which<00:03:52.230> gives<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.620> better

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
much narrower which gives you better

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.240 
much narrower which gives you better
airflow<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.209> diffuser<00:03:55.100> interesting<00:03:56.100> that

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
airflow to the diffuser interesting that

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.099 
airflow to the diffuser interesting that
they<00:03:56.430> tried<00:03:56.730> these<00:03:56.940> as<00:03:57.299> I<00:03:57.329> said<00:03:57.600> in<00:03:57.720> Germany

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
they tried these as I said in Germany

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.140 
they tried these as I said in Germany
last<00:03:58.319> year<00:03:58.650> but<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:59.340> plates<00:03:59.640> that<00:03:59.940> these

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
last year but the plates that these

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.599 
last year but the plates that these
ducts<00:04:01.019> mount<00:04:01.319> to<00:04:01.560> remained<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:02.040> remained<00:04:02.489> on

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
ducts mount to remained it remained on

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.099 
ducts mount to remained it remained on
the<00:04:02.730> roll<00:04:02.880> hoop<00:04:03.090> on<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.329> car<00:04:03.540> for<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:03.780> rest<00:04:03.959> of

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
the roll hoop on the car for the rest of

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.050 
the roll hoop on the car for the rest of
the<00:04:04.230> year<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:05.100> they<00:04:05.250> probably<00:04:05.400> will<00:04:05.640> be<00:04:05.730> losing

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
the year so they probably will be losing

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.460 
the year so they probably will be losing
a<00:04:06.090> little<00:04:06.299> bit<00:04:06.390> of<00:04:06.480> rear<00:04:06.660> wing<00:04:06.840> performance

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
a little bit of rear wing performance

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.140 
a little bit of rear wing performance
but<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.709> think<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.220> know<00:04:08.280> on<00:04:08.459> balance<00:04:08.730> the

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
but I think you know on balance the

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.759 
but I think you know on balance the
performance<00:04:09.630> increased<00:04:10.049> from<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.380> diffuser

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
performance increased from the diffuser

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.860 
performance increased from the diffuser
from<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.100> smaller<00:04:11.340> side<00:04:11.579> pods<00:04:11.850> will<00:04:12.030> be<00:04:12.120> far

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
from the smaller side pods will be far

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.840 
from the smaller side pods will be far
more<00:04:12.900> worthwhile<00:04:13.319> than<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:14.190> little<00:04:14.519> bit<00:04:14.609> of<00:04:14.639> a

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
more worthwhile than a little bit of a

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.110 
more worthwhile than a little bit of a
rear<00:04:15.209> wing<00:04:15.420> interruption<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.370> then<00:04:17.370> as<00:04:17.639> I

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
rear wing interruption and then as I

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.300 
rear wing interruption and then as I
said<00:04:18.180> at<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.720> back<00:04:18.900> we<00:04:19.169> have<00:04:19.200> from<00:04:20.190> the

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
said at the back we have from the

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.399 
said at the back we have from the
drawing<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.970> disciples'<00:04:21.479> actually<00:04:21.750> at<00:04:22.200> first

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
drawing the disciples' actually at first

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:23.899 
drawing the disciples' actually at first
looked<00:04:22.650> quite<00:04:22.800> long<00:04:23.039> and<00:04:23.190> large<00:04:23.400> but<00:04:23.700> what<00:04:23.789> it

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
looked quite long and large but what it

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.820 
looked quite long and large but what it
is<00:04:23.940> is<00:04:24.180> they've<00:04:24.360> moved<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.169> outlet<00:04:25.530> air

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
is is they've moved the outlet air

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.100 
is is they've moved the outlet air
like<00:04:26.189> McLaren<00:04:26.699> did<00:04:26.819> last<00:04:27.030> year<00:04:27.150> very<00:04:27.479> high<00:04:27.870> up

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
like McLaren did last year very high up

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.260 
like McLaren did last year very high up
and<00:04:28.740> it's<00:04:28.860> very<00:04:29.039> visual<00:04:29.610> even<00:04:30.030> though<00:04:30.120> the

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
and it's very visual even though the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.119 
and it's very visual even though the
side<00:04:30.449> pods<00:04:30.720> underneath<00:04:31.139> are<00:04:31.289> actually<00:04:31.800> very

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:32.129 
side pods underneath are actually very

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:34.070 
side pods underneath are actually very
small<00:04:32.490> on<00:04:32.699> the<00:04:32.879> pictures<00:04:33.419> we've<00:04:33.569> seen<00:04:33.780> so<00:04:34.050> far

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
small on the pictures we've seen so far

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.890 
small on the pictures we've seen so far
of<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.590> Lotus<00:04:34.979> and<00:04:35.669> again<00:04:36.270> this<00:04:36.389> is<00:04:36.569> all<00:04:36.689> about

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
of the Lotus and again this is all about

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.420 
of the Lotus and again this is all about
getting<00:04:37.080> air<00:04:37.289> flow<00:04:37.560> you<00:04:37.949> know<00:04:38.009> through<00:04:38.280> the

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
getting air flow you know through the

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.899 
getting air flow you know through the
rear<00:04:38.610> suspension<00:04:39.240> up<00:04:39.419> over<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:39.840> diffuser<00:04:40.199> and

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:40.909 
rear suspension up over the diffuser and

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:43.249 
rear suspension up over the diffuser and
because<00:04:41.909> there's<00:04:42.090> no<00:04:42.210> beam<00:04:42.509> wing<00:04:42.840> that<00:04:43.080> would

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
because there's no beam wing that would

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.159 
because there's no beam wing that would
be<00:04:43.430> disrupted<00:04:44.430> by<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.669> airflow<00:04:45.090> these<00:04:45.330> side

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
be disrupted by the airflow these side

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.020 
be disrupted by the airflow these side
pod<00:04:46.379> outlets<00:04:46.770> they<00:04:47.250> just<00:04:47.430> bring<00:04:47.580> them<00:04:47.699> up<00:04:47.789> much

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
pod outlets they just bring them up much

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.939 
pod outlets they just bring them up much
higher<00:04:48.300> up<00:04:48.569> it's<00:04:49.229> perhaps<00:04:49.439> not<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.770> most

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
higher up it's perhaps not the most

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.219 
higher up it's perhaps not the most
aesthetically<00:04:50.400> pleasing<00:04:50.750> solution<00:04:51.750> but<00:04:51.990> it's

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
aesthetically pleasing solution but it's

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
this year given the number of 10

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.909 
this year given the number of 10
they<00:06:38.669> can<00:06:38.849> now<00:06:38.970> mate<00:06:39.210> and<00:06:39.720> for<00:06:39.960> me<00:06:40.169> being<00:06:40.830> a

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 
they can now mate and for me being a

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:42.499 
they can now mate and for me being a
gambler<00:06:41.190> I<00:06:41.580> would<00:06:41.789> have<00:06:41.910> tried<00:06:42.120> to<00:06:42.150> have<00:06:42.300> got<00:06:42.479> a

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:42.509 
gambler I would have tried to have got a

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:44.779 
gambler I would have tried to have got a
second<00:06:42.990> Honda<00:06:43.319> deal<00:06:43.500> and<00:06:43.800> got<00:06:44.340> on<00:06:44.430> the<00:06:44.460> back<00:06:44.669> of

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:44.789 
second Honda deal and got on the back of

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:46.279 
second Honda deal and got on the back of
the<00:06:44.849> whole<00:06:44.970> Honda<00:06:45.330> bandwagon<00:06:45.660> when<00:06:46.110> they're

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:46.289 
the whole Honda bandwagon when they're

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:48.439 
the whole Honda bandwagon when they're
still<00:06:46.530> relatively<00:06:47.430> low<00:06:47.639> profile<00:06:48.150> because

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:48.449 
still relatively low profile because

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:49.790 
still relatively low profile because
there's<00:06:48.810> no<00:06:48.900> doubt<00:06:49.139> that<00:06:49.169> over<00:06:49.410> a<00:06:49.620> two<00:06:49.770> to

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
there's no doubt that over a two to

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.290 
there's no doubt that over a two to
three<00:06:50.039> year<00:06:50.069> period<00:06:50.340> Honda<00:06:50.789> will<00:06:50.940> start<00:06:51.210> to

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
three year period Honda will start to

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.040 
three year period Honda will start to
get<00:06:51.389> it<00:06:51.509> together

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 
get it together

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.350 
get it together
I'm<00:06:52.410> surprised<00:06:52.889> that<00:06:53.009> they've<00:06:53.220> gone<00:06:53.430> to

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
I'm surprised that they've gone to

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.990 
I'm surprised that they've gone to
Mercedes<00:06:54.960> the<00:06:55.169> year<00:06:55.440> after<00:06:55.800> everybody's<00:06:56.340> been

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
successful with Mercedes it will cost

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:59.960 
successful with Mercedes it will cost
