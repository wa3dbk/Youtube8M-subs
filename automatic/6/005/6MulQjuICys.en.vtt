 mars you will never come back 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.290

 years of training for 7 years so they 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.180
 you can survive on mars and that shit 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.739
 as a bit logical and funny and is of 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.280
 all that training and shit and for 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.440
 different 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.060
 because the reality show made mistake 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.100
 I was looking at a comrade from my body 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.769

 for that under fucking that just becomes 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.420
 the fucking reality show made of 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.340
 all those are qualifications of 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.220
 people who want to go to mars and 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.470
 from 2023 only four people remained 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.510
 over and yes to the students who are on 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.390

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.739

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.780
 two new ones are coming in two years 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.080
 people at someone else did that on 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.690
 Mars 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.300
 your live stream will become privacy fucking 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.310

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.400

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.190
 Pike

 or so so many true professional 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.970
 astronauts are opposed to the system 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.580
 from that failure or sent everyone got too 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.930
 a task on mars but as the one then 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.630
