00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 everything they will hear or see 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.339
 continuation is a tribute to the time 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.899
 that defined our personality and that of 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.670
 many of you are not authors of 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.990
 no audiovisual material used in 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.790
 We are the owners of this project 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.150
 words and opinions exposed on beards 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.150
 in the air 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.040
 hello gentlemen welcome this is beards 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.720
 to the air tv after very good 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.610
 criticisms we had about the program 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.900
 radio so be you just tell me that 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.029
 there are no people unknown to us telling us that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.790
 the program was very good then 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.770
 we decide why not take it to another 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.380
 format and that's why we're here with this 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.290
 flame beards to the air tv these days 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.910
 we are sitting and talking and 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.270
 we come to the conclusion that it is more 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.820
 we told each other and why not 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.020
 because not then that's what we're 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:53.570
 doing at this moment 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:55.190
 this is to pass the air tv along 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.110
 of history and in different cultures 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.559
 men with facial hair have been 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:04.040
 attributed wisdom sexual potential and 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.660
 a high social status but we do not 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.760
 we know a lot about all of us 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.300
 quickie and in your pocket we do not have 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.300
 a little kiss 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.260
 but we have a beard and he was a mother 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.360

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.640

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.290
 little monkeys and remember to ride then 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.290
 with doublet 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.420
 to situations names and places 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.360
 described in this program are product 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.510
 of fiction any resemblance to the 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.750
 reality is pure coincidence 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.890
 the topic to be discussed today is the 90 I could 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.240
 Easily tell a girl 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:04.950
 do not use the word love love my baby 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.950
 marchi marchi 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.800
 telling me nothing if we just do 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.930
 the exercise look at the beard concentrate 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.930
 the beard and bald especially 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:24.950
 by two places when you arrived 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.950
 if you stay game 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.770
 will be the one who touched me, they touched me a lot of things 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.180
 I was born in 1990, so my moments 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.550
 they started more or less in 1995 in 1995 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.720
 there was a program on television that 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.720
 it was called that 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.920
 pacheco was always old, that's why 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.069
 as as álex aguinaga of the selection 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.069
 from Ecuador 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.329
 That's how old he was and when I do not know if he died 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.219
 I guess because pacheco de pacheco was 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.989
 very tense and what if we talk about cinema 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:06.030
 and television in general series 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.010
 movies things from that era like the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.640
 following 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.640
 that 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.390
 look at that buttock 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.010
 it was 70 50 these are going to leave all 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.540
 running from the first this caterine 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.230
 ibargüen and in the end is the daddy of you 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.230

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.360
 the fed and the ugly but but but it set 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.340
 I'm in the fifth element there are four 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:39.459
 elements and the fifth is love 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.609
 but you did not see that dialogue to 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.390
 she was love the fifth element ni 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.269
 the dialogue 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.090
 in the end the question is why save 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.709
 to the planet there is a dialogue in the part in 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.900
 the one that already has a gigantic lightning 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.940

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.150

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.100
 song I love sent people already 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.590
 He did not care 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.360
 finally I think not I do not say it would be 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.150
 nurse and you will not go one 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.830
 unworthy here there is something they threw me 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.810
 here they put fruits with spices for 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.200
 be actors then there is this hose 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.200
 coconut 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.710
 cinnamon 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.320
 damn is cumin veronica orozco that 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.260
 it was vanilla and this gentleman who always 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.210
 called take and it will be called cough and it will be called 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:44.600
 take the wife of the capo enter your section 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.600
 this section is called erudite chatter 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:51.680
 there came out the question of the oven that 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.110
 they are the barney teletubbies cousins 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.060
 distant cousins ​​because they are more amorphous 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.920
 even though you barnes at least one knows that 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.560
 Barney is a dinosaur when they came out 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.139
 the teletubbies when the 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.729
 teletubbies 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.729
 the television was chubby 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:15.139
 at this time they would have high definition 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.090
 here in the belly the teletubbies would have 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.100
 been created after a collision of two 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.169
 asteroids swallowed then by a hole 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.750
 black expelled later by a 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.490
 hole even more black and thus creating a 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.380
 parallel universe that escapes the 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.020
 laws of quantum physics and that 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:34.580
 stephen hawkings ignored 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:37.759
 the power rangers were five two women 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:42.009
 and three men because when they are 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:42.009
 uniforms look like five women 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.949
 because people do not realize the 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:48.110
 problems that had everything in that era 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:51.410
 this first of all is called game of 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:56.440
 Juan Situation has situations of 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:06:00.590
 stadiums huang places and give me the 4 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.509
 give me the 1 what things you would not think about the 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.389
 home of the in-laws would not think about the 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:07.580
 mother-in-law I would not think about the sister-in-law and 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:09.440

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.199
 think about the sister-in-law but yes it has 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.150
 abstained is because he has done it and is more 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:15.770
 from you I did not get married I do not think or any 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.280
 sister-in-law that I have had to mauro the 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.500
 sister-in-law of huang in the street of the 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.370
 blacks mauro would not think about the sister-in-law of 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:31.160
 water but it makes me 3 and Juan 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:33.090
 the 3 with the buttock the 1 if things that do not 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:37.199
 you would take 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:39.240
 a lion store and or the store 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:42.930
 lions would take us for example a 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.460
 dead dead gazelle I would not go mounted 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.550
 in a house of a lion store 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.190
 paulo I would not take morcilla if also 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.169
 You should like them as I want to do 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.639
 something they do on television that I 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:54.870
 I think we do not have much space below 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:58.520
 then we can do it up 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:00.750
 social networks are going to go up 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.610
 here are social networks coming out 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.970
 social networks we see ourselves in a 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.440
 next emission of beards to the air tve 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.630
 I wish you liked it and I hope you follow them 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.180
 liking and hopefully we keep seeing the 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.009
 faces 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.660
 things that happen in the nineties the 

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:18.170
 things that we will never understand from the 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:21.960
 ninetys I would not say I'm a man 

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:25.020
 I feel very sorry, I have 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:27.690
 problems with my hormones I'm not a 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:31.070
 less I am not a man is not that I am not 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:31.070
 a man I have hormonal problems
