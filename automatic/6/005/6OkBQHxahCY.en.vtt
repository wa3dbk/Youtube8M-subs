00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:18.349
 hey people today i'll show you the 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:24.830
 solution to some bugs for example the 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:27.470
 pact of cash systems and the bug of 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:32.119
 skills of talents when it when 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.220
 he caught his own 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.170
 Youth for example or from the youth 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.269
 another team for example 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.870
 here the club I have different from the 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:43.030
 own youth I want to know from 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.059
 valencia 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:50.469
 we could see we had five games to play 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:54.050
 Won 58 critical points 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:58.600
 However, here is the nicola pds 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.120
 talent in ten games 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.690
 you see now 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.250
 that was already - gets 16 points though 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.630
 have used so many times yes 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.420
 actually also in the champions league 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.009
 plays regularly 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.080
 if you are interested in the development of 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.330
 so much emphasis on the game 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.180
 development forecasts you see also 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.119
 would be closing at about the strength 90 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.030
 but since I can already now already 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.200
 now went much higher than 90 here for 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.790
 example mario brandt 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.110
 then I have from our own youth he 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.070
 was really a very bad game 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.820
 and of course seen 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.610
 the skill points at almost plus 170 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.310
 and he has only five missions 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.950
 and you can see it here 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.350
 probably further on strength 80 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.079
 but even then i can tell you if 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.179
 They use them regularly 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:59.009
 strength with security went higher so 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:02:01.200
 why is this box so easy man 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.689
 some talents he got from the iphone in 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.299
 which youth picks are overrated 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.330
 that is the performance they have in the 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.920
 Youth will have done automatically 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.959
 after the commitment with in the first 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.590
 put team first but in the 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:22.200
 of course it is harder for the team 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:26.340
 get bet insert and how 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.690
 one says so nicely is the beginning 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.810
 hard so she keeps on 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.140
 then it goes away too so here 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.170
 We can see the cash in cash 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.849
 income and expenses some have me 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.069
 already tells you that in cash times 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.510
 less time again after 12 o'clock 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.360
 weeks 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.580
 this is normal because 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.620
 if you win a game you get 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.250
 Of course, more grants at one 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.350
 of course, you get less defeat 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.090
 but money is still the same 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.090
 for example, salaries 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.770
 bonuses etc 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.530
 and here at the booking channel could exactly 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.720
 see where you have your income and where 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.220
 here too the issues have to 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.930
 Example here had at the 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.630
 player salaries of the first team 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.900
 most of the issues and most 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.700
 revenue from the show revenue 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.440
 I'll come back to that later 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.390
 here at a premium payments can 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.280
 yes, see who most champions bremen 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.840
 come non-premium and have here 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.810
 you then logged exactly as seen 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.300
 better said the whole income and 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.370
 here you can see the editions 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.800
 tickets tv sponsors 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.130
 infrastructure you have just about everything 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.010
 a look and I would as always 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.920
 keep an eye on it and then to 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.750
 for example, make the tickets heart 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.739
 For example, never merchandising 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.590
 to neglect 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:57.290
 always look that they are all up to 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.290
 stop at product pallets 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.760
 You have marketing here you can get one 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.530
 choose 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:07.110
 of course I'm always nice so 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.739
 always on a stop 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:13.430
 you always have to offer 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.979
 here now at the ticket sale 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.889
 I have many on top 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.609
 made what means top is top 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.200
 to beat 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.840
 the tickets have the double 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.280
 price for a discount of course 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.860
 more spectators but here 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.510
 if a not attractive game is me 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.690
 makes it to the top go the expected 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.750
 spectators already off and so clearly 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.330
 that's just back 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.490
 really where he really expect them 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.450
 spectators to maximum then have the 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.970
 topzuschlag make 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:49.830
 that will be at the end of the year 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:54.000
 really noticed the scales 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.680
 or when in the case of 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.979
 sales you have here we can too 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.130
 the money from the boards what a 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:06.250
 got a nice raise 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:11.660
 I never do that money here 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:14.690
 could also invest with good luck 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.010
 then out of the same if the 15 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.160
 Maybe we can invest millions 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.560
 until 10 years then 10 120 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:26.450
 million but I would do that first 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:29.920
 if I mean mine I say one 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:34.400
 team really has that too 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.259
 complete 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.880
 example but always injured 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:39.710
 players use mario gÃ¶tze am 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.850
 had been injured at the beginning and now had 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.410
 a plus of almost 140 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.580
 I hope soon Holger Badstuber as 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.479
 be this time as well 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:52.160
 but this would soon have an update 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.220
 to all players I tell you him 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.430
 I have shown and I hope I can 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:01.130
 To help stand the park is the same 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:05.169
 an insoluble case and Jamaica 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.169
 Subscribe to it until next time
