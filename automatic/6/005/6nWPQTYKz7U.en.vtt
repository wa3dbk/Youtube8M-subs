00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
now as it says slightly tougher cut this

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.150 
now as it says slightly tougher cut this
one<00:00:06.629> afresh<00:00:06.990> that's<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.350> side<00:00:07.529> experiment

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
one afresh that's a side experiment

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.910 
one afresh that's a side experiment
after<00:00:08.490> inventing<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.240> lasers<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:10.500> test<00:00:10.740> its

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
after inventing the lasers to test its

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.609 
after inventing the lasers to test its
accuracy<00:00:12.710> it<00:00:13.710> passed<00:00:14.059> all<00:00:15.059> right<00:00:16.020> we're<00:00:16.500> going

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
accuracy it passed all right we're going

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.680 
accuracy it passed all right we're going
to<00:00:16.650> cut<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.980> from<00:00:17.190> as<00:00:17.640> we<00:00:17.940> view<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.300> left<00:00:18.570> to

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
to cut it from as we view it left to

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.510 
to cut it from as we view it left to
right<00:00:18.900> because<00:00:19.230> I'm<00:00:19.560> shooting<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.189> right<00:00:20.369> to

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
right because I'm shooting it right to

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.970 
right because I'm shooting it right to
left<00:00:20.810> and<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:22.020> will<00:00:22.170> put<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> lot<00:00:22.560> I'm<00:00:22.740> only

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
left and I will put a lot I'm only

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.189 
left and I will put a lot I'm only
putting<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.310> half<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> inside<00:00:24.300> here<00:00:24.600> and

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
putting a half it to the inside here and

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.529 
putting a half it to the inside here and
put<00:00:25.500> me<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> half<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.010> tip<00:00:26.189> inside<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.480> can

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
put me a half a tip inside so I can

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.810 
put me a half a tip inside so I can
predict<00:00:28.349> how<00:00:28.949> much<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.279> key<00:00:29.429> ball<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.670> going

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
predict how much the key ball is going

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.030 
predict how much the key ball is going
to<00:00:29.880> deflect<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.510> curve<00:00:30.750> rather<00:00:31.529> than<00:00:31.830> just

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
to deflect and curve rather than just

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.830 
to deflect and curve rather than just
counting<00:00:32.510> excuse<00:00:33.510> me

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
counting excuse me

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.720 
counting excuse me
rather<00:00:34.469> than<00:00:34.770> just<00:00:34.950> counting<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> center

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
rather than just counting on the center

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.319 
rather than just counting on the center
ball<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.090> accidentally<00:00:36.570> hit<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:37.010> right

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
ball and accidentally hit it right

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.389 
ball and accidentally hit it right
anyways<00:00:39.379> second<00:00:40.379> reason<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.010> might<00:00:41.219> miss

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
anyways second reason is I might miss

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.389 
anyways second reason is I might miss
this<00:00:41.520> ball<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.360> way<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.920> but<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.950> will<00:00:44.219> catch

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
this ball on the way in but I will catch

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.240 
this ball on the way in but I will catch
it<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.700> our<00:00:44.789> way<00:00:44.940> out<00:00:45.200> the<00:00:46.200> third<00:00:46.440> reason<00:00:46.649> if<00:00:47.100> I

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
it on our way out the third reason if I

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.110 
it on our way out the third reason if I
do<00:00:47.309> make<00:00:47.670> it

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
do make it

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.119 
do make it
I<00:00:48.149> won't<00:00:48.690> scratch<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.530> hit<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.770> with<00:00:49.829> Center

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
I won't scratch we hit it with Center

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.920 
I won't scratch we hit it with Center
ball<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:50.820> scratch<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.539> colon<00:00:51.809> or

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
ball you can scratch up in the colon or

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.900 
ball you can scratch up in the colon or
up<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.230> down<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.500> table<00:00:52.890> hitting<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:53.640> thin

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
up and down the table hitting it so thin

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.790 
up and down the table hitting it so thin
they<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.180> only<00:00:54.300> need<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> half<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.140> tip<00:00:55.350> inside

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
they you only need a half a tip inside

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.459 
they you only need a half a tip inside
is<00:00:55.980> plenty<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.670> hold<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.320> when

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
is plenty to hold this it's like when

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.049 
is plenty to hold this it's like when
you<00:00:58.530> hit<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.920> thin<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.789> like<00:00:59.940> shooting

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
you hit it this thin it's like shooting

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.689 
you hit it this thin it's like shooting
the<00:01:00.210> ball<00:01:00.359> straight<00:01:00.629> into<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> rail<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.379> also

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
the ball straight into the rail and also

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.670 
the ball straight into the rail and also
after<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.879> line<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.719> see<00:01:04.439> where<00:01:04.589> you're

after to line it up see where you're
going<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.860> aim<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.510> object-ball<00:01:06.860> I'm<00:01:07.860> not

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
going to aim on the object-ball I'm not

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.060 
going to aim on the object-ball I'm not
really<00:01:08.909> much<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.479> conversation<00:01:10.110> I'm<00:01:10.229> really

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
enough energy for the ball to get to the

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.949 
enough energy for the ball to get to the

lose control of your cue ball and it's
the<00:01:59.500> same<00:01:59.739> thing<00:01:59.979> like<00:02:00.189> I<00:02:00.310> said<00:02:00.869> when<00:02:01.869> I<00:02:01.899> was<00:02:02.079> a

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
the same thing like I said when I was a

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.819 
the same thing like I said when I was a
player<00:02:03.009> a<00:02:03.429> player<00:02:04.270> I<00:02:04.599> felt<00:02:05.469> more<00:02:05.649> comfortable

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
player a player I felt more comfortable

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.219 
player a player I felt more comfortable
with<00:02:06.219> that<00:02:06.340> that's<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:06.759> way<00:02:06.909> I<00:02:07.239> was<00:02:07.719> raised<00:02:07.959> I

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
with that that's the way I was raised I

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.359 
with that that's the way I was raised I
think<00:02:08.440> that's<00:02:08.769> the<00:02:08.829> way<00:02:08.920> most<00:02:09.099> of<00:02:09.310> the

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
think that's the way most of the

think that's the way most of the
American<00:02:09.759> public<00:02:10.260> but<00:02:15.000> but<00:02:16.000> now<00:02:16.150> we<00:02:16.209> have<00:02:16.420> to
