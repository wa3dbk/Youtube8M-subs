00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
the secrets I found just recently in

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.500 
the secrets I found just recently in
fact<00:00:30.150> was<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.439> when<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.949> actually<00:00:32.279> put<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
fact was that when I actually put the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.389 
fact was that when I actually put the
lavalier<00:00:33.780> microphone<00:00:34.320> under<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.130> actor

lavalier microphone under the actor

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.270 
lavalier microphone under the actor
shirt<00:00:35.840> you<00:00:36.840> can<00:00:37.320> block<00:00:37.590> most<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.100> wind

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280

shirt you can block most of that wind
and<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.610> works<00:00:38.760> pretty<00:00:38.969> nicely<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:40.290> these

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530

and it works pretty nicely so in these
last<00:00:40.770> couple<00:00:40.890> episodes<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.550> I'll<00:00:41.670> show<00:00:41.850> you

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.179 
up that cue and be ready to go and then
in<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.700> one<00:01:05.760> I'm<00:01:06.180> using<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.659> Audio<00:01:06.930> Technica

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
in this one I'm using the Audio Technica

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.630 
in this one I'm using the Audio Technica
88<00:01:08.189> 99<00:01:08.640> underneath<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> blue<00:01:09.930> sweatshirt

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
88 99 underneath the blue sweatshirt

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.770 
88 99 underneath the blue sweatshirt
that's<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:11.820> that's<00:01:12.150> quite<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> bit<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.630> light

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
that's all that's quite a bit of light

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.750 
that's all that's quite a bit of light
and<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.500> takes<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.890> much<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.280> really<00:01:14.460> fill

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
and it takes that much to really fill

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.840 
and it takes that much to really fill
the<00:01:14.909> shadows<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.619> a<00:01:16.619> cloudy<00:01:17.280> day<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:17.670> this

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
the shadows so a cloudy day like this

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.609 
the shadows so a cloudy day like this
this<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.540> register<00:01:18.720> right<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:19.470> as<00:01:19.560> you

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
this is can register right here as you

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.460 
this is can register right here as you
can<00:01:19.680> see<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:20.070> pretty<00:01:20.189> windy<00:01:21.110> dark<00:01:22.110> clouds

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
can see it's pretty windy dark clouds

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.770 
can see it's pretty windy dark clouds
and<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.549> use<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.820> light<00:01:24.060> very<00:01:24.330> effective

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
and I can use this light very effective

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.719 
and I can use this light very effective
way<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.930> fill<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> illness<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.580> get<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
way to fill in the illness and to get a

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.609 
way to fill in the illness and to get a
nice<00:01:26.939> even<00:01:27.150> planning<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:27.659> my<00:01:27.840> subject

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
nice even planning on my subject

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.260 
nice even planning on my subject
that's<00:01:29.159> all<00:01:29.310> that's<00:01:29.670> quite<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> bit<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.119> light

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
that's all that's quite a bit of light

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.330 
that's all that's quite a bit of light
and<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:31.020> takes<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.380> much<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.799> really<00:01:32.070> fill<00:01:32.250> in

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
and it takes that much to really fill in

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.330 
and it takes that much to really fill in
the<00:01:32.430> shadows<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:34.290> cloudy<00:01:34.770> day<00:01:34.890> like<00:01:35.009> this

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
the shadows so on a cloudy day like this

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.770 
the shadows so on a cloudy day like this
and<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.759> getting<00:01:36.090> ready<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.299> storm<00:01:36.600> right

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
and this is getting ready to storm right

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.590 
and this is getting ready to storm right
here<00:01:36.810> as<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.170> see<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:37.560> pretty<00:01:37.680> windy

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
here as you can see it's pretty windy

dark<00:01:39.600> clouds<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.070> use<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.340> light

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
dark clouds and I can use this light

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.639 
dark clouds and I can use this light
very<00:01:41.790> effectively<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.570> fill<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> eyes<00:01:43.200> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
very effectively to fill in the eyes and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.380 
very effectively to fill in the eyes and
to<00:01:44.070> get<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> nice<00:01:44.430> even<00:01:44.670> lighting<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.180> my

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.630 
to get a nice even lighting on my
subject<00:01:45.899> now<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.680> both<00:01:46.799> these<00:01:46.950> cases<00:01:47.159> we<00:01:47.460> have

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
subject now in both these cases we have

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.700 
subject now in both these cases we have
a<00:01:47.670> fair<00:01:48.270> bit<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.600> wind<00:01:48.840> especially<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
a fair bit of wind especially in the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.830 
a fair bit of wind especially in the
case<00:01:49.890> with<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:51.000> second<00:01:51.329> one<00:01:51.450> with<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
case with the the second one with the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.620 
case with the the second one with the
blue<00:01:52.079> sweatshirt<00:01:52.610> breezes<00:01:53.610> were<00:01:53.759> probably<00:01:54.149> up

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
blue sweatshirt breezes were probably up

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.800 
blue sweatshirt breezes were probably up
to<00:01:54.689> 15<00:01:55.170> miles<00:01:55.409> per<00:01:55.590> hour<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.009> they<00:01:56.880> were<00:01:57.329> more

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
to 15 miles per hour so they were more

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.130 
to 15 miles per hour so they were more
than<00:01:57.990> just<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.259> mild<00:01:58.979> mild<00:01:59.310> breeze<00:01:59.780> but<00:02:00.780> having

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
than just a mild mild breeze but having

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.569 
than just a mild mild breeze but having
that<00:02:01.259> underneath<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.770> sweatshirt<00:02:02.189> made<00:02:02.430> all

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
that underneath the sweatshirt made all

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.370 
that underneath the sweatshirt made all
the<00:02:02.670> difference<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.180> world<00:02:03.329> now<00:02:03.689> one<00:02:04.350> of

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the difference in the world now one of

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.230 
the difference in the world now one of
the<00:02:04.500> challenges<00:02:05.070> with<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.369> type<00:02:06.210> of

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the challenges with this type of

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.300 
the challenges with this type of
approach<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.990> that

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
approach is that

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.340 
approach is that
if<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.270> actor<00:02:09.569> moves<00:02:09.750> around<00:02:09.869> too<00:02:10.200> much

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
if the actor moves around too much

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.750 
if the actor moves around too much
you're<00:02:10.679> going<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.830> get<00:02:10.979> some<00:02:11.190> noise<00:02:11.370> from<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
you're going to get some noise from the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.340 
you're going to get some noise from the
clothes<00:02:12.090> clothes<00:02:12.780> rubbing<00:02:13.140> on<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
clothes clothes rubbing on the

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.660 
clothes clothes rubbing on the
microphone<00:02:13.800> so<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.069> have<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.340> be<00:02:14.430> kind<00:02:14.610> of

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
microphone so you have to be kind of

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.640 
microphone so you have to be kind of
careful<00:02:14.850> one<00:02:15.600> of<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.780> things<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.200> also<00:02:16.319> be

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
careful one of the things that also be

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.680 
careful one of the things that also be
experimenting<00:02:17.160> with<00:02:17.310> I've<00:02:17.580> heard<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.480> lot

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
experimenting with I've heard of a lot

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.290 
experimenting with I've heard of a lot
of<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.870> professionals<00:02:19.910> sound<00:02:20.910> guys<00:02:21.060> actually

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
of the professionals sound guys actually

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.260 
of the professionals sound guys actually
putting<00:02:21.690> moleskin<00:02:22.620> around<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.430> outside<00:02:24.000> of

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
putting moleskin around the outside of

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.020 
putting moleskin around the outside of
the<00:02:24.630> lavalier<00:02:25.140> microphone<00:02:25.590> just<00:02:25.709> sort<00:02:25.890> of

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
the lavalier microphone just sort of

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.340 
the lavalier microphone just sort of
applying<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.150> small<00:02:27.360> piece<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.569> it<00:02:27.870> like<00:02:28.080> you

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
applying a small piece of it like you

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.890 
applying a small piece of it like you
would<00:02:28.530> tape<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.120> moleskin<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.239> actually<00:02:30.600> for

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
would tape and moleskin is actually for

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.360 
would tape and moleskin is actually for
it's<00:02:31.500> actually<00:02:31.709> made<00:02:31.830> for<00:02:31.950> foot<00:02:32.160> care

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
it's actually made for foot care

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.190 
it's actually made for foot care
technically<00:02:33.360> it's<00:02:33.480> not<00:02:33.540> really<00:02:33.660> coming<00:02:34.080> from

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
technically it's not really coming from

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.860 
technically it's not really coming from
a<00:02:34.440> mole<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.400> synthetic<00:02:35.910> fabric<00:02:36.360> but<00:02:36.780> it

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
a mole it is a synthetic fabric but it

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.630 
a mole it is a synthetic fabric but it
goes<00:02:36.959> around<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.319> microphone<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.069> also

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
goes around the microphone and that also

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.990 
goes around the microphone and that also
what<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.239> does<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.750> helps<00:02:40.050> prevent<00:02:40.769> the

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
what that does is it helps prevent the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.820 
what that does is it helps prevent the
any<00:02:42.000> abrasion<00:02:42.600> between<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.290> microphone<00:02:43.560> on

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
any abrasion between the microphone on

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.759 
any abrasion between the microphone on
the<00:02:43.860> clothes<00:02:44.190> from<00:02:44.489> creating<00:02:44.880> any<00:02:45.030> noise<00:02:45.239> so

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
the clothes from creating any noise so

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.259 
the clothes from creating any noise so
again<00:02:46.769> not<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.640> perfect<00:02:47.880> solution<00:02:48.060> because

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
again not the perfect solution because

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.729 
again not the perfect solution because
your<00:02:48.480> actor<00:02:48.690> can't<00:02:48.870> be<00:02:48.989> moving<00:02:49.230> around<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.500> ton

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
your actor can't be moving around a ton

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.930 
your actor can't be moving around a ton
but<00:02:50.989> definitely<00:02:51.989> better<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.650> less<00:02:52.940> costly

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
but definitely better and less costly

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.390 
but definitely better and less costly
than<00:02:54.319> trying<00:02:55.319> to<00:02:55.470> get<00:02:55.620> one<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:55.950> those<00:02:56.010> actual

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
than trying to get one of those actual

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.900 
than trying to get one of those actual
blimp<00:02:56.760> covers<00:02:57.239> or<00:02:57.480> your<00:02:57.840> shotgun<00:02:58.470> leg<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:59.040> hope

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
blimp covers or your shotgun leg so hope

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.130 
blimp covers or your shotgun leg so hope
you<00:03:00.030> found<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.300> helpful<00:03:00.390> thanks<00:03:01.019> for

you found that helpful thanks for

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.570 
you found that helpful thanks for
