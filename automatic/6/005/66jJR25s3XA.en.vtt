the moment and that was you know a

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.770 
the moment and that was you know a
testament<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.820> screenwriting<00:02:58.300> and<00:02:58.570> to

testament to the screenwriting and to

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.199 
testament to the screenwriting and to
the<00:02:59.590> two<00:02:59.739> performances<00:03:00.160> which<00:03:00.519> is<00:03:00.670> what<00:03:00.850> this

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
the two performances which is what this

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:20.880 
the two performances which is what this
whole<00:03:01.390> movie<00:03:01.690> is<00:03:17.970> you're<00:03:18.970> just<00:03:19.150> tired<00:03:19.890> it's

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
whole movie is you're just tired it's

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.319 
whole movie is you're just tired it's
gonna<00:03:21.010> be<00:03:21.190> a<00:03:21.220> lot<00:03:21.430> easier<00:03:21.610> once<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.180> get

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
gonna be a lot easier once you get

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.630 
gonna be a lot easier once you get
stronger<00:03:22.630> I'm<00:03:23.530> not<00:03:23.709> getting<00:03:24.040> stronger

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
stronger I'm not getting stronger

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.840 
stronger I'm not getting stronger
I<00:03:25.920> think<00:03:26.920> people<00:03:27.040> give<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.489> other<00:03:27.640> reason

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
I think people give the other reason

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.979 
I think people give the other reason
like<00:03:27.970> a<00:03:28.030> hard<00:03:28.180> time<00:03:28.329> because<00:03:28.690> she's<00:03:28.810> always

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
like a hard time because she's always

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.600 
like a hard time because she's always
going<00:03:29.200> after<00:03:29.350> these<00:03:29.530> Oscar<00:03:29.890> bait<00:03:30.010> roles<00:03:30.280> but

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
going after these Oscar bait roles but

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.210 
going after these Oscar bait roles but
she's<00:03:31.150> so<00:03:31.329> good<00:03:31.540> at<00:03:31.660> them<00:03:31.840> she<00:03:32.440> never<00:03:32.829> seems<00:03:33.130> to

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
she's so good at them she never seems to

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.340 
she's so good at them she never seems to
be<00:03:33.310> acting<00:03:33.880> she's<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:34.780> know<00:03:34.840> if<00:03:35.049> this<00:03:35.200> is<00:03:35.320> the

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
be acting she's you know if this is the

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.720 
be acting she's you know if this is the
fearless<00:03:35.590> performance<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.400> think<00:03:36.430> it's

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
fearless performance and I think it's

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.699 
fearless performance and I think it's
very<00:03:36.790> technical<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.600> she<00:03:38.170> does<00:03:38.320> such<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.500> good

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
very technical and she does such a good

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.170 
very technical and she does such a good
job<00:03:38.769> that<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:39.130> like<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.549> see<00:03:39.700> her<00:03:39.850> do<00:03:40.000> these

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
job that I like to see her do these
