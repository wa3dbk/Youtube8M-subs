00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
score streaks I try to use things that

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.470 
score streaks I try to use things that
are<00:03:45.840> easier<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.170> get<00:03:46.350> because<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:48.180> don't<00:03:48.330> get

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
are easier to get because you don't get

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.600 
are easier to get because you don't get
mad<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:48.930> like<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.709> said<00:03:49.769> they're<00:03:50.070> easy<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.430> get

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
so you feel like you're actually doing

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.350 
so you feel like you're actually doing
good<00:03:51.989> even<00:03:52.860> just<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.370> know<00:03:53.489> using<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:53.910> UAV

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360

use<00:03:59.760> a<00:04:00.030> lot<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:00.209> time<00:04:00.510> because<00:04:00.720> one<00:04:01.200> UAV<00:04:01.620> is

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
use a lot of time because one UAV is

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.680 
use a lot of time because one UAV is
very<00:04:02.010> easy<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.250> get<00:04:02.489> and<00:04:02.640> then<00:04:03.239> once<00:04:03.480> you<00:04:03.570> get

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
very easy to get and then once you get

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.449 
very easy to get and then once you get
your<00:04:03.750> lightning<00:04:03.930> strike<00:04:04.350> you<00:04:04.950> most<00:04:05.190> likely

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
your lightning strike you most likely

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.539 
your lightning strike you most likely
got<00:04:05.760> your<00:04:06.209> hellstorm<00:04:06.900> missile<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.799> it's<00:04:08.400> also

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
got your hellstorm missile and it's also

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:09.860 
got your hellstorm missile and it's also
pretty<00:04:08.760> good<00:04:08.880> in<00:04:09.030> groundwater<00:04:09.299> say<00:04:09.750> if<00:04:09.810> you

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
pretty good in groundwater say if you

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.440 
pretty good in groundwater say if you
use<00:04:10.110> your<00:04:10.230> lightning<00:04:10.350> strike<00:04:10.739> and<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.820> kill<00:04:12.150> a

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
use your lightning strike and you kill a

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.420 
use your lightning strike and you kill a
majority<00:04:13.170> of<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.260> team<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:13.769> then<00:04:14.130> quickly

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
majority of the team and then quickly

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.159 
majority of the team and then quickly
call<00:04:14.730> in<00:04:14.820> your<00:04:14.910> hellstorm<00:04:15.239> missile<00:04:15.269> you'll

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
call in your hellstorm missile you'll

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.140 
call in your hellstorm missile you'll
then<00:04:16.260> kill<00:04:16.709> those<00:04:16.859> same<00:04:17.160> people<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.820> you're

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
then kill those same people that you're

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.729 
then kill those same people that you're
just<00:04:18.390> killed<00:04:18.720> with<00:04:18.989> your<00:04:19.109> lightning<00:04:19.320> strikes

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
just killed with your lightning strikes

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.250 
just killed with your lightning strikes
so<00:04:19.979> it's<00:04:20.609> pretty<00:04:20.880> effective<00:04:20.970> combo<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:22.049> I

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
so it's pretty effective combo and I

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.770 
so it's pretty effective combo and I
don't<00:04:22.500> recommend<00:04:22.919> that<00:04:23.240> you<00:04:24.240> guys<00:04:24.390> can<00:04:24.570> count

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
don't recommend that you guys can count

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.650 
don't recommend that you guys can count
below<00:04:25.020> saying<00:04:25.919> whether<00:04:26.160> or<00:04:26.370> not<00:04:26.490> you<00:04:26.669> think<00:04:26.700> hi

below saying whether or not you think hi
score<00:04:27.840> streaks<00:04:28.080> are<00:04:28.170> worth<00:04:28.260> getting<00:04:28.560> because

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
score streaks are worth getting because

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.680 
score streaks are worth getting because
most<00:04:29.100> of<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.280> time<00:04:29.460> high<00:04:30.060> score<00:04:30.420> streaks

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
most of the time high score streaks

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.360 
most of the time high score streaks
don't<00:04:30.870> even<00:04:31.020> get<00:04:31.140> the<00:04:31.650> same<00:04:31.920> amount<00:04:31.950> of<00:04:32.190> kills

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
don't even get the same amount of kills

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.990 
don't even get the same amount of kills
or<00:04:32.790> more<00:04:33.180> kills<00:04:33.480> than<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.870> lower<00:04:34.050> ones<00:04:34.260> do

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
or more kills than the lower ones do

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.250 
or more kills than the lower ones do
sometimes<00:04:36.000> I'll<00:04:36.150> call<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.450> k-9<00:04:36.600> unit<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.200> my

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
sometimes I'll call the k-9 unit and my

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.290 
sometimes I'll call the k-9 unit and my
canine<00:04:37.680> would<00:04:37.860> get<00:04:37.950> like<00:04:38.160> maybe<00:04:38.610> five<00:04:38.910> kills

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
canine would get like maybe five kills

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.600 
canine would get like maybe five kills
and<00:04:39.990> that's<00:04:40.140> it<00:04:40.380> just<00:04:40.860> because<00:04:41.160> enemy<00:04:41.460> team

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
and that's it just because enemy team

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.490 
and that's it just because enemy team
will<00:04:41.730> camp<00:04:41.940> in<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.150> building<00:04:42.480> and<00:04:42.630> just<00:04:43.320> wait

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
will camp in the building and just wait

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.260 
will camp in the building and just wait
till<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.740> goes<00:04:43.830> away<00:04:43.890> the<00:04:44.730> same<00:04:45.000> thing<00:04:45.030> with

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
till it goes away the same thing with

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.240 
till it goes away the same thing with
the<00:04:45.300> swarm<00:04:45.690> I<00:04:45.930> don't<00:04:46.470> think<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.800> swarm<00:04:47.100> is

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
the swarm I don't think the swarm is

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.770 
the swarm I don't think the swarm is
worth<00:04:47.430> using<00:04:47.700> unless<00:04:48.180> you're<00:04:48.330> playing<00:04:48.450> ground

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
worth using unless you're playing ground

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.440 
worth using unless you're playing ground
war<00:04:48.840> on<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:49.200> open<00:04:49.500> map<00:04:49.650> otherwise<00:04:50.610> it's<00:04:51.300> not

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
war on the open map otherwise it's not

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.750 
war on the open map otherwise it's not
worth<00:04:51.570> it<00:04:51.870> because<00:04:52.190> most<00:04:53.190> maps<00:04:53.460> have

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
worth it because most maps have

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.900 
worth it because most maps have
buildings<00:04:54.720> which<00:04:54.960> grown<00:04:55.230> into<00:04:55.500> and<00:04:55.770> the<00:04:56.730> other

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
buildings which grown into and the other

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.090 
buildings which grown into and the other
time<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.840> enemy<00:04:58.080> team<00:04:58.260> noma<00:04:58.560> just<00:04:58.740> backs<00:04:58.920> out

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
time the enemy team noma just backs out

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.230 
time the enemy team noma just backs out
because<00:04:59.430> they<00:04:59.520> don't<00:04:59.640> want<00:04:59.760> to<00:04:59.820> deal<00:04:59.970> with<00:05:00.000> it

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
because they don't want to deal with it

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.330 
because they don't want to deal with it
so<00:05:00.540> I<00:05:00.780> don't<00:05:01.380> think<00:05:01.620> it's<00:05:01.710> worth<00:05:01.830> using<00:05:02.010> it's

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
so I don't think it's worth using it's

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.520 
so I don't think it's worth using it's
not<00:05:02.460> worth<00:05:02.700> how<00:05:03.330> hard<00:05:03.630> it<00:05:03.780> is<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:03.990> get<00:05:04.140> it's<00:05:04.350> not

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
not worth how hard it is to get it's not

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.770 
not worth how hard it is to get it's not
worth<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:04.830> frustration<00:05:05.240> sometimes<00:05:06.240> it<00:05:06.690> is

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
worth the frustration sometimes it is

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.010 
worth the frustration sometimes it is
get<00:05:07.160> but<00:05:08.160> who<00:05:08.280> knows<00:05:08.460> I'm<00:05:09.180> sure<00:05:09.600> a<00:05:09.630> lot<00:05:09.840> of<00:05:09.900> you

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
get but who knows I'm sure a lot of you

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.390 
get but who knows I'm sure a lot of you
guys<00:05:10.050> are<00:05:10.230> better<00:05:10.380> than<00:05:10.440> me<00:05:10.650> and<00:05:10.860> have<00:05:11.280> no

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
before black ops 2 has always been a

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.090 
before black ops 2 has always been a
challenge<00:05:15.780> for<00:05:16.230> me<00:05:16.320> I<00:05:16.350> don't<00:05:16.560> know<00:05:16.620> why<00:05:16.800> ever

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
challenge for me I don't know why ever

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.650 
challenge for me I don't know why ever
since<00:05:17.400> it<00:05:17.520> came<00:05:17.550> out<00:05:17.730> it's<00:05:18.090> always<00:05:18.270> been<00:05:18.390> so

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
since it came out it's always been so

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.900 
since it came out it's always been so
tough<00:05:18.930> for<00:05:19.170> me<00:05:19.680> to<00:05:19.830> post<00:05:20.040> good<00:05:20.490> game<00:05:20.670> plays

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
tough for me to post good game plays

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.970 
tough for me to post good game plays
because<00:05:21.120> it's<00:05:21.510> so<00:05:21.690> hard<00:05:21.960> to<00:05:22.170> get<00:05:22.560> them<00:05:22.740> and

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
because it's so hard to get them and

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.190 
because it's so hard to get them and
most<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.760> time<00:05:23.910> like<00:05:24.090> I<00:05:24.180> said<00:05:24.450> I<00:05:24.480> play<00:05:24.720> solo

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
most the time like I said I play solo

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.590 
most the time like I said I play solo
and<00:05:25.440> I<00:05:25.860> end<00:05:26.040> up<00:05:26.130> facing<00:05:26.400> full<00:05:26.880> teams<00:05:27.210> which

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
and I end up facing full teams which

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.810 
and I end up facing full teams which
which<00:05:28.080> makes<00:05:28.290> it<00:05:28.380> even<00:05:28.470> worse<00:05:28.860> and<00:05:29.340> more<00:05:29.520> of<00:05:29.760> a

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
which makes it even worse and more of a

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.840 
which makes it even worse and more of a
challenge<00:05:30.050> and<00:05:31.050> another<00:05:31.500> thing<00:05:31.650> is<00:05:31.890> i<00:05:32.100> think

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
challenge and another thing is i think

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.670 
challenge and another thing is i think

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
sure before the game came out I heard

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.570 
sure before the game came out I heard
that<00:05:36.300> you<00:05:36.570> faced<00:05:37.380> people<00:05:37.890> that<00:05:38.130> are<00:05:38.250> similar

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
that you faced people that are similar

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.000 
that you faced people that are similar
to<00:05:38.700> your<00:05:38.940> skill<00:05:39.300> level<00:05:39.330> so<00:05:40.320> all<00:05:40.620> the<00:05:40.710> people<00:05:40.950> I

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
to your skill level so all the people I

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.370 
to your skill level so all the people I
met<00:05:41.040> up<00:05:41.190> with<00:05:41.400> I<00:05:41.900> believe<00:05:42.900> or<00:05:43.020> at<00:05:43.080> least<00:05:43.200> this

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
met up with I believe or at least this

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.320 
met up with I believe or at least this
is<00:05:43.530> what<00:05:43.560> I<00:05:43.680> heard<00:05:43.980> will<00:05:44.610> be<00:05:44.730> similar<00:05:45.090> to<00:05:45.120> my

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
is what I heard will be similar to my

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.120 
is what I heard will be similar to my
skill<00:05:45.660> level<00:05:45.690> to<00:05:46.110> my<00:05:46.260> score<00:05:46.620> per<00:05:46.860> minute

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
skill level to my score per minute

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.760 
skill level to my score per minute
that's<00:05:47.730> why<00:05:47.940> people<00:05:48.150> sometimes<00:05:48.990> they<00:05:49.320> do<00:05:49.380> that

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
that's why people sometimes they do that

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.220 
that's why people sometimes they do that
um<00:05:49.980> reverse<00:05:50.910> boosting<00:05:51.450> is<00:05:51.600> where<00:05:51.780> they<00:05:51.930> kill

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
um reverse boosting is where they kill

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.440 
um reverse boosting is where they kill
themselves<00:05:52.350> and<00:05:52.890> go<00:05:53.490> for<00:05:53.730> those<00:05:53.820> low<00:05:54.060> katie's

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
themselves and go for those low katie's

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.710 
themselves and go for those low katie's
on<00:05:54.630> purpose<00:05:55.020> joseline<00:05:55.980> match<00:05:56.250> up<00:05:56.490> with<00:05:56.940> noobs

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
on purpose joseline match up with noobs

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.960 
on purpose joseline match up with noobs
and<00:05:58.140> they<00:05:58.919> can<00:05:59.100> then<00:05:59.250> get<00:05:59.430> their<00:05:59.610> score

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
and they can then get their score

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.909 
and they can then get their score
streaks<00:06:00.270> and<00:06:00.480> they're<00:06:01.140> amazing<00:06:01.500> game<00:06:01.650> plays

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
streaks and they're amazing game plays

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.190 
streaks and they're amazing game plays
which<00:06:02.460> I<00:06:02.700> don't<00:06:02.760> even<00:06:03.030> think<00:06:03.240> is<00:06:03.570> it's

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
which I don't even think is it's

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.290 
which I don't even think is it's
pointless<00:06:04.560> really<00:06:04.890> because<00:06:05.250> if<00:06:06.060> you're

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
pointless really because if you're

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.510 
pointless really because if you're
facing<00:06:06.540> noobs<00:06:06.930> you<00:06:07.830> won't<00:06:08.040> be<00:06:08.130> getting<00:06:08.250> better

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
facing noobs you won't be getting better

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.430 
facing noobs you won't be getting better
and<00:06:08.820> then<00:06:09.270> as<00:06:09.510> soon<00:06:09.660> as<00:06:09.810> your<00:06:09.900> facing<00:06:10.110> noobs

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
and then as soon as your facing noobs

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.650 
and then as soon as your facing noobs
and<00:06:10.500> switch<00:06:10.800> over<00:06:10.950> to<00:06:11.100> good<00:06:11.700> people<00:06:12.090> you'll

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 
and switch over to good people you'll

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.850 
and switch over to good people you'll
just<00:06:12.810> go<00:06:12.930> back<00:06:13.110> to<00:06:13.140> because<00:06:13.320> you're<00:06:13.560> used<00:06:13.740> to

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
just go back to because you're used to

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.710 
just go back to because you're used to
people<00:06:13.980> that<00:06:14.220> don't<00:06:14.400> even<00:06:14.550> react<00:06:14.820> like<00:06:15.390> I<00:06:15.450> said
