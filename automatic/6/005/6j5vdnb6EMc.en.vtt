00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
not a bad thing it's it's actually quite

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.750 
not a bad thing it's it's actually quite
nice<00:01:00.180> but<00:01:00.510> I'm<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.780> little<00:01:01.469> stunned<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.219> it's

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
nice but I'm a little stunned that it's

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.430 
nice but I'm a little stunned that it's
flowering<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.329> its<00:01:03.480> own<00:01:03.660> without<00:01:03.840> having<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
flowering on its own without having the

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.800 
flowering on its own without having the
dormancy<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:07.009> yeah<00:01:08.009> it's<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.729> small<00:01:09.360> victory<00:01:09.570> I

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
dormancy so yeah it's a small victory I

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.090 
dormancy so yeah it's a small victory I
guess<00:01:10.280> let's<00:01:11.280> see<00:01:11.430> what's<00:01:11.640> under<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.509> oh<00:01:13.100> no

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
guess let's see what's under here oh no

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.100 
guess let's see what's under here oh no
it's<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.360> more<00:01:15.540> leaves<00:01:15.780> down

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
it's just it's just more leaves down

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.200 
it's just it's just more leaves down
there<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.500> thought<00:01:16.979> maybe<00:01:17.060> there's<00:01:18.060> another

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210
