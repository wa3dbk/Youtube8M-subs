00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
that means is we're not going to use the

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.600 
that means is we're not going to use the
plectrum<00:01:24.930> today<00:01:25.409> we're<00:01:26.040> going<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.220> use<00:01:26.369> some

plucking<00:03:45.160> those<00:03:45.280> strings<00:03:45.580> again<00:03:45.910> four<00:03:46.270> three

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
plucking those strings again four three

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.590 
plucking those strings again four three
two<00:03:46.870> one

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.260 

okay<00:03:50.350> very<00:03:50.560> good<00:03:51.100> now<00:03:51.370> once<00:03:51.640> you've<00:03:51.790> done<00:03:52.030> that

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
okay very good now once you've done that

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.030 
okay very good now once you've done that
I<00:03:52.480> want<00:03:52.660> you<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.840> go<00:03:53.050> back<00:03:53.260> to<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.590> second

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
I want you to go back to the second

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.210 
I want you to go back to the second
string<00:03:54.310> with<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.730> middle<00:03:55.000> finger<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:56.650> then

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
string with the middle finger and then

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.510 
string with the middle finger and then
the<00:03:57.370> third<00:03:57.610> string<00:03:58.030> with<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.540> first<00:03:58.570> finger

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
the third string with the first finger

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.280 
the third string with the first finger
so<00:04:00.520> if<00:04:00.760> we<00:04:00.910> join<00:04:01.120> those<00:04:01.360> notes<00:04:01.630> on<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.960> end<00:04:02.080> it

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
so if we join those notes on the end it

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.170 
so if we join those notes on the end it
should<00:04:02.470> sound<00:04:02.650> like<00:04:02.830> this

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.030 

okay<00:04:08.180> and<00:04:08.630> what<00:04:08.810> happens<00:04:09.170> is<00:04:09.350> you<00:04:09.500> can<00:04:09.650> repeat

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
okay and what happens is you can repeat

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.890 
okay and what happens is you can repeat
that<00:04:10.070> over<00:04:10.490> and<00:04:10.760> over<00:04:10.910> again<00:04:11.180> and<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:11.660> joins

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
that over and over again and it joins

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:22.510 
that over and over again and it joins
together<00:04:12.200> perfectly<00:04:12.920> like<00:04:13.190> this

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.670 

okay<00:04:23.419> and<00:04:23.629> you<00:04:23.720> can<00:04:23.840> see<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.199> that<00:04:24.349> sounds

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
okay and you can see that that sounds

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.430 
okay and you can see that that sounds
really<00:04:25.069> nice<00:04:25.220> now<00:04:25.879> I<00:04:25.910> suggest<00:04:26.300> you<00:04:26.750> can<00:04:26.930> change

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
really nice now I suggest you can change

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.890 
really nice now I suggest you can change
the<00:04:27.680> different<00:04:28.039> cords<00:04:28.430> for<00:04:29.300> example<00:04:29.720> if<00:04:29.780> we

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
the different cords for example if we

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.540 
the different cords for example if we
went<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.199> the<00:04:30.289> G<00:04:30.470> chord<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:31.069> of<00:04:31.220> course<00:04:31.430> you

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
went to the G chord and of course you

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.040 
went to the G chord and of course you
already<00:04:31.669> know<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.120> G<00:04:32.270> chord<00:04:32.509> because<00:04:32.750> we

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
already know the G chord because we

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.330 
already know the G chord because we
learned<00:04:33.259> that<00:04:33.440> in<00:04:33.620> one<00:04:33.740> of<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:33.889> previous

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
learned that in one of the previous

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.629 
learned that in one of the previous
segments<00:04:34.819> but<00:04:35.599> just<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:35.990> refresh<00:04:36.289> your<00:04:36.409> memory

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
segments but just to refresh your memory

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.770 
segments but just to refresh your memory
middle<00:04:37.639> finger<00:04:37.940> on<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.090> sixth<00:04:38.539> string<00:04:38.659> at

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
on the second string at fret three

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.200 
on the second string at fret three
little<00:04:45.949> finger<00:04:46.310> on<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:46.550> first<00:04:46.759> string<00:04:46.849> at

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
little finger on the first string at

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.390 
little finger on the first string at
fret<00:04:47.240> three<00:04:47.720> okay<00:04:48.229> you<00:04:48.620> can<00:04:48.770> pause<00:04:48.949> the<00:04:49.099> video

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
fret three okay you can pause the video

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.100 
fret three okay you can pause the video
if<00:04:49.550> you<00:04:49.610> just<00:04:49.819> need<00:04:49.970> to<00:04:50.120> check<00:04:50.360> that<00:04:50.389> now

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
if you just need to check that now

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.320 
if you just need to check that now
what's<00:04:51.409> going<00:04:51.620> to<00:04:51.650> happen<00:04:52.069> is<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.729> thumb<00:04:53.090> is

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
what's going to happen is the thumb is

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.640 
what's going to happen is the thumb is
now<00:04:53.479> going<00:04:53.659> to<00:04:53.750> pluck<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.080> sixth<00:04:54.409> string

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
now going to pluck the sixth string

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.070 
now going to pluck the sixth string
because<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:55.729> sum<00:04:55.940> always<00:04:56.270> plucks<00:04:56.539> a<00:04:56.720> root<00:04:56.900> no

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
because the sum always plucks a root no

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.110 
because the sum always plucks a root no
of<00:04:57.259> the<00:04:57.380> chord<00:04:57.650> when<00:04:58.069> we<00:04:58.220> were<00:04:58.340> on<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.639> D<00:04:58.819> the

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
of the chord when we were on the D the

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.059 
of the chord when we were on the D the
root<00:04:59.300> no<00:04:59.509> was<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.139> fourth<00:05:00.380> string<00:05:00.650> but<00:05:00.889> now

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:01.069 
root no was the fourth string but now

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:03.040 
root no was the fourth string but now
we're<00:05:01.250> on<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:01.460> G<00:05:01.699> the<00:05:02.300> root<00:05:02.479> note<00:05:02.690> is<00:05:02.870> the

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
we're on the G the root note is the

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.659 
we're on the G the root note is the
sixth<00:05:03.319> string<00:05:03.590> okay<00:05:04.069> I<00:05:04.099> hope<00:05:04.340> that<00:05:04.520> makes

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
sixth string okay I hope that makes

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.029 
sixth string okay I hope that makes
sense<00:05:05.000> but<00:05:05.659> these<00:05:05.870> three<00:05:06.139> fingers<00:05:06.590> are<00:05:06.740> still

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
sense but these three fingers are still

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:08.409 
sense but these three fingers are still
going<00:05:07.310> to<00:05:07.370> be<00:05:07.490> on<00:05:07.610> the<00:05:07.669> same<00:05:07.880> strings<00:05:08.240> as

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
going to be on the same strings as

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.450 
going to be on the same strings as
before<00:05:08.810> the<00:05:09.020> third<00:05:09.259> string<00:05:09.590> second<00:05:10.430> string

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
before the third string second string

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.059 
before the third string second string
and<00:05:10.819> first<00:05:11.180> string<00:05:11.479> so<00:05:12.080> when<00:05:12.319> we<00:05:12.440> apply<00:05:12.560> this

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:13.069 
and first string so when we apply this

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:21.159 
and first string so when we apply this
picking<00:05:13.460> pattern<00:05:13.819> it'll<00:05:14.090> sound<00:05:14.270> like<00:05:14.389> this

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.399 

right<00:05:21.949> so<00:05:22.580> what<00:05:22.729> I<00:05:22.759> suggest<00:05:22.909> you<00:05:23.240> do<00:05:23.449> is<00:05:23.689> to<00:05:23.960> do

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 
right so what I suggest you do is to do

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.499 
right so what I suggest you do is to do
that<00:05:24.590> picking<00:05:24.979> pattern<00:05:25.370> twice<00:05:25.610> on<00:05:25.879> the<00:05:25.999> D<00:05:26.180> and

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:26.509 
that picking pattern twice on the D and

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.719 
that picking pattern twice on the D and
then<00:05:27.080> twice<00:05:27.319> on<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:27.650> G<00:05:27.830> so<00:05:28.279> it<00:05:28.370> should<00:05:28.520> sound

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
then twice on the G so it should sound

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.650 
then twice on the G so it should sound
like<00:05:28.819> this

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.520 

you

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:49.399 

and<00:05:38.980> then<00:05:39.130> you<00:05:39.250> can<00:05:39.430> do<00:05:39.550> it<00:05:39.670> again

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.260 

Oh

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
Oh

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.720 
Oh
okay<00:05:51.990> I<00:05:52.020> think<00:05:52.290> you<00:05:52.560> get<00:05:52.770> the<00:05:52.860> idea<00:05:52.920> now<00:05:53.490> I

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
okay I think you get the idea now I

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.120 
okay I think you get the idea now I
suggest<00:05:54.150> you<00:05:54.450> practice<00:05:55.320> that<00:05:55.560> with<00:05:55.890> the<00:05:56.010> other

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
suggest you practice that with the other

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.770 
suggest you practice that with the other
cords<00:05:56.460> you<00:05:56.520> know<00:05:56.640> as<00:05:56.790> well<00:05:56.940> like<00:05:57.120> the<00:05:57.240> E<00:05:57.450> and

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
cords you know as well like the E and
