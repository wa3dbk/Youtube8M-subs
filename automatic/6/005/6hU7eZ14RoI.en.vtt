00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.260
 It's the people today. I'll show you. 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.100
 here is a problem that is happening 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.210
 with screens is the second line of the iphone 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.040
 4 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.439
 The proximity sensor here is not 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.300
 running after switching screen 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.529
 So I'll show you what's 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.020
 going on that I'll make a call 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:31.329
 the moment you step into the 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.329
 hand on the screen does not turn off the sensor 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.280
 I found a problem that is in the case of 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.050
 earth on top that the sensor has a 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:53.149
 partition on the original screen is right here tv 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:56.920
 on the second screen I no longer have I 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.920
 I made a solution and I'll show you 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.879
 I'm going to solve a problem today at 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:08.750
 iphone that is happening with some 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:10.460
 screens I'm playing in the case of 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:20.510
 original iphone screens 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:23.690
 when it comes a 3rd partition the original on 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.640
 case the generic screen when you 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.450
 purchase on the open market or in other 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.190
 sites no longer have this part what I did 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.420
 the sensor is not working . 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.440
 proximity and when you are going to 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.350
 Link 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.890
 hence it is not erasing the light of the earth 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:44.480
 I did the following I took a piece 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:51.190
 insulating tape and put a 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.190
 partition 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.520
 there's got to be the division more or less 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.520
 the way it is here 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.190
 or you can do so too 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:18.930
 can do so, too, if you do 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:24.000
 that way I'll say that you're going 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:31.590
 501 phonique, you 'll put it there 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:39.079
 It's not even though I'm going to put it to 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:39.079
 you solve it the same way 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:58.000
 the case saying what I did the scene 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.360
 they will catch and they will put the right thing in the air 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.209
 keep it that way 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:21.440
 there just have to know there รณ there and closes the 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:25.819
 iphone just closing the screen I'm going 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.660
 finish here to close the 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.430
 iphone 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.079
 then I'll do a test for you will 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.760
 show in the video how it works because 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.769
 phone proximity sensor not 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.049
 it's working 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:39.620
 it is not activating this way 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:50.450
 tape that works and this way here 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:56.959
 also the only adjustment is to leave it in position 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:04:00.130
 who is touching the image that is going 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:03.200
 to work will only operate normally 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.760
 I'm going to take the measure of my little sister and I'm going 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.650
 put in the video description for who 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.109
 want to do another with a problem in the 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.799
 corinthians got to go go leaves 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:16.160
 I 'm already beginning to be safe. 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:18.579
 will of the device a screen cache in the 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.579
 place 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:31.440
 one place the motherboard and the rest 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.780
 of parts separately 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.099
 I'm just finished mounting the iphone alone 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.319
 lacked bring here I will make a 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:47.120
 you to see that the sensor is 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:47.120
 running live 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:05.840
 on August 20 while not going 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:07.669
 logical but put the foot in the 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.820
 when you put your cell phone in the 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:17.419
 ear it is to conserve battery 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:19.280
 energy in the case and also prevent 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.660
 slope some buttons are present here 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:28.370
 to lean on the platform 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:31.600
 the screen will look gray trifle taken out is 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.520
 just put there who deletes the normal 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.320
 procedure is easy, I'll leave the 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:42.740
 footage that was placed on the 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:46.729
 the floor of the video and that was also 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:49.039
 made very simple and works normal 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.050
 usually happens with the screens 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:54.020
 are generic in the case after you 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.940
 broke the iphone official comes 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.599
 then you change it will probably go 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:02.660
 if this happens, just follow 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:07.030
 the good video that works out is who 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.810
 liked the video is unmik share 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:12.280
 help channel 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.280
 Thanks and until the next video
