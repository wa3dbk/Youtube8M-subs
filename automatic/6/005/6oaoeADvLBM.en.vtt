page so for example here I could put you
know<00:02:39.420> one<00:02:40.200> two<00:02:40.470> three<00:02:41.070> real<00:02:42.030> estate<00:02:42.680> that's

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
know one two three real estate that's

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.830 
know one two three real estate that's
not<00:02:44.280> my<00:02:44.550> site<00:02:44.910> or<00:02:45.060> anything<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.420> just<00:02:45.450> made<00:02:45.810> that

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
not my site or anything I just made that

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.880 
not my site or anything I just made that
up<00:02:46.020> but<00:02:46.170> let's<00:02:46.530> suppose<00:02:46.739> that<00:02:46.980> was<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.640> and

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
up but let's suppose that was it and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.530 
up but let's suppose that was it and
typically<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:50.010> suggest<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.730> open<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:51.180> up<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.450> a

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
typically I suggest you open it up in a

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.560 
typically I suggest you open it up in a
new<00:02:51.720> window<00:02:52.520> just<00:02:53.520> that<00:02:53.760> toggle<00:02:54.239> you've<00:02:54.390> got

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
new window just that toggle you've got

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.479 
new window just that toggle you've got
the<00:02:54.750> option<00:02:54.900> but<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.590> gives<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.280> what's

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
the option but that gives you so what's

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.220 
the option but that gives you so what's
basically<00:02:56.700> we're<00:02:57.209> doing<00:02:57.450> here<00:02:57.660> is<00:02:57.690> we're

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
basically we're doing here is we're

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.020 
basically we're doing here is we're
creating<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:59.070> code<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.520> take<00:02:59.730> that

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
creating the code to take that

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.060 
creating the code to take that
photograph<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.930> when<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.080> prospect<00:03:01.380> clicks<00:03:01.860> on

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
photograph and when a prospect clicks on

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.699 
photograph and when a prospect clicks on
it<00:03:02.100> let's<00:03:02.670> say<00:03:02.910> in<00:03:03.150> craigslist<00:03:03.780> or<00:03:04.020> another

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
it let's say in craigslist or another

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.860 
it let's say in craigslist or another
website<00:03:05.640> they're<00:03:06.239> going<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.420> click<00:03:06.720> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
website they're going to click the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.870 
website they're going to click the
photograph<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.590> be<00:03:07.830> redirected<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.850> your

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
photograph and be redirected to your

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.110 
photograph and be redirected to your
website<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:09.900> in<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:10.680> example<00:03:11.160> it's<00:03:11.459> 123

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
website and in this example it's 123

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.000 
website and in this example it's 123
real<00:03:12.270> estate<00:03:12.630> well<00:03:13.080> let's<00:03:13.290> see<00:03:13.500> what<00:03:13.650> happens

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010
