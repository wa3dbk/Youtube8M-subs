00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
right but he's a player that his overall

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.310 
right but he's a player that his overall
is<00:02:33.440> not<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.800> highest<00:02:34.040> but<00:02:34.489> he<00:02:34.670> is<00:02:34.820> a<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.320> working

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
running around like Livermore and and

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.980 
running around like Livermore and and
Sandro<00:04:50.130> and<00:04:50.160> co<00:04:50.700> lingo<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:51.150> winning<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.780> ball

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
Sandro and co lingo and winning the ball

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.960 
Sandro and co lingo and winning the ball
back<00:04:52.260> he<00:04:52.440> just<00:04:52.470> doesn't<00:04:53.070> do<00:04:53.250> it<00:04:53.280> as<00:04:53.550> much<00:04:53.790> and

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
back he just doesn't do it as much and

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.640 
back he just doesn't do it as much and
he's<00:04:54.060> not<00:04:54.240> really<00:04:54.419> being<00:04:54.690> a<00:04:54.810> playmaker<00:04:55.290> force

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
he's not really being a playmaker force

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.530 
he's not really being a playmaker force
neither<00:04:55.950> so<00:04:56.250> Fellaini<00:04:56.940> is<00:04:57.120> probably<00:04:57.450> the

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
neither so Fellaini is probably the

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.330 
neither so Fellaini is probably the
player<00:04:57.780> that<00:04:57.900> I'm<00:04:58.020> most<00:04:58.260> disappointed<00:04:58.620> with

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340
