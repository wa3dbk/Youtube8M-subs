on the first set screw that was inside

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.910 
on the first set screw that was inside
of<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.719> though<00:00:48.960> busted<00:00:49.440> all<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> pieces

on the come along just to keep it
upright<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.470> had<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.740> thing<00:01:22.979> covered<00:01:23.310> up

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
upright and I had this thing covered up

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.969 
upright and I had this thing covered up
when<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:23.759> had<00:01:23.909> ring<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.450> every<00:01:25.200> day<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.350> blasted

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
when we had ring but every day I blasted

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.649 
when we had ring but every day I blasted
some<00:01:26.250> more<00:01:26.670> penetrance<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.330> it

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
some more penetrance in it

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.260 
some more penetrance in it
got<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> collar<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.890> there<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.850> made<00:01:30.000> this

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
got the collar on there and I made this

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.590 
got the collar on there and I made this
makeshift<00:01:30.900> slide<00:01:31.500> hammer<00:01:32.600> conventional

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
makeshift slide hammer conventional

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.300 
makeshift slide hammer conventional
slide<00:01:33.869> hammer<00:01:34.140> would<00:01:34.439> not<00:01:34.650> work<00:01:35.009> because

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
slide hammer would not work because

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.190 
slide hammer would not work because
there's<00:01:35.850> really<00:01:36.119> nothing<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.509> attach<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.170> to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
there's really nothing to attach it to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.100 
there's really nothing to attach it to
unless<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.890> get<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.310> pretty<00:01:38.939> expensive<00:01:39.329> set<00:01:39.840> so

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
unless you get a pretty expensive set so

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.460 
unless you get a pretty expensive set so
I<00:01:40.380> made<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.479> made<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:42.720> out<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.229> piece<00:01:43.259> of

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
I made this made this out of a piece of

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.789 
I made this made this out of a piece of
galvanized<00:01:44.220> pipe<00:01:44.520> three-quarter<00:01:45.180> inch<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.799> I

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
galvanized pipe three-quarter inch and I

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.679 
galvanized pipe three-quarter inch and I
threaded<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.790> collar<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.270> give<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.540> kind

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
threaded on the collar to give it kind

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.100 
threaded on the collar to give it kind
of<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.930> ramming<00:01:50.450> section<00:01:51.450> there<00:01:51.630> at<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.840> front

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
of a ramming section there at the front

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.350 
of a ramming section there at the front
of<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.560> also<00:01:52.829> made<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.189> short<00:01:53.549> enough<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:54.060> it

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
of it I also made it short enough if it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.810
