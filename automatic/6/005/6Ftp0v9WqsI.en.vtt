00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
kind and make sure it's not like one of

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.729 
kind and make sure it's not like one of
those<00:00:45.450> really<00:00:45.690> cheap<00:00:45.809> business<00:00:46.410> cards<00:00:46.649> like

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
those really cheap business cards like

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.560 
those really cheap business cards like
they're<00:00:46.920> really<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.550> super<00:00:47.969> thin<00:00:48.180> ones<00:00:48.390> but

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
they're really like super thin ones but

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.410 
they're really like super thin ones but
the<00:00:48.780> ones<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.200> kind<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.890> little

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
the ones that kind of have like a little

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.720 
the ones that kind of have like a little
toughness<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:52.280> so<00:00:53.280> then<00:00:53.460> you're<00:00:53.610> gonna

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
toughness to it so then you're gonna

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.090 
toughness to it so then you're gonna
take<00:00:54.030> your<00:00:54.180> business<00:00:54.360> card<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.170> all<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.739> did

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
take your business card and all I did

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.849 
take your business card and all I did
was<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.370> folded<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.180> over<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.620> it

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
was I folded it over like this so it

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.209 
was I folded it over like this so it
looks<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.670> like<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.890> reason

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
looks just like that and then the reason

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.660 
looks just like that and then the reason
why<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:03.260> cut<00:01:04.260> out<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.739> because<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.369> took

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
why this is cut out it's because I took

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.420 
why this is cut out it's because I took
the<00:01:05.850> card<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:07.080> put<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.439> on<00:01:07.590> my<00:01:07.740> eye<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.280> look

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
the card and I put it on my eye and look

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.210 
the card and I put it on my eye and look
it<00:01:08.610> was<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.180> at<00:01:09.360> first<00:01:09.570> actually<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.650> I

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
it was like this at first actually and I

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.030 
it was like this at first actually and I
measured<00:01:11.610> from<00:01:11.820> here<00:01:12.020> to<00:01:13.020> here<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.470> took<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.710> pan

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
measured from here to here I took a pan

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.310 
measured from here to here I took a pan
and<00:01:14.189> put<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> mark<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:14.850> here<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.570> and

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
and put a mark on here like this and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.070 
and put a mark on here like this and
down<00:01:16.880> after<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:17.970> do<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.509> took<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.869> pen

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
down after you do that I took the pen

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.850 
down after you do that I took the pen
and<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.350> add<00:01:19.619> rule<00:01:20.180> like<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.420> half<00:01:21.860> crescent

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
and I add rule like this half crescent

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.160 
and I add rule like this half crescent
moon<00:01:23.009> type<00:01:23.460> shape<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.090> then<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.780> take<00:01:24.990> your

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
moon type shape and then you take your

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.560 
moon type shape and then you take your
scissors<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.650> what<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.250> do<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:26.909> cut

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
scissors and what you do is you just cut

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.230 
scissors and what you do is you just cut
it<00:01:27.720> until<00:01:28.409> where<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.920> looks<00:01:29.130> like<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:30.030> looks

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
it until where it looks like it looks

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.870 
it until where it looks like it looks

do<00:01:59.790> this<00:01:59.939> for<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> roughly<00:02:00.719> 30<00:02:01.170> seconds<00:02:01.920> it

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
do this for a roughly 30 seconds it

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.010 
do this for a roughly 30 seconds it
