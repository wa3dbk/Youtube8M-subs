00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.540
 hello my name is milla jovovich and 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.060
 I work as a manager 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.410
 the bakery man and now i want to 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.570
 like a bit about me in mine 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.800
 tell the village what has moved me to 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.660
 wake up to arrive 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.580
 There was when I was shopping there 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.379
 and the delicious things and me 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.820
 employees have seen that the fun 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.820
 and I wanted that too 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.320
 try it for me personally 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.059
 from the ground so that particularly 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.550
 I've been the worker for so long 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.470
 started doing it and very young and 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.030
 for me already like family is the 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.070
 bakery is different 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.530
 that she is taller one again 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.820
 family atmosphere radiates mine 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.559
 Colleagues are very dear to me 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.270
 Since they have grown very well 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.870
 have taken and take again 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.170
 help 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.270
 A typical everyday life looks like that 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.700
 I do not get up at half past five 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.090
 of course finish halfway at the latest 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.399
 8 8 in the first branch already am and 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.700
 There of course the checklist 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.810
 do it because it's all right afterwards 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.280
 if i talk to the co-workers 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.950
 There are certain topics 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.080
 of course a lot of phone calls in the 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.900
 many followers so I'm currently looking after 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.110
 14 branches of about 90 employees 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.159
 I personally care very much 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:34.280
 a lot with the speaker of the speaker 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.380
 so i run schedules i look 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.399
 me the mentors for me 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.299
 job interviews 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.580
 opposite 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.070
 I usually enjoy this job 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.399
 I have many different characters 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.690
 may know 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.210
 The most important thing I have in this job 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.700
 I learned that I was very much 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.619
 have gotten self-confidence and the 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.850
 get to know people better 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.909
 main features are 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.770
 actually flexibility with stress 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.140
 can handle and honesty 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.759
 I found my job here and with me 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.409
 to be proud of being part of the team 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.269
 I would be happy about the team 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.220
 At the bakery you can welcome 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:13.239
 because without a good team creates itself 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.239
 the man is not good
