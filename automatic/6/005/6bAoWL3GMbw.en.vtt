00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.810 
what you need to extract from a washing
machine<00:00:06.839> before<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:08.069> take<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.370> whole<00:00:08.519> unit

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
machine before you take the whole unit

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.419 
machine before you take the whole unit
to<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.000> scrapyard<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.660> maximize<00:00:10.200> your<00:00:10.559> money

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
to the scrapyard to maximize your money

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.100 
to the scrapyard to maximize your money
that<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.700> can<00:00:11.880> make<00:00:12.030> from<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.540> now

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
that you can make from it now

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.600 
that you can make from it now
washing<00:00:13.559> machines<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.040> best<00:00:14.219> thing<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.400> do

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
washing machines the best thing to do

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.799 
washing machines the best thing to do
with<00:00:14.730> washing<00:00:15.000> machines<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.480> turn<00:00:15.660> them

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
with washing machines is turn them

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.230 
with washing machines is turn them
upside<00:00:15.960> down<00:00:16.279> because<00:00:17.279> nine<00:00:17.760> times<00:00:18.029> out<00:00:18.210> of

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
upside down because nine times out of

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.550 
upside down because nine times out of
ten<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.630> motors<00:00:18.960> are<00:00:19.080> going<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.289> be<00:00:19.380> at<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
ten the motors are going to be at the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.640 
ten the motors are going to be at the
bottom<00:00:20.150> and<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.359> too<00:00:21.420> will<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.810> pump<00:00:22.109> be<00:00:22.410> on

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
bottom and so too will the pump be on

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.990 
bottom and so too will the pump be on
the<00:00:22.920> odd<00:00:23.010> occasion<00:00:23.039> you'll<00:00:23.640> have<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.820> take<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
the odd occasion you'll have to take the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.540 
the odd occasion you'll have to take the
back<00:00:24.210> panel<00:00:24.600> off<00:00:24.689> but<00:00:25.680> it's<00:00:25.859> very<00:00:26.310> quick

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
back panel off but it's very quick

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.130 
back panel off but it's very quick
process<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.300> it's<00:00:27.420> nothing<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.750> be<00:00:27.840> worried

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
process and it's nothing to be worried

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.810 
process and it's nothing to be worried
about<00:00:28.199> now<00:00:30.679> inside<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.740> washing<00:00:32.099> machine<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.759> a

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
about now inside a washing machine is a

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.459 
about now inside a washing machine is a
whole<00:00:33.090> lot<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.360> cable<00:00:33.719> here<00:00:33.930> okay

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
whole lot of cable here okay

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.900 
whole lot of cable here okay
so<00:00:34.620> that's<00:00:34.890> one<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> things<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.760> will

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
so that's one of the things you will

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.639 
so that's one of the things you will
extract<00:00:36.360> from<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:37.010> this<00:00:38.010> here<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.840> pump<00:00:40.170> and

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
extract from it this here is a pump and

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.690 
extract from it this here is a pump and
that<00:00:40.790> is<00:00:41.790> full<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.120> copper<00:00:43.520> now<00:00:44.520> these

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
that is full of copper now these

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.490 
that is full of copper now these
particular<00:00:45.030> pumps<00:00:45.690> are<00:00:45.870> actually<00:00:46.140> very<00:00:46.320> easy

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
particular pumps are actually very easy

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.470 
particular pumps are actually very easy
to<00:00:46.620> take<00:00:46.860> apart<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.610> soon<00:00:47.879> as<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.030> see<00:00:48.210> one<00:00:48.239> of

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
to take apart so soon as you see one of

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.100 
to take apart so soon as you see one of
those<00:00:48.600> grab<00:00:48.960> those<00:00:49.670> now<00:00:50.670> here<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.629> washing

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
those grab those now here is the washing

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.880 
those grab those now here is the washing
machine<00:00:52.469> motor<00:00:53.329> and<00:00:54.350> you<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.500> see<00:00:55.680> all<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
machine motor and you can see all the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.400 
machine motor and you can see all the
copper<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.309> there<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.960> don't<00:00:57.960> know<00:00:58.079> why<00:00:58.289> on

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
copper in there I don't know why on

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.360 
copper in there I don't know why on
earth<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.890> green<00:00:59.219> but<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.120> assume

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
earth that is green but I have to assume

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.370 
earth that is green but I have to assume
it<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.609> copper<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:05.900> would<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> look<00:01:07.229> into

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
it is copper I would have to look into

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.289 
it is copper I would have to look into
that<00:01:07.590> one<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.189> don't<00:01:08.340> really<00:01:08.820> see<00:01:09.030> how<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.210> can

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
that one I don't really see how it can

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.000 
that one I don't really see how it can
be<00:01:09.360> anything<00:01:09.630> else<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.320> once<00:01:10.680> you've<00:01:10.830> got<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
be anything else so once you've got the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.990 
be anything else so once you've got the
copper<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.549> you've<00:01:11.700> got<00:01:11.729> all<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
copper out of that you've got all the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.120 
copper out of that you've got all the
metal<00:01:12.299> here<00:01:12.510> now<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.950> an<00:01:14.040> interesting

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
metal here now this is an interesting

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.490 
metal here now this is an interesting
bit<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.820> board's<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.720> see<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> board<00:01:16.200> grab

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
bit the board's if you see a board grab

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.850 
bit the board's if you see a board grab
it

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.999 
it
because<00:01:17.780> there<00:01:18.780> are<00:01:18.930> always<00:01:19.110> parts<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.860> this

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
because there are always parts of this

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.920 
because there are always parts of this
which<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.580> use<00:01:20.909> now<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.540> notice

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
which you can use now if you can notice

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.270 
which you can use now if you can notice
here<00:01:22.549> there's<00:01:23.549> tiny<00:01:23.759> bit<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.060> copper<00:01:24.330> there<00:01:25.280> an

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
here there's tiny bit of copper there an

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.960 
here there's tiny bit of copper there an
iminium<00:01:26.729> sink<00:01:27.030> there<00:01:28.340> there<00:01:29.340> are<00:01:29.460> other<00:01:29.700> bits

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
iminium sink there there are other bits

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.390 
iminium sink there there are other bits
now<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.509> best<00:01:30.960> bottom<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> transformer

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
now the best bottom is a transformer

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.190 
now the best bottom is a transformer
there<00:01:32.549> as<00:01:32.670> well<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.119> want<00:01:33.240> all<00:01:33.450> those<00:01:33.659> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
there as well so you want all those and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.899 
there as well so you want all those and
you've<00:01:34.680> also<00:01:34.829> got<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.189> aluminium<00:01:36.500> in<00:01:37.500> these

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
you've also got the aluminium in these

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.340 
you've also got the aluminium in these
bits<00:01:38.909> here<00:01:39.240> which<00:01:39.540> do<00:01:39.689> add<00:01:39.840> up<00:01:40.020> as<00:01:40.170> well<00:01:40.320> I

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
bits here which do add up as well I

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.990 
bits here which do add up as well I
haven't<00:01:40.619> separated<00:01:40.890> those<00:01:41.280> yet<00:01:41.490> myself<00:01:41.640> I

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
haven't separated those yet myself I

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.830 
haven't separated those yet myself I
intend<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.299> doing<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:45.450> best<00:01:47.840> circuit

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
intend on doing so the best circuit

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.569 
intend on doing so the best circuit
boards<00:01:49.200> when<00:01:49.470> you're<00:01:49.590> scrapping<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.189> would<00:01:50.369> say

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
boards when you're scrapping I would say

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.730 
boards when you're scrapping I would say
apart<00:01:50.880> from<00:01:50.970> computers<00:01:51.450> as<00:01:51.570> TVs<00:01:51.990> TVs<00:01:52.229> all<00:01:52.560> seem

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
apart from computers as TVs TVs all seem

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.959 
apart from computers as TVs TVs all seem
to<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.890> lot<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.130> copper<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.490> them<00:01:53.869> okay<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.969> get

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
to a lot of copper in them okay so get
