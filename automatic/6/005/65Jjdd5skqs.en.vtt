 this beautiful guitar the peaceful 611 hfm 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.260
 the peaceful series has already been many years 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.230
 the truth is that the year 90 ritz the nerds 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.460
 creator of the famous guitar of 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.580
 well-known artist steven designed based 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.830
 the performance of custom guitars 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.690
 show of the Californian scene already 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.610
 long all these years has gone 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.070
 evolving the peaceful series up 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.930
 give so beautiful units and also 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.670
 finished with very good materials like 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.940
 is the case of these in socia we have 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.629
 today here as specifications tell 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.119
 which has the alder body mast of 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.710
 Maple rosewood fingerboard very well 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.530
 Finished very well finished the frets 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.619
 no type of staggering has 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.750
 locking brouwer headstock does not 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.660
 missing any kind of return to the wing 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.600
 nutty just put the rope and in 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.670
 the very first of the first and back of the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.959
 what is the pegbox the pivot and 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.880
 presses the rope strangles her and does not 

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:28.709
 It takes half a turn even to 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.750
 that the guitar already has its tension and 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:34.490
 correct tuning 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:39.120
 Graphite nut Teflon saddles 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:42.960
 pill care jamba we say duncan only 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.790
 5 others and mort d'un k of 90 selector of 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.830
 rib and blade three positions and 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.840
 push pull switch that what it does is 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.320
 combine this jamba care 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.530
 to single having thus greater fan of 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.560
 possibilities then we will see a 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.020
 of the main benefits of the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.570
 Teflon materials both as the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.800
 graphite bonding sole is to avoid excess 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.570
 of friction so many guitars 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.130
 they are frequently tuned out then what 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.920
 What Teflon does is eliminate that 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.690
 friction and cause a slip 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.690
 for the bending for the vibratos 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.430
 thus maintaining an optimal tuning like this 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.120
 that nothing like you see guitar very 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.430
 pretty the light purple finish very 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.260
 comfortable and ergonomic and then nothing is going to 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.960
 go listen to it 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.500
 i 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.500
 do not 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.629
 and 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.980
 ah 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.650
 Mars 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.650

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.260
 totally versatile is a guitar 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.550
 very plural super comfortable we can 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.790
 get a lot of records with 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.980
 her from warm clean sounds with 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.500
 sounds effects more blues e Ã³s in the a 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.030
 rockers even beyond near the 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.000
