00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:11.929
 toyota corolla automatic x 2009 there 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.049
 This is the best-selling mid-size sedan in the 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.680
 world in its tenth generation produced in the 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.830
 Brazil between 2008 and 2014 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.140
 such as its major Japanese rivals 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.380
 corolla does her homework very well 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.029
 and delivers a great product with a reputation 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.880
 of the best 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:36.310
 may not be the best in some 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:39.290
 but it is above average in all of them 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.320
 I particularly find this model very 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.930
 beautiful with well balanced lines 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.240
 everything is in the right place without any 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.060
 controversial detail to please the 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.630
 majority can not deny that their 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:56.540
 visual was inspired by the 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.750
 mainly from the front to the rear is 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.720
 very similar to the previous generation 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.030
 coming to confuse the less attentive 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.090
 in this intermediate version are 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.320
 present 16-inch wheels with 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.829
 unique arrow design on mirrors 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.259
 and front fog lights a shame 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:21.079
 this generation does not have friezes 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.049
 This makes it difficult to 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:27.649
 to avoid smashing the doors 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:30.170
 dimensions are common to other cars 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:34.549
 of this category with emphasis on 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.039
 width that has great 176 centimeters 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.560
 releasing good lateral space for the 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.689
 occupants 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.069
 another great highlight of the corolla is his 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.210
 mechanical assembly 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:49.939
 the motor has block and aluminum head 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.490
 1.8 liter multi valve head with 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.630
 dual control and intake control 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:00.889
 variable develops a good 136 horses 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.350
 6,000 rpm and 17.5 kg force meter 

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:06.229
 at 4,200 rpm 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.720
 of negative only one flex system 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.090
 market requirement if at least 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.460
 had a higher compression ratio 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.570
 could yield better when fueled 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.620
 With alcohol 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.260
 weighing 1260 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.470
 pounds have good weight / power ratio 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.780
 below 9 kilos and a half for the horse 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.450
 despite not disclosing 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.440
 Toyota is a well-praised item for its 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.200
 owners 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.069
 In addition to the 60-liter tank, 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.829
 model with good autonomy in 2010 won 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.480
 the 2-liter engine option and power 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.030
 bigger is never too much 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.400
 but in my opinion this 1.8 does not 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.159
 disappoints and certainly caters to 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.980
 need of most drivers 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.819
 the automatic gearbox is well rice with 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.370
 bean 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.180
 are four gears with no exchange options 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.209
 manuals 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.109
 some complain they wanted more marches but 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.000
 wants to know 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:03.150
 this one may not be the most modern 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.640
 but it is very robust something positive in 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.900
 model used in addition to being smooth in 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.040
 gear shifts 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.200
 I look great in suspension too. 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.030
 there is nothing modern the courts 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.030
 macpherson systems at the front 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.829
 and torsion axle at the rear are 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.170
 gifts 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.420
 fortunately it was very well calibrated being 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.549
 one of the most commendable points in its 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.379
 driving well absorbs the irregularities 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:36.930
 and does not disappoint a faster play 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:42.720
 already the brakes make nice disco in the 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:46.760
 four wheels with abs and ebd and control 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.760
 of the locks on the key 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.830
 good internal space as you would expect 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.220
 of an average sedan considers the finish 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:01.630
 very good with quality and good parts 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:06.470
 is common in all versions. 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:09.230
 trio electric dual airbag steering with 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.770
 with power adjustments. 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:17.480
 height and depth of computer 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:21.500

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.630
 not steering wheel 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:39.490
 electrically folded rearview mirrors 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.490
 one touch function on the power windows 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:48.620

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.740

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.990
 luggage capacity 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:04.249
 step with the internal access one position 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:07.659
 good to be calibrated and with 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:07.659
 equal to other tires 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:15.130
 the corolla of this generation is a great 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.710
 business the right car for families who 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:20.290

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.510
 internal space and luggage 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.570
 when zero kilometer is a car 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:28.450
 expensive for many with a few years of use 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.490
 it is already possible to have this beautiful toyota for 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:33.310
 a much more attractive price 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.530

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:41.050
 maintenance is not that your parts are 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.990
 cheap but because it is a car 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.600
 construction quality makes it 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.010
 their maintenance intervals are 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.980
 higher than average 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:53.980
 It is not difficult to find models in 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.590
 because the profile of the owners is 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.780
 of careful people who even 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:02.260
 usually pay more for revisions in 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:04.900
 authorized 12 today that do not prove 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.660
 that the reviews are up to date may be 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.560
 expensive to straighten up making them unfeasible 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.920
 purchase 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.620
 the insurance is also within the average with 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.950
