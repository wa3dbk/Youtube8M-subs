00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
like a little bit more so it should be

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.850 
like a little bit more so it should be
pretty<00:01:38.280> close<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> flush<00:01:39.180> with<00:01:39.630> um<00:01:39.990> with<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
pretty close to flush with um with the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.440 
pretty close to flush with um with the
inner<00:01:41.040> ring<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.549> guess<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.820> could<00:01:41.970> say<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.270> is

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
inner ring I guess you could say that is

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.340 
inner ring I guess you could say that is
sitting<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.840> um<00:01:43.909> yeah<00:01:44.909> that's<00:01:45.750> pretty<00:01:45.899> much<00:01:46.079> it

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
sitting in um yeah that's pretty much it

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.649 
sitting in um yeah that's pretty much it
