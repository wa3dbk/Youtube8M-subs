see<00:00:53.190> him<00:00:53.370> shoot<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.789> combination<00:00:54.570> knowing

see him shoot this combination knowing

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.360 
see him shoot this combination knowing
that<00:00:55.170> gives<00:00:55.410> him<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> best<00:00:55.860> chance<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.250> win

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
that gives him the best chance to win

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.180 
that gives him the best chance to win
but<00:00:56.940> playing<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.079> by<00:00:58.260> hitting<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.680> four<00:00:58.949> into

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
but playing it by hitting the four into

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.990
