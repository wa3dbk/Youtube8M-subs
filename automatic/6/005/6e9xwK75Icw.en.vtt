 dj prieto and we are in a news 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.580
 surprising at the moment are rumors but 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.360
 more than one is going to leave with his ass 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.810
 crooked and is that the icaf legends could 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.509
 and I say could because it is not confirmed 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:23.019
 appear on the new xbox one and could 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:25.989
 be presented in this e3 2013 could 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.179
 be one of the big surprises what 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.759
 good that would be presented in this event 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:34.059
 and would be exclusive to the console 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.550
 microsoft is that since Forums 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.070
 neogaf where a lot is filtered 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.800
 information throughout the year and many 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.239
 Sometimes truth has focused on the list 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.250
 with the possible games that 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.949
 would present at the xbox conference 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.050
 one the author of the filtration warns that 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.780
 the sources might not be of total 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.390
 confidence but he himself has added the 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.160
 image that you can see in the link 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.560
 of the description and that has raised 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.930
 some suspicions of that is true 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.370
 the truth is that what games are going to 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.620

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.470

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.910
 description but the news 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.100
 at this time at these hours of the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.720
 late is that the incop legend is 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.670
 enrolled in a list that has been filtered 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.520
 in the neogaf forums where they usually 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.580
 filter truthful information and it could be 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.510
