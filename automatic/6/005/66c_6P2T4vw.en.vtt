and take a closer look at what this

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.910 
and take a closer look at what this
chopper<00:01:27.270> comes<00:01:27.509> with<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:28.560> your<00:01:28.740> main

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
chopper comes with you can get your main

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.920 
chopper comes with you can get your main
board<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.520> has<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.970> camera<00:01:30.270> mounted<00:01:30.750> onto

board that has the camera mounted onto

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.480 
board that has the camera mounted onto
it<00:01:31.170> for<00:01:31.380> power<00:01:31.530> you're<00:01:31.829> going<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:31.979> get<00:01:32.130> two

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
it for power you're going to get two

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.060 
it for power you're going to get two
brushed<00:01:33.240> motors<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.840> you're<00:01:34.619> actually<00:01:34.950> going

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
brushed motors and you're actually going

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.710 
brushed motors and you're actually going
to<00:01:35.159> get<00:01:35.250> individual<00:01:35.850> servos<00:01:36.270> that's<00:01:36.509> cool

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
to get individual servos that's cool

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.300 
to get individual servos that's cool
because<00:01:36.960> if<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.350> damage<00:01:37.590> your<00:01:37.740> servos<00:01:38.189> you

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
because if you damage your servos you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.590 
because if you damage your servos you
don't<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.700> swap<00:01:38.880> out<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> whole<00:01:39.299> board

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
don't have to swap out the whole board

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.380 
don't have to swap out the whole board
you<00:01:40.439> can<00:01:40.619> swap<00:01:40.860> out<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.130> servos<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.790> that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
you can swap out the servos and that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.440 
you can swap out the servos and that
it's<00:01:42.780> actually<00:01:43.259> better<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:44.070> repairs<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.970> for

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
it's actually better for repairs and for

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.910 
it's actually better for repairs and for
response<00:01:45.899> especially<00:01:46.619> if<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.430> damage<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.479> or

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
response especially if you damage it or

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.130 
response especially if you damage it or
crash<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:51.450> ability<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.869> get

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
crash it you have the ability to get

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.289 
crash it you have the ability to get
replacement<00:01:52.680> servos<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.939> enough<00:01:54.090> talk

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
replacement servos so you enough talk

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:03.720 
replacement servos so you enough talk

to<00:03:28.010> have<00:03:28.100> a<00:03:28.130> little<00:03:28.340> bit<00:03:28.490> of<00:03:28.550> lag<00:03:28.820> time

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
to have a little bit of lag time

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.850 
to have a little bit of lag time
especially<00:03:29.570> with<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.720> touchscreen<00:03:30.140> controls

you're<00:03:34.580> controlling<00:03:34.970> it<00:03:35.120> through<00:03:35.180> the

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
you're controlling it through the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
joysticks on the touchscreen but what's

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.570 
joysticks on the touchscreen but what's
cool<00:03:38.660> about<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:39.020> is<00:03:39.140> with<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.890> eye<00:03:39.920> device<00:03:40.400> you

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
cool about it is with the eye device you

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.240 
cool about it is with the eye device you
can<00:03:40.730> actually<00:03:40.970> record<00:03:41.650> video<00:03:42.650> footage<00:03:43.100> and

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
can actually record video footage and

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.550 
can actually record video footage and
you<00:03:43.340> actually<00:03:43.790> can<00:03:44.000> take<00:03:44.030> pictures<00:03:44.750> while<00:03:45.140> the

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
you actually can take pictures while the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.260 
you actually can take pictures while the

pictures and videos save on your iDevice

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.890 
pictures and videos save on your iDevice
so<00:03:49.850> you<00:03:49.940> can<00:03:50.090> view<00:03:50.330> it<00:03:50.480> later
