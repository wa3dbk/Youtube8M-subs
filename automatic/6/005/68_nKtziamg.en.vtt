highest<00:03:25.880> brightness<00:03:26.420> level<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:26.989> we<00:03:27.739> run<00:03:27.980> them

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
highest brightness level and we run them

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.699 
highest brightness level and we run them
at<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.459> full<00:03:28.820> max<00:03:29.330> capacity<00:03:29.660> we're<00:03:30.350> pumping

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
at the full max capacity we're pumping

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.660 
at the full max capacity we're pumping
them<00:03:30.890> we're<00:03:31.040> having<00:03:31.280> them<00:03:31.400> do<00:03:31.580> more<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.269> more

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
them we're having them do more and more

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.470 
them we're having them do more and more
applications<00:03:34.670> that<00:03:34.790> are<00:03:34.820> normally<00:03:35.360> designed
