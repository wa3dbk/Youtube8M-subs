there<00:00:22.020> are<00:00:22.109> three<00:00:22.500> possible<00:00:23.130> answers<00:00:23.400> as<00:00:24.090> to

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
there are three possible answers as to

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.740 
there are three possible answers as to
why<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> kept<00:00:25.640> prematurely<00:00:26.640> dying<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.510> this

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
why I kept prematurely dying in this

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.870 
why I kept prematurely dying in this
game<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.199> obvious<00:00:28.619> answer<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.039> these

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
game the obvious answer is these

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.849 
game the obvious answer is these

prematurely killing me for years another
possibility<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.570> playing<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.690> game<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.079> this
