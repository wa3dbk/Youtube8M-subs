limit<00:01:32.440> it's<00:01:32.680> kind<00:01:32.920> of<00:01:33.010> hard<00:01:33.250> to<00:01:33.340> build<00:01:33.610> a

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
limit it's kind of hard to build a

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.310 
limit it's kind of hard to build a
little<00:01:33.960> because<00:01:34.960> um<00:01:35.500> you<00:01:37.049> know<00:01:38.049> it's<00:01:38.229> like

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
little because um you know it's like

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.830 
little because um you know it's like
tiny<00:01:38.770> well<00:01:39.400> there<00:01:39.580> we<00:01:39.670> go<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:40.360> you<00:01:40.479> can<00:01:40.630> also

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
tiny well there we go and you can also

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.990 
tiny well there we go and you can also
build<00:01:41.170> over<00:01:41.740> which<00:01:41.890> is<00:01:42.100> kind<00:01:42.340> of<00:01:42.400> cool<00:01:42.460> so<00:01:42.880> you

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
build over which is kind of cool so you

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.510 
build over which is kind of cool so you
can<00:01:43.150> make<00:01:43.299> yourself<00:01:43.390> like<00:01:43.830> emerald<00:01:44.830> gates<00:01:45.250> and
