00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.030
 at the world level if gabriel or kiki 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.760
 as you prefer and today we are 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.380
 find in front of andy age pnj so 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.640
 on minecraft for a new 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.100
 fashion presentation lacks actually 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.350
 today the mode is going to be beat 0-2 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.820
 and in fact it is that this mode is doing well 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.130
 simply changed the intelligence 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.559
 artificial NPCs and also their 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.829
 appearance so we'll see that all of 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:34.910
 after 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.120
 so the first thing you notice 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.160
 is that the NPC are now 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.070
 people but humans and not 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.230
 weird stuff 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.450
 I do not have too much to explain that me 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.760
 they are on basic minecraft and they 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.160
 are they appear randomly with 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.020
 armor weapons and so on 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.030
 for example here we have a pnj teuton 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.309
 diam's here we have someone with leather 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.180
 excellent ground and so they are 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.920
 generated with random stuff and the 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.899
 system to buy stuff that is 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.170
 not changed not creating one can 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.860
 always exchange with them so that does not 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.740
 do not change 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.700
 So here we are when 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.650
 even funny to walk in the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.440
 village he notice that there are pnj 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.700
 in iron and pnj with no armor and 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.960
 so it's already that's rather blow 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.210
 so then with this mode we can 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.640
 not find that with the new 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.070
 artificial intelligence of the pnj 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.780
 they will automatically attack the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.690
 naming the zombies names that are going 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.130
 defend 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.990
 so my there the zombie fired by month 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.750
 but look they will defend themselves 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.660
 against the zombie with their ep and their 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.540
 armor so here he defends himself 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.710
 automatically and therefore and in addition to 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.869
 take refuge in this house go 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.360
 hide they will defend themselves and goals and 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.899
 every year says he's who the killer 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.850
 run away shit just that's it 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.140
 then these NPCs can also be located 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.490
 but unfortunately they do not have 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.320
 rhdp their armor so good we can not 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.270
 really reaped the armor of the pnj 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.160
 on the other hand when we kill them 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.229
 general is all the villages in the village 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.450
 will hound you so it's not 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.890
 the most recommended thing to do 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.350
 because they are still a bad year 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.250
 are ten thousand with all their ep here 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.100
 so it's a little war he has 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.530
 now that I killed under the one of 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.720
 their friend a friend of theirs so you have to do 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.870
 blunder on that but does not prevent me find that 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.970
 it's still pretty funny this mode 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.820
 and then that adds up 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.500
 more + rp 1 1 I was wrong then 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.610
 yen very low chances that the NPCs 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.019
 of Europe their armor 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.760
 oh well that's cool because I 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.709
 tested several times and it never drops 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.350
 and so here you have taken to the 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.019
 proof the pnj can drop and a 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.110
 part of their armor if we are enough 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.120
 a long time so you can go 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.030
 look for villages that can add to 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.560
 these classes it can add a little bit of 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.100
 of exploration to find images 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.900
 for this to dominate a population 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.880
 full and became full armor all 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.980
 that all that we see the bank 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.200
 I think it's super cool so the mode 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.819
 these beasts towards jazz and it's pretty much 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.800
 almost everything for this mode which is pretty 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.870
 short fairly simple but still who 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.020
 worth watching 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.100
 so that was all for this mode the 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.600
 fourth time I say it and then 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.980
 here we meet again next time 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.230
 the links are in the description 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.790
 if you are not subscribed subscribe 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.170

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.890
 lots of other stuff too so that's it 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.890
 go ciao
