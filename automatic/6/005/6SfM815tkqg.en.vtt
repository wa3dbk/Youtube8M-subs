00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 so arrived there was another one 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.759
 almost took the world trip for us 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.350
 Berlin is a big city team 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.809
 So pink panther and steven p are the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.160
 not there yet but i'm in there 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.570
 mine berlin now the whole 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.580
 at the same time you have seen of you 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.020
 even there to contact you 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.670
 and then let it sell and let's see 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.119
 how dizzy we really are 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.769
 everything and so you look so if you 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.180
 either make a total spoonful 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.980
 will you try to be in the subway 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.510
 then go or go climbing is 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.070
 It's just the right equipment 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.099
 we all need even that 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.190
 wilde frightened pink panther wins 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.110
 yes , yes, well, that's all there is to it 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.390
 in limits 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.620
 i am honest a bit would be 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.879
 I say a poor one but me too 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.600
 have the same hands in front of the like 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.390
 it with you and which one 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.950
 Climbing experience so far never 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.309
 born so I think I 'll come 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.829
 clear 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.350
 So there will be no problems 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.090
 So burglary can be so from us 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.980
 a tall crane probably sits high up oh 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.899
 ne va plus 63 melt is otherwise 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.250
 actually not that high he is 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.329
 here almost a bit of pill-paw beside 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.129
 I am the managing director of 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.019
 mine berlin oliver hess how high 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.820
 you can climb here maximum so the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.970
 highest exercise is about 16 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.860
 16 meters you is meter deep the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.560
 challenge anyway or no 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.299
 clearly we are not alone here, we 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.920
 have wild cards awarded so again 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.900
 So that means the possibility 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.380
 for subscribers and subscribers hereby 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.640
 climb 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.299
 if he gets a little noise for a while 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.470
 could make it sound behind me 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.030
 much more than they are we are so 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.080
 altogether a group of about 15 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.340
 People and that's what I believe too 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.060
 very good group size around here 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.500
 get through 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.720
 how long does it take then for 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.920
 Thus, the single course was about two 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.360
 You should definitely go for hours 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.829
 time next to an hour you get on it 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.840
 to witness the briefing 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.450
 but average two conditioned 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.369
 hours of time 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.189
 just a little introduction that 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.780
 works the silent movie is quite 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.090
 exactly what you should do but no one 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.560
 says what must be considered spooky 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.560
 According to the deep because decided 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:07.470
 In any case, the patent is not one man 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:09.030
 can not one if not then just 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.380
 Does not sound right 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.260
 then I can fall to the snout 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.370
 do I look forward so that I can 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.370
 life of education is after 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.920
 difficult parcours 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.220
 summer co 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.190
 we are the same in the first pack 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.330
 a bit bumpy wage 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.470
 balance so full of my thing so on 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.319
 best somewhere a dizzy height 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.970
 balance hopping me on charisma land 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:26.430
 but I'm curious how it goes on 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:30.709
 because steve is so awful 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.709
 Slow is totally afraid of heights 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:47.790
 So do not show it is here 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.940
 a bit shaky there would have been 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.940
 children further east 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:02.790
 I've already smelled a bit 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.790
 from finished mountains 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.030
 yes, this fucking camera get what 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.030
 drink 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.890
 No 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.890
 so 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.630
 He must be careful caution 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.800
 but it grows 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.129
 os english king must 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.129
 think 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:24.140
 So it was done over the club 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.140
 probably would have the pope 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.380
 I was surprised 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.720
 his grandparents 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.110
 completely 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.110
 are further 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:37.879
 save affected by the bankruptcy 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:41.779
 in terms of difficulty it is for 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:44.580
 nothing happens every day you should 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:46.720
 maybe I'm busy 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.060
 entrepreneur accelerates 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.220
 I was too fast 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.940
 there 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.940
 that's the main thing 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:02.080
 I have 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:04.689
 In 2000 the whole series was struck two times 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.630
 has then fit already 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:09.400
 leipzig afp 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.620
 or wash summer quarters I have 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.210
 to understand most of the time 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:19.840
 climb the masts 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:22.000
 yes nice pictures 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.990
 relatively broad balancing act between 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.900
 to prevent it from taking 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.009
 So announced 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.480
 not right now 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:29.930
 dollar too 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.930
 six children 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.689
 In any case , they are both 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.019
 seen 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:39.019
 red 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.930
 at the main problem 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.540
 always tastes more stuck 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.620
 is back 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.620
 that's just the way it is 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:50.919
 out 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:56.810
 with mappus on 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.860
 just so thought that stinks points 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.790
 was winner car 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.790
 rudolph 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.030
 also choose 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.740
 so far no witnesses are asked 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.920
 are the biggest items 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.449
 if ever since then every case 

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.289
 fun 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:25.480
 from 6 years 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:27.310
 and when it rains 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.050
 let me say that automated 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.129
 means a stable climate and man 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.900
 sweats 

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:37.259
 that's great 

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:37.259
 they do not have a bit 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:43.620
 next time they go completely 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:48.170
 really high designer and integration 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.170
 important with parasol protect glass 

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:53.200
 so i still have a book most 

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.470
 is is 

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.470
 3
