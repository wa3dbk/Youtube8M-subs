00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
now in this video I want to talk a

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.160 
now in this video I want to talk a
little<00:00:33.600> bit<00:00:33.989> about<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:35.300> swing<00:00:36.300> itself<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.989> on

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
little bit about the swing itself and on

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.350 
little bit about the swing itself and on
the<00:00:37.200> portion<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.890> when<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.579> hit<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> ball<00:00:39.059> and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
the portion of when you hit the ball and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.510 
the portion of when you hit the ball and
mostly<00:00:39.989> when<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.290> finish<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.040> stroke<00:00:41.309> which

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
mostly when you finish the stroke which

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.400 
mostly when you finish the stroke which
is<00:00:41.670> where<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> feel<00:00:42.450> most<00:00:42.809> people<00:00:43.230> make<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
is where I feel most people make the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.150 
is where I feel most people make the
biggest<00:00:43.710> mistakes<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:45.950> learned<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
biggest mistakes so we learned on the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.549 
biggest mistakes so we learned on the
other<00:00:47.280> video<00:00:47.579> how<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.789> prepare<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:49.379> back

use the wrists to do it use your forearm
it's<00:01:42.299> more<00:01:42.659> done<00:01:42.960> an<00:01:43.229> elbow<00:01:43.680> level<00:01:43.950> here<00:01:44.369> than

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
it's more done an elbow level here than

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.920 
it's more done an elbow level here than
at<00:01:45.090> risk<00:01:45.360> level<00:01:46.159> and<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:48.119> finish<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> stroke

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
at risk level and to finish the stroke

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.810 
at risk level and to finish the stroke
correctly<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.619> important<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.369> not<00:01:50.549> go

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
correctly it's important to not go

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.569 
correctly it's important to not go
straight<00:01:51.210> down<00:01:51.509> with<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.130> not<00:01:53.310> where

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
straight down with it this is not where

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.240 
straight down with it this is not where
the<00:01:53.610> slice<00:01:54.030> finishes<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:55.470> slice<00:01:55.740> finishes

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
the slice finishes the slice finishes

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.709 
the slice finishes the slice finishes
actually<00:01:56.670> up<00:01:56.850> here

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
actually up here

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.380 
actually up here
well<00:01:58.619> after<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.040> go<00:01:59.219> down<00:01:59.520> catch<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.180> ball

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
well after you go down catch the ball

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.679 
well after you go down catch the ball
brush<00:02:00.869> behind<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.740> deliver<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.240> rocket

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
brush behind it deliver it the rocket

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.149 
brush behind it deliver it the rocket
then<00:02:03.930> climbs<00:02:04.590> back<00:02:05.009> up<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.490> little<00:02:05.610> bit

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
then climbs back up a little bit

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.609 
then climbs back up a little bit
so<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:06.999> swing<00:02:07.270> actually<00:02:07.749> looks<00:02:08.170> more<00:02:08.379> like

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
so the swing actually looks more like

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.080 
so the swing actually looks more like
this<00:02:10.019> then<00:02:11.019> like<00:02:11.260> this

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
this then like this

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.759 
this then like this
Willy<00:02:13.090> time<00:02:13.390> this<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:13.900> proper<00:02:14.349> is<00:02:14.470> when<00:02:14.650> you

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
Willy time this is proper is when you

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.430 
Willy time this is proper is when you
want<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.040> do<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.220> drop<00:02:15.640> shot<00:02:16.030> get<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.260> later

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
want to do a drop shot get to that later

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.110 
want to do a drop shot get to that later
