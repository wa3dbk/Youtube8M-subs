00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:33.179
 Bronner are the waiting ones 

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:36.819

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.269
 played 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.039

 whoever is dear we know here in this 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:24.159
 That's exactly what you have to take the measure 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.889
 after all, and Springer or EMAS I know for themselves 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.080

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.699

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:11.719
 permeable like a sponge 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.819
