00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
all right in the last video I showed you

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.970 
all right in the last video I showed you
guys<00:00:02.310> how<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.520> use<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:03.030> replace<00:00:03.389> command<00:00:03.980> to

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
guys how to use the replace command to

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.499 
guys how to use the replace command to
fill<00:00:05.220> this<00:00:05.310> thing<00:00:05.370> with<00:00:05.609> water<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:06.060> also<00:00:06.450> to

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
fill this thing with water and also to

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.650 
fill this thing with water and also to
change<00:00:06.990> this<00:00:07.259> edge<00:00:07.529> here<00:00:08.420> this<00:00:09.420> time<00:00:09.630> around

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
change this edge here this time around

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.419 
change this edge here this time around
I'm<00:00:10.019> going<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.469> show<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.740> how<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:10.950> go<00:00:11.130> ahead

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
I'm going to show you how to go ahead

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:19.269 
I'm going to show you how to go ahead
and<00:00:15.500> make<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.680> natural<00:00:17.340> lake<00:00:17.580> how's<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.090> sound

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
and make a natural lake how's that sound

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.670 
and make a natural lake how's that sound
there's<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.580> really<00:00:21.119> really<00:00:21.720> easy<00:00:22.170> way<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.470> do

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
there's a really really easy way to do

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.009 
there's a really really easy way to do
this<00:00:22.830> with<00:00:24.590> with<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.800> craft<00:00:26.310> software

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
this with with the I craft software

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
this with with the I craft software
it'll<00:00:28.019> produce<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.380> result<00:00:28.470> that's<00:00:28.769> not<00:00:28.920> quite

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
it'll produce a result that's not quite

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.500 
it'll produce a result that's not quite
as<00:00:29.220> pretty<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.609> man<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.029> just<00:00:30.179> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
as pretty as this man this is just the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.870 
as pretty as this man this is just the
perfect<00:00:30.750> square<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.309> looks<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.700> bit

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
perfect square but this this looks a bit

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.610 
perfect square but this this looks a bit
more<00:00:33.030> natural<00:00:33.210> now<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:33.989> one<00:00:34.200> works<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.500> little

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
more natural now this one works a little

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.190 
more natural now this one works a little
bit<00:00:34.829> different<00:00:35.280> than<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:36.450> other<00:00:36.630> BLB<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
bit different than the other BLB in the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.110 
bit different than the other BLB in the
replacement<00:00:37.770> HP<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.190> don't<00:00:38.370> set<00:00:38.610> two<00:00:38.820> bricks

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
replacement HP you don't set two bricks

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.330 
replacement HP you don't set two bricks
at<00:00:39.750> opposite<00:00:40.379> corners<00:00:40.739> because<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.160> going

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
at opposite corners because it's going

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.740 
at opposite corners because it's going
to<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.239> figure<00:00:42.420> out<00:00:42.510> what<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
to it's going to figure out what the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.270 
to it's going to figure out what the
lake<00:00:42.930> should<00:00:43.140> look<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.320> underground<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.160> we

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
lake should look like underground so we

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.090 
lake should look like underground so we
set<00:00:44.489> them<00:00:44.610> above<00:00:45.090> ground<00:00:45.750> level<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.860> set<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
set them above ground level so set a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.430 
set them above ground level so set a
brick<00:00:47.399> there<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.940> then<00:00:48.809> we'll<00:00:48.989> come<00:00:49.320> over

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
brick there and then we'll come over

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.549 
brick there and then we'll come over
here<00:00:49.770> or<00:00:50.670> make<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.030> big<00:00:51.270> lake<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.719> we're

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
here or make this a big lake and we're

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.950 
here or make this a big lake and we're
going<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.710> set<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.010> brick<00:00:53.219> there<00:00:53.780> now<00:00:54.780> those

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
going to set that brick there now those

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.200 
going to set that brick there now those
are<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.199> opposite<00:00:55.620> corners<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.100> our<00:00:56.190> lake<00:00:56.489> at

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
are the opposite corners of our lake at

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.970 
are the opposite corners of our lake at
the<00:00:57.449> top<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> surface<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.920> to

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
the top on the surface it's going to

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.889 
the top on the surface it's going to
make<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.250> these<00:00:59.670> changes<00:00:59.879> below<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.750> were

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
make this these changes below if I were

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.750 
make this these changes below if I were
to<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.140> knocked<00:01:01.739> out<00:01:01.920> bricks<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.399> was<00:01:02.489> ground

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
to have knocked out bricks I was ground

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.039 
to have knocked out bricks I was ground
the<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.660> would<00:01:03.809> be<00:01:04.189> 11<00:01:05.189> brick<00:01:05.430> low<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:06.869> do

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
the like would be 11 brick low so we do

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.700 
the like would be 11 brick low so we do
/<00:01:07.470> lake<00:01:08.420> pretty<00:01:09.420> simple<00:01:09.810> stuff<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.470> cuts

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
/ lake pretty simple stuff and it cuts

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.690 
/ lake pretty simple stuff and it cuts
out<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.130> perfectly<00:01:12.090> rectangular<00:01:12.630> leg<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:14.520> go

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
out a perfectly rectangular leg and go

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.399 
out a perfectly rectangular leg and go
knock<00:01:15.060> out<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.479> bricks<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.930> used<00:01:16.170> when

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
knock out the bricks that you used when

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.719 
knock out the bricks that you used when
you<00:01:16.439> get<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> bound<00:01:17.040> those<00:01:17.189> two<00:01:17.310> air<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.670> you

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
you get a bound those two air and you

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.550 
you get a bound those two air and you
wouldn't<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.000> done<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:19.259> now<00:01:19.409> it's

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
wouldn't have done that but now it's

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.740 
wouldn't have done that but now it's
made<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.220> rather<00:01:20.520> deep<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.630> way

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
made this this rather deep like the way

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.850 
made this this rather deep like the way
it<00:01:21.810> does<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.680> hill

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
it does it it's just like the hill

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.820 
it does it it's just like the hill
algorithm<00:01:23.400> ups<00:01:23.549> except<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.090> upside<00:01:24.450> down

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
algorithm ups except it's upside down

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.560 
algorithm ups except it's upside down
I've<00:01:25.830> taught<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.640> guys<00:01:26.880> hill<00:01:27.119> yet<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:27.479> we'll

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
I've taught you guys hill yet but we'll

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.990 
I've taught you guys hill yet but we'll
get<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> second<00:01:29.750> so<00:01:31.549> it's<00:01:32.549> pretty<00:01:32.790> neat

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
get that in a second so it's pretty neat

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.609 
get that in a second so it's pretty neat
I<00:01:33.119> don't<00:01:33.570> like<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.750> use<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.229> too<00:01:34.470> much

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
I don't like to use this too much

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.990 
I don't like to use this too much
because<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.009> do<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.340> lot<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.520> my<00:01:35.700> building

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
because I do a lot of my building

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.340 
because I do a lot of my building
underground<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:38.900> having<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.020> thing<00:01:40.079> make

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
underground and having this thing make

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.530 
underground and having this thing make
these<00:01:40.500> really<00:01:40.740> deep<00:01:40.950> holes<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:42.180> be<00:01:42.210> bad

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
these really deep holes can be bad

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.830 
these really deep holes can be bad
especially<00:01:43.500> when<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.770> fills<00:01:43.890> them<00:01:44.070> with<00:01:44.100> water

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
especially when it fills them with water

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.270 
especially when it fills them with water
because<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:47.070> something

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
because if you have something

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.740 
because if you have something
underground<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.060> do<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> light<00:01:48.420> command

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
underground and you do a light command

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.770 
underground and you do a light command
and<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.710> happens<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.130> touch<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.780> you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
and this this happens to touch it you

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.289 
and this this happens to touch it you
will<00:01:52.170> flood<00:01:52.439> your<00:01:52.470> underground<00:01:52.829> structure

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
will flood your underground structure

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.209 
will flood your underground structure
completely<00:01:54.299> unless<00:01:54.869> using<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.350> finite<00:01:55.799> water

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
completely unless using a finite water

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.340 
completely unless using a finite water
but

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
but

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.630 
but
yeah<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.280> don't<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.580> that<00:01:59.670> stuff<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.570> ah<00:02:01.640> so

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
yeah I don't like that stuff so ah so

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.249 
yeah I don't like that stuff so ah so
that's<00:02:02.759> how<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.540> mentioned<00:02:04.200> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
that's how you do that I mentioned the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.899 
that's how you do that I mentioned the
hill<00:02:04.409> command<00:02:04.770> now<00:02:05.430> let's<00:02:05.610> go<00:02:05.729> ahead<00:02:05.820> and

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
hill command now let's go ahead and

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.719 
hill command now let's go ahead and
let's<00:02:06.330> go<00:02:06.450> ahead<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.630> try<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.900> one<00:02:07.259> out<00:02:07.729> same

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
let's go ahead and try that one out same

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.370 
let's go ahead and try that one out same
thing<00:02:08.940> we're<00:02:09.060> going<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.270> set<00:02:09.420> two<00:02:09.600> bricks<00:02:09.869> at

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
thing we're going to set two bricks at

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.840 
thing we're going to set two bricks at
ground<00:02:10.770> level<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:11.130> can<00:02:11.250> set<00:02:11.400> these<00:02:11.520> below

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
ground level you can set these below

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.729 
ground level you can set these below
ground<00:02:12.150> level<00:02:12.319> I'll<00:02:13.319> just<00:02:13.500> make<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
ground level I'll just make the

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.320 
ground level I'll just make the
structure<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.280> little<00:02:14.550> bit<00:02:14.640> less<00:02:14.790> tall<00:02:15.060> and

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
structure a little bit less tall and

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:23.059 
structure a little bit less tall and
then<00:02:16.110> we<00:02:16.230> do<00:02:16.380> /<00:02:16.890> hill<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.870> there<00:02:19.530> we<00:02:19.620> go<00:02:22.069> sorry

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
then we do / hill and there we go sorry

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.360 
then we do / hill and there we go sorry
and<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.810> makes<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.730> nice<00:02:26.730> grassy<00:02:27.390> hill

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
and that that makes a nice grassy hill

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.580 
and that that makes a nice grassy hill
it's<00:02:29.370> like<00:02:29.819> I<00:02:29.910> said<00:02:30.090> roughly<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.540> same<00:02:30.780> same

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
it's like I said roughly the same same

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.370 
it's like I said roughly the same same
way<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.950> lakes<00:02:32.190> are<00:02:32.459> structured<00:02:33.120> in<00:02:33.360> terms<00:02:34.260> of

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
way the lakes are structured in terms of

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.890 
way the lakes are structured in terms of
how<00:02:34.530> its<00:02:34.680> generated<00:02:35.630> obviously<00:02:36.630> this<00:02:36.720> isn't

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
how its generated obviously this isn't

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.830 
how its generated obviously this isn't
as<00:02:37.110> tall<00:02:37.319> I<00:02:37.350> didn't<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:37.860> didn't<00:02:38.190> spread<00:02:38.400> out<00:02:38.580> the

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
as tall I didn't I didn't spread out the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.710 
as tall I didn't I didn't spread out the
pieces<00:02:39.840> as<00:02:40.140> much<00:02:41.630> but<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:45.060> can<00:02:45.269> be<00:02:45.390> convening

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
pieces as much but it can be convening

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.120 
pieces as much but it can be convening
especially<00:02:46.140> if<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.290> if<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.709> try<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.950> make

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
especially if you if you try to make

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.190 
especially if you if you try to make
something<00:02:47.310> look<00:02:47.489> natural<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.959> big

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
something look natural and it's a big

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.600 
something look natural and it's a big
flat<00:02:49.440> area<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:49.769> this<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.100> can<00:02:50.280> really<00:02:50.400> help

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
flat area like this this can really help

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.509 
flat area like this this can really help
there's<00:02:51.239> also<00:02:51.530> another<00:02:52.530> command<00:02:53.130> that's

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
there's also another command that's

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.110 
there's also another command that's
similar<00:02:53.940> i'll<00:02:54.150> go<00:02:54.330> ahead<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:55.970> this<00:02:56.970> is

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
similar i'll go ahead and this is

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.150 
similar i'll go ahead and this is
approximately<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.810> same<00:02:58.019> same<00:02:58.650> size<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.069> the

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
approximately the same same size of the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.970 
approximately the same same size of the
hill<00:02:59.310> it's<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.390> /<00:03:00.810> mountain<00:03:01.440> Oh<00:03:03.739> mountain<00:03:04.739> is

hill it's a / mountain Oh mountain is
one<00:03:05.970> of<00:03:06.060> those<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.269> forgot<00:03:06.570> about<00:03:06.600> this<00:03:06.959> it

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
one of those I forgot about this it

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.370 
one of those I forgot about this it
wants<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.160> type<00:03:08.579> a<00:03:08.910> brick<00:03:09.810> type<00:03:10.049> so<00:03:10.230> i'm<00:03:10.290> going

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
wants a type a brick type so i'm going

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.039 
wants a type a brick type so i'm going
to<00:03:10.470> say<00:03:10.590> /<00:03:10.890> mountain<00:03:11.510> we'll<00:03:12.510> go<00:03:12.600> ahead<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:12.840> go

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
to say / mountain we'll go ahead and go

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.680 
to say / mountain we'll go ahead and go
with<00:03:15.769> how<00:03:16.769> about<00:03:16.950> stone<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.609> then<00:03:18.420> it's<00:03:18.570> going

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
with how about stone and then it's going

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.870 
with how about stone and then it's going
to<00:03:18.750> make<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:19.170> mountain<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.859> whatever<00:03:20.730> you

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
to make a mountain of whatever you

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.660 
to make a mountain of whatever you
specify<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.600> case<00:03:21.870> stone<00:03:22.250> mountains<00:03:23.250> are<00:03:23.430> a

specify this case stone mountains are a

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.729 
specify this case stone mountains are a
little<00:03:24.540> bit<00:03:24.720> different<00:03:25.019> there<00:03:25.230> they're<00:03:25.530> much

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
little bit different there they're much

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.740 
little bit different there they're much
steeper<00:03:26.040> they<00:03:26.370> go<00:03:26.640> a<00:03:26.670> little<00:03:26.760> bit<00:03:26.970> taller<00:03:27.000> this

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
steeper they go a little bit taller this

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.349 
steeper they go a little bit taller this
one<00:03:27.900> doesn't<00:03:28.019> go<00:03:28.140> too<00:03:28.230> much<00:03:28.470> taller<00:03:28.769> because

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
one doesn't go too much taller because

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.270 
one doesn't go too much taller because
it<00:03:30.359> wasn't<00:03:30.630> that<00:03:30.690> big<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.959> begin<00:03:31.109> with<00:03:31.410> if<00:03:31.680> if<00:03:32.130> I

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
it wasn't that big to begin with if if I

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.310 
it wasn't that big to begin with if if I
would<00:03:32.400> have<00:03:32.489> made<00:03:32.640> this<00:03:32.959> sort<00:03:33.959> of<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.079> that<00:03:34.200> my

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
would have made this sort of it that my

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.440 
would have made this sort of it that my
phone's<00:03:34.530> going<00:03:34.769> off<00:03:34.920> here<00:03:35.100> if<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:36.090> were<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.359> have

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
phone's going off here if I were to have

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.580 
phone's going off here if I were to have
made<00:03:36.630> this<00:03:36.920> any<00:03:37.920> any<00:03:38.690> wider<00:03:39.690> this<00:03:40.049> could<00:03:40.500> have

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
made this any any wider this could have

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.710 
made this any any wider this could have
gotten<00:03:40.739> quite<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.010> bit<00:03:41.190> taller<00:03:41.430> very<00:03:41.700> quickly

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.130 

there's<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:46.100> few<00:03:47.100> more<00:03:47.630> what<00:03:48.630> my<00:03:48.750> phone's<00:03:48.959> just

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
there's a few more what my phone's just

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.979 
there's a few more what my phone's just
going<00:03:49.350> crazy<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:50.390> see<00:03:51.390> their<00:03:51.570> change<00:03:51.780> in<00:03:51.900> the

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
going crazy I see their change in the

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.610 
going crazy I see their change in the
weather<00:03:52.079> okay<00:03:52.560> well<00:03:52.890> anyway<00:03:54.109> if<00:03:55.109> I<00:03:55.350> set

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
weather okay well anyway if I set

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.800 
weather okay well anyway if I set
actually<00:03:56.100> I<00:03:56.130> if<00:03:56.549> I<00:03:56.670> said<00:03:56.850> I<00:03:56.880> Rick<00:03:57.090> there<00:03:57.299> once

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
actually I if I said I Rick there once

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.240 
actually I if I said I Rick there once
again<00:03:57.900> on<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.260> surface<00:03:58.650> and

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
again on the surface and

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.580 
again on the surface and
I<00:04:00.310> said<00:04:01.210> it<00:04:01.300> Ricker's<00:04:01.540> can<00:04:01.780> be<00:04:01.870> roughly<00:04:02.380> the

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
I said it Ricker's can be roughly the

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.070 
I said it Ricker's can be roughly the
same<00:04:02.740> size<00:04:02.800> as<00:04:03.190> my<00:04:03.340> head<00:04:03.490> on<00:04:03.610> my<00:04:03.640> Mountain<00:04:04.080> this

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
same size as my head on my Mountain this

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.960 
same size as my head on my Mountain this
one's<00:04:05.650> going<00:04:05.830> to<00:04:05.890> go<00:04:06.040> down<00:04:06.250> again<00:04:06.490> we're<00:04:06.820> going

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
one's going to go down again we're going

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.690 
one's going to go down again we're going
to<00:04:07.060> do<00:04:07.270> pole<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:09.540> this<00:04:10.540> I<00:04:11.370> believe<00:04:12.370> it's<00:04:12.520> the

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
to do pole and this I believe it's the

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.340 
to do pole and this I believe it's the
same<00:04:12.730> algorithm<00:04:13.390> that<00:04:13.510> makes<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.900> lake<00:04:14.050> and

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
same algorithm that makes the lake and

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.470 
same algorithm that makes the lake and
the<00:04:14.500> same<00:04:14.680> one<00:04:14.860> that<00:04:15.120> probably<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.299> same<00:04:16.450> one

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
the same one that probably the same one

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.789 
the same one that probably the same one
that<00:04:16.570> makes<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.840> hill<00:04:17.079> just<00:04:17.290> upside<00:04:17.590> down

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
that makes the hill just upside down

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.060 
that makes the hill just upside down
again<00:04:18.989> it's<00:04:19.989> likely<00:04:20.290> like<00:04:20.440> except<00:04:20.859> it<00:04:20.920> doesn't

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
again it's likely like except it doesn't

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.830 
again it's likely like except it doesn't
fill<00:04:21.280> them<00:04:21.400> with<00:04:21.430> water<00:04:21.549> so<00:04:22.360> if<00:04:22.570> you're<00:04:22.690> going

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
fill them with water so if you're going

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.480 
fill them with water so if you're going
to<00:04:22.900> make<00:04:22.960> a<00:04:23.020> lake<00:04:23.260> and<00:04:23.470> you<00:04:23.950> really<00:04:24.250> just<00:04:24.280> want

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
to make a lake and you really just want

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.700 
to make a lake and you really just want
to<00:04:24.760> generate<00:04:25.030> one<00:04:25.300> what<00:04:26.050> I<00:04:26.080> recommend<00:04:26.440> you<00:04:26.590> do

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
to generate one what I recommend you do

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.130 
to generate one what I recommend you do
is<00:04:26.740> use<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.040> whole<00:04:27.430> command<00:04:27.790> and<00:04:28.120> then<00:04:28.960> if<00:04:29.050> you

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
is use the whole command and then if you

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.510 
is use the whole command and then if you
see<00:04:29.350> you<00:04:29.800> know<00:04:29.920> sure<00:04:30.040> enough<00:04:30.070> it<00:04:30.310> doesn't

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
see you know sure enough it doesn't

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.970 
see you know sure enough it doesn't
doesn't<00:04:31.180> hit<00:04:31.420> anything<00:04:31.570> it's<00:04:32.500> not<00:04:32.770> going<00:04:32.890> to

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
doesn't hit anything it's not going to

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.130 
doesn't hit anything it's not going to
flood<00:04:33.190> anything<00:04:33.460> then<00:04:33.940> go<00:04:34.120> ahead<00:04:34.240> and<00:04:34.390> bind

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
flood anything then go ahead and bind

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.930 
flood anything then go ahead and bind
something<00:04:35.530> to<00:04:35.650> water<00:04:35.919> and<00:04:36.220> set<00:04:36.490> at<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.730> top

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
something to water and set at the top

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.480 
something to water and set at the top
and<00:04:37.090> let<00:04:37.210> it<00:04:37.240> fill<00:04:37.450> it<00:04:37.540> up<00:04:37.630> for<00:04:37.930> you<00:04:38.250> that<00:04:39.250> seems

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
and let it fill it up for you that seems

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.060 
and let it fill it up for you that seems
like<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.700> way<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.000> go<00:04:40.120> I<00:04:40.210> think<00:04:40.590> oh<00:04:41.590> speaking

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
like the way to go I think oh speaking

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.040 
like the way to go I think oh speaking
of<00:04:42.370> dangerous<00:04:42.880> commands<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.540> use<00:04:43.690> they<00:04:43.930> can

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
of dangerous commands to use they can

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.570 
of dangerous commands to use they can
flood<00:04:44.290> things<00:04:44.560> here's<00:04:44.919> one<00:04:45.100> you<00:04:45.220> really<00:04:45.370> want

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
flood things here's one you really want

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.630 
flood things here's one you really want
to<00:04:45.640> avoid<00:04:46.110> in<00:04:47.110> my<00:04:47.260> opinion<00:04:47.530> I<00:04:47.800> I<00:04:48.070> see<00:04:48.430> it<00:04:48.520> has

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
to avoid in my opinion I I see it has

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.530 
to avoid in my opinion I I see it has
uses<00:04:49.060> i<00:04:49.090> have<00:04:49.330> used<00:04:49.540> it<00:04:49.720> in<00:04:49.840> one<00:04:50.230> of<00:04:50.260> my<00:04:50.530> worlds

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
uses i have used it in one of my worlds

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.570 
uses i have used it in one of my worlds
you<00:04:52.540> hope<00:04:53.200> you<00:04:53.500> know<00:04:53.590> what<00:04:53.680> you<00:04:53.800> same<00:04:54.310> same

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
you hope you know what you same same

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
deal i keep forgetting about this you're

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.280 
deal i keep forgetting about this you're
going<00:04:56.110> to<00:04:56.169> set<00:04:56.350> your<00:04:56.440> bricks<00:04:56.710> at<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:58.840> top<00:04:59.080> I'm

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
going to set your bricks at the top I'm

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.630 
going to set your bricks at the top I'm
actually<00:04:59.440> going<00:04:59.680> to<00:04:59.770> offset<00:05:00.220> it<00:05:00.250> by<00:05:00.340> one

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
actually going to offset it by one

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.550 
actually going to offset it by one
because<00:05:00.910> I<00:05:01.000> think<00:05:01.480> this<00:05:01.690> one<00:05:01.870> is<00:05:01.900> going<00:05:02.169> to<00:05:02.350> eat

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
because I think this one is going to eat

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.170 
because I think this one is going to eat
a<00:05:02.800> hole<00:05:03.160> under<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.580> I<00:05:03.730> don't<00:05:03.850> want<00:05:03.970> to<00:05:04.060> fill

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
a hole under it I don't want to fill

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.120 
a hole under it I don't want to fill
that<00:05:04.300> up<00:05:06.570> oopsie<00:05:07.570> now<00:05:07.690> I've<00:05:07.780> ruined<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:08.140> okay<00:05:09.100> i

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
that up oopsie now I've ruined it okay i

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.460 
that up oopsie now I've ruined it okay i
set<00:05:09.669> my<00:05:09.790> corner<00:05:10.090> blocks<00:05:10.330> we're<00:05:10.900> going<00:05:10.990> to<00:05:11.050> do<00:05:11.200> /

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
set my corner blocks we're going to do /

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.770 
set my corner blocks we're going to do /
pit<00:05:12.010> this<00:05:12.280> is<00:05:12.400> like<00:05:12.580> hole<00:05:12.820> it's<00:05:13.270> like<00:05:13.510> lake

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
pit this is like hole it's like lake

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.900 
pit this is like hole it's like lake
except<00:05:14.560> it<00:05:15.010> makes<00:05:15.070> a<00:05:15.280> pit<00:05:15.430> of<00:05:15.460> lava<00:05:16.200> so<00:05:17.250> it<00:05:18.250> is

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
except it makes a pit of lava so it is

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.300 
except it makes a pit of lava so it is
pretty<00:05:19.210> deep<00:05:19.479> like<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:20.260> other<00:05:20.290> ones<00:05:20.590> if<00:05:21.220> you

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
pretty deep like the other ones if you

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.550 
pretty deep like the other ones if you
if<00:05:21.610> you<00:05:21.760> go<00:05:21.910> in<00:05:22.060> here<00:05:22.300> you<00:05:22.510> can't<00:05:22.840> really<00:05:23.440> see

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
if you go in here you can't really see

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.839 
if you go in here you can't really see
very<00:05:23.740> much<00:05:24.570> but<00:05:25.570> uh

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
very much but uh

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:29.480 
very much but uh
it<00:05:27.419> it's<00:05:27.990> a<00:05:28.139> roughly<00:05:28.740> the<00:05:28.830> same<00:05:28.979> as<00:05:29.129> that<00:05:29.219> hole

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
it it's a roughly the same as that hole

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.730 
it it's a roughly the same as that hole
there<00:05:29.839> think<00:05:30.839> the<00:05:30.929> dimensions<00:05:31.409> of<00:05:31.499> the<00:05:31.589> same

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
there think the dimensions of the same

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.299 
there think the dimensions of the same
so<00:05:31.889> it<00:05:32.009> should<00:05:32.429> be<00:05:33.349> yeah<00:05:34.349> it<00:05:34.649> looks<00:05:34.800> like<00:05:34.889> it<00:05:35.159> is

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:35.309 
so it should be yeah it looks like it is

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:37.850 
so it should be yeah it looks like it is
in<00:05:35.639> fact<00:05:35.879> the<00:05:36.330> same<00:05:36.569> algorithm<00:05:37.020> his<00:05:37.139> hole<00:05:37.379> so

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
in fact the same algorithm his hole so

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.829 
in fact the same algorithm his hole so
the<00:05:38.009> same<00:05:38.189> ones<00:05:38.369> like<00:05:38.580> probably<00:05:38.879> oh<00:05:41.839> well

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:42.839 
the same ones like probably oh well

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:46.249 
the same ones like probably oh well
anyway<00:05:43.429> this<00:05:44.429> one<00:05:44.669> this<00:05:45.599> would<00:05:45.779> be<00:05:45.899> just<00:05:45.929> awful

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 
anyway this one this would be just awful

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.429 
anyway this one this would be just awful
if<00:05:46.649> you<00:05:47.039> were<00:05:47.159> to<00:05:47.599> do<00:05:48.599> this<00:05:48.629> and<00:05:48.899> have<00:05:49.050> it<00:05:49.080> flood
