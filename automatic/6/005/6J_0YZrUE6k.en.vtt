shaft on five this tutorial is very easy

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.049 
shaft on five this tutorial is very easy
but<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.330> does<00:00:12.509> require<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:13.200> lag<00:00:13.530> switch<00:00:13.759> so<00:00:14.759> i

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
but it does require a lag switch so i

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.599 
but it does require a lag switch so i
will<00:00:15.750> be<00:00:15.780> putting<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.379> internet<00:00:16.920> lag<00:00:17.100> switch<00:00:17.400> if

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
will be putting a internet lag switch if

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.099 
will be putting a internet lag switch if
you<00:00:17.730> don't<00:00:17.880> have<00:00:18.000> an<00:00:18.119> ethernet<00:00:18.240> cord<00:00:18.779> one<00:00:18.930> in

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
you don't have an ethernet cord one in

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.650 
you don't have an ethernet cord one in
the<00:00:19.470> description<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.880> as<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.029> can<00:00:21.180> see<00:00:21.390> he's

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
like he just did and he felt through the

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.759 
like he just did and he felt through the
back<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.630> the<00:00:27.630> what<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.109> have<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.439> do<00:00:28.560> is

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
you have to have the host the host is

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.920 
you have to have the host the host is
castro<00:00:32.520> if<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.759> can<00:00:32.940> see<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> character<00:00:33.660> up

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
can see he is right now and so as you

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.789 
can see he is right now and so as you
can<00:01:11.850> see<00:01:12.060> he<00:01:12.240> wanted<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.689> spin<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.110> circles<00:01:13.140> to

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
can see he wanted to spin in circles to

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.640 
can see he wanted to spin in circles to
show<00:01:14.010> how<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.340> hell<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:15.299> ceiling<00:01:16.229> looks<00:01:16.530> a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
show how the hell the ceiling looks a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.230

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.850 
so right here he's showing how you can
night<00:01:23.610> them<00:01:24.020> sometimes<00:01:25.020> through<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> wall

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
night them sometimes through the wall

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.300 
night them sometimes through the wall
it's<00:01:26.240> not<00:01:27.240> as<00:01:27.420> effective<00:01:28.110> as<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:29.040> other

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
it's not as effective as this other

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.120 
it's not as effective as this other
option<00:01:29.790> you'll<00:01:29.970> see<00:01:30.240> right<00:01:30.509> here<00:01:30.829> but<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.979> is

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
option you'll see right here but it is

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.910 
option you'll see right here but it is
still<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:33.060> decent<00:01:33.990> wet<00:01:34.290> thing<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.799> have<00:01:34.890> a

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
still a decent wet thing if you have a

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.310 
still a decent wet thing if you have a
bowie<00:01:35.220> knife<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:36.210> when<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.360> suggest<00:01:36.840> doing<00:01:37.020> is

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
bowie knife but when I suggest doing is

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.179 
bowie knife but when I suggest doing is
doing<00:01:38.159> what<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.549> see<00:01:38.729> here<00:01:39.060> he<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.710> shoot<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
doors normally are and you can shoot

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.230

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
through the doors you can it's really

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.030 
through the doors you can it's really
good<00:01:54.509> because<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:55.049> zombies<00:01:55.439> are<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.740> lot

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
good because the zombies are a lot

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.399 
good because the zombies are a lot
they're<00:01:56.340> perfect<00:01:56.939> type<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.329> where<00:01:57.509> their

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
they're perfect type to where their

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.679 
they're perfect type to where their
heads<00:01:58.950> are<00:01:59.250> aligned<00:01:59.610> perfectly<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.570> can

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
heads are aligned perfectly so you can

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.810 
heads are aligned perfectly so you can
just<00:02:00.719> kill<00:02:01.079> them<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.350> get<00:02:01.469> headshots<00:02:01.790> now<00:02:02.790> I

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
just kill them and get headshots now I

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.630 
just kill them and get headshots now I
don't<00:02:02.939> think<00:02:03.390> ray<00:02:03.780> guns<00:02:04.020> or<00:02:04.259> frost<00:02:05.100> guns<00:02:05.369> can

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
don't think ray guns or frost guns can

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.510 
don't think ray guns or frost guns can
shoot<00:02:05.939> through<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.630> but<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.200> do<00:02:07.740> believe<00:02:08.039> that

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
shoot through this but I do believe that

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.580
