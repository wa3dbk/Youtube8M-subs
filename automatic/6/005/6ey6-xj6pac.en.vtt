00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
where I'm just going to stand here and

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.520 
where I'm just going to stand here and

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
talk honestly it's not going to be a

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.410 
talk honestly it's not going to be a
long<00:02:18.680> video<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:19.490> here's<00:02:19.670> my<00:02:19.790> thoughts<00:02:20.120> on<00:02:20.300> it

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
long video so here's my thoughts on it

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.180 
long video so here's my thoughts on it
you<00:02:23.420> can<00:02:23.600> see<00:02:23.810> combat<00:02:24.110> somewhere<00:02:24.680> else<00:02:24.830> really

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
you can see combat somewhere else really

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.650 
you can see combat somewhere else really
because<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.000> combat<00:02:26.330> is<00:02:26.360> also<00:02:26.720> boring

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
because the combat is also boring

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.590 
because the combat is also boring
there's<00:02:29.660> if<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.230> like<00:02:30.440> me<00:02:30.880> if<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:32.150> played

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
there's if you like me if you played

play MMO does to their game which it has
nothing<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.720> do<00:03:44.840> with<00:03:45.049> anything<00:03:45.290> is<00:03:45.500> just<00:03:45.739> and

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
nothing to do with anything is just and

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.570 
nothing to do with anything is just and
I<00:03:47.630> called<00:03:47.930> it<00:03:48.019> a<00:03:48.110> a<00:03:48.350> world<00:03:48.799> of<00:03:48.860> warcraft<00:03:48.980> clone

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
I called it a a world of warcraft clone

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.640 
I called it a a world of warcraft clone
which<00:03:49.850> is<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.000> which<00:03:50.420> is<00:03:50.570> a<00:03:50.600> stupid<00:03:50.930> term<00:03:51.410> and<00:03:51.590> i

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
which is a which is a stupid term and i

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.650 
which is a which is a stupid term and i
realized<00:03:52.040> that<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.489> you<00:03:53.180> can<00:03:53.330> argue<00:03:53.570> with

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
realized that and you can argue with

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.150 
realized that and you can argue with
that<00:03:53.720> as<00:03:53.989> much<00:03:54.170> as<00:03:54.200> you<00:03:54.380> want<00:03:54.560> but<00:03:54.680> what<00:03:54.860> i<00:03:54.920> mean

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
that as much as you want but what i mean

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.460 
that as much as you want but what i mean
by<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:55.400> is<00:03:55.630> basically<00:03:56.630> we've<00:03:56.900> seen<00:03:57.140> it<00:03:57.320> all

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
by that is basically we've seen it all

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.770 
by that is basically we've seen it all
before<00:03:57.650> it<00:03:58.430> follows<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.910> exact<00:03:59.239> same<00:03:59.510> model

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
before it follows the exact same model

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.320 
before it follows the exact same model
as<00:04:00.080> vanilla<00:04:00.590> world<00:04:00.890> of<00:04:01.040> warcraft<00:04:01.430> it<00:04:01.700> there's

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
as vanilla world of warcraft it there's

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.539 
as vanilla world of warcraft it there's
nothing<00:04:02.540> new<00:04:02.840> there<00:04:03.080> and<00:04:03.320> vanilla<00:04:04.280> world<00:04:04.400> of

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
nothing new there and vanilla world of

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.360 
nothing new there and vanilla world of
warcraft<00:04:04.850> is<00:04:04.940> just<00:04:05.209> like<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:06.019> culmination<00:04:06.620> of

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
warcraft is just like the culmination of

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.830 
warcraft is just like the culmination of
a<00:04:07.549> whole<00:04:07.730> bunch<00:04:07.940> of<00:04:08.060> other<00:04:08.150> similar<00:04:08.450> games<00:04:08.900> and

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.230 
the zone is done and that's it but i
have<00:04:37.270> put<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.690> time<00:04:37.900> in<00:04:38.080> of<00:04:38.460> as<00:04:39.460> much<00:04:39.910> as<00:04:40.120> i

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
have put the time in of as much as i

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.570 
have put the time in of as much as i
could<00:04:40.300> stomach<00:04:40.810> and<00:04:41.200> eventually<00:04:42.100> i<00:04:42.130> just<00:04:42.400> got

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
could stomach and eventually i just got

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.160 
could stomach and eventually i just got
to<00:04:42.610> board<00:04:43.090> with<00:04:43.270> it<00:04:43.300> to<00:04:43.540> be<00:04:43.660> able<00:04:43.750> to<00:04:43.900> continue

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
to board with it to be able to continue

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.560 
to board with it to be able to continue
so<00:04:44.470> that's<00:04:44.650> it<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:45.700> first<00:04:45.970> time<00:04:46.060> i<00:04:46.180> played<00:04:46.270> it

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
so that's it the first time i played it

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.990 
so that's it the first time i played it
was<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:46.900> one<00:04:47.050> i<00:04:47.080> played<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.680> most<00:04:47.950> and<00:04:48.460> i

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
was the one i played the most and i

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.020 
was the one i played the most and i
realized<00:04:49.570> at<00:04:49.750> that<00:04:49.780> time<00:04:49.900> that<00:04:50.640> when<00:04:51.640> i<00:04:51.670> played

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
realized at that time that when i played

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.470 
realized at that time that when i played
like<00:04:52.270> six<00:04:52.720> or<00:04:52.840> seven<00:04:53.020> hours<00:04:53.260> in<00:04:53.560> a<00:04:53.650> row<00:04:54.480> really

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
like six or seven hours in a row really

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.930 
like six or seven hours in a row really
just<00:04:55.830> after<00:04:56.830> a<00:04:56.860> while<00:04:56.980> I<00:04:57.010> realized<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.910> only

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
just after a while I realized the only

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.580 
just after a while I realized the only
reason<00:04:58.600> I'm<00:04:58.690> playing<00:04:58.870> this<00:04:58.990> game<00:04:59.170> is<00:04:59.350> because

anything in first person mode it's just
stupid<00:06:27.690> the<00:06:28.690> payment<00:06:28.960> model<00:06:29.470> they're<00:06:29.620> using

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
stupid the payment model they're using

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.460 
stupid the payment model they're using
is<00:06:30.250> just<00:06:30.640> insulting<00:06:31.480> the<00:06:31.660> last<00:06:31.870> one<00:06:32.140> that<00:06:32.290> did

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
is just insulting the last one that did

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.220 
is just insulting the last one that did
something<00:06:32.830> like<00:06:32.920> that<00:06:32.980> was<00:06:33.570> the<00:06:34.570> secret<00:06:34.780> world

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230 
something like that was the secret world

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.499 
something like that was the secret world
and<00:06:35.530> that<00:06:35.620> worked<00:06:35.890> out<00:06:36.040> well<00:06:36.100> for<00:06:36.370> them

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:37.509 
and that worked out well for them

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:40.389 
and that worked out well for them
and<00:06:38.509> there's<00:06:38.899> nothing<00:06:39.080> about<00:06:39.439> this<00:06:39.589> game<00:06:39.889> that

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:40.399 
and there's nothing about this game that

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:42.010 
and there's nothing about this game that
I<00:06:40.459> feel<00:06:40.789> in<00:06:40.939> a<00:06:40.969> way<00:06:41.029> that<00:06:41.419> reminds<00:06:41.719> me<00:06:41.929> of

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
I feel in a way that reminds me of

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.399 
I feel in a way that reminds me of
Skyrim<00:06:42.789> or<00:06:43.789> not<00:06:44.209> no<00:06:44.569> no<00:06:44.629> just<00:06:44.959> remember<00:06:45.319> the

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:10.459 
apart not that the storytelling is good

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:12.579 
apart not that the storytelling is good
in<00:07:10.610> this<00:07:10.699> game<00:07:10.759> either<00:07:11.119> but<00:07:11.990> what's<00:07:12.139> it<00:07:12.259> apart
