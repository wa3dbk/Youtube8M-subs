think<00:02:03.149> we'll<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.509> able<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.659> get<00:02:03.780> through<00:02:04.020> this

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
think we'll be able to get through this

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.200 
think we'll be able to get through this
but<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.799> wall<00:02:05.130> running<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.850> definitely

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
but a wall running just is definitely

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.490 
but a wall running just is definitely
gonna<00:02:06.299> be<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.509> thing<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:06.899> black<00:02:07.049> ops<00:02:07.259> 2<00:02:07.350> you're

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
gonna be able to run on walls which

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.580 
gonna be able to run on walls which
honestly<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.690> don't<00:02:09.780> think<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.110> cool<00:02:10.289> at<00:02:10.440> all

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
coolest thing out of this entire trailer

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.640 
coolest thing out of this entire trailer
there<00:02:17.150> is<00:02:17.359> actually<00:02:17.719> a<00:02:17.750> sniper<00:02:18.290> it's<00:02:18.500> called

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650

the<00:02:18.739> Lotus<00:02:18.950> sniper<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.760> looks<00:02:20.299> very<00:02:20.629> very

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
the Lotus sniper it looks very very

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.240 
the Lotus sniper it looks very very
awesome<00:02:20.930> when<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:21.319> shoots<00:02:21.590> but<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:22.040> don't<00:02:22.189> know

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
awesome when it shoots but I don't know

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.949 
awesome when it shoots but I don't know
Manikonda<00:02:22.730> seems<00:02:23.150> like<00:02:23.329> this<00:02:23.420> would<00:02:23.569> not<00:02:23.810> be

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
Manikonda seems like this would not be

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.330 
Manikonda seems like this would not be
the<00:02:24.049> sniper<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.379> we're<00:02:24.590> going<00:02:24.799> to<00:02:25.040> use<00:02:25.219> I

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
the sniper that we're going to use I

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.319 
the sniper that we're going to use I
feel<00:02:25.489> like<00:02:25.579> there's<00:02:25.700> gonna<00:02:25.760> be<00:02:25.879> a<00:02:25.969> cooler

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
feel like there's gonna be a cooler

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:27.880 
feel like there's gonna be a cooler
sniper<00:02:26.659> that's<00:02:26.930> in<00:02:27.019> this<00:02:27.109> game<00:02:27.319> because<00:02:27.709> it

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
sniper that's in this game because it

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.740 
sniper that's in this game because it
just<00:02:27.980> didn't<00:02:28.189> really<00:02:28.250> look<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:28.730> awesome<00:02:29.269> but

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
just didn't really look that awesome but

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.940 
just didn't really look that awesome but
it<00:02:29.959> definitely<00:02:30.109> is<00:02:30.349> pretty<00:02:30.560> awesome<00:02:30.709> that

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
it definitely is pretty awesome that

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.589 
it definitely is pretty awesome that
they<00:02:31.040> are<00:02:31.189> showing<00:02:31.519> some<00:02:31.670> snipers<00:02:32.209> off<00:02:32.359> and

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.030 
consoles I thought we would have some
old<00:03:44.060> gen<00:03:44.299> consoles<00:03:44.750> getting<00:03:45.319> beta<00:03:45.500> access<00:03:45.829> but

just for everything in general I think

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.060 
just for everything in general I think
theater<00:05:52.330> mode<00:05:52.420> is<00:05:52.570> really<00:05:52.870> useful<00:05:53.230> for<00:05:53.440> I<00:05:53.650> mean

theater mode is really useful for I mean
it's<00:05:54.340> useful<00:05:54.790> for<00:05:54.820> seeing<00:05:55.600> where<00:05:55.750> the<00:05:55.870> fucking

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.170

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.320 
it's useful for seeing where the fucking
person<00:05:56.500> was<00:05:56.710> who<00:05:56.950> you<00:05:57.070> killed<00:05:57.400> remember<00:05:58.000> in

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
card I really do hope it's just like the

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.180 
card I really do hope it's just like the
one<00:06:55.389> in<00:06:55.449> black<00:06:55.630> ops<00:06:55.840> 2<00:06:55.960> maybe<00:06:56.770> a<00:06:56.860> little<00:06:57.070> bit

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190 
one in black ops 2 maybe a little bit

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.159 
one in black ops 2 maybe a little bit
better<00:06:57.340> because<00:06:58.090> as<00:06:58.360> you<00:06:58.570> guys<00:06:58.690> know<00:06:58.750> the<00:06:59.050> one

00:06:59.159 --> 00:06:59.169 
better because as you guys know the one

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:00.570 
better because as you guys know the one
events<00:06:59.530> warfare<00:06:59.889> and<00:07:00.040> the<00:07:00.100> winning<00:07:00.340> ghost

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
events warfare and the winning ghost

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.100 
events warfare and the winning ghost
just<00:07:00.790> was<00:07:01.030> not<00:07:01.210> that<00:07:01.449> cool<00:07:01.630> I<00:07:01.690> didn't<00:07:01.990> like

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
just was not that cool I didn't like

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.330 
just was not that cool I didn't like
seeing<00:07:02.320> the<00:07:02.500> winning<00:07:02.710> ghosts<00:07:03.040> where<00:07:03.190> it<00:07:03.250> was

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.340 
seeing the winning ghosts where it was

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.189 
seeing the winning ghosts where it was
all<00:07:03.550> the<00:07:03.699> way<00:07:03.790> on<00:07:04.000> the<00:07:04.360> top<00:07:04.600> right<00:07:04.990> of<00:07:05.110> the

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 
all the way on the top right of the

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:07.530 
all the way on the top right of the
screen<00:07:05.229> I<00:07:05.680> really<00:07:06.280> like<00:07:06.460> seeing<00:07:06.729> some<00:07:07.330> type<00:07:07.510> of

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540 
screen I really like seeing some type of

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.300 
screen I really like seeing some type of
black<00:07:07.810> ops<00:07:07.990> 2<00:07:08.199> kill<00:07:08.410> feed<00:07:08.620> where<00:07:08.830> it's<00:07:08.949> up<00:07:09.100> for

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.310 
black ops 2 kill feed where it's up for

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.680 
black ops 2 kill feed where it's up for
a<00:07:09.370> little<00:07:09.639> bit<00:07:09.760> but<00:07:09.940> not<00:07:10.030> too<00:07:10.090> long<00:07:10.540> like

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:10.690 
a little bit but not too long like

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.450 
a little bit but not too long like
advanced<00:07:11.020> warfare<00:07:11.470> I<00:07:11.650> think<00:07:12.220> that<00:07:12.340> would<00:07:12.430> be

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:12.460 
advanced warfare I think that would be

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.950 
advanced warfare I think that would be
awesome<00:07:12.880> so<00:07:12.910> hopefully<00:07:13.360> they<00:07:13.510> do<00:07:13.570> keep<00:07:13.840> the

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960 
awesome so hopefully they do keep the

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.780 
awesome so hopefully they do keep the
kill<00:07:14.110> feed<00:07:14.290> like<00:07:14.470> that<00:07:14.680> and<00:07:14.889> that's<00:07:15.490> really<00:07:15.639> it

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:15.790 
kill feed like that and that's really it

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.190 
kill feed like that and that's really it
