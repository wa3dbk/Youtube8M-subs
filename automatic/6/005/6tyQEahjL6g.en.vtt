anything they don't put them in stupid

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.780 
anything they don't put them in stupid
places<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.650> don't<00:00:31.650> know<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.890> was<00:00:32.520> just

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
places and I don't know this was just

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.180 
places and I don't know this was just
probably<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.660> best<00:00:33.899> major<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.410> small<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.920> think

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
probably the best major a small I think

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.520 
probably the best major a small I think
or<00:00:35.790> driving<00:00:36.480> level<00:00:36.840> because<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.170> not<00:00:37.320> really

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
or driving level because it's not really

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.020 
or driving level because it's not really
racing<00:00:37.829> level<00:00:38.600> but<00:00:39.600> uh<00:00:39.980> mmm<00:00:40.980> one<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
there's something I got to cut in that

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.069 
there's something I got to cut in that
that's<00:00:52.949> no<00:00:53.160> reason<00:00:53.280> slogger<00:00:53.840> never<00:00:54.840> mind

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
that's no reason slogger never mind

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.349 
that's no reason slogger never mind
forget<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.320> said<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:56.480> but<00:00:57.480> there<00:00:57.870> are<00:00:58.309> um<00:00:59.359> like

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
forget I said that but there are um like

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.209 
forget I said that but there are um like
all<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.020> balloons<00:01:01.170> are<00:01:01.379> pretty<00:01:01.590> easy<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.800> see

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
all the balloons are pretty easy to see

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.960 
all the balloons are pretty easy to see
so<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.640> wouldn't<00:01:03.090> try<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:04.400> like<00:01:05.400> try<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.850> get

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
so I wouldn't try to like try and get

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.899 
so I wouldn't try to like try and get
them<00:01:06.680> trying<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.740> get<00:01:07.890> all<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.070> bat<00:01:08.490> try<00:01:08.850> to

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
them trying to get all the bat try to

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.550 
them trying to get all the bat try to
get<00:01:09.119> all<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.450> balloons<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:10.110> each<00:01:10.229> level

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
get all the balloons on each level

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.300 
get all the balloons on each level
before<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:12.500> go<00:01:13.500> down<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> next<00:01:13.979> one<00:01:14.280> I

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
before you go down to the next one I

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.980 
before you go down to the next one I
guess<00:01:14.610> looks<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.299> there's<00:01:15.570> like<00:01:15.659> three

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
guess looks like there's like three

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.899 
guess looks like there's like three
levels<00:01:16.380> first<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.070> one<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.490> next<00:01:17.759> one

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
levels first on this one in the next one

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.230 
levels first on this one in the next one
and<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:19.799> third<00:01:19.830> one<00:01:20.009> obviously<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:21.650> I<00:01:23.240> yeah

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and the third one obviously and I yeah

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.179 
and the third one obviously and I yeah
just<00:01:24.630> go<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.350> guess<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.860> then<00:01:26.009> she'll

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
just go for that I guess and then she'll

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.499 
just go for that I guess and then she'll
FS<00:01:26.520> walk<00:01:26.790> starting<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.270> fire<00:01:27.630> dies<00:01:29.509> wasn't

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
FS walk starting that fire dies wasn't

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.469 
FS walk starting that fire dies wasn't
very<00:01:30.600> smart<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.079> him<00:01:31.970> kind<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.150> fire

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
very smart of him kind of like a fire

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.499
