dll<00:00:36.510> order<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.399> then<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.730> shoulda<00:00:38.940> come<00:00:39.089> and

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
dll order and then you shoulda come and

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.540 
dll order and then you shoulda come and
exploit<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.289> will<00:00:40.410> generate<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:41.010> lawful<00:00:41.370> so

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
exploit so it will generate a lawful so

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.790 
exploit so it will generate a lawful so
work<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.839> serve<00:00:43.109> a<00:00:43.140> linkedin<00:00:43.589> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
work so you can serve a linkedin the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.869 
work so you can serve a linkedin the
local<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.519> be<00:00:44.699> 192<00:00:45.089> 11<00:00:45.480> 68.1<00:00:46.109> or<00:00:46.320> 9<00:00:46.469> 21<00:00:46.679> 34<00:00:46.949> so

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
local I be 192 11 68.1 or 9 21 34 so

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.750 
local I be 192 11 68.1 or 9 21 34 so
when<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.179> victim<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.570> itself<00:00:48.929> need<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.409> get<00:00:49.559> on

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
when the victim is itself need to get on

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.970 
when the victim is itself need to get on
so<00:00:50.760> how<00:00:51.629> we<00:00:51.690> can<00:00:51.899> embed<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.620> an<00:00:52.710> exercise

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
so how we can embed this is an exercise

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.239 
so how we can embed this is an exercise
that<00:00:53.129> accesses<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.559> it<00:00:55.559> can<00:00:55.829> use<00:00:56.069> an

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:56.249 
that accesses is that it can use an

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:00.140 
that accesses is that it can use an
iframe<00:00:56.579> tag<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.089> blow<00:00:57.989> dead<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.440> are

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
iframe tag to blow dead you are

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.870 
iframe tag to blow dead you are
and<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.840> other<00:01:01.930> thing<00:01:02.020> is<00:01:02.200> that<00:01:02.700> again<00:01:03.700> use

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
and the other thing is that again use

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.719 
and the other thing is that again use
meta<00:01:04.570> refresh<00:01:04.720> tax<00:01:05.290> to<00:01:05.470> include<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:06.010> URL<00:01:06.400> or

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
meta refresh tax to include the URL or

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.150 
meta refresh tax to include the URL or
otherwise<00:01:07.180> you<00:01:07.420> can<00:01:07.600> use<00:01:07.950> JavaScript<00:01:08.950> course

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
otherwise you can use JavaScript course

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.410 
otherwise you can use JavaScript course
like<00:01:09.400> winded<00:01:10.180> or<00:01:10.270> dolphin<00:01:10.450> etcetera

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.719 

remember<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.689> URL<00:01:17.320> and<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.939> we<00:01:19.060> with<00:01:19.210> Tim<00:01:20.729> and

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
remember the URL and so we with Tim and

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.740 
remember the URL and so we with Tim and
the<00:01:21.789> return<00:01:22.210> visits<00:01:22.600> a<00:01:22.719> URL<00:01:22.990> he<00:01:23.439> get<00:01:23.590> on<00:01:23.710> so<00:01:27.750> now

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
the return visits a URL he get on so now

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.690 
the return visits a URL he get on so now
go<00:01:28.929> back<00:01:29.079> to<00:01:29.140> your<00:01:29.259> back<00:01:29.979> technician<00:01:30.579> and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
go back to your back technician and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.449 
go back to your back technician and
after<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:34.409> Explorer<00:01:35.409> it<00:01:35.500> is<00:01:35.619> executed<00:01:36.100> victim

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:36.459 
after the Explorer it is executed victim

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:40.410 
after the Explorer it is executed victim
side<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:39.009> will<00:01:39.069> definitely<00:01:39.459> get<00:01:39.759> a<00:01:39.819> table

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
side you will definitely get a table

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.350 
side you will definitely get a table
accession<00:01:40.840> so<00:01:41.170> you<00:01:41.979> can<00:01:42.130> see<00:01:42.310> there<00:01:42.549> there's<00:01:43.119> a

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
accession so you can see there there's a

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.260 
accession so you can see there there's a
