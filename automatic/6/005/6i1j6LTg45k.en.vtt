00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello dear friends we are today 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.029
 let's talk in the next one which was 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.610
 provided for review by Novosibirsk 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.420
 knife shop blade will be this knife 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.139
 ira zlatoust knives ira company 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.510
 this knife Juan is traditionally such a package 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.670
 all good fun suede that will make even 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.640
 straight like I like ceilings heresy 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.119
 made especially when modest quite 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.660
 price 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.939
 similar availability similar in packaging is 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.340
 great especially for those who do not have 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.600
 such covers as I have allowed for 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.440
 storing large quantities on 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.110
 temporary knives 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.230
 let's go over our own 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.090
 Speaking briefly, I will run over the sheath 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.160
 knife or now on channel kami by 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.170
 some appeared need not 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.120
 all performed equally well 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.940
 just clamping action nothing 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.750
 unusual here not so here is the emboss 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.710
 company logo is traditionally 2 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.480
 the suspension is implemented here solid 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.309
 hard suspension is obtained through this one 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.250
 loop you can hang but wider 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.860
 free suspension for which made 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.540
 separate loop in this case 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.600
 practically does not creak very well 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.280
 Immediately immediately made all this brand 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.780
 the loop also fits in under the standard 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.600
 belts at least everything is fine leather 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.280
 this very pleasant soft here's how 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.409
 just want to lead to another comparison 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.600
 the pattern was already like a good colo 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.790
 leather jacket i have to move 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.880
 motorcycle so -called skin such 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.880
 cool inside is like this 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.119
 a small such knife is actually common 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.060
 the length of this knife is 210 millimeters in total 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.770
 make up the length of the blade 105 millimeters 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.710
 here it is quite a centimeter 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.930
 normal knock width is only two 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.689
 and six tenths of a centimeter and thickness 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.700
 blade three and a half millimeters but 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.110
 let's take a closer look at Karelian 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.470
 birch case on linings 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.210
 food tank design 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.950
 accordingly what can report so 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.850
 removes this place can be used 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.000
 glass fight but if at all just a buzz 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.220
 such a 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.350
 a small iron plate which 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.780
 It makes it possible for children to hold 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.520
 a knife from the shackles of claudette from as seen on 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.170
 well enough sticks out from there well 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.010
 at least in my hand you can hit 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.680
 if necessary 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.630
 need something to beat a few blows of such 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.870
 apply 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:26.780
 I want to show closer here such riveting 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.590
 that is, they are made not just by sleeves 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.120
 here and so beautifully riveted for out 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.910
 the boxes they look a bit worn 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.209
 many apparently clear 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:43.640
 as if rubs we need and a in hands 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:45.410
 probably those who made the tank very soft 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.190
 here did the difference from recently 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.020
 inspected Japanese knives here edges 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.610
 were processed that is nothing by the finger 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.590
 does not catch as well as in general 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.130
 here is a blade, that is, it is tangible 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.140
 let's say this butt as he scales 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.940
 fish so here you can skolblina quite 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.440
 but nevertheless your finger is not much 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.090
 tearing done such an engraving 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.700
 probably it correctly calls yes with 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.650
 birds 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.600
 that as if to us hints that it is such 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.160
 small multipurpose hunting knife 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.420
 for butchering such a small game 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.190
 but I like this 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.530
 It seems to be the most his 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.810
 using such can be concave 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.970
 descents 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.230
 such a butt was strong enough with 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.180
 given the fact that maybe three and a half 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.920
 millimeter they are third most knives 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.900
 they who are at least me 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.220
 happened to hold a knife that is 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.060
 such a short run more or less 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.830
 thick well for such some may be 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.540
 little tougher work must 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:47.030
 can apply here for but let's 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.299
 a little bit here this knife try the guys with 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.519
 what kind of situation is that for. 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.830
 at the knife or tried to be honest with me 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.450
 not inspiring lately I don't know 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.950
 why it seems that they 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.140
 pretty thick middle because in 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.450
 the knife just does not climb a piece of paper he is not stupid 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.830
 I tried them to work on products could 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.069
 as if not some delight but everything 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.290
 acceptable 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.569
 But nevertheless, I honestly 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.670
 confess it seems that these 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.680
 specific Zlatoust knives and how well 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.470
 would be required upon purchase if not 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.160
 lay down your hand immediately give before 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.160
 point such an impression arose them 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.740
 Means that here still comes off such 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.919
 hologram here means left 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:33.930
 In this case 100 x 13 m used 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:36.449
 Here it is with Zlatoust that 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.470
 liked in this knife simple without 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:43.020
 some kind of attempts to make some 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.639
 the finds seem to be like geometry possesses 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.280
 but it is very convenient in the grip here 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.139
 right under my great hand all 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.699
 absolutely grip some to have this knife 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:54.330
 can be realized completely 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:56.070
 wonderful straight very cool little 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.110
 I have this knife, that is, let's say 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.840
 some time ago shot a review on 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.220
 knife canine there was a hilt 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.110
 thick as if I was a little 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.050
 it would be awkward right here 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.289
 it 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.300
 in terms of cutting and cutting ability to me 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:14.030
 love concave descents on such 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.220
 knives, that is, but how would the geometry of the blade 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.690
 This is done cutting I will try 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.159
 to make it all work i think that if 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.009
 knife transfer and most likely rice will be 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:24.050
 Wonderful 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.370
 honestly the quality of this is wood 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.960
 as it is not very, but I am changing very 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.669
 like the way she looks like she is 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.530
 the price the type gets out of the box looks 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.389
 what is immediately under the well-worn I do not know 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:36.259
 if such an impression on the camera but here 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:38.270
 I have Obama rest that is something like that 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:40.940
 so it stayed but you know how will 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.889
 This is the thing with the so-called 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.810
 Khokhloma must say that all the same in 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.780
 this is something traditional and 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.940
 You know, it's nice when you buy a knife 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.979
 and realizing that for such a small trash 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.719
 until that in the first place measure that is not all 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.669
 the knife here in this junk like this pretty 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:58.310
 often happens to many masters there on 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.770
 shelf you look who's terrible at this 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.419
 Regarding what's going on and very nice 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.509
 when you understand what's wrong with you 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:08.870
 take some money that is basically 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:11.419
 knives have up to a snail a reasonable price i 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.919
 Now I will try to see half a year 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:14.779
 it turns out three thousand seven hundred twenty 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.539
 rubles is such a knife that is in general 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:18.919
 then most knives are known to me 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:21.590
 Russian manufacturer will cost 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.659
 more expensive here in this form 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.819
 there is of course the question of what is needed 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:27.409
 tests of steel how would they even 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:28.729
 kaleva to say something about 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:30.889
 convenient in terms of quality 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:32.569
 your claims any special no 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:34.690
 except here perhaps wildebeest is not quite 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:37.159
 I understand you do not sharpen the quality 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:41.719
 Here are my impressions 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:43.310
 She 's a cheat from the company of Air I hope that 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:46.569
 it was all interesting to you big 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.569
 thanks for watching bye
