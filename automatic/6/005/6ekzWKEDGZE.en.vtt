00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.590
 I think there is a little bit what we want 

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:06.220
 do as a cows kitchen 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.220
 like this 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.220
 one 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.040
 look at all those things that are happening 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.700
 Over there 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.300
 or if 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.010
 ok as a company with the game that is this 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.320
 that we have here is a cow slaughterhouse 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.910
 compact hyper passively what it does 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.950
 is that up here they are in the parents 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.930
 This is true parents when they do 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.450
 children the children are going to leave because this 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.430
 for this and everything from one wide this 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.290
 thing that parents do not leave but 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.579
 the children and then the children stay 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.290
 down here and it looks like they 're 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.880
 traumatized or so 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.710
 sorry, you wait for the children 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.090
 grow and quickly that there are people 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.090
 you kill with this state 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.560
 this is then this option that is here 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.230
 it's basically hard strips and then in 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.489
 mainqué this when you want lazcoz 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.500
 asturias that has two positions of 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.510
 this one when you throw it the strips once 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.310
 and everyone was left halfway through life and 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.650
 then he throws it again and kills himself but 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.050
 before the one before it falls 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.810
 here the position well let's change to 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.460
 our east to our sword and then 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.470
 this one is pay has something very good 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.770
 very interesting more interesting than 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.950
 has routing 3 that you basically get 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.450
 this much more this things from the 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.250
 cows do not necessarily do that but 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.080
 this is the idea of this as you get 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.210
 many more things about the cow that is 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.649
 what are we going to do, come on let's put 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.270
 words here we are going to put for you go 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.890
 here to explain how this is 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.890
 it serves we are here like that 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.690
 and putting the cows usually does not 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.490
 supposes that this is done because we are going like this 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.500
 that the few grew there we go like this 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.010
 that the children of these cows as 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.300
 they came out here they grew ok then what 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.300
 let's do after wow 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.520
 I walked pa'l cará there was really good 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.649
 they are not there 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.210
 someone is like that does not exist then 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.009
 basically let's give this we're going to 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.920
 get here right now this is what 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.990
 let's make four blocks this 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.700
 away from them is basically this 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.490
 when we have this this position that 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.319
 it's here so I 'll pay you this one was 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.099
 here will not pay you the pay you're 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.440
 above 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.599
 moody to the first while giving 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.099
 open the chest and then if we throw 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.690
 when we throw the second fast that 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.670
 is in the air this portion we are going to 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.440
 change in our sun we're going to 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.660
 throw it change and boom 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.400
 and it's as if we had killed him with the 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:32.280
 sword and that's what this is for 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.780
 vox ok maybe they're asking around here 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.849
 is to this blog until it is here to 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.560
 that this dispenser and why are we going 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.010
 to take out he 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.410
 our community to make children that 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.170
 is here and they realize 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.430
 we have to make them children so that 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.930
 children leave here below and we can 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.269
 cook it 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.680
 but it is difficult to make children when 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.079
 while it 's down here is a little bit 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.750
 easier to give this button and then that 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.750
 they jump a sprint that puts 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.880
 gloves the button and as the children do 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.040
 Sun 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.970
 and joel holds it for quite some time 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.690
 until you see that you did not change the 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.270
 told about this that is here 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.720
 basically when when everything is in 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.300
 this position 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.310
 all parents make children to know 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.580
 down here that there are many is parakeets 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.480
 the others grow bushes and so they continue 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.890
 a little bit dark but if 7 ok we're going to 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.720
 do this this well what are we going to do 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.000
 here we are going to do is going to put the 3 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.940
 hoppers that what will take our 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.850
 meals you're going to put first to put the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.770
 hopper chest looking at the chest and the two 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.930
 envelopes are going to have to be looking at 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.550
 he hopper the middle so basically 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.520
 as we have things to this paper but 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.500
 yesterday this chest that we are going to surround these 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.200
 hoppers with blocks this is not necessary 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:57.390
 for the improvement of aesthetics 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:57.390
 let's do our 44 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:06.080
 234 if we have 1 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:10.900
 4 we are still here 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:14.430
 three and four three blocks of 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.430
 maybe 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:27.770
 at 3 123 we are going to corroborate here 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.260
 because I 'm here 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.560
 do not 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:37.120
 and here that we are going to put the dispenser 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:40.650
 and here we are going to put we are going to take out what 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.650
 what here what 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.280
 so we can open our chest and 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.870
 do not leave the cows we go to 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.370
 scattered looking is expected so much is 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.310
 good and hard let's put an attempt 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.200
 of crystal here that crystal is very 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.700
 important and you can not you can not put 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.190
 a normal block because if not this the 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.270
 cows this is suffocating has crystal like 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.530
 know the seals 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.730
 so here I am fine also for 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.320
 that the water does not escape from the sides 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:14.330
 let's put a this one has a sign 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.330
 there and rock promoter 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:22.030
 let's put them we must surround this with 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:26.449
 this or whatever you want 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:29.030
 and here we have our the place where 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:31.190
 let's put them to be children 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.780
 I do not want to say anything other than putting 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.940
 our water in here then here 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.770
 low by some button up here thing of 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.820
 that we're going to activate dispensers with 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.780
 this button 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.780
 and we are going to look for the water 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.370
 I'm going to bring 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.769
 and because 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:55.889
 this is basically you ended up like that 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.419
 where are you going to kill them and then 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.809
 you are going to count four what they have taken 1 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:02.399
 2 3 and 4 and in the fifth we are going to put your 

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:04.229
 blocks for where are you going to stop this 

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:06.689
 it's important you have to stop here in 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.879
 this block and you can leave yourself 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:13.079
 of this what because here you are going to throw 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:14.249
 you are your position from to kill them 

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:16.529
 to them so you have to throw the 2 with 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:19.259
 a lot of time and then this block is 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:21.089
 will open and this result this I did not do 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.769
 I did this what other people did 

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:26.129
 they do our tutorials and he 's super 

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:27.509
 well it is a European east then if you want 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:29.610
 watch the video then there is the description 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:32.339
 and free misfortunes that you christian 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.199
 I am sending English and I know good English 

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:37.549
 people thanks to the person who 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.549
 he invented this and
