 champagne and his famous red robe and 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.430
 We were chatting as until 3 o'clock 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.170

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.870

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.209
 in the birds and we stayed until that 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.580

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:14.690
 ruca liked rock very much it was very 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.390

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.050

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.570
 we also chatted about many things and 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.030
 lately he was not organizing himself doing 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.330
 Milanese the last time I spoke with him 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.620
 by phone that was in the house and 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.460
 Olga was doing milanesas with 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.110

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:41.390
 that 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:44.960

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.510
 before being admitted shortly before 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.420

 who called to see how everything was going and 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.739
 He talked with Mom for a while that I never felt bad 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.450
 he believed he was holy then he believed 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.970
 whenever they were there they were 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.830
 doing some charged according to the 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.260
 anecdote that my old woman told him 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.710
 if on behalf of who wanted to talk 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.990

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.220
 daughter has forbidden me to pass them and 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.140
 says a friend you have to tell me 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.090

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.430
 Well who speaks to the good mother is 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.490
