00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
things that they were never designed to

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.670 
things that they were never designed to
do<00:01:02.329> let's<00:01:02.570> face<00:01:02.750> it<00:01:02.780> this<00:01:02.960> was<00:01:03.110> designed<00:01:03.260> to<00:01:03.560> go

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
do let's face it this was designed to go

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.030 
do let's face it this was designed to go
off-road<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:04.550> instead<00:01:05.300> I<00:01:05.630> am<00:01:06.470> flipping<00:01:06.800> it

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
off-road and instead I am flipping it

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.480 
off-road and instead I am flipping it
around<00:01:07.810> like<00:01:08.810> nobody's<00:01:09.380> business

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:20.469 

shot<00:01:13.490> on<00:01:13.520> grass<00:01:13.820> course<00:01:19.210> this<00:01:20.210> is<00:01:20.300> not<00:01:20.450> going

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
shot on grass course this is not going

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.170 
shot on grass course this is not going
to<00:01:20.630> be<00:01:20.720> a<00:01:20.750> great<00:01:21.080> great<00:01:21.770> attempt<00:01:22.369> at<00:01:22.490> autocross

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
to be a great great attempt at autocross

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.510 
to be a great great attempt at autocross
corsica's<00:01:23.780> these<00:01:23.899> cones<00:01:24.800> that<00:01:25.100> I<00:01:25.220> have<00:01:25.340> been

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
corsica's these cones that I have been

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.639 
corsica's these cones that I have been
knocked<00:01:25.820> down<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.600> it's<00:01:26.750> hard<00:01:27.020> to<00:01:27.140> see<00:01:27.320> Jack

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
knocked down and it's hard to see Jack

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.210 
knocked down and it's hard to see Jack
Russells<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:28.340> go

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.060 

yeah<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.120> you<00:01:33.690> know<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:34.020> remarkably<00:01:34.860> capable

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
yeah so you know it's remarkably capable

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.340 
yeah so you know it's remarkably capable
and<00:01:35.430> that's<00:01:36.240> simply<00:01:36.600> because<00:01:36.660> of<00:01:36.930> all<00:01:37.230> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
and that's simply because of all the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.650 
and that's simply because of all the
electronics<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.010> are<00:01:38.070> now<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.460> place<00:01:38.660> that

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
electronics that are now in place that

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.390 
electronics that are now in place that
helped<00:01:39.960> us<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:41.120> stay<00:01:42.120> on<00:01:42.270> course<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.840> stay

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
helped us to stay on course and stay

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.880 
helped us to stay on course and stay
really<00:01:44.400> stable<00:01:44.910> and<00:01:45.060> flat<00:01:45.590> you<00:01:46.590> know<00:01:46.680> what

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
really stable and flat you know what

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.980 
really stable and flat you know what
these<00:01:47.550> are<00:01:47.610> hard<00:01:48.150> to<00:01:48.240> see<00:01:48.420> where<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.570> was<00:01:48.720> going

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
these are hard to see where I was going

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.970 
these are hard to see where I was going
so<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.200> think<00:01:49.440> I'm<00:01:49.500> gonna<00:01:49.590> try<00:01:49.800> it<00:01:49.860> one<00:01:49.950> more

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
so I think I'm gonna try it one more

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:57.270 
so I think I'm gonna try it one more
time<00:01:51.200> if<00:01:52.200> they<00:01:52.350> let<00:01:52.500> me

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.920 

I'm<00:01:57.790> gonna<00:01:57.910> go<00:01:58.030> one<00:01:58.180> more<00:01:58.330> time<00:01:58.540> thanks<00:02:00.810> cuz<00:02:01.810> I

this<00:02:03.610> is<00:02:03.760> a<00:02:03.880> very<00:02:04.090> slowly<00:02:04.420> time<00:02:04.750> hopefully

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
this is a very slowly time hopefully

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.719 
this is a very slowly time hopefully
learn<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:05.979> course<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:06.310> when<00:02:06.430> I<00:02:06.460> get<00:02:06.610> into

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
learn the course so when I get into

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:07.320 
learn the course so when I get into
