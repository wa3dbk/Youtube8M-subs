well<00:00:01.589> I'm<00:00:02.040> on<00:00:02.190> my<00:00:02.220> way<00:00:02.340> to<00:00:02.520> location<00:00:03.330> and<00:00:04.009> I

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
well I'm on my way to location and I

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.010 
well I'm on my way to location and I
think<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.549> conditions<00:00:06.299> are<00:00:06.629> absolutely

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
think the conditions are absolutely

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.169 
think the conditions are absolutely
spot-on<00:00:07.830> for<00:00:08.010> sea<00:00:08.429> trout<00:00:08.900> tide<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:10.110> rising

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:11.179 
spot-on for sea trout tide is rising

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.690 
spot-on for sea trout tide is rising
it's<00:00:12.179> supposed<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.540> get<00:00:12.719> better<00:00:13.700> this

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
it's supposed to get better this

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.279 
it's supposed to get better this
flattens<00:00:15.150> off<00:00:15.299> no<00:00:15.540> I'd<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.900> good<00:00:16.049> chance

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
flattens off no I'd have a good chance

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.810 
flattens off no I'd have a good chance
of<00:00:16.470> actually<00:00:16.619> seeing<00:00:16.949> one<00:00:19.250> here<00:00:21.140> here<00:00:22.820> and

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
of actually seeing one here here and

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.970 
of actually seeing one here here and
maybe<00:00:24.060> there<00:00:26.119> it<00:00:27.119> should<00:00:27.300> see<00:00:27.480> one<00:00:27.660> rise<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.650> I

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
maybe there it should see one rise and I

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.330 
maybe there it should see one rise and I
might<00:00:29.099> be<00:00:29.130> able<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.369> cast<00:00:29.550> off<00:00:31.040> so<00:00:32.040> let's<00:00:32.219> see

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
might be able to cast off so let's see

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:48.790 
might be able to cast off so let's see
what<00:00:32.460> happens
