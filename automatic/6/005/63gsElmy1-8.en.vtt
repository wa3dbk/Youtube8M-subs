00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
chef Madison said anyway let's look at

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.350 
chef Madison said anyway let's look at
that<00:02:11.150> look<00:02:11.720> at<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:12.459> we<00:02:13.459> did<00:02:13.640> what<00:02:13.909> we<00:02:14.030> did<00:02:14.209> do

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
that look at that we did what we did do

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.130 
that look at that we did what we did do
earlier<00:02:14.690> that<00:02:14.900> we<00:02:14.989> didn't<00:02:15.260> say<00:02:15.440> we<00:02:15.680> did<00:02:17.140> we

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
earlier that we didn't say we did we

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.899 
earlier that we didn't say we did we
dried<00:02:18.379> out<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.769> tobacco<00:02:19.099> just<00:02:19.489> a<00:02:19.549> little<00:02:19.790> bit

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
dried out the tobacco just a little bit

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.520 
dried out the tobacco just a little bit
to<00:02:20.090> kind<00:02:20.209> of<00:02:20.360> open<00:02:20.629> it<00:02:20.989> and<00:02:21.110> put<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.349> on<00:02:21.440> the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
to kind of open it and put it on the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.100 
to kind of open it and put it on the
paper<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:22.010> way<00:02:22.159> it<00:02:22.250> would<00:02:22.569> kind<00:02:23.569> of<00:02:23.690> dry<00:02:24.080> out

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
paper that way it would kind of dry out

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.839 
paper that way it would kind of dry out
that<00:02:24.409> way<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.560> would<00:02:24.650> absorb<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:25.579> vanilla

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
that way it would absorb the vanilla

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.240 
that way it would absorb the vanilla
extract

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
extract

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.770 
extract
so<00:02:28.250> hopefully<00:02:28.489> this<00:02:28.909> works<00:02:29.150> out<00:02:29.390> good<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.940> does

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
so hopefully this works out good it does

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.720 
so hopefully this works out good it does
actually<00:02:32.989> smell<00:02:33.349> good<00:02:33.500> from<00:02:33.709> far<00:02:33.739> away<00:02:34.010> yeah<00:02:34.700> I

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.920 
actually smell good from far away yeah I
don't<00:02:34.909> know<00:02:35.090> how<00:02:35.239> much<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.599> should<00:02:35.780> actually

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
don't know how much I should actually

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.690 
don't know how much I should actually
put<00:02:36.200> on<00:02:36.349> this<00:02:36.470> is<00:02:36.620> this<00:02:36.739> outer<00:02:37.220> part<00:02:37.670> is<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:40.640> a

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
put on this is this outer part is it a

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.020 
put on this is this outer part is it a
big<00:02:40.940> clump<00:02:41.150> right<00:02:41.269> there<00:02:41.510> oh<00:02:42.190> yeah<00:02:43.190> let's<00:02:43.790> see

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
big clump right there oh yeah let's see

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.690 
big clump right there oh yeah let's see
here<00:02:44.470> we<00:02:45.470> don't<00:02:45.620> want<00:02:45.859> it<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.010> be<00:02:46.099> like<00:02:46.280> our<00:02:46.459> dip

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
here we don't want it to be like our dip

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.970 
here we don't want it to be like our dip
that<00:02:46.910> turned<00:02:47.090> into<00:02:47.239> mud<00:02:47.569> yeah<00:02:48.140> so<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.560> think<00:02:48.739> a

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
that turned into mud yeah so I think a

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.069 
that turned into mud yeah so I think a
frontage<00:02:49.489> is<00:02:49.819> probably<00:02:50.150> not<00:02:50.359> good<00:02:50.660> I<00:02:50.690> mean<00:02:50.959> if

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
frontage is probably not good I mean if

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.170 
frontage is probably not good I mean if
you<00:02:51.200> look<00:02:51.410> at<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.829> it's<00:02:52.459> pretty<00:02:52.519> moist<00:02:52.879> now

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
you look at it it's pretty moist now

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.380 
you look at it it's pretty moist now
it's<00:02:53.569> pretty<00:02:53.870> moist<00:02:54.849> doesn't<00:02:55.849> quite<00:02:55.970> stick<00:02:56.269> to

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
it's pretty moist doesn't quite stick to

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.589 
it's pretty moist doesn't quite stick to
your<00:02:56.480> fingers<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:57.109> think<00:02:57.859> maybe<00:02:58.040> we<00:02:58.280> did<00:02:58.609> smells
