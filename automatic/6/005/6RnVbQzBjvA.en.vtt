00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
this exercise is called sixteenth note

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.540 
this exercise is called sixteenth note
timing<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.449> as<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.470> name<00:00:25.650> suggests<00:00:25.890> we're

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
timing and as the name suggests we're

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.250 
timing and as the name suggests we're
learning<00:00:26.699> how<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.090> utilize<00:00:27.720> different

learning how to utilize different

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.839 
learning how to utilize different
rhythmic<00:00:28.529> patterns<00:00:29.070> within<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.460> sixteenth

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
rhythmic patterns within a sixteenth

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.359 
rhythmic patterns within a sixteenth
note<00:00:29.910> format<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.470> all<00:00:31.650> based<00:00:31.890> upon<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
note format this is all based upon the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.280 
note format this is all based upon the
straight<00:00:32.610> sticking<00:00:33.000> system<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.600> that

straight sticking system in that

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.160 
straight sticking system in that
sticking<00:00:34.800> method<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:36.000> right<00:00:36.239> hand<00:00:36.480> plays<00:00:36.660> any

plays<00:00:41.700> any<00:00:42.090> instance<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.750> e<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.290> up<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
plays any instance of e and up the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.340 
plays any instance of e and up the
reason<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:45.300> utilizing<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:46.079> type<00:00:46.320> of

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
reason for utilizing this type of

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.729 
reason for utilizing this type of
sticking<00:00:46.860> system<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.329> gain<00:00:48.899> consistency

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
sticking system is to gain consistency

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.490 
sticking system is to gain consistency
with<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.430> battery<00:00:50.730> sound<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:52.020> unify<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
with the battery sound to unify the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.920 
with the battery sound to unify the
battery<00:00:53.010> sound<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.449> make<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> little

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
battery sound and to make it a little

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.599 
battery sound and to make it a little
bit<00:00:55.050> easier<00:00:55.469> for<00:00:55.710> them<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.980> read<00:00:56.190> their<00:00:56.430> music

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.030 

the<00:01:02.609> bass<00:01:02.789> drum<00:01:03.059> part<00:01:03.329> utilizes<00:01:04.110> one<00:01:04.769> beat<00:01:05.010> of

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the bass drum part utilizes one beat of

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:15.880 
the bass drum part utilizes one beat of
sixteenth<00:01:05.610> notes<00:01:05.880> traded<00:01:06.360> from<00:01:06.540> drum<00:01:06.780> -<00:01:06.900> drum

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.890 

this<00:01:16.890> gives<00:01:17.159> us<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.460> good<00:01:17.700> solid<00:01:17.909> foundation<00:01:18.270> to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
this gives us a good solid foundation to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.260 
this gives us a good solid foundation to
lay<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.740> other<00:01:19.920> sixteenth<00:01:20.460> note<00:01:20.670> patterns<00:01:21.060> on

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
lay the other sixteenth note patterns on

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.870 
lay the other sixteenth note patterns on
top<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:22.880> notice<00:01:23.880> how<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.750> stroke<00:01:25.229> moves

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
top of notice how the stroke moves

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.149 
top of notice how the stroke moves
within<00:01:26.880> each<00:01:27.000> grouping<00:01:27.479> one<00:01:28.320> hand<00:01:28.619> plays<00:01:28.890> two

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
within each grouping one hand plays two

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.609 
within each grouping one hand plays two

strokes and the other hand only plays
one<00:01:31.950> stroke<00:01:32.479> you'll<00:01:33.479> notice<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.079> our<00:01:34.560> front

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
one stroke you'll notice that our front

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.789 
one stroke you'll notice that our front
ensemble<00:01:35.400> technique<00:01:35.820> has<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.259> single
