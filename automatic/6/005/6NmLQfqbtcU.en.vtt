 First of all 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.140
 I'm going to make a crease 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.550
 Something like this 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.730
 We get off the operation so as to match the in the center it is After the navel 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.650
 In addition it is And then 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.650
 I will try to match this center 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.000
 What in the blood vessel 15 centimeters 15 centimeters origami 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.800
 I When You're pretty scattered third place 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.800
 That sumo wrestler can do it 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:40.280
 Because 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:45.880
 Oh, it's a little bit more hokkie- how to make origami 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.880
 Cheap to I do not might Well Atondemo fun tilt 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.820
 Then 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.870
 I turn over from here 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.190
 I 've got it turned over 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.190
 This left and right operation 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.360
 I 'm in the center to buy 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.130
 this 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.130
 Pull out the back part 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.670
 It has the opposite in 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.670
 Behind the Ettoko say they're going two dogs Orazu 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.580
 What 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.580
 It looks like a simple squid so far 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.550
 Then you have a corner on this 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.550
 this 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.390
 I will go down to the bottom 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.319
 It's below this, it's just this split point 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.500
 A little 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:10.010
 It is also meeting at this time 5 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.660
 I'm jumping out on top of that at the end 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.660
 Please leave this as is 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.640
 It's from here and turned over 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:39.049
 The lower corner 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.049
 I just go to the part that overlaps with the back 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:56.730
 It is your their Shitara 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:59.360
 I'm going to make a crease so that the upper corner of this one matches the lower one. 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.360
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.930
 First of all try to freeze the upper corner 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.990
 This is also the opposite 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.990
 In the same way 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:22.389
 It looks like this makes a crease 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.340
 In that part of that child then that cross 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:28.440
 So you 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.440
 Well I I can cage eyes 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.700
 If you can do this 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.820
 Sumo wrestler 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.820
 In half 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.380
 I am 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:43.489
 So here's the fold 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.700
 in this way 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.700
 Kind of like bulge can I back 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:57.930
 Yes this 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.930
 Evil is also completed 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:09.199
 It's a date I showed it first I 'm noble I'm different I guess this 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:15.190
 Oh, now I'm 15 cm paper and is usually sold normally 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:16.470
 It was a general size, so I tried to make it . 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.120
 Wonder 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.120
 I tried to make it 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.780
 Wintering 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:27.390
 Even if the sound is made with 17.5 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:32.080
 Because the room to wait for is completely necessitating 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:35.689
 It was 15 centimeters since the dive becomes tiny 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:40.860
 I said in the middle of 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:42.720
 I think it is good to try making with a rather large origami instead of 15 cm 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.950
 Then I will 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:50.280
 Well two side by side 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:52.900
 Tomato glacier diameter 20 cm 20 cm circle 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.699
 I think that is just right 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.699
 Thank you for watching
