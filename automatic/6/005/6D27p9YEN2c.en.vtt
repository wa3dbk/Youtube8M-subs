00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.380
 hello all friends with you produce today 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:12.179
 feeder candychan but versions 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:14.710
 095 094 bottom and later versions 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.100
 mechanism called motion sensor dollars 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:22.689
 as you know on the obverse 095 in between 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.699
 it's time to put pressure on the torch sand and 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:29.980
 it was eyes hard with these 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:32.290
 mechanisms a in 172 to from this version 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.250
 who now play only mechanism 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.870
 pointer to the mat put a sign and 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.440
 it is also true sausages sad as 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.890
 the mechanism is built therefore the principle of freud 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.780
 thought and thought and think something 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.910
 turned out so forest beast 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:54.129
 but faster we will wait a little in this corner 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.420
 that opens up even create here 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:01.090
 call any flower 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:04.080
 new versions of 095 taken 30 so let's 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.299
 I will show how jihadism is built 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.680
 This is how our mechanism looks 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:15.250
 side and builds like this in this 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.520
 the corner in which approached ragged hurts 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.939
 so here we are doing just such a track 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.780
 here to me red torch so far 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:28.330
 the parties will be all two days that 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.310
 activating services but for now take a number of 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:36.040
 there is a red torch 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:39.280
 it would be convenient to know here yet qa2 end 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.220
 of our rails we put any animals 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.310
 that is, the best will be reduced to or box 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.310
 further stands acutely and that such a platform 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.370
 10 specially showed inside the cup 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.830
 end of our rails 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.550
 and a quick google platform like both 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.930
 put a cactus here put a simple 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:05.630
 ground accumulation 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:08.520
 and there also is pok that this camera 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.850
 melts ice well there might be 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:17.960
 simple ice is not here there are two kinds 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:21.010
 there is thick ice this is such a tone of it 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.350
 hard to melt the wax melts 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.450
 next here is a mat on the mat 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.629
 put the sand 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.319
 on the sand you see so signs and 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:36.800
 spend here to our construction here 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.750
 here where we stood sand on so 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.820
 this here 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:47.990
 and there are already three blocks put our sand and 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.610
 there is a chest there is such a mechanism 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.120
 like put and write 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.170
 comments and dumped the sprout good luck to all 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.170
 bye
