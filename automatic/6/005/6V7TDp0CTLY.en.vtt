thinking<00:01:04.879> we're<00:01:05.180> developing<00:01:05.720> a<00:01:05.869> solid<00:01:06.830> two

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
thinking we're developing a solid two

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.730 
thinking we're developing a solid two
deep<00:01:07.570> back<00:01:08.570> there<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:09.050> then<00:01:09.200> I<00:01:09.290> think<00:01:09.530> that

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
deep back there and then I think that

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.020 
deep back there and then I think that
you<00:01:10.220> know<00:01:10.340> Robert<00:01:11.090> Smithson<00:01:11.570> his<00:01:11.720> own<00:01:11.869> league

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
you know Robert Smithson his own league

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.030 
you know Robert Smithson his own league
right<00:01:14.030> now<00:01:14.060> I<00:01:14.510> think<00:01:14.810> he's<00:01:14.930> playing<00:01:15.259> really

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
right now I think he's playing really

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.240
