00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.950
 cents we see that the game is loading 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.620
 the game is something like a computer 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.540
 version of assassin's creed 4 black flag but 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.370
 However , the developer says that this 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.770
 completely except where they do not look like 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.809
 nothing on each other in this game 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.700
 only like now 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.110
 the computer version of the game is what we have 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.539
 here the ships have a big map on 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.550
 which we can swim have 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.370
 captain have a ship ship can 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.289
 improve and 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.629
 perfection can be in the battles that is fighting with 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.939
 other pirates with other assassins with 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.979
 other templar my earn 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.350
 gold and pump our ship that is 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.260
 in principle everything is very logical everything is very 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.729
 just in the game we will meet with such 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.150
 famous pirates like black beard 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.369
 black sam bellamy penza exactly the roots 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.619
 golden and others i don't know these names 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.869
 and I just read them just 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.630
 Generally there's a campaign going on loading 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.619
 this is our ship we sink some 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.340
 the templar is good at 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.680
 go to i'm music so this is the background 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.530
 let's go back when we are already the most 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.360
 the game and so i'm already sailing to my first 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.180
 the booty on me is right over there 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.009
 right in front of the ship's nose and and won 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.590
 management is very simple we have two 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.939
 buttons one lowers speed 2 boosts 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.430
 speed from snatches can turn 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.409
 in this way with a wipe left right 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.090
 that is, everything is very simple let's click 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.890
 on the ship so we will make it clear 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.390
 the team that we attack and start 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.160
 graphics so 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:12.569
 here we have guns let's go for them 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:14.000
 okay so I understand it on a carbine she told me 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.050
 aim 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.500
 went reload hockey good shot 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.920
 so go quickly reload the ship 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.180
 We will be pumping with you so on this 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.290
 rate of husband principle is not 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.360
 pay attention because with 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.100
 passing it will increase boo 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.810
 add new shells and all sorts of 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.480
 improvement on the ship is now the turn 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:42.540
 of our rival let's hit this 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.830
 button and he missed the perfect coin then 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:50.430
 there is such a way we can 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:51.840
 avoid these maneuvers everything is left 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.230
 just a little bit to finish this 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:01.110
 ship and this dude zadolbal me 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:03.330
 let's tella broads our friend 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.620
 on a small ship there are only 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.500
 one shot soon I would have 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:12.000
 recharged and now it's his turn 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.180
 from the first strike is now our turn 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.220
 and this this last shot is photo 5 by 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.600
 idea broads yes yes he went to the world that is 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.940
 look stylish amazing graphics i 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.610
 I think people who played assasins 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.739
 creed black flag on computers will appreciate 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.959
 This game I am a fan of this series will therefore 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.079
 year i think and on iphone so now 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.750
 let's get everything out of 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.610
 ships that later could use it 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.730
 to improve performance 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:46.850
 of our own ship looking for prey booty 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.850
 scattered all over the water surface and 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.860
 where there is still 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.860
 we all collected all the booty that we have 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.329
 you had 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.190
 as for shop ships in this 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.170
 the game here ships a lot and they 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.820
 differ in the characteristics they cost 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.230
 gold coins which we will earn 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.970
 by passing this game and 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.680
 accordingly if our level is not 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.120
 match the level for this ship we 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.610
 it can not buy that is the principle 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.710
 everything is also very simple and you just need 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.780
 drive in not swim and 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.310
 this game that is to pass this game and 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.960
 we can buy new ones 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.850
 ships accordingly also have 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.130
 shop with improvements already for 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.470
 existing ships here as we can 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.480
 pump our skill and all that spirit 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.480
 that is, the game is rich in this part 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.120
 pumping and think those people who love 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.590
 pumping she also really like it here 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.510
 somehow games which is available on 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.910
 the initial stage with the passage is a map 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.680
 will be very big and so we can 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.170
 move on it as we want here 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.330
 honestly need to come to this zone let's and 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.160
 touch select sails and 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.290
 and we see that we have to our ship was 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.570
 at that point, that is, there will now be 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.150
 completely new story if we are with you 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.770
 in the scrap play to the point of destination then just 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.750
 We can just move this swipe 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.360
 Our ship to the educational sign to 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.580
 our mission and basically imitate everything 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.650
 victory ship will come to you become another 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.180
 sign that is here in this way we 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.750
 you come on a mission, and it can 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.850
 start let's get ahead in the game very 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.670
 beautiful graphics very beautiful water and 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.380
 beautiful animation that is in terms of 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.440
 graphics this game is fully justified 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.170
 its value in the appstore 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.540
 send these screensavers again so let's 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.780
 just skip raise the sail and 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.490
 follow on byuzand let's be for 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.130
 him to follow what else liked in the game 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.470
 what ships can see us 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.080
 completely in this way and the wheel 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.080
 just be in such a big format 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.570
 at the bottom of the screen we have to follow 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:49.860
 our ally that we principle will 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:53.350
 do when now don't knock off and 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.720
 inadvertently when guys really 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.090
 management is very simple and 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.760
 principle, you can play without joysticks without 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:03.010
 all of which have already been released although I 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:07.090
 so far only there are two magicians and hooves 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:11.170
 from logitek we sailed on a mission in the game 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.610
 10 cool screensavers in principle this 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.620
 can be skipped gradually and along the way 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.750
 we will be with our ally to drown this 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.550
 Quran in the game a lot of any modes 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.320
 now my goal is to find this one 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.030
 the ship here is my ship must pave 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.310
 course and not catch your eye 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.740
 an enemy who's here and so like 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:32.990
 swimming and looking for me let me sail to 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:35.180
 I found him to my ally so now 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.040
 have to go through some screensavers yes here 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.250
 where are we going to 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:44.570
 and now we have to destroy these 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:48.830
 let's ships under the reception to them and now 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:57.130
 we plunge into battle now start again with 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:57.130
 ourselves so we drove something 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.800

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:06.540
