dependent<00:03:26.169> on<00:03:26.230> each<00:03:26.319> other<00:03:26.470> so<00:03:27.370> I'll<00:03:27.519> just

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
dependent on each other so I'll just

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.490 
dependent on each other so I'll just
unzip<00:03:28.299> mine<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.720> downloads<00:03:30.750> all<00:03:31.750> right<00:03:31.959> so<00:03:32.319> we

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
unzip mine to downloads all right so we

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.780 
unzip mine to downloads all right so we
have<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:32.889> here
