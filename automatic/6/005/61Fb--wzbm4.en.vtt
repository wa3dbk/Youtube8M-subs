probably<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:15.920> know<00:03:15.950> my<00:03:16.340> take<00:03:16.580> on<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:16.959> it

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
probably you know my take on it is it

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.020 
probably you know my take on it is it
slows<00:03:18.319> the<00:03:18.470> mash<00:03:18.620> down<00:03:18.860> it<00:03:19.489> takes<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.849> match

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
slows the mash down it takes a match

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.729 
slows the mash down it takes a match
that's<00:03:20.269> six<00:03:20.480> minutes<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:20.989> turns<00:03:21.470> it<00:03:21.650> into

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
that's six minutes and turns it into

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:22.960 
that's six minutes and turns it into
really<00:03:22.129> like<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.310> minute<00:03:22.610> a<00:03:22.670> half<00:03:22.819> or<00:03:22.940> two

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
really like a minute a half or two

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.580 
really like a minute a half or two
minutes<00:03:23.360> because<00:03:23.750> then<00:03:24.019> you<00:03:24.140> get<00:03:24.290> to<00:03:24.349> the<00:03:24.500> end

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
minutes because then you get to the end

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.229 
minutes because then you get to the end
where<00:03:24.830> there's<00:03:25.340> less<00:03:25.549> of<00:03:25.610> that<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:25.970> someone's

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
where there's less of that and someone's

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.559 
where there's less of that and someone's
