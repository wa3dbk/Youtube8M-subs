my purpose this for those who don't know

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.330 
my purpose this for those who don't know
this<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.050> sensor<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.800> comes<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.189> we

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
this is the sensor that comes to the we

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.660 
this is the sensor that comes to the we
that<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.030> see<00:00:33.239> your<00:00:33.980> your<00:00:34.980> pointer<00:00:35.520> on

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
that so you can see your your pointer on

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.130 
that so you can see your your pointer on
the<00:00:35.700> screen<00:00:37.370> this<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.579> actually<00:00:39.149> not<00:00:39.719> sending

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
the screen this is actually not sending

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.840 
the screen this is actually not sending
any<00:00:40.320> information<00:00:40.980> back<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.160> your<00:00:41.340> Wii<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> lot

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
any information back to your Wii a lot

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.610 
any information back to your Wii a lot
of<00:00:41.910> people<00:00:42.120> think<00:00:42.329> oh<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.750> sensor<00:00:43.140> bar<00:00:43.290> closed

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
of people think oh the sensor bar closed

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.500 
of people think oh the sensor bar closed
in<00:00:43.770> well<00:00:43.950> be<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.640> feed<00:00:44.879> information<00:00:45.149> to

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
in well be so it can feed information to

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.600 
in well be so it can feed information to
it<00:00:46.579> sorta<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:48.300> not<00:00:48.539> really<00:00:49.160> what<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.340> does

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
it sorta but not really what this does

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.650 
it sorta but not really what this does
is<00:00:51.090> it's<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.600> series<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:52.020> infrared<00:00:52.680> LEDs<00:00:53.219> that

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
is it's a series of infrared LEDs that

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.479 
is it's a series of infrared LEDs that
your<00:00:54.660> Wii<00:00:54.870> mode<00:00:55.079> actually<00:00:55.320> sees<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.280> can

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
your Wii mode actually sees and so can

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.990 
your Wii mode actually sees and so can
gauge<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.059> X<00:00:57.539> Y<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:58.170> know<00:00:58.289> Z<00:00:58.590> distance<00:00:59.280> from

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
gauge the X Y you know Z distance from

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.500 
gauge the X Y you know Z distance from
your<00:01:00.210> TV<00:01:00.710> which<00:01:01.710> allows<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:03.000> pointer<00:01:03.390> to

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
your TV which allows for that pointer to

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.690 
your TV which allows for that pointer to
operate<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.140> knows<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.799> know<00:01:04.920> exactly<00:01:05.460> where

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
operate so knows you know exactly where

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.000 
operate so knows you know exactly where
it<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:06.960> actually<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.260> very<00:01:07.650> simple

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
it is so it's actually a very simple

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.260 
it is so it's actually a very simple
product<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.630> batteries<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:10.890> has

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
product it's just batteries this one has

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.380 
product it's just batteries this one has
four<00:01:12.740> double<00:01:13.740> a's<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.340> comes<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.090> it

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
four double a's in it comes with it

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.380 
four double a's in it comes with it
and<00:01:16.040> it's<00:01:17.040> supposed<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.520> read<00:01:17.729> for<00:01:18.090> 30

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and it's supposed to be read for 30

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.749 
and it's supposed to be read for 30

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
plastic case with batteries maybe a say

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.850 
plastic case with batteries maybe a say
or<00:02:11.160> something<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.879> might<00:02:11.970> set<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.300> apart

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
or something that might set this apart

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.730 
or something that might set this apart
back<00:02:14.100> here<00:02:14.340> as<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:16.400> would<00:02:17.400> do<00:02:17.670> as<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.330> timer<00:02:19.110> no

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
back here as a would do as a timer no

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.320 
back here as a would do as a timer no
focus<00:02:20.310> okay

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
focus okay

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.390 
focus okay
it<00:02:21.780> does<00:02:21.930> say<00:02:22.110> timer<00:02:22.410> there<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.890> then<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.100> says

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
it does say timer there and then it says

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.750 
it does say timer there and then it says
off<00:02:23.910> one<00:02:24.750> hour<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.170> two<00:02:25.350> hour<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.250> can<00:02:26.370> set

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
off one hour and two hour so you can set

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.810 
off one hour and two hour so you can set
this<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.500> automatically<00:02:28.500> shut<00:02:28.830> off<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:29.340> an

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
this to automatically shut off in an

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.030 
this to automatically shut off in an
hour<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.360> now<00:02:31.110> this<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.620> actually<00:02:31.710> kind<00:02:32.010> of
