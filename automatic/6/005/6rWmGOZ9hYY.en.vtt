really<00:04:00.100> problematic<00:04:00.310> it's<00:04:00.940> just<00:04:01.090> not<00:04:01.360> a<00:04:01.390> very

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
really problematic it's just not a very

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.950 
really problematic it's just not a very
big<00:04:01.900> interface<00:04:02.440> overall<00:04:03.270> but<00:04:04.270> thankfully

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
big interface overall but thankfully

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.580 
big interface overall but thankfully
it'll<00:04:05.290> be<00:04:05.440> a<00:04:06.060> smooth<00:04:07.060> data<00:04:07.300> comes<00:04:08.200> out<00:04:08.380> to

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
it'll be a smooth data comes out to
