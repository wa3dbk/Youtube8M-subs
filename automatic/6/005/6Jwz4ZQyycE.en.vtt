because<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.000> Gears<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.299> War<00:01:06.390> or<00:01:06.750> when<00:01:07.020> you're

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
because in Gears of War or when you're

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.960 
because in Gears of War or when you're
using<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.500> turret<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.010> Halo<00:01:08.250> 4<00:01:08.610> you're

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
using the turret in Halo 4 you're

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.170 
using the turret in Halo 4 you're
looking<00:01:09.390> over<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.869> right<00:01:10.320> shoulder<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.490> your

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
looking over the right shoulder of your

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.690 
looking over the right shoulder of your
player<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:13.020> if<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.229> take<00:01:13.470> cover<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> left

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
player so if you take cover on a left

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.050 
player so if you take cover on a left
wall<00:01:15.060> then<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.229> don't<00:01:16.530> actually<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.850> to

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
wall then it you don't actually have to

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.910 
wall then it you don't actually have to
expose<00:01:18.600> yourself<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.110> look<00:01:19.439> around<00:01:19.710> that

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
expose yourself to look around that

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.440 
expose yourself to look around that
corner<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.670> stand<00:01:21.030> behind<00:01:21.240> that

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
corner you can just stand behind that

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.960 
corner you can just stand behind that
corner<00:01:21.840> no<00:01:22.409> one<00:01:22.680> knows<00:01:22.920> you're<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.610> you

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
corner no one knows you're there and you

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.630 
corner no one knows you're there and you
can<00:01:24.119> see<00:01:24.479> all<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.780> way<00:01:25.409> past<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.130> thing<00:01:26.430> all

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
can see all the way past that thing all

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.960 
can see all the way past that thing all
the<00:01:27.180> way<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.979> be<00:01:29.009> really<00:01:29.400> useful<00:01:29.430> now

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
the way so that can be really useful now

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.550 
the way so that can be really useful now
in<00:01:30.150> Gears<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.540> War<00:01:30.659> there's<00:01:31.079> all<00:01:31.320> these<00:01:31.500> little

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
in Gears of War there's all these little

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.770 
in Gears of War there's all these little
perfect<00:01:32.220> blocks<00:01:32.579> set<00:01:32.909> up<00:01:32.939> for<00:01:33.270> cover<00:01:33.540> so

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
perfect blocks set up for cover so

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.899 
perfect blocks set up for cover so
there's<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.079> lot<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.290> really<00:01:34.950> useful<00:01:34.979> places<00:01:35.640> to

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
there's a lot of really useful places to

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.609 
there's a lot of really useful places to
actually<00:01:36.329> take<00:01:36.540> advantage<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.560> a

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
actually take advantage of this and a

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.270 
actually take advantage of this and a
halo<00:01:37.770> 4<00:01:38.189> not<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.630> much<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.979> some

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
halo 4 not so much but in some

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.330 
halo 4 not so much but in some
situations<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.720> be<00:01:43.500> quite<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.920> bit<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.220> an

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
situations it can be quite a bit of an

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.700 
situations it can be quite a bit of an
advantage<00:01:44.579> not<00:01:45.420> only<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.140> taking<00:01:46.560> cover

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
advantage not only just for taking cover

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.679 
advantage not only just for taking cover
but<00:01:46.950> also<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.220> checking<00:01:47.880> around<00:01:47.970> corners<00:01:48.540> to

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
but also just checking around corners to

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.480 
but also just checking around corners to
see<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:48.930> there's<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.170> really<00:01:49.470> annoying<00:01:49.950> bolt

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
see if there's a really annoying bolt

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.510 
see if there's a really annoying bolt
shot<00:01:50.880> camper<00:01:51.390> kid<00:01:51.659> behind<00:01:52.409> there<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.220> can<00:01:53.399> be

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
shot camper kid behind there that can be

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.639 
shot camper kid behind there that can be
pretty<00:01:53.850> useful<00:01:53.939> as<00:01:54.390> well<00:01:54.570> another<00:01:55.200> tip<00:01:55.439> would

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
pretty useful as well another tip would

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
lazy but you could theoretically uh turn

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.259 
lazy but you could theoretically uh turn
up<00:03:01.769> your<00:03:01.920> sensitivity<00:03:02.700> while<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:03.030> have<00:03:03.150> the

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
up your sensitivity while you have the

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.390 
up your sensitivity while you have the
turret<00:03:03.599> because<00:03:03.870> well<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.349> do<00:03:04.560> move<00:03:04.890> faster

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
turret because well you do move faster

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.210 
turret because well you do move faster
your<00:03:05.849> aim<00:03:06.269> sensitivity<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.410> still<00:03:07.680> like<00:03:07.950> way

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
your aim sensitivity is still like way

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.900 
your aim sensitivity is still like way
slowed<00:03:08.730> down<00:03:08.970> an<00:03:09.180> all<00:03:09.390> sluggish<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.459> so<00:03:11.459> you

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
slowed down an all sluggish and so you

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.490 
slowed down an all sluggish and so you
could<00:03:12.150> turn<00:03:12.390> up<00:03:12.599> your<00:03:12.720> sensitivity<00:03:13.260> wall

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
could turn up your sensitivity wall

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.470 
could turn up your sensitivity wall
using<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.950> turret<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.580> kind<00:03:14.910> of<00:03:15.000> make<00:03:15.209> it<00:03:15.239> a

one<00:04:03.989> thing<00:04:04.319> you<00:04:04.470> can<00:04:04.650> do<00:04:04.889> to<00:04:04.920> get<00:04:05.250> around

faster<00:04:06.060> with<00:04:06.359> the<00:04:06.389> turret<00:04:06.930> is<00:04:07.079> kind<00:04:08.040> of

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
faster with the turret is kind of

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.699 
faster with the turret is kind of
running<00:04:08.459> it<00:04:08.609> like<00:04:08.639> you<00:04:08.970> would<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.450> flag<00:04:09.959> in<00:04:10.290> the

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
running it like you would a flag in the

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.860 
running it like you would a flag in the
previous<00:04:11.040> games<00:04:11.400> where<00:04:11.639> you<00:04:11.700> jump<00:04:12.060> drop<00:04:12.690> the

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
previous games where you jump drop the

jump<00:04:16.560> drop<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:16.979> turret<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.370> you<00:04:17.669> can<00:04:17.820> get

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
jump drop the turret and you can get

around<00:04:18.180> a<00:04:18.329> little<00:04:18.479> bit<00:04:18.630> quicker<00:04:18.840> there<00:04:19.079> but

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
around a little bit quicker there but

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.990 
around a little bit quicker there but
it's<00:04:19.680> just<00:04:19.829> a<00:04:19.919> lot<00:04:20.070> better<00:04:20.340> if<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:20.700> use<00:04:20.729> the

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
it's just a lot better if you use the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.750
