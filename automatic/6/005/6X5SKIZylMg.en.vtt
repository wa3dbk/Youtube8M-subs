00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.020
 I bring you a little trick for the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.059
 against strike 1.6 this trick is for the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.580
 money many times you will have noticed that 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.710
 you start with 800 dollars but with the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.350
 next trick you will start with the money 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.359
 maximum that is 16,000 forgive me if in 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.930
 some time the video looks slow and 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.460
 that my pc is slow good let's start 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.980
 hear I just remembered that I'll put a 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.019
 extra how to put more than 32 players 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.990
 in the counter strike excuse the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.360
 annoyances very well we will start with the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.989
 trick of the players first we go 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.989
 a new game 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.030
 As you can see I have 50 players right now 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:50.170
 but only 32 good will come out first 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:54.120
 we put 50 we go to game and in max 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.120
 players we put the number 50 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.770
 now we go with the trick of money in 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.840
 where it says starting money we put 16,000 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.710
 or the number they want to start in 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.710
 the counter strike 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.820
 now let's see if it worked 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.240
 excuse me as I said I'm sorry today 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.310
 very slow it must be for the amount of 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.310
 pages and things downloaded xd 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.550

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.690

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.690
