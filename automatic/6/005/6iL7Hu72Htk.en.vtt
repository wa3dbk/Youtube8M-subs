00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
was really important to us

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.750 
was really important to us
make<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.410> single<00:02:15.890> player<00:02:16.070> experience<00:02:16.100> but

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
but to have that ability you can

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.870 
but to have that ability you can
certainly<00:02:18.560> play<00:02:18.680> single<00:02:19.070> player<00:02:19.100> there's<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:19.580> I

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
certainly play single player there's a I

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.660 
certainly play single player there's a I
assist<00:02:20.360> but<00:02:20.930> if<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:22.100> wanted<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.400> pick<00:02:22.520> up<00:02:22.580> a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
assist but if you wanted to pick up a

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.520 
assist but if you wanted to pick up a
controller<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.210> tag<00:02:23.360> along<00:02:23.600> you<00:02:23.840> do<00:02:23.960> that<00:02:24.110> so

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
controller and tag along you do that so

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.870 
controller and tag along you do that so
has<00:02:24.710> the<00:02:24.860> gameplay<00:02:25.310> differ<00:02:25.520> from<00:02:25.730> each

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
has the gameplay differ from each

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.580 
has the gameplay differ from each
character<00:02:26.300> like<00:02:26.510> between<00:02:26.810> sonic<00:02:27.440> and

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
character like between sonic and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.620 
character like between sonic and
knuckles<00:02:27.620> we<00:02:28.400> saw<00:02:28.550> knuckles<00:02:28.880> can<00:02:29.060> climb<00:02:29.360> in

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
knuckles we saw knuckles can climb in

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.300 
knuckles we saw knuckles can climb in
this<00:02:29.750> game<00:02:29.990> what<00:02:30.800> are<00:02:30.890> some<00:02:31.070> of<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.160> other

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
this game what are some of the other

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.190 
this game what are some of the other
differences<00:02:31.640> between<00:02:31.820> each<00:02:32.120> character<00:02:32.510> well

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
differences between each character well

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.330 
differences between each character well
first<00:02:33.440> of<00:02:33.500> all<00:02:33.530> we<00:02:33.680> want<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:33.860> make<00:02:34.010> sure<00:02:34.040> that

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
first of all we want to make sure that

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.240 
first of all we want to make sure that
from<00:02:35.090> a<00:02:35.200> character<00:02:36.200> abilities<00:02:36.650> perspective

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
from a character abilities perspective

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.590 
from a character abilities perspective
and<00:02:37.490> also<00:02:37.550> from<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.000> narrative<00:02:38.300> perspective

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
and also from a narrative perspective

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.170 
and also from a narrative perspective
that<00:02:39.200> they<00:02:39.800> were<00:02:39.860> very<00:02:40.340> much<00:02:40.490> coupled

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
that they were very much coupled

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.750 
that they were very much coupled
together<00:02:41.300> so<00:02:41.810> each<00:02:42.320> character<00:02:42.830> has<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:43.130> very

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
together so each character has a very

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.540 
together so each character has a very
specific<00:02:43.970> personality<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:45.400> attributes<00:02:46.400> that

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
specific personality and attributes that

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
that that goes into their navigation

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.700 
that that goes into their navigation
special<00:02:51.230> moves<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.830> also<00:02:52.130> combat<00:02:53.170> tales<00:02:54.170> for

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
certain characters team up is there a

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.530 
certain characters team up is there a
difference<00:03:56.959> in<00:03:57.680> gameplay<00:03:57.800> like<00:03:58.580> Sonic<00:03:59.420> and

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
difference in gameplay like Sonic and

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.910 
difference in gameplay like Sonic and
Tails<00:03:59.570> team<00:03:59.990> up<00:04:00.110> in<00:04:00.230> to<00:04:00.290> feel<00:04:00.500> like<00:04:00.620> more<00:04:00.770> of<00:04:00.800> a

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
Tails team up in to feel like more of a

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.380 
Tails team up in to feel like more of a
like<00:04:01.100> a<00:04:01.160> buddy<00:04:01.310> buddy<00:04:01.580> kind<00:04:01.820> of<00:04:01.910> thing<00:04:02.060> is<00:04:02.180> most

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
like a buddy buddy kind of thing is most

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.080 
like a buddy buddy kind of thing is most
like<00:04:02.570> a<00:04:02.600> knuckles<00:04:03.190> sonic<00:04:04.190> team<00:04:04.490> up<00:04:04.670> yes

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
like a knuckles sonic team up yes

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.510 
like a knuckles sonic team up yes
they're<00:04:05.420> definitely<00:04:05.830> part<00:04:06.830> of<00:04:06.860> a<00:04:06.950> matrix<00:04:07.100> of

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
they're definitely part of a matrix of

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.820 
they're definitely part of a matrix of
different<00:04:08.090> personalities<00:04:08.660> you<00:04:08.840> know<00:04:09.320> sonic

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
different personalities you know sonic

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.420 
different personalities you know sonic
is<00:04:10.640> different<00:04:11.060> in<00:04:11.900> attitude<00:04:12.440> and<00:04:12.770> treats

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
is different in attitude and treats

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.920 
is different in attitude and treats
tails<00:04:13.700> differently<00:04:14.120> than<00:04:14.300> he<00:04:14.390> would<00:04:14.510> knuckles

tails differently than he would knuckles
there's<00:04:15.140> a<00:04:15.200> bit<00:04:15.410> more<00:04:15.440> competition<00:04:16.040> between

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
there's a bit more competition between

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.070 
there's a bit more competition between
t2<00:04:16.480> so<00:04:17.480> there<00:04:18.140> is<00:04:18.320> that<00:04:18.350> fun<00:04:18.799> aspect<00:04:19.340> of<00:04:19.549> a<00:04:19.730> team

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
t2 so there is that fun aspect of a team

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.160 
t2 so there is that fun aspect of a team
set<00:04:21.080> up

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
set up

set up
no<00:04:22.490> it<00:04:23.490> was<00:04:23.640> important<00:04:24.030> for<00:04:24.060> us<00:04:24.210> to<00:04:24.240> make<00:04:24.450> sure

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
no it was important for us to make sure

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.080 
no it was important for us to make sure
that<00:04:24.750> each<00:04:24.900> character<00:04:25.430> really<00:04:26.430> stood<00:04:26.610> out<00:04:26.670> and

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
that each character really stood out and

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.820 
that each character really stood out and
was<00:04:27.300> able<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:28.290> bring<00:04:28.560> something

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
was able to to bring something

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.070 
was able to to bring something
interesting<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:29.640> to<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:29.910> mix<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.390> not

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
interesting to the to the mix and not

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.220 
interesting to the to the mix and not
just<00:04:31.290> simply<00:04:31.470> be<00:04:31.680> subordinate<00:04:32.130> to<00:04:32.190> Sonic<00:04:33.230> and

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
just simply be subordinate to Sonic and

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.540 
just simply be subordinate to Sonic and
we<00:04:34.350> also<00:04:34.500> heard<00:04:34.770> that<00:04:34.830> this<00:04:35.010> game<00:04:35.250> will<00:04:35.370> serve

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
we also heard that this game will serve

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.220 
we also heard that this game will serve
as<00:04:35.670> a<00:04:35.700> prequel<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.450> show<00:04:36.690> he<00:04:36.900> tells<00:04:37.110> us<00:04:37.170> a

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
as a prequel to the show he tells us a

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.930 
as a prequel to the show he tells us a
little<00:04:37.350> bit<00:04:37.470> more<00:04:37.650> about<00:04:37.710> that<00:04:38.070> well<00:04:38.640> I<00:04:38.670> think

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
little bit more about that well I think

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.330 
little bit more about that well I think
that's<00:04:39.300> for<00:04:39.510> later<00:04:39.900> conversation<00:04:40.740> they<00:04:41.190> are

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
that's for later conversation they are

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.780 
that's for later conversation they are
part<00:04:41.580> of<00:04:41.670> same<00:04:41.850> universe<00:04:42.590> so<00:04:43.590> I<00:04:43.980> think<00:04:44.130> that's

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
part of same universe so I think that's

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.790 
part of same universe so I think that's
more<00:04:44.970> for<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.210> TV<00:04:45.390> people<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:45.900> answer<00:04:46.290> all

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
more for the TV people to answer all

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.120 
more for the TV people to answer all
right<00:04:46.890> uh<00:04:47.100> and<00:04:47.640> but<00:04:48.240> on<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.630> universe<00:04:49.130> aspect

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
right uh and but on the universe aspect

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.520 
right uh and but on the universe aspect
so<00:04:50.220> this<00:04:50.370> is<00:04:50.520> a<00:04:50.550> new<00:04:50.760> sonic<00:04:51.210> but<00:04:51.900> it's<00:04:52.230> in<00:04:52.470> a

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
so this is a new sonic but it's in a

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.750 
so this is a new sonic but it's in a
different<00:04:52.650> universe<00:04:53.070> from<00:04:53.340> from<00:04:53.640> our

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
different universe from from our

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.980 
different universe from from our
original<00:04:53.820> song<00:04:54.270> it's<00:04:54.480> like<00:04:54.510> a<00:04:54.600> parallel

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
original song it's like a parallel

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.780 
original song it's like a parallel
universe<00:04:55.020> kind<00:04:55.500> of<00:04:55.560> thing<00:04:55.710> you<00:04:56.280> can<00:04:56.460> think<00:04:56.490> of

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
universe kind of thing you can think of

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.180 
universe kind of thing you can think of
it<00:04:56.880> as<00:04:57.000> that<00:04:57.240> we're<00:04:58.020> really<00:04:58.230> treating<00:04:58.590> it<00:04:58.710> as<00:04:58.920> a

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
it as that we're really treating it as a

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.500 
it as that we're really treating it as a
as<00:04:59.820> a<00:04:59.880> branch<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.930> Canon<00:05:01.790> modern<00:05:02.790> sonic<00:05:03.210> will

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
as a branch to Canon modern sonic will

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.860 
as a branch to Canon modern sonic will
continue<00:05:04.050> on<00:05:04.430> we're<00:05:05.430> not<00:05:05.610> you<00:05:06.210> know<00:05:06.240> replacing

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
continue on we're not you know replacing

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.210 
continue on we're not you know replacing
mom<00:05:07.080> and<00:05:07.260> Sonic<00:05:07.560> and<00:05:07.710> we<00:05:07.770> wouldn't<00:05:08.010> want<00:05:08.070> to

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
mom and Sonic and we wouldn't want to

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.120 
mom and Sonic and we wouldn't want to
it's<00:05:08.520> a<00:05:08.610> it's<00:05:08.790> a<00:05:08.910> great<00:05:09.090> franchise<00:05:09.540> it's<00:05:10.440> so

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
it's a it's a great franchise it's so

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.130 
it's a it's a great franchise it's so
what<00:05:11.850> we're<00:05:12.150> doing<00:05:12.180> is<00:05:12.540> trying<00:05:12.870> something

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
what we're doing is trying something

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.160 
what we're doing is trying something
different<00:05:13.400> and<00:05:14.400> just<00:05:14.880> exploring<00:05:15.570> what<00:05:15.900> other

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
different and just exploring what other

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.170 
different and just exploring what other
options<00:05:16.740> we<00:05:16.950> have<00:05:16.980> for<00:05:17.220> a<00:05:17.580> character<00:05:18.150> that's

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
options we have for a character that's

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.170 
options we have for a character that's
been<00:05:18.570> around<00:05:18.660> for<00:05:18.960> so<00:05:19.080> long<00:05:19.400> if<00:05:20.400> you<00:05:20.580> look<00:05:20.760> at<00:05:20.970> a

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
been around for so long if you look at a

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.780 
been around for so long if you look at a
lot<00:05:21.210> of<00:05:21.420> the<00:05:22.190> franchise's<00:05:23.190> that<00:05:23.520> have<00:05:23.670> been

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
lot of the franchise's that have been

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.900 
lot of the franchise's that have been
around<00:05:23.880> in<00:05:24.240> comic<00:05:24.600> books<00:05:24.810> for<00:05:25.650> example<00:05:26.070> you

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
around in comic books for example you

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.970 
around in comic books for example you
will<00:05:27.030> see<00:05:27.300> a<00:05:27.330> lot<00:05:27.660> of<00:05:27.720> different<00:05:28.110> explorations

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
will see a lot of different explorations

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.360 
will see a lot of different explorations
and<00:05:29.160> experiments<00:05:29.760> and<00:05:29.910> I<00:05:30.510> think<00:05:31.080> Sega<00:05:32.040> should

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
and experiments and I think Sega should

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.580 
and experiments and I think Sega should
be<00:05:32.460> commended<00:05:32.670> for<00:05:32.880> their<00:05:33.120> bravery<00:05:33.330> to<00:05:33.930> step

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
be commended for their bravery to step

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.050 
be commended for their bravery to step
out<00:05:34.740> and<00:05:34.770> try<00:05:35.130> something<00:05:35.160> different<00:05:35.820> with
