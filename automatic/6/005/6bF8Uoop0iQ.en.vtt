 he has to tell something very interesting 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.100
 about something that everyone thinks 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.030
 we should learn to do and have in 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.820

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.740
 simple fast economical with ones 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.360
 very very very easy ingredients that 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.430
 we all usually have at home in any 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.740
 very very natural moment all 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.659
 absolutely natural cream cheese 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.640
 or cream if you already know that 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.619
 bakers love it because 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.869
 obviously used for pies 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.009
 of exact cheese is a cream cheese 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.259
 what are we going to do? 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.110
 sweet creations for cakes 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.729
 Baked or even cold cheese 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.170
 good american cheesecake or 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.390
 salty preparations for canapÃ©s 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.460
 snacks simply to eat 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.259
 a restaurant what richer and more 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.700
 easy you will see tell us what 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.710
 ingredients you need for the 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.789
 ingredients that we need to make 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.730
 Cheese cream is absorbent paper 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.510
 kitchen 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.130
 cheese mesh half a kilo of yogurt that 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.880
 today we have brought 4 arrived the one from 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.450
 125 grams 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.250
 125 2 teaspoons of salt a thing that 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.110
 I have to ask you the mesh of 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.170
 cheese is one thing to make cheese 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.880
 but you can not use the 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.550
 two things or one or the other is used 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.380
 we are going to use paper today 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.910
 absorbing this we have brought it so that 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.890
 it would be seen because surely someone 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.390
 can get big and we also 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.520
 would be worth it or have it at home is a 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.960
 way that your gaza style aha and 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.340
 designs but if you do not find them 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.810
 A problem can be done with 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.360
 barely cooks as he sees the paper 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.250
 kitchen perfectly serves for what 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.510
 that we are going to perform very well then come 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.820
 the then I the only thing that we have to 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.820
 to do is open the yoghurts 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.620
 we do not throw the floor what 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.620
 that appears in the yogurt is not pulled 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:02.170
 we discarded it and we did it in 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.470
 what we said in a bag game 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.910
 with the soil the broth that many people 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.910
 strip is the best 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.569
 we made our half pound of yogurt 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.340
 we stir well we leave it homogeneous 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.659
 and now the only thing we have to do 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.299
 is to throw the two teaspoons of salt 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.299
 teaspoon rasa roses two fats of salt 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.420
 nothing else this recipe 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.870
 does not have anything else we miss two 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.870
 teaspoons 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.500
 we remove well we can use the 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.500
 spoon we can use a rod 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.220
 simply 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.830
 and the only thing we do is 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.870
 place the kitchen paper today your 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.550
 defect we would place the mesh to see how 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.200
 several capitalinos how many 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.080
 paper capitals has exposed as three 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.510
 plus three we put three because the paper 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.100
 It was a deserve something we do not want 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.580
 is that it breaks then to give a 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.580
 little bit of strength 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.150
 a little bit we have left a kind of 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.150
 bag 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.910
 and snuck 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.040
 now the effect that salt is going to make 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.040
 about yogurt is going to be 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.080
 that you are going to hydrate it will take the 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.560
 serum we are going to leave now 10 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.120
 hours in 10 hours one night in refrigerator and 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.190
 the next day after 10 am 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.300
 let's see that everything will be full 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.640
 ground 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.170
 we have been the fund in the background 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.320
 then little by little he will be resting 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:48.590
 resting resting and at 10 o'clock or 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.330
 the next morning we will have our 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.310
 cream cheese made and now we're going to 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.870
 let those 10 hours pass we're going to 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.950
 let it happen and let it rest on 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.310
 good miracle is that it does wrong is 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.010
 miraculous have already passed 10 hours and already 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.710
 we have our our cheese cream 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.960
 our crisis look here 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.850
 is here is here is we have had it 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.250
 10 hours or a whole night we have 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.680
 come another day has passed and here not 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.280
 we have found it, now we have to 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.210
 use it 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:23.980
 we know that the soil that has it below 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.980
 everything that has achieved 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:32.690
 and the cream we have to do 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.030
 is very careful not to break the 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.500
 paper that's why we put three layers 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.430
 of paper is 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.430
 we take out 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:44.629
 and then we would do it in a bowl or a 

00:05:42.739 --> 00:05:47.229
 little dish very carefully that I do not know 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:47.229
 break the paper 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.890
 trying to make the most of 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.290
 we collect 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:09.120
 and it is already we have our have 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:12.550
 our cheese cream with the texture 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.320
 good how rich besides very easy to spread 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.360
 It is so very much to help a lot 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.300
 creamy easy to spread and especially 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.530
 easy to make and easy economical and 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.800
 quick to do the only thing that needs to be done 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.800
 wait 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.590
 after keeping yes yes perfectly 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:32.710
 perfectly can be saved and even 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:34.270
 Hold in the fridge for 45 days 6 without 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.880
 no problem without any kind of 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.130
 problem we put it in a covered tupper 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.940
 and endures the six days what does not 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:45.610
 It suits this cream is to freeze the no 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:48.430
 agrees well I would not continue dropping the 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:53.380
 serum there we could not be 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:55.630
 I would remove the fat from the protein 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.750
 I think with 5 or 6 days in the fridge 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:01.030
 I do not think that will last much 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.360
 it's so easy to do it we do it again 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.280
 plus 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.259
