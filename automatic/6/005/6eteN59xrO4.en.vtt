00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
using magic and the first tip is

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.550 
using magic and the first tip is
attacking<00:00:18.760> with<00:00:18.970> magic<00:00:19.600> and<00:00:19.840> the<00:00:20.380> most

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
attacking with magic and the most

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.680 
attacking with magic and the most
important<00:00:21.160> thing<00:00:21.340> to<00:00:21.520> know<00:00:21.700> is<00:00:21.970> that<00:00:22.029> shock

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:22.690 
important thing to know is that shock

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.200 
important thing to know is that shock
deals<00:00:23.140> the<00:00:23.440> most<00:00:23.770> damage<00:00:24.340> out<00:00:24.580> of<00:00:24.640> all<00:00:25.029> the

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
deals the most damage out of all the

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.390 
deals the most damage out of all the
damage<00:00:25.630> rings<00:00:25.960> and<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:26.770> others<00:00:27.130> are

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
damage rings and the others are

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.420 
damage rings and the others are
incinerate<00:00:28.090> and<00:00:28.360> holy<00:00:28.780> but<00:00:29.470> shock<00:00:29.830> comes<00:00:30.190> out

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
incinerate and holy but shock comes out

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.519 
incinerate and holy but shock comes out
at<00:00:30.670> the<00:00:30.940> top<00:00:31.240> and<00:00:31.539> I'm<00:00:31.780> showing<00:00:32.080> some<00:00:32.169> good

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
at the top and I'm showing some good

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.580 
at the top and I'm showing some good
rings<00:00:32.860> of<00:00:33.220> both<00:00:33.489> ISA<00:00:33.820> and<00:00:34.180> Silas<00:00:34.809> that<00:00:35.290> have

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
rings of both ISA and Silas that have

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.270 
rings of both ISA and Silas that have
shock<00:00:35.980> magic<00:00:36.580> the<00:00:37.239> way<00:00:37.420> it<00:00:37.720> calculates<00:00:38.020> is<00:00:38.680> you

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
shock magic the way it calculates is you

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.820 
shock magic the way it calculates is you
take<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:40.000> magic<00:00:40.540> number<00:00:40.989> that<00:00:41.020> you<00:00:41.290> have<00:00:41.559> in

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
take the magic number that you have in

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.910 
take the magic number that you have in
my<00:00:42.100> case<00:00:42.129> five<00:00:42.879> for<00:00:43.180> one<00:00:43.390> and<00:00:43.720> you<00:00:44.350> times<00:00:44.650> it<00:00:44.890> by

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
my case five for one and you times it by

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.090 
my case five for one and you times it by
one<00:00:45.489> for<00:00:45.790> 5:04<00:00:46.690> shock<00:00:46.989> a<00:00:47.290> thousand<00:00:47.949> for

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
one for 5:04 shock a thousand for

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.090 
one for 5:04 shock a thousand for
incinerate<00:00:48.670> and<00:00:48.879> 750<00:00:49.750> for<00:00:49.930> holy<00:00:50.199> or<00:00:50.530> ten<00:00:50.830> times

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
incinerate and 750 for holy or ten times

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.250 
incinerate and 750 for holy or ten times
less<00:00:51.489> if<00:00:51.760> you<00:00:51.879> don't<00:00:52.120> have<00:00:52.330> ultimate<00:00:52.870> magic

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
less if you don't have ultimate magic

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.860 
less if you don't have ultimate magic

and thanks to Man of Steel otherwise
known<00:00:56.229> as<00:00:56.260> a<00:00:56.620> belong<00:00:56.949> wizard<00:00:57.400> for<00:00:57.610> those

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
known as a belong wizard for those

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.540 
known as a belong wizard for those
calculations<00:00:58.540> so<00:00:59.470> my<00:00:59.650> second<00:01:00.100> tip<00:01:00.129> is

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
calculations so my second tip is

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.689 
calculations so my second tip is
defending<00:01:01.390> yourself<00:01:01.839> with<00:01:02.110> magic<00:01:02.620> and<00:01:02.830> the

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
defending yourself with magic and the

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.020 
defending yourself with magic and the
best<00:01:03.940> magic<00:01:04.540> for<00:01:05.049> that<00:01:05.229> is<00:01:05.620> defend<00:01:06.430> magic

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
best magic for that is defend magic

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.420 
best magic for that is defend magic
because<00:01:07.960> it<00:01:08.110> gives<00:01:08.320> you<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.650> most<00:01:08.950> health

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
because it gives you the most health

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.120 
because it gives you the most health
back<00:01:09.760> it<00:01:10.150> gives<00:01:10.390> more<00:01:10.720> than<00:01:10.780> heal<00:01:11.409> and<00:01:11.680> I<00:01:11.799> think

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
back it gives more than heal and I think

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.860 
back it gives more than heal and I think
more<00:01:12.310> than<00:01:12.340> holy<00:01:12.790> although<00:01:13.240> I<00:01:13.270> haven't<00:01:13.600> worked

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
more than holy although I haven't worked

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.410 
more than holy although I haven't worked
that<00:01:14.080> out<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.890> other<00:01:15.010> benefit<00:01:15.670> of<00:01:15.850> defend

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
that out and the other benefit of defend

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.929 
that out and the other benefit of defend
is<00:01:16.689> that<00:01:16.990> it<00:01:17.170> does<00:01:17.409> give<00:01:17.710> you<00:01:17.920> shield<00:01:18.310> back<00:01:18.640> as

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
is that it does give you shield back as

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.840 
is that it does give you shield back as
well<00:01:19.360> as<00:01:19.570> health<00:01:19.930> and<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.829> other<00:01:20.979> magic<00:01:21.640> good

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
well as health and the other magic good

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.289 
well as health and the other magic good
for<00:01:22.119> defense<00:01:22.270> is<00:01:23.049> blunt<00:01:23.920> magic<00:01:24.520> as<00:01:24.729> you'll<00:01:25.060> get

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
for defense is blunt magic as you'll get

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.920 
for defense is blunt magic as you'll get
less<00:01:25.630> damage<00:01:26.229> if<00:01:26.469> the<00:01:26.740> enemy<00:01:27.189> hits<00:01:27.490> you<00:01:27.759> on<00:01:28.060> to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
less damage if the enemy hits you on to

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.740 
less damage if the enemy hits you on to
tip<00:01:29.170> three<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.829> it's<00:01:30.219> using<00:01:30.939> the<00:01:31.060> dark<00:01:31.329> fire

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
tip three and it's using the dark fire

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.039 
tip three and it's using the dark fire
with<00:01:32.109> magic<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.799> for<00:01:33.490> that<00:01:33.640> you<00:01:34.000> need<00:01:34.049> nullify

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
with magic and for that you need nullify

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.099 
with magic and for that you need nullify
magic<00:01:35.590> as<00:01:35.740> it<00:01:36.250> removes<00:01:36.609> the<00:01:36.909> Titans<00:01:37.420> spectrum

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
magic as it removes the Titans spectrum

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.819 
magic as it removes the Titans spectrum
defense<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:39.149> for<00:01:40.149> bosses<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:41.020> means<00:01:41.380> your

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
defense and for bosses that means your

other element gem that you use to attack

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.310 
other element gem that you use to attack
and<00:01:47.799> it<00:01:48.280> works<00:01:48.490> with<00:01:48.850> any<00:01:49.179> Titan<00:01:49.840> who<00:01:50.079> has
