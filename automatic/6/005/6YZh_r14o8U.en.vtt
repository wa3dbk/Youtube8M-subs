your hand and the back of the phone
curves<00:02:47.709> actually<00:02:48.700> you<00:02:48.790> can<00:02:48.910> see<00:02:49.090> a<00:02:49.120> very

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
curves actually you can see a very

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.080 
curves actually you can see a very
slight<00:02:49.630> curvature<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:51.190> fits<00:02:51.370> perfectly<00:02:51.790> in

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
slight curvature so it fits perfectly in

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.390 
slight curvature so it fits perfectly in
your<00:02:52.120> hand<00:02:52.540> while<00:02:52.660> resting<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.260> as<00:02:54.160> you<00:02:54.280> can

your hand while resting and as you can

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.130 
your hand while resting and as you can
see<00:02:54.430> it's<00:02:54.700> clearly<00:02:55.239> capable<00:02:55.660> of<00:02:55.930> being<00:02:56.079> used

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
see it's clearly capable of being used

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.050 
see it's clearly capable of being used
in<00:02:56.440> one<00:02:56.590> hand<00:02:56.829> in<00:02:57.010> fact<00:02:57.489> it's<00:02:57.730> probably<00:02:57.850> the

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
in one hand in fact it's probably the

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.360 
in one hand in fact it's probably the
same<00:02:58.209> size<00:02:58.420> as<00:02:58.630> my<00:02:58.780> lumia<00:02:59.019> 920<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.530> i'll<00:03:00.190> be

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
same size as my lumia 920 and i'll be

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.800 
same size as my lumia 920 and i'll be
sure<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.519> a<00:03:00.670> comparison<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.239> those<00:03:01.390> later<00:03:01.600> on

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
sure to a comparison of those later on

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.949 
sure to a comparison of those later on
so<00:03:02.650> what<00:03:03.549> else<00:03:03.670> about<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:04.030> device<00:03:04.209> has<00:03:04.480> a
