hi there and welcome to our study we'll

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.340 
hi there and welcome to our study we'll
be<00:00:08.700> asking<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.269> take<00:00:09.420> some<00:00:09.660> pictures<00:00:10.049> of<00:00:10.080> your

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.350 
be asking to take some pictures of your

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.790 
be asking to take some pictures of your
brain

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
brain

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.040 
brain
using<00:00:11.040> an<00:00:11.160> MRI<00:00:11.490> scanner<00:00:12.030> which<00:00:12.720> is<00:00:12.870> like<00:00:13.020> a

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.050 
using an MRI scanner which is like a

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.650 
using an MRI scanner which is like a
special<00:00:13.590> camera<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.070> uses<00:00:14.430> magnets<00:00:15.120> and

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
special camera that uses magnets and

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.870 
special camera that uses magnets and
kind<00:00:15.930> of<00:00:16.020> looks<00:00:16.230> like<00:00:16.290> a<00:00:16.410> big<00:00:16.680> doughnut<00:00:16.950> it

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
kind of looks like a big doughnut it

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.519 
kind of looks like a big doughnut it
takes<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.240> picture<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.660> whatever<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
takes a picture of whatever is in the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.350 
takes a picture of whatever is in the
middle<00:00:19.860> of<00:00:19.950> the<00:00:20.070> doughnut<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.610> so<00:00:21.119> you'll<00:00:21.300> be

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
middle of the doughnut and so you'll be

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.250 
middle of the doughnut and so you'll be
lying<00:00:21.720> on<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> bed<00:00:22.260> inside<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.779> this<00:00:24.779> video

squeeze<00:03:49.250> ball<00:03:49.550> is<00:03:49.790> your<00:03:50.030> way<00:03:50.209> of<00:03:50.420> letting<00:03:50.600> the

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
squeeze ball is your way of letting the

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.720 
squeeze ball is your way of letting the
researchers<00:03:51.590> in<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:51.920> next<00:03:52.250> room<00:03:52.430> know<00:03:52.670> you

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
will ask you to squeeze the ball if

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.000 
will ask you to squeeze the ball if
you're<00:03:58.010> okay<00:03:58.490> if<00:03:59.330> you<00:04:00.050> want<00:04:00.260> to<00:04:00.380> stop<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.620> scan

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010

you<00:04:01.280> can<00:04:01.459> squeeze<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.060> ball<00:04:02.209> at<00:04:02.420> any<00:04:02.630> time<00:04:02.990> and

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
you can squeeze the ball at any time and

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.280 
you can squeeze the ball at any time and
someone<00:04:03.620> will<00:04:03.860> come<00:04:04.040> in<00:04:04.070> and<00:04:04.340> talk<00:04:04.490> with<00:04:04.700> you

you to make sure that you can see

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.960 
you to make sure that you can see
everything<00:05:07.620> clearly<00:05:07.650> in<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:08.340> mirror<00:05:08.639> above

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
your head before we start taking

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.100 
your head before we start taking
pictures<00:05:10.770> of<00:05:11.160> your<00:05:11.280> brain<00:05:11.490> again<00:05:12.240> the<00:05:12.780> scanner

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
pictures of your brain again the scanner

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.930 
pictures of your brain again the scanner
will<00:05:13.349> make<00:05:13.560> funny<00:05:13.860> noises<00:05:14.190> but<00:05:14.610> you<00:05:14.789> already

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
will make funny noises but you already

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.360

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
know that so just relax and keep still

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.670 
know that so just relax and keep still
you<00:05:18.120> may<00:05:18.300> get<00:05:18.479> to<00:05:18.630> play<00:05:18.810> some<00:05:19.080> games<00:05:19.320> in<00:05:19.590> the

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
you may get to play some games in the

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.540 
you may get to play some games in the
scanner<00:05:19.979> too

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
scanner too

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.480
