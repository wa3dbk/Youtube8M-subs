00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
the rest of the lore which needs to be

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.950 
the rest of the lore which needs to be
changed<00:05:46.830> I<00:05:46.950> mean<00:05:47.880> think<00:05:48.210> of<00:05:48.300> it<00:05:48.450> basically

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
changed I mean think of it basically

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.350 
changed I mean think of it basically
every<00:05:49.650> character<00:05:50.130> up<00:05:50.310> until<00:05:50.610> this<00:05:50.790> point<00:05:50.910> is

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
every character up until this point is

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.030 
every character up until this point is
tied<00:05:51.660> to<00:05:51.900> the<00:05:52.020> Institute<00:05:52.530> in<00:05:52.620> some<00:05:52.830> way

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
tied to the Institute in some way

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.890 
tied to the Institute in some way
they've<00:05:53.760> already<00:05:54.000> changed<00:05:54.270> a<00:05:54.510> lot<00:05:54.690> of<00:05:54.750> the

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
they've already changed a lot of the

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.170 
they've already changed a lot of the
characters<00:05:55.350> backstories<00:05:55.950> but<00:05:56.280> more<00:05:56.700> still

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
characters backstories but more still

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.230 
characters backstories but more still
left<00:05:57.800> not<00:05:58.800> only<00:05:58.830> do<00:05:59.250> they<00:05:59.370> have<00:05:59.490> to<00:05:59.550> change<00:05:59.970> the

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
left not only do they have to change the

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.630 
left not only do they have to change the
individual<00:06:01.020> characters<00:06:01.500> lore<00:06:01.740> but<00:06:02.310> they<00:06:02.400> also

simple task for any story which is

though they don't have to go and find

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.950 
though they don't have to go and find
grand<00:06:11.340> reasons<00:06:11.850> for<00:06:12.000> why<00:06:12.270> characters<00:06:12.810> are

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
grand reasons for why characters are

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.900 
grand reasons for why characters are
fighting<00:06:13.320> only<00:06:13.680> that<00:06:14.310> they<00:06:14.430> stand<00:06:14.760> for

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
fighting only that they stand for

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.420 
fighting only that they stand for
something<00:06:15.480> and<00:06:15.660> eventually<00:06:16.530> it'll<00:06:16.770> all<00:06:17.100> lead

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
something and eventually it'll all lead

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.630 
something and eventually it'll all lead
somewhere<00:06:17.910> I<00:06:18.890> believe<00:06:19.890> that<00:06:20.160> these<00:06:20.310> story

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
somewhere I believe that these story

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.730 
somewhere I believe that these story
changes<00:06:21.060> are<00:06:21.330> probably<00:06:21.840> for<00:06:22.080> the<00:06:22.170> best<00:06:22.380> I

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
changes are probably for the best I

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.410 
changes are probably for the best I
never<00:06:23.370> had<00:06:23.550> a<00:06:23.580> problem<00:06:23.760> with<00:06:23.970> the<00:06:24.180> story

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:24.420 
never had a problem with the story

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.660 
never had a problem with the story
before<00:06:24.630> but<00:06:25.170> I<00:06:25.380> can<00:06:25.710> see<00:06:25.950> where<00:06:26.220> some<00:06:26.250> of<00:06:26.490> their

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:26.670 
before but I can see where some of their

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.360 
before but I can see where some of their
concerns<00:06:26.940> are<00:06:27.390> founded<00:06:28.070> opening<00:06:29.070> the<00:06:29.160> world

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
concerns are founded opening the world

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.710 
concerns are founded opening the world
up<00:06:29.610> will<00:06:29.820> allow<00:06:30.030> for<00:06:30.300> more<00:06:30.480> dynamic

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
up will allow for more dynamic

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.660 
up will allow for more dynamic
storytelling<00:06:31.710> and<00:06:31.860> removing<00:06:32.550> the

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:32.670 
storytelling and removing the

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.160 
storytelling and removing the
restriction<00:06:33.180> of<00:06:33.300> the<00:06:33.360> Institute<00:06:33.930> should

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.170 
restriction of the Institute should

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.840 
restriction of the Institute should
create<00:06:34.560> more<00:06:34.800> depth<00:06:35.160> than<00:06:35.430> their<00:06:35.550> future

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:35.850 
create more depth than their future

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.990 
create more depth than their future
champions<00:06:36.350> but<00:06:37.350> still<00:06:37.770> some<00:06:38.280> things<00:06:38.520> like<00:06:38.820> the

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
champions but still some things like the

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.909 
champions but still some things like the
mixing<00:06:39.420> of

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 
mixing of

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.100

in factions on the same team may never

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.320 
in factions on the same team may never

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 
the story it's just gonna be a victim of

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:49.360 
the story it's just gonna be a victim of
the<00:06:46.879> gameplay<00:06:47.499> after<00:06:48.499> all<00:06:48.680> is<00:06:48.949> said<00:06:48.979> and<00:06:49.310> done

the gameplay after all is said and done
the<00:06:50.029> gameplay<00:06:50.569> is<00:06:50.749> what's<00:06:50.990> most<00:06:51.229> important

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
the gameplay is what's most important

the gameplay is what's most important
here<00:06:52.039> the<00:06:52.699> story<00:06:52.999> adds<00:06:53.300> to<00:06:53.659> the<00:06:53.749> gameplay<00:06:54.080> a

here the story adds to the gameplay a

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:56.019 
here the story adds to the gameplay a
narrative<00:06:54.770> which<00:06:54.979> gives<00:06:55.219> life<00:06:55.520> to<00:06:55.550> the<00:06:55.819> game
