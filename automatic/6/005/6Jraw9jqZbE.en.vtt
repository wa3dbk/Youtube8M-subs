don't you expect to get from an ovation

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.710 
don't you expect to get from an ovation
and<00:00:50.040> the<00:00:50.130> action<00:00:50.400> is<00:00:50.520> great<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.910> these<00:00:51.120> they

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
and the action is great on these they

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.300 
and the action is great on these they
also<00:00:51.870> sound<00:00:52.290> really<00:00:52.500> good<00:00:52.650> just<00:00:52.950> strumming<00:00:53.190> a

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
also sound really good just strumming a

00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:05.469 
also sound really good just strumming a
few<00:00:53.520> chords

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.090 

great<00:01:06.479> action<00:01:06.840> almost<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.320> an<00:01:07.470> electric<00:01:07.890> but

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
great action almost like an electric but

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.649 
great action almost like an electric but
the<00:01:08.549> best<00:01:08.790> feature<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> guitar<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.570> think

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the best feature of the guitar I think

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.690 
the best feature of the guitar I think
anyways<00:01:10.320> especially<00:01:11.009> if<00:01:11.159> you're<00:01:11.340> rehearsing

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
anyways especially if you're rehearsing

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.969 
anyways especially if you're rehearsing

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
on your own is to be able to record a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.280 
on your own is to be able to record a
track<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.640> then<00:01:15.210> be<00:01:15.390> able<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.689> play<00:01:15.869> over<00:01:16.200> it

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
track and then be able to play over it

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.420 
track and then be able to play over it

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
right now you have to push the record

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.690 
right now you have to push the record
button<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:21.090> couple<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.200> times<00:01:22.440> here<00:01:25.039> and<00:01:26.039> that

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
button a couple of times here and that

00:01:34.030 --> 00:02:04.800 

and<00:01:34.510> we'll<00:01:34.690> start<00:01:34.930> from<00:01:35.050> there

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.540 

okay<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.890> then<00:02:10.009> what<00:02:10.130> we'll<00:02:10.220> do<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.340> we'll

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550

okay and then what we'll do is we'll
play<00:02:10.729> that<00:02:10.910> back<00:02:11.120> obviously<00:02:11.720> that's<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:11.960> Led

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110
