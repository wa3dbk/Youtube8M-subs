Whistler picks this up almost every time
I<00:00:29.220> Drive<00:00:29.550> through<00:00:29.820> here<00:00:30.059> of<00:00:30.590> 99.5<00:00:31.590> percent<00:00:31.619> of

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
I Drive through here of 99.5 percent of

the time first up will be the Whistler
as<00:00:35.160> soon<00:00:35.309> as<00:00:35.429> this<00:00:35.550> light<00:00:35.789> changes<00:00:36.239> okay<00:00:36.929> here

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
as soon as this light changes okay here

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.279 
as soon as this light changes okay here
we<00:00:37.320> go<00:00:37.350> finally<00:00:38.250> got<00:00:38.429> to<00:00:38.609> that<00:00:38.640> light<00:00:39.019> first<00:00:40.019> up

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
we go finally got to that light first up

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.029 
we go finally got to that light first up
is<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> Whistler<00:00:40.949> XT<00:00:41.339> our<00:00:41.460> 690<00:00:42.089> se<00:00:43.039> detecting

is the Whistler XT our 690 se detecting
laser<00:00:44.579> Falls<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.269> basically<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:45.960> we're

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
laser Falls is basically what we're

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.099 
laser Falls is basically what we're
doing<00:00:46.140> here<00:00:47.239> for<00:00:48.239> all<00:00:48.359> intents<00:00:48.929> and<00:00:49.019> purposes

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
doing here for all intents and purposes

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.020 
doing here for all intents and purposes
is<00:00:49.940> testing<00:00:50.940> its<00:00:51.089> light<00:00:51.600> our<00:00:51.809> capabilities

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
is testing its light our capabilities

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.090 
is testing its light our capabilities
detection<00:00:54.030> capabilities<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.829> stretch

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
detection capabilities and this stretch

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.299 
detection capabilities and this stretch
of<00:00:56.129> road<00:00:56.429> I<00:00:56.670> almost<00:00:56.909> always<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:58.129> light<00:00:59.129> our

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
of road I almost always get light our

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.950 
of road I almost always get light our
false<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.820> down<00:00:59.999> this<00:01:00.210> stretch<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.569> road<00:01:00.809> to

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
false is down this stretch of road to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.180 
false is down this stretch of road to
here<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.230> we're<00:01:01.379> going<00:01:01.559> there's<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.949> lot<00:01:02.100> of

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
here that we're going there's a lot of

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.850 
here that we're going there's a lot of
industrial<00:01:02.519> stuff<00:01:03.120> here<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.600> that's<00:01:04.470> probably

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
industrial stuff here so that's probably

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:26.850 
industrial stuff here so that's probably
the<00:01:05.129> reason<00:01:05.280> for<00:01:05.730> that<00:01:05.909> happening

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.570 

and<00:01:27.700> so<00:01:28.030> far<00:01:28.330> we're<00:01:28.540> getting<00:01:28.930> nothing<00:01:29.580> usually

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
and so far we're getting nothing usually

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.550 
and so far we're getting nothing usually
I<00:01:30.640> get<00:01:30.760> a<00:01:30.940> hit<00:01:31.180> or<00:01:31.300> treat<00:01:31.480> line<00:01:31.660> down<00:01:31.900> ah<00:01:32.050> there

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
I get a hit or treat line down ah there

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.740 
I get a hit or treat line down ah there
we<00:01:32.680> go

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.070 

just<00:01:35.200> got<00:01:35.380> two<00:01:35.590> hits<00:01:35.800> of<00:01:36.540> 997<00:01:38.880> 901<00:01:40.080> thousand

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
just got two hits of 997 901 thousand

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.300 
just got two hits of 997 901 thousand
ten<00:01:41.730> so<00:01:42.730> three<00:01:43.290> Falls<00:01:44.290> light<00:01:44.620> art<00:01:44.830> hits<00:01:45.070> right

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
ten so three Falls light art hits right

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.590 
ten so three Falls light art hits right
there<00:01:45.490> in<00:01:45.580> a<00:01:45.640> row<00:01:45.760> actually<00:01:46.000> I<00:01:46.180> think<00:01:46.240> it<00:01:46.420> was<00:01:46.540> a

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
there in a row actually I think it was a

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.340 
there in a row actually I think it was a
thousand<00:01:47.050> for<00:01:47.200> PBS<00:01:47.590> I'll<00:01:47.920> have<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.220> look<00:01:49.350> so

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
thousand for PBS I'll have to look so

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.490 
thousand for PBS I'll have to look so
that's<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.770> Whistler

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
that's the Whistler

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.560 
that's the Whistler
and<00:01:53.130> we'll<00:01:53.370> come<00:01:53.580> back<00:01:53.610> down<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:54.090> same<00:01:54.330> run

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
and we'll come back down the same run

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.950 
and we'll come back down the same run
road<00:01:54.890> okay<00:01:55.920> fourth<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.930> one-thousand<00:01:57.930> three

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960

pulses per second at this time is the
Beltronics<00:02:03.180> rx<00:02:03.450> 65<00:02:04.050> and<00:02:04.440> we<00:02:04.530> are<00:02:04.650> going<00:02:04.950> down

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
Beltronics rx 65 and we are going down

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.240 
Beltronics rx 65 and we are going down
the<00:02:05.370> same<00:02:05.550> stretch<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.910> road<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.740> may<00:02:07.740> pick<00:02:07.950> up<00:02:08.070> a

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
the same stretch of road I may pick up a

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.360 
the same stretch of road I may pick up a
cab<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.390> falls<00:02:09.750> here<00:02:10.050> but<00:02:10.440> laser<00:02:11.009> should

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
cab and falls here but laser should

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.020 
cab and falls here but laser should
override<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:13.070> so<00:02:14.070> let's<00:02:14.280> see<00:02:14.460> what<00:02:14.610> happens

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
override it so let's see what happens

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.490 
override it so let's see what happens
I'm<00:02:15.150> gonna<00:02:15.240> go<00:02:15.390> about<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.690> same<00:02:15.870> speed<00:02:16.200> as<00:02:16.380> I

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
I'm gonna go about the same speed as I

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.020 
I'm gonna go about the same speed as I
did<00:02:16.740> with<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.190> Whistler<00:02:17.580> which<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:17.880> about

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
did with the Whistler which is about

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.420 
did with the Whistler which is about
forty<00:02:18.360> miles<00:02:18.510> an<00:02:18.690> hour<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.920> we'll<00:02:20.100> see<00:02:20.310> how

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
forty miles an hour so we'll see how

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:30.550 
forty miles an hour so we'll see how
what<00:02:20.610> kind<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.910> hits<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.240> takes

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:53.320 

okay<00:02:31.560> there's<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.980> falls<00:02:35.030> just<00:02:36.030> ignore<00:02:36.480> that

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.820 

okay<00:02:54.330> we<00:02:54.450> got<00:02:54.600> two<00:02:54.810> laser<00:02:55.080> hits<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.650> row

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
okay we got two laser hits in a row

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.930 
okay we got two laser hits in a row
right<00:02:56.040> there

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.480 

or<00:03:01.940> coming<00:03:02.390> up<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.780> our<00:03:02.810> stretch<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.340> end

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
or coming up to our stretch to the end

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:23.260 
or coming up to our stretch to the end
of<00:03:04.610> this<00:03:04.700> little<00:03:05.240> stretch<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.540> road

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.850 

okay<00:03:24.270> and<00:03:24.570> there<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:24.780> have<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.500> would<00:03:25.710> have

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
okay and there you have it I would have

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.720 
okay and there you have it I would have
to<00:03:25.920> say<00:03:26.250> there<00:03:26.550> that<00:03:27.110> probably<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:29.220> Whistler

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
to say there that probably the Whistler

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.250 
to say there that probably the Whistler
has<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.240> edge<00:03:30.390> on<00:03:30.660> that<00:03:30.690> as<00:03:31.020> far<00:03:31.050> as

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
has the edge on that as far as

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.380 
has the edge on that as far as
sensitivity<00:03:31.860> goes<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.640> of<00:03:32.760> course<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.120> fact

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
sensitivity goes and of course the fact

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.080 
sensitivity goes and of course the fact
that<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.720> can<00:03:33.840> identify<00:03:34.020> the<00:03:34.760> pulses<00:03:35.760> per

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
that it can identify the pulses per

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.970 
that it can identify the pulses per
second<00:03:36.540> rate<00:03:36.720> definitely<00:03:37.590> makes<00:03:37.830> a

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
second rate definitely makes a

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.710 
second rate definitely makes a
difference<00:03:38.840> but<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.990> RX<00:03:40.470> 65<00:03:41.010> bit<00:03:41.220> okay<00:03:41.550> -<00:03:41.720> but

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
difference but the RX 65 bit okay - but

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.540 
difference but the RX 65 bit okay - but
I<00:03:42.750> would<00:03:43.500> have<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.770> give<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.070> edge<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.220> the

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
I would have to give the edge to the

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.080 
I would have to give the edge to the
Whistler<00:03:44.970> in<00:03:45.480> this<00:03:45.690> category
