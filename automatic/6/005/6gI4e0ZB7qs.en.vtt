think about I think we think about it
you<00:02:01.049> know<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.200> try<00:02:01.500> not<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.829> make<00:02:01.979> too<00:02:02.040> much<00:02:02.340> of

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
you know you try not to make too much of

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.780 
you know you try not to make too much of
it<00:02:02.729> but<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.770> fact<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.100> our<00:02:05.219> program

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
it but it's the fact that our program

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.210 
it but it's the fact that our program
obviously<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.509> haven't<00:02:06.869> been<00:02:07.079> here<00:02:07.229> since<00:02:07.290> 2002

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
obviously I haven't been here since 2002

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.990 
obviously I haven't been here since 2002
so<00:02:08.539> a<00:02:09.539> few

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
so a few

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.510 
so a few
have<00:02:10.330> certainly<00:02:10.780> fallen<00:02:11.710> on<00:02:11.860> our<00:02:11.890> coaching

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520

have certainly fallen on our coaching
staff<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:13.030> recent<00:02:13.360> teams<00:02:13.600> but<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:14.140> think<00:02:14.800> you

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
staff and recent teams but I think you

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.550 
staff and recent teams but I think you
know<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.250> old<00:02:15.400> adage<00:02:15.550> in<00:02:15.940> sports<00:02:16.300> is<00:02:16.510> this<00:02:16.750> you

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.100 
know the first half yesterday against
UCLA<00:03:22.200> we<00:03:23.200> did<00:03:23.380> not<00:03:23.530> do<00:03:23.739> a<00:03:23.769> very<00:03:24.070> good<00:03:24.160> job

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
UCLA we did not do a very good job

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.470 
UCLA we did not do a very good job
rebounding<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.920> second<00:03:27.370> half<00:03:27.580> we<00:03:28.120> broke<00:03:28.330> the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
rebounding the second half we broke the

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.300 
rebounding the second half we broke the
game<00:03:28.630> open<00:03:28.769> because<00:03:29.769> we<00:03:29.890> did<00:03:30.040> an<00:03:30.160> outstanding

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
game open because we did an outstanding

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.870 
game open because we did an outstanding
job<00:03:30.910> really<00:03:31.600> ditto<00:03:31.810> for<00:03:31.900> cow<00:03:32.519> at<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.670> half

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
job really ditto for cow at the half

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.960 
job really ditto for cow at the half
against<00:03:34.420> cow<00:03:34.600> I<00:03:34.930> think<00:03:35.560> we<00:03:36.040> had<00:03:36.130> one<00:03:36.340> second

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
against cow I think we had one second

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.539 
against cow I think we had one second
shot<00:03:37.120> I<00:03:37.150> believe<00:03:37.600> but<00:03:38.170> in<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.380> second<00:03:38.680> half<00:03:38.829> we

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
shot I believe but in the second half we

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.850 
shot I believe but in the second half we
got<00:03:39.940> going<00:03:40.329> our<00:03:40.600> defensive<00:03:41.200> rebounding<00:03:41.650> has

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
got going our defensive rebounding has

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.090 
got going our defensive rebounding has
been<00:03:42.070> a<00:03:42.100> constant<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:44.200> that<00:03:44.739> has<00:03:44.920> to

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
been a constant and and that has to

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.620 
been a constant and and that has to
continue<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.549> be<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:45.760> constant<00:03:46.269> now<00:03:46.360> that<00:03:46.540> we're

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630
