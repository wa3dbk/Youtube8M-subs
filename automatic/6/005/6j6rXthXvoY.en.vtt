then<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:12.989> got<00:02:13.140> our<00:02:13.230> secondary<00:02:13.739> thing

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
then we got our secondary thing

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.880 
then we got our secondary thing
secondary<00:02:14.970> class<00:02:15.209> we're<00:02:15.510> just<00:02:15.750> used<00:02:15.959> for<00:02:16.290> you

clothes and stuff like that we offer one
and<00:02:21.360> only<00:02:21.450> lethal<00:02:22.069> class

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
and only lethal class

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.229 
and only lethal class
this<00:02:25.829> is<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> kind<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.340> class<00:02:26.549> I<00:02:26.760> would<00:02:26.819> use<00:02:27.060> I

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
this is a kind of class I would use I

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.690 
this is a kind of class I would use I
probably<00:02:27.629> use<00:02:27.870> pills<00:02:28.349> dexterity<00:02:29.340> there

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.610 

that's<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.060> lethal<00:02:33.599> class<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:34.049> would<00:02:34.109> use<00:02:34.349> all

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
that's the lethal class I would use all

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.149 
that's the lethal class I would use all
the<00:02:34.769> time<00:02:35.689> so<00:02:36.689> especially<00:02:36.959> at<00:02:37.709> create<00:02:38.010> classes

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
the time so especially at create classes

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.880 
the time so especially at create classes
aren't<00:02:38.640> really<00:02:38.909> that<00:02:39.030> special<00:02:39.620> these<00:02:40.620> are<00:02:40.799> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
aren't really that special these are the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.770 
aren't really that special these are the
score<00:02:41.159> streaks<00:02:41.459> are<00:02:41.640> usually<00:02:42.090> use<00:02:42.390> for

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
score streaks are usually use for

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.520 
score streaks are usually use for
running<00:02:43.140> non-lethal<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:45.090> EV<00:02:45.359> vsat<00:02:45.840> an<00:02:46.079> EMP

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
running non-lethal you EV vsat an EMP

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.209 
running non-lethal you EV vsat an EMP
system<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.189> a<00:02:47.280> five<00:02:47.489> running<00:02:48.139> the<00:02:49.219> littles

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:50.219 
system and a five running the littles

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:52.309 
system and a five running the littles
I'll<00:02:50.400> probably<00:02:50.609> use<00:02:50.790> lodestar<00:02:51.359> don't<00:02:51.870> swarm

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
I'll probably use lodestar don't swarm

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:59.509 
I'll probably use lodestar don't swarm
or<00:02:53.299> Vita<00:02:54.299> na<00:02:55.230> ro<00:02:56.219> dah<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.269> swamp<00:02:57.750> or<00:02:58.370> or<00:02:59.370> bow

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
or Vita na ro dah the swamp or or bow

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.649 
or Vita na ro dah the swamp or or bow
visa<00:02:59.969> down<00:03:00.329> to<00:03:00.540> swarm<00:03:00.870> or<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:03.329> there's

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
visa down to swarm or that so there's

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.089 
visa down to swarm or that so there's
all<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.989> combinations<00:03:04.169> just<00:03:04.829> going<00:03:05.040> to

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
all of the combinations just going to

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.569 
all of the combinations just going to
know<00:03:05.250> what<00:03:06.239> search<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:07.139> and<00:03:07.379> syd<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:07.980> best<00:03:08.370> I

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
know what search you and syd you best I

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.039 
know what search you and syd you best I
guess<00:03:09.859> so<00:03:10.859> next<00:03:11.310> thing<00:03:11.459> Dean<00:03:12.359> Cain<00:03:12.629> I<00:03:12.659> wanted

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
guess so next thing Dean Cain I wanted

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.899 
guess so next thing Dean Cain I wanted
to<00:03:13.139> show<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.290> guys<00:03:13.470> for<00:03:13.889> quite<00:03:14.069> a<00:03:14.099> long<00:03:14.189> time<00:03:14.340> a

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
to show you guys for quite a long time a

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.569 
to show you guys for quite a long time a
combat<00:03:15.810> record<00:03:16.019> so<00:03:16.620> as<00:03:16.769> you<00:03:16.889> can<00:03:16.980> see<00:03:17.159> there<00:03:17.340> I

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
combat record so as you can see there I

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.559 
combat record so as you can see there I
do<00:03:18.180> not<00:03:18.510> reverse<00:03:18.840> boost<00:03:19.169> whatsoever<00:03:19.919> and<00:03:20.569> I'm

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
do not reverse boost whatsoever and I'm

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.849 
do not reverse boost whatsoever and I'm
a<00:03:21.629> two-point<00:03:22.019> 67<00:03:22.709> k<00:03:22.950> dr<00:03:23.180> p<00:03:24.180> d<00:03:24.329> ratio<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:25.079> that's

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
a two-point 67 k dr p d ratio so that's

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.569 
a two-point 67 k dr p d ratio so that's
like<00:03:26.129> almost<00:03:26.609> decals<00:03:27.389> /<00:03:27.689> 11<00:03:28.439> death<00:03:28.680> i<00:03:28.980> mean<00:03:29.549> i

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
like almost decals / 11 death i mean i

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:30.920 
like almost decals / 11 death i mean i
could<00:03:29.700> get<00:03:29.909> that<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.120> lot<00:03:30.269> higher<00:03:30.480> i<00:03:30.540> could<00:03:30.810> get

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
could get that a lot higher i could get

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.679 
could get that a lot higher i could get
that<00:03:31.139> up<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.260> at<00:03:31.500> least<00:03:31.650> six<00:03:32.010> if<00:03:32.609> I<00:03:32.849> tried<00:03:33.239> but<00:03:33.629> I

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:33.689 
that up to at least six if I tried but I

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:35.530 
that up to at least six if I tried but I
don't<00:03:34.109> really<00:03:34.260> care<00:03:34.500> about<00:03:34.590> stats<00:03:34.950> that<00:03:35.159> much

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
don't really care about stats that much

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.030 
don't really care about stats that much
then<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:36.659> have<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.810> negative<00:03:37.109> one<00:03:37.440> horse<00:03:37.709> and

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
then I have a negative one horse and

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.949 
then I have a negative one horse and
that<00:03:38.459> obviously<00:03:38.639> comes<00:03:39.120> with<00:03:39.329> reach<00:03:39.540> quitting

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
that obviously comes with reach quitting

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.289 
that obviously comes with reach quitting
a<00:03:40.079> lot<00:03:40.319> or<00:03:40.590> dashboarding<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.549> i'll<00:03:42.000> tell<00:03:42.180> you

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
a lot or dashboarding and i'll tell you

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.119 
a lot or dashboarding and i'll tell you
right<00:03:42.329> now<00:03:42.479> I<00:03:42.629> do<00:03:42.780> not<00:03:42.930> dashboard<00:03:43.530> whatsoever

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
right now I do not dashboard whatsoever

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.240 
right now I do not dashboard whatsoever
I<00:03:44.310> haven't<00:03:44.849> dash<00:03:45.030> once<00:03:45.359> in<00:03:45.569> this<00:03:45.659> game<00:03:45.930> and

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
I haven't dash once in this game and

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.119 
I haven't dash once in this game and
then<00:03:47.250> score<00:03:47.579> per<00:03:47.729> minute<00:03:48.409> 484<00:03:49.409> could<00:03:49.799> get<00:03:49.979> that

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
then score per minute 484 could get that

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.909 
then score per minute 484 could get that
a<00:03:50.159> lot<00:03:50.310> higher<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.760> could<00:03:50.970> get<00:03:51.090> up<00:03:51.269> to<00:03:51.299> like

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
a lot higher I could get up to like

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.409 
a lot higher I could get up to like
900-1000<00:03:52.919> if<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.159> properly<00:03:53.729> trained<00:03:54.150> my<00:03:54.389> ass
