 moved the public to Gabon jean didier gadou 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.530
 massacre with every purchase that each 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.090
 fight well done to fights because 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.800
 to train must be prepared 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.500
 physically psychologically it takes 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.510
 to live up to what is expected or 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.090
 and and they and not to take pleasure 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.830
 what's great about a festival is 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.630
 that it's virtually must not 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.670
 simply on the stage the stakes of the 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.480
 beautiful things and the very 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.490
 beautiful stories that we can not 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.280
 suspect one of the marriages of 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:44.290
 births and deaths feel for you in 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.560
 to speak is this inscription still that 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.560
 pleases 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.890
 it is frankly it combines birth or 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.580
 to a child the pleasure you take 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.580
 often enough 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.720
 then the tent planted this gestation 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.490
 nine months of waiting it's really 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.840
 one against zug that's what I call 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.240
 the creative process and the 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.350
 repetition the text must be done 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.600
 attention that's what these moments the 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:24.170
 more fragile just before he 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:26.119
 happens after delivery this is the 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:34.910
 stuffed but there it is really 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:38.750
 particular are warned all that is 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.130
 goes into the French-speaking world and that 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.520
 french bills almost better than 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.520
 the transfers 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.970
 we are here the experience of 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.860
 artists on stage I never had to 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.300
 translate into show to adapt 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.870
 I have the impression that this 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:05.950
 condescending greenhouse says wishing to 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:09.070
 2.4 anti no gaap for Moroccans 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.330
 yala which is our French chance to 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.790
 hearing by this application 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.150
 my job is something that I 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.210
 do that is already very complicated 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:23.280
 position in its functions diffuse 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.280
 unknown artists the audience drops 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.960
 finally no bars 4 1 artist 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.890
 French not known the diocese are 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.080
 mathematics 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.930
 if the trolls can have a chance 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.010
 to maintain it a little bit the case of 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.120
 jag this time but on and the climate 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.190
 so if I put in Arabic speaking 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.060
 Arabic there no noticeable equipment 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.060
 by the lips in the perigord 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.480
 a home theater
