00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.450 

I'm<00:00:07.350> just<00:00:07.529> going<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.680> take<00:00:07.859> you<00:00:07.950> through<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.160> few

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
I'm just going to take you through a few

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.950 
I'm just going to take you through a few
steps<00:00:09.000> here<00:00:09.269> on<00:00:09.360> how<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.630> should<00:00:09.780> be

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
steps here on how you should be

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.450 
steps here on how you should be
conducting<00:00:10.500> measurements<00:00:10.980> when<00:00:11.160> drawing

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
conducting measurements when drawing

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.940 
conducting measurements when drawing
landscapes<00:00:12.389> so<00:00:12.960> what<00:00:13.080> i'm<00:00:13.170> doing<00:00:13.410> here<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.710> i'm

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
landscapes so what i'm doing here is i'm

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.470 
landscapes so what i'm doing here is i'm
just<00:00:14.009> measuring<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.910> bottom<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
just measuring the bottom of the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.880 
just measuring the bottom of the
building<00:00:15.839> that's<00:00:15.929> visible<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.590> i'm<00:00:16.650> trying

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
building that's visible and i'm trying

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.599 
building that's visible and i'm trying
to<00:00:17.130> divide<00:00:17.460> my<00:00:17.490> page<00:00:17.970> into<00:00:18.390> sections<00:00:19.130> so<00:00:20.130> it's

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
to divide my page into sections so it's

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.840 
to divide my page into sections so it's
almost<00:00:21.090> halfway<00:00:21.689> through<00:00:21.930> on<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.769> right<00:00:23.519> side

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
almost halfway through on the right side

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.900 
almost halfway through on the right side
here<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.359> slightly<00:00:24.930> lower<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.619> left<00:00:25.910> next

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
here and slightly lower on the left next

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.580 
here and slightly lower on the left next
thing<00:00:27.060> what<00:00:27.210> i<00:00:27.240> can<00:00:27.449> do<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.599> measure<00:00:27.960> up<00:00:28.289> from

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
thing what i can do is measure up from

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.370 
thing what i can do is measure up from
this<00:00:28.740> line<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.490> top<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.939> building<00:00:30.380> and

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
this line to the top of the building and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.229 
this line to the top of the building and
i'm<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.619> going<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.980> create<00:00:32.640> another<00:00:32.969> line

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
i'm just going to create another line

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.459 
i'm just going to create another line
there<00:00:35.329> you<00:00:36.329> should<00:00:36.540> also<00:00:36.690> perhaps<00:00:37.020> measure

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
there you should also perhaps measure

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.760 
there you should also perhaps measure
the<00:00:37.739> length<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.540> if<00:00:39.540> you're<00:00:39.719> enlarging<00:00:40.590> or

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
the length and if you're enlarging or

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.299 
the length and if you're enlarging or
decreasing<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.410> drawing<00:00:43.410> if<00:00:43.800> you're<00:00:44.070> doing

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
decreasing the drawing if you're doing

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.279 
decreasing the drawing if you're doing
an<00:00:44.399> observational<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.480> uh<00:00:45.510> perhaps

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
an observational one is uh perhaps

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.200 
an observational one is uh perhaps
double<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.430> two<00:00:47.489> or<00:00:47.910> decrease<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.570> by<00:00:48.600> 2<00:00:48.750> etc

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
double it I two or decrease it by 2 etc

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.060 
double it I two or decrease it by 2 etc
so<00:00:51.210> I've<00:00:51.360> measured<00:00:51.629> from<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> edge<00:00:52.590> there<00:00:52.860> to

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
so I've measured from the edge there to

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.670 
so I've measured from the edge there to
the<00:00:53.190> inside<00:00:53.460> building<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.239> get<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> edge<00:00:54.680> then

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the inside building to get the edge then

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.150 
the inside building to get the edge then
I'm<00:00:55.770> also<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:57.500> connect<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.920> top

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
I'm also going to connect it to that top

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:10.910 
I'm also going to connect it to that top
line<00:00:59.370> there<00:01:09.140> next<00:01:10.140> thing<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.470> I'm<00:01:10.560> going<00:01:10.860> to

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
line there next thing what I'm going to

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.149 
line there next thing what I'm going to
do<00:01:11.780> is<00:01:12.780> find<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.380> end<00:01:13.560> point<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
do is find the end point for the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.160 
do is find the end point for the
building<00:01:14.520> here<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:18.210> I'm<00:01:18.509> also<00:01:18.659> going<00:01:18.960> to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
building here and I'm also going to

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.399 
building here and I'm also going to
either<00:01:19.530> measure<00:01:20.009> from<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.369> top<00:01:21.330> down<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:22.110> or

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
either measure from the top down here or

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.460 
either measure from the top down here or
I<00:01:22.439> could<00:01:22.770> also<00:01:22.890> measure<00:01:23.340> up<00:01:24.000> from<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.600> second

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
I could also measure up from that second

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.850 
I could also measure up from that second
line<00:01:26.840> I've<00:01:27.840> done<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> measurements<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.740> I'm

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
line I've done the measurements and I'm

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.039 
line I've done the measurements and I'm
just<00:01:29.220> going<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.430> extend<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.909> line<00:01:30.119> across<00:01:30.390> I

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.740 

measure<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.380> from<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> end<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:36.450> give<00:01:36.600> me

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
measure in from the end I can give me

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.780 
measure in from the end I can give me
the<00:01:36.780> angle<00:01:39.710> find<00:01:40.710> out<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.979> layout<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
the angle find out the layout for the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.950 
the angle find out the layout for the
tree<00:01:42.479> here<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.170> measured<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:44.810> find<00:01:45.810> out

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
tree here so just measured in find out

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.370 
tree here so just measured in find out
the<00:01:46.259> measurement<00:01:46.860> for<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.340> walkway<00:01:47.880> here

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.050 

measuring<00:01:50.740> from<00:01:50.890> in<00:01:51.040> these<00:01:51.219> sides<00:01:53.969> then<00:01:54.969> the

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
measuring from in these sides then the

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.510 
measuring from in these sides then the
measurement<00:01:55.479> i'm<00:01:55.570> going<00:01:55.719> to<00:01:55.810> start<00:01:56.520> planting

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
measurement i'm going to start planting

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.060 
measurement i'm going to start planting
it<00:01:57.640> is<00:01:57.759> rough<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:59.200> basically<00:01:59.530> what<00:01:59.740> i'm<00:01:59.829> trying

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
it is rough so basically what i'm trying

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.850 
it is rough so basically what i'm trying
to<00:02:00.130> do<00:02:00.280> is<00:02:00.369> just<00:02:00.430> break<00:02:01.119> my<00:02:01.229> paper<00:02:02.229> down<00:02:02.560> into

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
to do is just break my paper down into

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:12.690 
to do is just break my paper down into
parts<00:02:03.070> here<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:12.069> i<00:02:12.130> want<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.370> find<00:02:12.550> the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
parts here so i want to find the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.030 
parts here so i want to find the
measurements<00:02:13.150> for<00:02:13.360> these<00:02:14.110> ridge<00:02:14.470> lines<00:02:14.769> on

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
measurements for these ridge lines on

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.680 
measurements for these ridge lines on
the<00:02:15.160> building<00:02:15.519> so<00:02:15.700> i'm<00:02:15.760> measuring<00:02:15.970> from<00:02:16.540> the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
the building so i'm measuring from the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.440 
the building so i'm measuring from the
sign<00:02:16.959> here<00:02:17.290> down<00:02:17.560> then<00:02:18.519> from<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:18.940> other<00:02:19.120> side

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
sign here down then from the other side

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.380 
sign here down then from the other side
i<00:02:19.750> can<00:02:20.050> just<00:02:20.170> mark<00:02:20.470> those<00:02:20.680> points<00:02:21.190> then<00:02:22.120> draw

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
i can just mark those points then draw

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.660 
i can just mark those points then draw
my<00:02:22.599> line<00:02:22.840> straight<00:02:23.380> across<00:02:23.620> between<00:02:24.489> those

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
my line straight across between those

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.420 
my line straight across between those
two<00:02:24.880> points<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:26.650> I'll<00:02:26.830> just<00:02:27.010> repeat<00:02:27.220> the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
two points and I'll just repeat the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.920 
two points and I'll just repeat the
process<00:02:27.760> for<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.690> other<00:02:28.900> ones<00:02:29.290> as<00:02:29.500> well<00:02:33.930> I'm

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
process for the other ones as well I'm

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.470 
process for the other ones as well I'm
just<00:02:35.080> going<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.410> do<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.400> same<00:02:36.610> but<00:02:36.880> vertical

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
just going to do the same but vertical

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.569 
just going to do the same but vertical
or<00:02:38.230> find<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:38.980> measurements<00:02:39.370> for<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:39.549> windows

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
or find the measurements for the windows

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.949 
or find the measurements for the windows
naturally<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:42.730> windows<00:02:43.030> on<00:02:43.209> this<00:02:43.390> side<00:02:43.599> will

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
naturally the windows on this side will

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.770 
naturally the windows on this side will
be<00:02:43.989> thicker<00:02:44.920> than<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.370> windows<00:02:46.180> on<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.390> bar

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
be thicker than the windows on the bar

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.009 
be thicker than the windows on the bar
side<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:51.940> would<00:02:52.180> go<00:02:52.360> through<00:02:52.599> and<00:02:52.840> measure

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
side and I would go through and measure

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:03.330 
side and I would go through and measure
each<00:02:53.769> of<00:02:54.099> these<00:02:54.340> sections<00:02:55.049> individually<00:03:02.340> so

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
each of these sections individually so

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.680 
each of these sections individually so
I'm<00:03:03.400> going<00:03:03.519> to<00:03:03.549> start<00:03:03.760> blocking<00:03:04.180> in<00:03:04.450> some

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
I'm going to start blocking in some

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.990 
I'm going to start blocking in some
parts<00:03:04.989> of<00:03:05.109> the<00:03:05.170> trees<00:03:05.530> here<00:03:05.889> so<00:03:06.579> I<00:03:06.609> can<00:03:06.700> see

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
parts of the trees here so I can see

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.849 
parts of the trees here so I can see
there<00:03:07.180> is<00:03:07.269> a<00:03:07.299> branch<00:03:07.660> here<00:03:07.780> between<00:03:08.170> these<00:03:08.590> two

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
there is a branch here between these two

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.180 
there is a branch here between these two
windows<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:11.260> can<00:03:11.440> measure<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.799> distance

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
windows and I can measure the distance

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.170 
windows and I can measure the distance
from<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.489> building<00:03:13.000> towards<00:03:13.780> this<00:03:13.989> tree<00:03:14.410> as

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
from the building towards this tree as

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.120 
from the building towards this tree as
well<00:03:16.180> as<00:03:16.389> I<00:03:16.660> can<00:03:16.840> measure<00:03:17.019> down<00:03:17.350> from<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:17.920> line

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
well as I can measure down from the line

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.740 
well as I can measure down from the line
to<00:03:18.400> see<00:03:18.639> where<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.120> tree<00:03:19.569> comes<00:03:20.049> into<00:03:20.440> view<00:03:21.750> so

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
to see where the tree comes into view so

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.930 
to see where the tree comes into view so
I'll<00:03:22.840> just<00:03:22.900> start<00:03:23.290> sketching<00:03:23.799> that<00:03:23.950> in<00:03:24.130> some

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
I'll just start sketching that in some

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.640 
I'll just start sketching that in some
of<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.090> other<00:03:25.209> branches<00:03:25.690> I<00:03:25.840> usually<00:03:26.230> do<00:03:26.410> by<00:03:26.620> a

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
of the other branches I usually do by a

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.840 
of the other branches I usually do by a
free<00:03:27.160> hand<00:03:28.230> then<00:03:29.230> I'm<00:03:29.350> going<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.739> measure<00:03:30.040> down

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
free hand then I'm going to measure down

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.819 
free hand then I'm going to measure down
this<00:03:31.180> way<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.480> see<00:03:31.959> where<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.260> next<00:03:32.560> tree

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
this way to see where the next tree

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:40.500 
this way to see where the next tree
comes<00:03:33.310> in<00:03:37.739> and<00:03:38.739> I<00:03:38.950> can<00:03:39.130> see<00:03:39.340> this<00:03:39.549> tree<00:03:39.940> judging

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
comes in and I can see this tree judging

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.270 
comes in and I can see this tree judging
by<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:41.109> placement<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.709> windows<00:03:42.040> and

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
by the placement of the windows and

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.530 
by the placement of the windows and
there's<00:03:42.430> going<00:03:42.579> to<00:03:42.670> put<00:03:42.760> a<00:03:42.790> line<00:03:43.030> there<00:03:43.299> to

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
there's going to put a line there to

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.230 
there's going to put a line there to
signal<00:03:43.959> where<00:03:44.709> it'll<00:03:44.950> be

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
signal where it'll be

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.640 
signal where it'll be
want<00:03:47.240> to<00:03:47.300> check<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.630> area<00:03:47.780> of<00:03:47.990> the<00:03:48.080> bushes<00:03:48.320> now

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
want to check the area of the bushes now

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.530 
want to check the area of the bushes now
so<00:03:48.950> just<00:03:48.980> going<00:03:49.250> to<00:03:49.340> measure<00:03:49.730> up<00:03:50.030> we<00:03:50.270> can<00:03:50.390> also

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
so just going to measure up we can also

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.950 
so just going to measure up we can also
measure<00:03:51.110> down<00:03:51.470> from<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:52.070> middle<00:03:53.030> line<00:03:53.210> I'm

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
measure down from the middle line I'm

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.290 
measure down from the middle line I'm
going<00:03:54.080> to<00:03:54.290> measure<00:03:54.440> R<00:03:54.590> in<00:03:54.770> to<00:03:55.040> see<00:03:55.280> I'm<00:03:55.940> trying

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
going to measure R in to see I'm trying

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.540 
going to measure R in to see I'm trying
to<00:03:56.420> compare<00:03:56.810> one<00:03:57.650> object<00:03:58.100> to<00:03:58.160> another<00:03:58.250> object

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
to compare one object to another object

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.120 
to compare one object to another object
to<00:03:59.060> see<00:03:59.270> where<00:03:59.570> one<00:03:59.810> begins<00:04:00.020> and<00:04:00.590> when<00:04:00.920> it's

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
to see where one begins and when it's

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.390 
to see where one begins and when it's
one<00:04:01.790> way<00:04:01.940> you<00:04:02.000> can<00:04:02.210> also<00:04:02.330> do<00:04:02.690> is<00:04:02.980> create<00:04:03.980> a<00:04:04.070> box

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
one way you can also do is create a box

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.520 
one way you can also do is create a box
measurement<00:04:05.000> and<00:04:05.210> then<00:04:05.600> work<00:04:05.870> inside<00:04:06.260> that

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
measurement and then work inside that

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.530 
measurement and then work inside that
box<00:04:06.800> dealing<00:04:07.340> with<00:04:07.520> the<00:04:07.970> measurements<00:04:08.240> of<00:04:08.480> the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
box dealing with the measurements of the

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.780 
box dealing with the measurements of the
bush<00:04:08.870> as<00:04:09.050> well<00:04:12.340> now<00:04:13.340> that<00:04:13.490> I<00:04:13.520> have<00:04:13.670> the

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
bush as well now that I have the

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.690 
bush as well now that I have the
measurement<00:04:14.210> of<00:04:14.240> the<00:04:14.390> bush<00:04:14.600> I<00:04:14.810> can<00:04:15.459> mark<00:04:16.459> in

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
measurement of the bush I can mark in

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.340 
measurement of the bush I can mark in
the<00:04:17.180> measurements<00:04:17.600> for<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:17.810> other<00:04:17.989> grass

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350

areas in relation to the other lines
that<00:04:21.109> I've<00:04:21.200> sketched<00:04:21.590> and<00:04:23.380> can<00:04:24.380> also<00:04:24.530> put<00:04:24.830> in

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
that I've sketched and can also put in

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.950 
that I've sketched and can also put in
this<00:04:25.130> line<00:04:25.430> here<00:04:25.760> judging<00:04:26.450> by<00:04:26.480> the<00:04:26.690> other

this line here judging by the other

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.500 
this line here judging by the other
lines<00:04:29.200> and<00:04:30.200> it's<00:04:30.650> gonna<00:04:30.800> mark<00:04:31.070> some<00:04:31.510> basic

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
lines and it's gonna mark some basic

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:41.230 
lines and it's gonna mark some basic
shapes<00:04:32.810> here<00:04:33.050> to<00:04:33.290> show<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:34.310> bushes<00:04:40.120> so<00:04:41.120> when

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
shapes here to show the bushes so when

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.790 
shapes here to show the bushes so when
you're<00:04:41.360> doing<00:04:41.630> observational<00:04:42.320> drawing<00:04:42.530> you

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
you're doing observational drawing you

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.409 
you're doing observational drawing you
should<00:04:42.980> have<00:04:43.160> something<00:04:43.370> perhaps<00:04:43.640> similar<00:04:44.090> to

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
should have something perhaps similar to

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.680 
should have something perhaps similar to
this<00:04:44.570> on<00:04:44.890> to<00:04:45.890> act<00:04:46.070> as<00:04:46.280> a<00:04:46.310> guide<00:04:46.550> on<00:04:46.820> how<00:04:47.060> each

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
this on to act as a guide on how each

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.530 
this on to act as a guide on how each
object<00:04:47.960> will<00:04:48.350> relate<00:04:48.680> to<00:04:48.890> another<00:04:49.010> object<00:04:49.540> and

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
object will relate to another object and

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.150 
object will relate to another object and
I<00:04:50.720> can<00:04:50.870> just<00:04:50.900> start<00:04:51.290> going<00:04:51.530> ahead<00:04:51.770> now<00:04:52.130> and

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
I can just start going ahead now and

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.880 
I can just start going ahead now and
either<00:04:52.669> darken<00:04:53.419> those<00:04:53.540> lines<00:04:53.900> to<00:04:54.169> cut<00:04:54.440> to

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
either darken those lines to cut to

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.190 
either darken those lines to cut to
enhance<00:04:55.610> it<00:04:55.850> and<00:04:56.030> but<00:04:56.660> I'm<00:04:56.750> just<00:04:56.960> going<00:04:57.110> to

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
enhance it and but I'm just going to

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.360 
enhance it and but I'm just going to
start<00:04:57.410> adding<00:04:57.680> a<00:04:57.950> color<00:04:58.370> directly<00:04:58.730> on<00:04:59.090> it<00:04:59.240> now
