00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:15.400
 think like one gathered in the mountains 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:17.909
 how much effort because nobody knows that 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.909
 land is low 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.920
 or maybe they don't mind 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.860
 today we prepare the omelette from 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.470
 wild swordswoman of monte scalambra 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.840

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:50.090
 ingredients and the shoots the pepper eggs 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.170

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:58.370
 fresh spring onion and some cheese 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:08.409

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:08.409
 pan that we will put oil in here 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.920
 we are here 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.659
 we must explain that the onions 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.330
 fresh and good as well this does not go away 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.479
 threw good all different with the 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.780
 Roman vegetables very good part of the 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.270
 little onions have it everywhere 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:36.050
 but we have a good land 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:40.940
 then our volcanic fragrances 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:43.970
 our vegetables are special because 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:48.890
 all throw these no this is the 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:52.700
 best chives except white but 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:57.649
 that is more fragrant at home than a 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:02.869
 name which allow us to cook 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:06.229
 spring onions and then prepare the spara gina 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:09.519
 wild that this would be here yes 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.140

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.989
 knives 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.330

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:23.810

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:26.180

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.160
 asparagus is not thrown away 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.500
 I boil them while I'm doing the 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:37.519
 pasta that juice that remains is good one 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.200
 stolen and then use it together that 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.630
 continue 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.630

00:02:48.380 --> 00:03:05.910
