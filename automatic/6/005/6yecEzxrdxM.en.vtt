gonna live there in fact let's build our
wings<00:00:26.789> now<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.990> these<00:00:28.830> Lego<00:00:29.130> pieces<00:00:29.550> here

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
wings now so these Lego pieces here

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.389 
wings now so these Lego pieces here
these<00:00:30.510> are<00:00:30.720> called<00:00:30.840> angle<00:00:31.410> plates<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.279> we've

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
these are called angle plates and we've

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.040 
these are called angle plates and we've
got<00:00:32.550> left<00:00:32.820> angle<00:00:33.149> plates<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.600> right<00:00:33.809> ones

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
got left angle plates and right ones

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.900 
got left angle plates and right ones
let's<00:00:34.320> start<00:00:34.620> with<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.340> left<00:00:35.610> plate

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
let's start with the the left plate

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.030 
let's start with the the left plate
we're<00:00:36.480> gonna<00:00:36.570> build<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.899> Lego<00:00:37.170> sandwich<00:00:37.800> in

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
we're gonna build a Lego sandwich in

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.020 
we're gonna build a Lego sandwich in
fact<00:00:38.250> let<00:00:38.370> me<00:00:38.399> just<00:00:38.579> show<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.730> can<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:38.940> see

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
fact let me just show you can you see

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.200 
fact let me just show you can you see
that<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:40.290> quite<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> special<00:00:41.129> modified<00:00:41.940> piece

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
that it's quite a special modified piece

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.709 
that it's quite a special modified piece
so<00:00:42.989> we're<00:00:43.379> gonna<00:00:43.469> stack<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.980> left<00:00:44.390> angle<00:00:45.390> plate

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
so we're gonna stack a left angle plate

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.180 
so we're gonna stack a left angle plate
and<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> white<00:00:46.050> one<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.320> know<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.590> make<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> Lego

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
and a white one I know it make a Lego

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.880 
and a white one I know it make a Lego
sandwich<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.200> so<00:00:49.200> that's<00:00:49.379> our<00:00:49.530> left

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
sandwich like this so that's our left

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.600 
sandwich like this so that's our left
wing<00:00:50.129> built<00:00:50.399> let's<00:00:50.910> build<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.660> right<00:00:51.960> wing

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
wing built let's build the right wing

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.760 
wing built let's build the right wing
same<00:00:53.610> method<00:00:54.030> stack<00:00:54.750> those<00:00:54.930> place<00:00:55.260> into<00:00:55.739> a

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
same method stack those place into a

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.520 
same method stack those place into a
Lego<00:00:56.190> sandwich<00:00:56.760> give<00:00:57.660> them<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.899> good<00:00:58.020> squeeze

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.759 
two solid studs on the top and then
attach<00:02:23.830> our<00:02:24.070> 2<00:02:24.280> by<00:02:24.430> 2<00:02:24.489> nose<00:02:25.000> cone<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.620> we'll

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
attach our 2 by 2 nose cone and we'll

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.020 
attach our 2 by 2 nose cone and we'll
attach<00:02:27.070> that<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.890> top<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:30.310> our<00:02:30.459> jet<00:02:30.730> you

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
attach that to the top of our jet you

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.660 
attach that to the top of our jet you
can<00:02:31.060> see<00:02:31.300> it's<00:02:31.450> taking<00:02:31.600> shape<00:02:31.810> now<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.670> now

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
these Lego jumpers in red we're gonna

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.800 
these Lego jumpers in red we're gonna
stack<00:02:37.569> these<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:38.319> a<00:02:38.590> row<00:02:38.890> all<00:02:39.850> side-by-side

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
stack these in a row all side-by-side

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.370 
stack these in a row all side-by-side
like<00:02:41.050> this<00:02:41.260> here<00:02:41.590> we<00:02:41.650> go<00:02:41.880> 1<00:02:42.880> 2<00:02:43.120> 3<00:02:44.100> there<00:02:45.100> we<00:02:45.220> go

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
like this here we go 1 2 3 there we go

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.080 
like this here we go 1 2 3 there we go
just<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.530> make<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:48.010> bit<00:02:48.220> consistent<00:02:48.910> here

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
just to make it a bit consistent here

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.660 
just to make it a bit consistent here
and<00:02:49.330> nice<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.660> smooth<00:02:49.930> we'll<00:02:50.260> use<00:02:50.470> another<00:02:50.670> 1

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
and nice and smooth we'll use another 1
