00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
Expo we're pretty excited by by what it

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.009 
Expo we're pretty excited by by what it
was<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:23.000> the<00:00:24.000> innovation<00:00:24.570> with<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
was and and the innovation with the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.200 
was and and the innovation with the
caravan<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.160> features<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.760> caravan

caravan and the features on the caravan

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.009 
caravan and the features on the caravan
and<00:00:27.859> so<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:28.980> bought<00:00:29.130> our<00:00:29.250> first<00:00:29.279> Caravan<00:00:30.019> about

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
and so we bought our first Caravan about

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.410 
and so we bought our first Caravan about
twelve<00:00:31.410> months<00:00:31.619> ago<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:32.940> worked<00:00:33.149> very

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
twelve months ago and it's worked very

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.900 
twelve months ago and it's worked very
successfully<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.980> eggs<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.489> carbon

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
successfully the eggs and the carbon

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.880 
successfully the eggs and the carbon
come<00:00:36.059> out<00:00:36.210> very<00:00:36.390> clean<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.110> certainly<00:00:37.620> saved

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
come out very clean so certainly saved

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.860 
come out very clean so certainly saved
some<00:00:38.190> cleaning<00:00:38.670> time<00:00:38.879> it's<00:00:39.120> got<00:00:39.270> water<00:00:39.480> build

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
some cleaning time it's got water build

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.799 
some cleaning time it's got water build
into<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.200> caravan<00:00:41.059> here<00:00:42.059> at<00:00:42.149> Danny<00:00:42.360> do<00:00:42.570> it's

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
into the caravan here at Danny do it's

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.119 
into the caravan here at Danny do it's
it's<00:00:43.170> fairly<00:00:44.100> dry<00:00:44.340> we<00:00:44.610> don't<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:44.910> irrigated

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
it's fairly dry we don't have irrigated

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.000 
it's fairly dry we don't have irrigated
points<00:00:47.129> throughout<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.550> paddock<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.239> we<00:00:48.629> rely

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
points throughout the paddock so we rely

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.090 
points throughout the paddock so we rely
on<00:00:50.360> watered<00:00:51.360> shuttles<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.620> water<00:00:52.829> in

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
on watered shuttles that have water in

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.819 
on watered shuttles that have water in
them<00:00:53.300> but<00:00:54.300> certainly<00:00:54.570> advantageous<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.680> have

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
them but certainly advantageous to have

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.709 
them but certainly advantageous to have
water<00:00:56.160> built<00:00:56.460> into<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.789> caravans<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.420> also

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
water built into the caravans and also

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.400 
water built into the caravans and also
gives<00:00:57.930> us<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.079> chance<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:59.899> feed<00:01:00.899> water<00:01:01.140> into

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
gives us a chance to to feed water into

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.200 
gives us a chance to to feed water into
the<00:01:01.500> caravans<00:01:01.920> from<00:01:02.010> our<00:01:02.219> water<00:01:02.430> truck<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.030> so

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the caravans from our water truck and so

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.560 
the caravans from our water truck and so
we've<00:01:03.329> got<00:01:03.510> extra<00:01:03.690> capacity<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:05.090> and<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
we've got extra capacity there and the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.940 
we've got extra capacity there and the
fact<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.159> the<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:09.119> eggs<00:01:09.270> roll<00:01:09.540> away<00:01:09.869> from<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
fact the the the eggs roll away from the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.679 
fact the the the eggs roll away from the
chickens<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.180> chickens<00:01:12.570> are

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
chickens and the chickens are

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.660 
chickens and the chickens are
effectively<00:01:13.110> kicked<00:01:13.439> out<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.979> nests<00:01:14.400> at

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
effectively kicked out of that nests at

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.210 
effectively kicked out of that nests at
night<00:01:14.990> again<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.110> another<00:01:16.530> great<00:01:16.740> feature<00:01:16.799> of

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
night again is another great feature of

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.410 
night again is another great feature of
the<00:01:17.400> caravan<00:01:17.990> we<00:01:18.990> actually<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:20.159> some<00:01:20.700> older

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the caravan we actually have some older

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.660 
the caravan we actually have some older
style<00:01:21.720> sheds<00:01:22.049> as<00:01:22.259> well<00:01:22.500> but<00:01:23.490> we've<00:01:23.640> just

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
style sheds as well but we've just

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.429 
style sheds as well but we've just
bought<00:01:24.000> our<00:01:24.150> second<00:01:24.540> curve<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.930> because<00:01:25.259> we

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
bought our second curve and because we

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.960 
bought our second curve and because we
feel<00:01:26.400> they're<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:27.299> great<00:01:28.280> product<00:01:29.280> compared<00:01:29.850> to

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
feel they're a great product compared to

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.080 
feel they're a great product compared to
some<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.270> older<00:01:30.540> sheds<00:01:30.780> we<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.880> we

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
some of the older sheds we have and we

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.450 
some of the older sheds we have and we
think<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.420> over<00:01:33.810> long-term<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> was

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
think it over long-term you know it was

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.380 
think it over long-term you know it was
certainly<00:01:35.729> saved<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.060> lot<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.210> time<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:39.240> I

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
certainly saved a lot of time and and I

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.969 
certainly saved a lot of time and and I
think<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.750> investment<00:01:40.470> certainly

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
think the investment certainly

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.370 
think the investment certainly
worthwhile<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.930> great<00:01:43.049> product

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
worthwhile but it's it's a great product

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.520 
worthwhile but it's it's a great product
or<00:01:43.680> certainly<00:01:44.250> recommend<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:45.170> we've<00:01:46.170> enjoyed

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
or certainly recommend it we've enjoyed

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.130 
or certainly recommend it we've enjoyed
using<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.369> caravans<00:01:47.850> they're<00:01:48.600> very<00:01:48.780> easy<00:01:48.960> to

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
using the caravans they're very easy to

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.990 
using the caravans they're very easy to
move<00:01:49.259> around<00:01:49.320> we<00:01:49.950> move<00:01:50.130> our<00:01:50.340> caravans

in well with that where one of the main

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.270 
in well with that where one of the main
reasons<00:02:00.930> why<00:02:01.110> we're<00:02:01.290> doing<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.250> to

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
reasons why we're doing this is to

cattle certainly appreciate that they
