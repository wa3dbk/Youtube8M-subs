00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
collectible obviously I'm not going to

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.350 
collectible obviously I'm not going to
do<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:37.979> because<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.729> whole<00:01:38.850> idea<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.210> this

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
do that because the whole idea of this

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.149 
do that because the whole idea of this
is<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.810> see<00:01:40.049> what's<00:01:40.229> inside<00:01:40.380> although

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
is so you can see what's inside although

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.440 
is so you can see what's inside although
part<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.460> me<00:01:41.520> kind<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.850> wish<00:01:42.000> as<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.210> could

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
part of me kind of wish as I could

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.420 
part of me kind of wish as I could
that's<00:01:42.930> kind<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.290> defeating<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> purpose<00:01:44.009> but

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
that's kind of defeating the purpose but

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.920 
that's kind of defeating the purpose but
I<00:01:44.490> do<00:01:44.610> know<00:01:44.909> some<00:01:45.149> people<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.450> will<00:01:45.720> greatly
