00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.360
 Well, what about friends and followers first? 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.910
 before starting if the description of 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.660
 the following tutorials that I'm going to 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.150
 record I want to thank you for these 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.990
 last two years that I already have with the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.890
 channel for your support and for your good vibes 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.260
 and so be constantly following in 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.380
 this work that I have a little bit of 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.920
 story when I started this channel what 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.670
 I did with the idea of ​​publishing videos that 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.130
 I recorded personally as notes 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.330
 to work with this great engine of 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.640
 render that was this then viceroy in his 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.820
 moment I learned with version 1.4 I 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.370
 it seems and I think that the videos that with the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.560
 that started the channel was 1.5 ago 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.230
 some time then came the 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.860
 version 2.0 that presented a 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.680
 an important breakthrough and new issues 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.740
 as for the render but now it has 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:20.210
 arrived a few months ago a new 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.210
 version that is version 3.0 of viceroy 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.190
 well this version already presents 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.200
 many different changes with what 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.910
 respect to the previous ones especially in 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.310
 what is a matter of the work flow 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.500
 and the interface has changed a bit now 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.990
 is more friendly then from here that I 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.480
 see the importance of renewing the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.150
 channel content and you can show them 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.630
 now what they call what is the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:51.180
 arq workflow for artist flow 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.280
 Gandaristas for himself and for all 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.110

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.780
 render engine for that first thing that 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.770
 need is to have an account 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.750

 to settle the viceroy in a way 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.090

 settings that is something that I love are 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.549
 the new features that I'm going to 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.970
 try to introduce the same as I did 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.569
 in trimax trim videos , 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.129
 let's talk briefly how 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.230
 describe the functions of this engine 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.879
 render and where are we going to find them 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:49.650
 true and this we are going to do 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:54.209
 directly from the page of docs 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:57.120
 point cause group.com yes that will be 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.810
 here is where we are going to 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.359
 take 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.400
 I'm going to draw the agenda as I did 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.650
 the first time 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.359
 and I will go trying to describe 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.040
 according to the content for example when 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.370
 touch that we talk about the materials I 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.170
 I go to the video and material section and 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.100
 Well, let's see all the information 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.500
 described here and then I will explain 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.690
 in a concise way and in Spanish well what 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.210
 is what they are giving us as 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.870
 support well since we have installed it 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.430
 let's click on trimax and check that 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.320
 the installation has been done in a 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.870
 correct 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.580
 if you have any previous version to max 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.650
 then it is advisable to pardon Viceroy 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.540
 it is recommended to uninstall and 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.560
 do a cleaning of this one so that it does not 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:47.760
 there is no problem prior to the new 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.920
 installation well since you have loaded then 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.960

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.290
 viceroy that these other things that a 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.460
 I loved it because we have a 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.020
 bar where we are going to have all the 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.640
 details or all the tools that 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.830
 we usually have here in the panel 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.650
 create then to create cameras and all 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.639
 these issues that are very useful with 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.249
 which we are working day by day 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:13.909
 and well with this we are going to review the 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:16.699
 customer let's go to forgiveness let's go to 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:20.449
 go to the render engine and it's already defined 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:24.699
