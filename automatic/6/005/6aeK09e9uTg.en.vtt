00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
of first row blacks but apparently i

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.720

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
override it with something else so I

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.030 
override it with something else so I

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
or the audigy depth so I took a

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.680 
or the audigy depth so I took a
screenshot<00:03:49.040> since<00:03:49.459> its<00:03:49.820> bit<00:03:50.209> more<00:03:50.390> clear<00:03:50.660> than

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
screenshot since its bit more clear than

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.160 
screenshot since its bit more clear than
the<00:03:51.200> video<00:03:51.530> so<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.850> first<00:03:53.239> two<00:03:53.600> rows<00:03:53.840> are

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
the video so the first two rows are

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.380 
the video so the first two rows are
obviously<00:03:54.560> normal<00:03:55.130> common<00:03:55.519> drops<00:03:55.760> there's

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
obviously normal common drops there's

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
1.6 bill which is pretty crazy so with

the normal good words armor it's

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.820 
the normal good words armor it's
probably<00:04:35.669> around<00:04:36.270> two<00:04:36.659> billion<00:04:37.050> I<00:04:37.470> believe

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
probably around two billion I believe

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.760 
probably around two billion I believe
i'm<00:04:38.009> not<00:04:38.159> sure<00:04:38.340> how<00:04:38.460> much<00:04:38.580> data<00:04:38.930> items<00:04:39.930> or<00:04:40.080> it's

i'm not sure how much data items or it's
probably<00:04:41.099> around<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.460> build<00:04:41.729> an<00:04:41.879> total<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:42.509> i

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.409 
probably around to build an total and i

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.460 
probably around to build an total and i
also<00:04:43.680> have<00:04:44.099> made<00:04:44.400> over<00:04:44.669> one<00:04:45.060> bill<00:04:45.360> with<00:04:45.690> the

one bill i'm not sure how much things
even<00:04:52.620> more<00:04:52.650> probable<00:04:53.400> five<00:04:53.849> bills<00:04:54.210> so<00:04:54.419> i<00:04:54.449> have

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
even more probable five bills so i have

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.270 
even more probable five bills so i have
made<00:04:54.990> quite<00:04:55.319> a<00:04:55.440> lot<00:04:55.650> of<00:04:55.680> money<00:04:55.740> from<00:04:56.099> the

made quite a lot of money from the
series<00:04:56.669> it<00:04:57.449> is<00:04:57.599> pretty<00:04:57.840> epic<00:04:58.080> and<00:04:58.440> it's<00:04:58.470> a

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
series it is pretty epic and it's a

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.430 
series it is pretty epic and it's a
fungal<00:04:59.099> so<00:04:59.550> i'm<00:04:59.940> pretty<00:05:00.690> close<00:05:00.960> to<00:05:01.110> finishing

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
fungal so i'm pretty close to finishing

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.339
