00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.630
 I do not expect them to be very good 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.250
 in this video I'm going to talk about my 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.110
 hair and how it was that I painted it 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.200
 because I was doing many 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:33.520
 questions of how it was that I went from dark to 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:37.090
 clear and good it's very easy very obvious I used 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.880
 blige blige my hair twice 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.920
 mutxamel or colors twice and here 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.320
 I will tell you step by step how 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.840
 I did not have the video of when I did 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.790
 I recorded when I took it off because it was 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.530
 happened as well as last minute was 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.870
 one in the morning and I painting the 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.030
 hair because I was bored but if 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.700
 I took pictures and studying with them 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.420
 instagram then what are we going to 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.640
 bring how it was that I painted my hair and 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.439
 I also just made this look 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.200
 makeup I just recorded this tutorial 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:10.299
 Super bright dark makeup 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.770
 well as well dramatic then that 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.840
 they want to see this video they can do 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.479
 click on lalín that is going to leave you a little 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.280
 in the description box or here 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.260
 you can also click for what 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.360
 in this good video then as 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.020
 you know, I brought my hair 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.000
 dark and before to before I 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.549
 I grew them I had already been discolored 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.140
 twice and good the case is that it is 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.720
 bored and I wanted to do something different 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.880
 I wanted to clarify the tips make me 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.830
 something like man and that's how it was 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.750
 As I was left, you already saw in the photo how 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.970
 it looks when I bring it curly 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.480
 and that's how it looks when I bring it 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.480
 lazio 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.740
 ah 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.530
 Well, what I did was to do the 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.440
 bridge mix use this bridge 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.160
 yesterday and all that you can get in 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:21.990
 leave your fly and mix it with 30 this 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.550
 30th volume of peroxide and as I did not want 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.590
 that is mistreating a lot the hair 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.190
 I added a jet of shampoo so that 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.230
 this was so strong the bridge then 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.680
 what I did afterwards was to divide the hair 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.280
 in four parts were two parts here 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.760
 in front 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.070
 these two and the two behind and use 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.870
 aluminum to be able to clarify then 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.620
 it is very easy, the only thing I did was 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.530
 go separating pieces like that from the hair and 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.260
 I put the brics where I wanted to keep it and 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.050
 some parts went up as well as more than 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.240
 others so not so perfect very well as well as to 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.090
 and it's going so that there is no line 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.660
 well it would not be the difference of leather to 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.610
 dark then this one after that 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.230
 do all the hair center use 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.569
 the dryer 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.950
 that the process will accelerate a bit 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:17.250
 more and the parts of those stripes that be 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.780
 above there it does not cover them with aluminum 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.909
 It fills more cover the tips with 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.190
 aluminum like all this good puts it 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.470
 aluminum and I'm out here I did not put it 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.080
 aluminum to this process a 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.980
 little slower and give that effect of 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.959
 darker color to more clarity then 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.970
 this one then after that I already washed the 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:41.569
 normal hair and use this dye 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:46.799
 permanent in the clairol brand is 7 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:48.629
 he is a medium blond with blue tones 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.390
 so that he could remove the orange because 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:54.370
 after I improve my hair 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.200
 I remain very navas the hair still 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.360
 So what I wanted to take away from you 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.799
 orange tones use this dye with 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.870
 blue base and this covered me a little 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.430
 but not much anyway I do 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.409
 I wanted with a little bit more light 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.930
 good as it was at night because I could not see myself 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.519
 very good hair if it had 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.920
 it was so clear that I wanted 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.079
 leave me crimes of the sun already in the light 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.209
 of the day it will look better but you will not 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.310
 you have been like that, very golden brown 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.340
 coppery and I do not like your stories because 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.430
 clarify me again but how has it 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.560
 I finished that cliché then I went and bought 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.330
 another I use it this nothing else for 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.720
 try something different this is also from 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.510
 the brand they read is the basic wild and 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.699
 Well, if we go a little bit more than this 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.229
 because I feel that, of course, more 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.330
 hair but from not having the 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.300
 colorado so I can not know if of 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.070
 truth clarified more or not but that yes 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.760
 when I activate it with heat if 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.590
 it worked clarified a lot faster than 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.940
 the year 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.120
 I do not know how in five minutes was the 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.330
 hair ready 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.030
 and then after using that my 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.590
 hair or I mixed it the same with volume of 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.479
 30 but this time I did not put shampoo 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.280
 because I wanted to clarify it as much as 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.780
 you could and when shampoo how 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.940
 dilutes the product because it is not clear 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.919
 so then nothing else how is that 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.350
 same with 30 volume the same peroxide 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.540
 that I took him to teach and I left him in the 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.389
 hair about half an hour later I 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.240
 pay normal as always and before 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.370
 put on the dye at the first time 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.870
 also this the first second time 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.080
 uses the same ink that of clator is 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.750
 you just teach them and use them as a 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.760
 tonic tinted although this is a tint 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.289
 permanent and do not use it common where 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.960
 not the toner are put with the 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.880
 wet damp hair and colors 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.250
 permanent which hair is with but 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.100
 as I did not want this one to mistreat more my 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:49.160
 hair then use it with the 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:52.520
 wet hair and that was the result 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:55.370
 so I stay and it became clearer to me more 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.630
 This little yellowish orange is not as 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.390
 first time 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:02.060
 and that was all I did to paint 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.590
 my hair are the steps that the 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.000
 dyes I use I'll leave them 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.360
 also the names below in the box 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.890
 of description in case this one or if you 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.970
 they want to check I leave here 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:15.680
 abajito and that was all the toner the two 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.960
 Sometimes I paint my hair I leave it 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.670
 as good the first time and I left it 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.280
 like half an hour to see if it removes more what 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.770
 orange but I do not remove it much then 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.530
 and the second time as the color I eat 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.410
 the hair was rinsed to the level that 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.570
 I wanted because I left him and the 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.610
 time that is half an hour knew darken 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.650
 because that is a medium roll then 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.000
 I did not want it so dark then I 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.830
 I left it until I saw that it started 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.810
 change color that I saw that started to 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.330
 tint the yellow tones a little 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.850
 that were like between 3 to 5 minutes something 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.920
 very fast and therefore very easy to do and 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.410
 this is the final result girls to me 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.630
 I really liked how I was had 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.820
 eager to bring hair like this 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:59.270
 man and I feel that I will be a father because 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.860
 you see the line so then that was 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.810
 everything I hope I hope you liked it 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.029
 this video you know they can find 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.860
