00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
exploration look at that nine signatures

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.600 
exploration look at that nine signatures
in<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.750> ballet<00:00:10.219> probably<00:00:11.219> one<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.400> the

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
in the ballet probably one of the

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.259 
in the ballet probably one of the
busiest<00:00:11.880> systems<00:00:12.769> in<00:00:13.769> solitude<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:14.880> we<00:00:15.179> are

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
busiest systems in solitude so we are

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.060 
busiest systems in solitude so we are
pretty<00:00:15.690> pretty<00:00:16.109> awesome<00:00:16.470> i<00:00:16.560> just<00:00:16.770> found<00:00:16.920> this

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
pretty pretty awesome i just found this

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.340 
pretty pretty awesome i just found this
vigil<00:00:17.490> here<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.000> i'm<00:00:18.600> going<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.930> take<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
vigil here and i'm going to take the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.920 
vigil here and i'm going to take the
opportunity<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.980> test<00:00:20.550> out<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.180> nerves<00:00:21.630> on

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
opportunity to test out the nerves on

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.349 
opportunity to test out the nerves on
the<00:00:22.830> sentry<00:00:23.130> drones<00:00:23.369> especially<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.000> guards

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
the sentry drones especially the guards

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.380 
the sentry drones especially the guards
which<00:00:25.019> have<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.769> think<00:00:26.369> like<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> twenty-five

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
which have a think like a twenty-five

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.510 
which have a think like a twenty-five
percent<00:00:27.800> lower<00:00:28.800> optimal<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:30.740> and<00:00:31.740> put<00:00:32.399> an

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
percent lower optimal and and put an

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.970 
percent lower optimal and and put an
increased<00:00:32.940> fall<00:00:33.329> off<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.719> let's<00:00:33.930> see<00:00:34.170> if<00:00:34.380> this

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
increased fall off so let's see if this

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.060 
increased fall off so let's see if this
really<00:00:35.370> becomes<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:36.059> problem<00:00:36.630> here<00:00:37.079> what's

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
really becomes a problem here what's

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.580 
really becomes a problem here what's

already good news i actually get hit at
the<00:00:40.649> same<00:00:42.410> distance<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.620> i<00:00:43.710> don't<00:00:44.160> have

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
the same distance and i don't have

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.600 
the same distance and i don't have
something<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.230> increases<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.250> tracking

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
something that increases the tracking

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.790 
something that increases the tracking
speed<00:00:47.850> or<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.120> optimal<00:00:48.899> range<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.649> mid

tracking as well so this is going to be

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.760 
tracking as well so this is going to be
a<00:01:06.930> really<00:01:07.380> good<00:01:07.619> test<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.990> a<00:01:09.990> very<00:01:10.260> nice<00:01:10.500> site

so coralie guardian let's see well i'm
still<00:01:21.210> hitting<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.380> little<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:23.400> do

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
still hitting it it's a little you do

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.760 
still hitting it it's a little you do
feel<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.570> not<00:01:24.750> as<00:01:24.930> good<00:01:25.409> as<00:01:25.560> what

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
feel that it's it's not as good as what

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.190 
feel that it's it's not as good as what
it<00:01:25.890> was<00:01:26.070> before<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:27.450> my<00:01:27.570> opinion<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:28.170> is

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
it was before but in my opinion it is

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.260 
it was before but in my opinion it is
still<00:01:28.680> working<00:01:29.070> out<00:01:29.189> quite<00:01:29.430> nicely<00:01:29.490> still

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
still working out quite nicely still

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.719 
still working out quite nicely still
three<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.780> four<00:01:31.020> hits<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:32.250> these

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
three to four hits on these

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.690 
three to four hits on these
battlecruiser<00:01:33.420> house<00:01:33.720> at<00:01:33.990> 50<00:01:34.380> kilometers<00:01:34.700> so

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
battlecruiser house at 50 kilometers so

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.550 
battlecruiser house at 50 kilometers so
it's<00:01:36.000> not<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.600> has<00:01:36.780> been<00:01:36.930> nerfed<00:01:37.229> into

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
it's not like this has been nerfed into

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.560 
it's not like this has been nerfed into
the<00:01:37.650> grounds<00:01:38.070> from<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> looks<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.299> at<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
the grounds from the looks of it at the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.200 
the grounds from the looks of it at the
moment<00:01:39.600> i<00:01:40.130> do<00:01:41.130> think<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.640> next<00:01:41.909> room<00:01:42.119> is

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
moment i do think that the next room is

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.899 
moment i do think that the next room is
going<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.450> even<00:01:42.689> more<00:01:43.140> challenging<00:01:43.880> to<00:01:44.880> try

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
going to be even more challenging to try

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.340 
going to be even more challenging to try
and<00:01:45.509> grab<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:47.570> shadow<00:01:48.570> serpent<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.140> guy

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
and grab the shadow serpent this guy

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.859 
and grab the shadow serpent this guy
that<00:01:49.649> that'll<00:01:50.070> warp<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.549> here<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.689> one

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
that that'll warp in here but that one

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.840 
that that'll warp in here but that one
goes<00:01:52.079> down<00:01:52.110> next<00:01:52.770> up<00:01:52.890> we<00:01:53.070> also<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> couple

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
goes down next up we also have a couple

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.270 
goes down next up we also have a couple
of<00:01:53.909> small<00:01:54.270> ones<00:01:54.479> here<00:01:54.810> which<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:56.009> i'm<00:01:56.130> not

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
of small ones here which if i'm not

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.450 
of small ones here which if i'm not
mistaken<00:01:56.430> will<00:01:56.880> also<00:01:57.329> dampen<00:01:58.170> me<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.740> i<00:01:58.770> get<00:01:59.430> a

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
mistaken will also dampen me so i get a

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.560 
mistaken will also dampen me so i get a
maybe<00:01:59.790> trying<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.600> put<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:01.079> single<00:02:02.420> guard<00:02:03.420> on

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
maybe trying and put a single guard on

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.539 
maybe trying and put a single guard on
these<00:02:03.750> guys<00:02:04.020> let's<00:02:04.320> see<00:02:04.409> if<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.009> decreased

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
these guys let's see if the decreased

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.999 
these guys let's see if the decreased
optimal<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.119> actually<00:02:06.450> better<00:02:06.689> for<00:02:07.020> these

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
optimal is actually better for these

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.650 
optimal is actually better for these
guys<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.280> there<00:02:08.580> goes<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.940> damping<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.569> i'm

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
guys and there goes the damping so i'm

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.830 
guys and there goes the damping so i'm
actually<00:02:09.950> losing<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.069> little<00:02:11.310> bit<00:02:11.580> of

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
actually losing a little bit of

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
actually losing a little bit of
targeting<00:02:12.840> range<00:02:13.050> now<00:02:13.379> but

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
targeting range now but

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.100 
targeting range now but
get<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.130> even<00:02:14.580> at<00:02:14.700> 14<00:02:15.210> kilometers<00:02:15.870> on<00:02:16.050> a

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
get that even at 14 kilometers on a

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.150 
get that even at 14 kilometers on a
small<00:02:16.710> frigate<00:02:17.160> very<00:02:17.850> nice<00:02:18.150> hits<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:19.170> honestly

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
small frigate very nice hits so honestly

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.510 
small frigate very nice hits so honestly
is<00:02:20.400> this<00:02:21.030> really<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> nerve<00:02:21.750> or<00:02:21.990> are<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.130> guards

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
is this really a nerve or are the guards

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.550 
is this really a nerve or are the guards
going<00:02:23.820> to<00:02:23.910> be<00:02:24.000> able<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.390> hit<00:02:24.570> dogs<00:02:24.840> within<00:02:25.170> 10

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
going to be able to hit dogs within 10

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.010 
going to be able to hit dogs within 10
kilometers<00:02:25.710> with<00:02:26.370> this<00:02:26.600> this<00:02:27.600> could<00:02:27.840> actually

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
kilometers with this this could actually

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.860 
kilometers with this this could actually
end<00:02:28.470> up<00:02:28.650> being<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.950> PVE<00:02:29.310> buff<00:02:29.790> for<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.420> east<00:02:30.630> are

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
end up being a PVE buff for the east are

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.480 
end up being a PVE buff for the east are
at<00:02:31.080> least<00:02:31.290> for<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.590> high<00:02:31.710> sea<00:02:31.890> combat<00:02:32.130> sides

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
at least for the high sea combat sides

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.640 
at least for the high sea combat sides
here<00:02:32.670> because<00:02:32.850> that<00:02:33.240> went<00:02:33.600> way<00:02:33.960> more<00:02:34.290> smoothly

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
here because that went way more smoothly

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.970 
here because that went way more smoothly
than<00:02:34.950> what<00:02:35.910> I'm<00:02:36.030> used<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.450> when<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:37.560> frigate

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
than what I'm used to when this frigate

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.730 
than what I'm used to when this frigate
spawn<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.430> usually<00:02:39.330> have<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.720> switch<00:02:39.930> out<00:02:40.170> two

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
spawn I usually have to switch out two

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.530 
spawn I usually have to switch out two
small<00:02:41.070> drones<00:02:41.430> or<00:02:41.610> something<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.150> and

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
small drones or something like that and

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.949 
small drones or something like that and
here<00:02:43.320> comes<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.800> drug<00:02:44.430> trader<00:02:44.850> so<00:02:45.750> he's<00:02:45.930> the

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
here comes the drug trader so he's the

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.870 
here comes the drug trader so he's the
trigger<00:02:46.440> for<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:46.770> gates<00:02:47.100> that's<00:02:47.430> really<00:02:47.700> good

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
trigger for the gates that's really good

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.210 
trigger for the gates that's really good
you<00:02:48.240> can<00:02:48.390> also<00:02:48.540> see<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.959> new<00:02:49.110> icons<00:02:49.740> of<00:02:49.920> course

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
you can also see the new icons of course

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.610 
you can also see the new icons of course
I<00:02:50.459> think<00:02:51.270> it'll<00:02:51.480> just<00:02:51.510> take<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.080> little<00:02:52.230> bit<00:02:52.560> of

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
I think it'll just take a little bit of

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.460 
I think it'll just take a little bit of
getting<00:02:52.890> used<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.670> then<00:02:53.970> we'll<00:02:54.290> will<00:02:55.290> be

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
getting used to and then we'll will be

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.500 
getting used to and then we'll will be
our<00:02:55.650> rights<00:02:55.890> let's<00:02:56.250> let's<00:02:56.850> take<00:02:57.120> care<00:02:57.330> of<00:02:57.420> the

our rights let's let's take care of the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.360 
our rights let's let's take care of the
drug<00:02:57.750> trader<00:02:58.020> for<00:02:58.380> first<00:02:58.770> make<00:02:59.040> sure<00:02:59.070> it

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
drug trader for first make sure it

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.979 
drug trader for first make sure it
doesn't<00:02:59.580> come<00:02:59.730> too<00:03:00.120> close<00:03:00.270> or<00:03:00.420> becomes<00:03:00.870> a

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
doesn't come too close or becomes a

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.729 
doesn't come too close or becomes a
problem<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:03.080> there<00:03:04.080> he<00:03:04.200> goes<00:03:04.380> look<00:03:04.530> at<00:03:04.650> that

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
problem and there he goes look at that

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.800 
problem and there he goes look at that
pretty<00:03:05.040> decent<00:03:05.520> hits<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.910> this<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:06.660> at

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
pretty decent hits and this is at

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.070 
pretty decent hits and this is at
eighteen<00:03:07.290> kilometers<00:03:07.670> so<00:03:08.670> that's<00:03:09.630> looking

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
eighteen kilometers so that's looking

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.310 
eighteen kilometers so that's looking
quite<00:03:10.380> nice<00:03:10.650> as<00:03:10.860> well<00:03:11.630> next<00:03:12.630> up<00:03:12.750> Calathes

these<00:03:29.610> guys<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:30.030> drone<00:03:30.269> bay<00:03:30.480> let's<00:03:30.870> go<00:03:31.080> to<00:03:31.170> the

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
these guys to drone bay let's go to the

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.610 
these guys to drone bay let's go to the
second<00:03:32.070> room<00:03:32.280> oh<00:03:32.489> god<00:03:33.450> damn<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:33.989> then<00:03:34.440> they

second room oh god damn it and then they

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.259 
second room oh god damn it and then they
spawn<00:03:36.049> that<00:03:37.049> tends<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.380> happen<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:37.830> we<00:03:37.950> get<00:03:38.269> two

them hitting perfectly at 15 to 17
kilometers<00:03:56.160> as<00:03:56.730> I'm<00:03:57.480> not<00:03:57.630> seeing<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.930> lot<00:03:58.049> of

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
kilometers as I'm not seeing a lot of

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.150 
kilometers as I'm not seeing a lot of
mrs.<00:03:58.560> here<00:04:00.049> that<00:04:01.049> watchman<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.590> done<00:04:01.799> as<00:04:01.980> well

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
mrs. here that watchman is done as well

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.250 
mrs. here that watchman is done as well
now<00:04:02.519> they<00:04:02.670> should<00:04:02.850> all<00:04:03.090> be<00:04:03.120> on<00:04:03.570> that<00:04:03.780> garden

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
now they should all be on that garden

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.220 
now they should all be on that garden
which<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:05.220> still<00:04:05.489> gets<00:04:05.730> hit<00:04:05.940> at<00:04:06.120> at<00:04:06.510> these

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
which and it still gets hit at at these

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.670 
which and it still gets hit at at these
ranges<00:04:07.739> so<00:04:08.330> honestly<00:04:09.330> for<00:04:09.660> close<00:04:09.989> range<00:04:10.170> these

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
ranges so honestly for close range these

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.800 
ranges so honestly for close range these
guards<00:04:11.160> they've<00:04:11.940> become<00:04:12.329> even<00:04:12.630> better

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
guards they've become even better

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.920 
guards they've become even better
against<00:04:13.230> small<00:04:13.560> targets<00:04:14.120> if<00:04:15.120> I'm<00:04:15.420> looking<00:04:15.780> at

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
against small targets if I'm looking at

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.050 
against small targets if I'm looking at
this

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
this

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.360 
this
ouch<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:18.169> hope<00:04:18.320> that<00:04:18.500> this<00:04:18.620> is<00:04:18.859> not<00:04:19.040> going<00:04:19.250> to

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
ouch I hope that this is not going to

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.690 
ouch I hope that this is not going to
have<00:04:19.579> an<00:04:19.940> unintended<00:04:20.600> consequence<00:04:21.230> because

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
have an unintended consequence because

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.060 
have an unintended consequence because
this<00:04:22.700> this<00:04:23.169> feels<00:04:24.169> like<00:04:24.320> the<00:04:24.470> Easter<00:04:24.919> is

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
this this feels like the Easter is

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.379 
this this feels like the Easter is
actually<00:04:25.370> going<00:04:25.490> to<00:04:25.610> benefit<00:04:25.940> a<00:04:26.000> little<00:04:26.270> bit

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
actually going to benefit a little bit

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.379 
actually going to benefit a little bit
in<00:04:26.510> efficiency<00:04:27.169> on<00:04:27.320> some<00:04:27.560> of<00:04:27.680> these<00:04:27.830> sites

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
in efficiency on some of these sites

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.820 
in efficiency on some of these sites
let's<00:04:29.389> take<00:04:29.660> a<00:04:29.690> look<00:04:29.900> at<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.320> second<00:04:30.650> room

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
let's take a look at the second room

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.140 
let's take a look at the second room
then<00:04:31.090> here<00:04:32.090> we<00:04:32.120> go<00:04:32.560> I<00:04:33.560> usually<00:04:34.400> just<00:04:34.430> let<00:04:34.820> my

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
then here we go I usually just let my

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.310 
then here we go I usually just let my
guards<00:04:35.660> choose<00:04:36.020> anyway<00:04:37.840> because<00:04:38.840> you<00:04:39.139> do<00:04:39.290> want

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
guards choose anyway because you do want

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.770 
guards choose anyway because you do want
one<00:04:39.650> of<00:04:39.680> those<00:04:39.889> century<00:04:40.310> towers<00:04:40.700> that<00:04:41.240> doesn't

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
one of those century towers that doesn't

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.670 
one of those century towers that doesn't
well<00:04:44.780> let's<00:04:44.930> maybe<00:04:45.110> start<00:04:45.470> targeting

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
well let's maybe start targeting

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.620 
well let's maybe start targeting
actually<00:04:46.370> because<00:04:46.730> they're<00:04:47.240> still<00:04:47.480> not

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
actually because they're still not

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.040 
actually because they're still not
firing<00:04:47.930> at<00:04:48.200> me<00:04:48.460> finally<00:04:49.460> there<00:04:49.669> they<00:04:49.850> go<00:04:50.050> so

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
firing at me finally there they go so

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.290 
firing at me finally there they go so
now<00:04:52.419> here<00:04:53.419> go<00:04:53.660> my<00:04:53.990> my<00:04:54.620> guards<00:04:55.130> 35<00:04:55.669> kilometers

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
now here go my my guards 35 kilometers

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.200 
now here go my my guards 35 kilometers
still<00:04:56.900> really<00:04:57.320> pretty<00:04:57.650> good<00:04:57.889> hits<00:04:58.130> here<00:04:58.520> so

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
still really pretty good hits here so

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.469 
still really pretty good hits here so
this<00:04:59.360> is<00:04:59.540> all<00:04:59.720> working<00:04:59.930> out<00:05:00.169> quite<00:05:00.229> nicely

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
this is all working out quite nicely

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.879 
this is all working out quite nicely
alright<00:05:02.479> let's<00:05:02.690> get<00:05:02.840> rid<00:05:03.020> of<00:05:03.050> these<00:05:03.290> guys<00:05:03.590> and

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
alright let's get rid of these guys and

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.240 
alright let's get rid of these guys and
try<00:05:04.610> to<00:05:04.669> find<00:05:05.120> tego<00:05:05.750> rican<00:05:06.350> as<00:05:06.530> he<00:05:06.650> spawns<00:05:07.040> in

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
try to find tego rican as he spawns in

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.050 
try to find tego rican as he spawns in
and<00:05:08.050> that's<00:05:09.050> much<00:05:09.440> easier<00:05:09.470> to<00:05:10.040> spot<00:05:10.280> now<00:05:10.490> this

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
and that's much easier to spot now this

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.090 
and that's much easier to spot now this
is<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:11.270> only<00:05:11.479> cruiser<00:05:11.930> on<00:05:12.229> field<00:05:12.650> so<00:05:13.010> I<00:05:13.070> can

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
is the only cruiser on field so I can

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.060 
is the only cruiser on field so I can
just<00:05:13.460> grab<00:05:13.940> him<00:05:14.270> then<00:05:14.990> we'll<00:05:15.169> grab<00:05:15.500> his

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
just grab him then we'll grab his

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.190 
just grab him then we'll grab his
escorts<00:05:16.820> which<00:05:16.970> are<00:05:17.210> all<00:05:17.450> of<00:05:17.660> the<00:05:17.780> small

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
escorts which are all of the small

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.279 
escorts which are all of the small
frigates<00:05:19.030> well<00:05:20.030> this<00:05:20.300> is<00:05:20.330> also<00:05:20.810> a<00:05:20.840> little<00:05:21.169> bit

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
frigates well this is also a little bit

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:22.810 
frigates well this is also a little bit
of<00:05:21.440> an<00:05:21.530> advantage<00:05:21.800> with<00:05:22.160> these<00:05:22.310> new<00:05:22.460> icons

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
of an advantage with these new icons

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.440 
of an advantage with these new icons
it's<00:05:22.970> much<00:05:23.330> more<00:05:23.860> much<00:05:24.860> more<00:05:25.039> easy<00:05:25.250> to<00:05:25.970> find

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
it's much more much more easy to find

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.060 
it's much more much more easy to find
specific<00:05:26.840> targets<00:05:27.650> this<00:05:28.370> guy<00:05:28.610> gets<00:05:28.970> dropped

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
specific targets this guy gets dropped

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.100 
specific targets this guy gets dropped
very<00:05:31.070> quickly<00:05:31.760> and<00:05:32.060> efficiently<00:05:32.360> now<00:05:32.900> let's

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
very quickly and efficiently now let's

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.520 
very quickly and efficiently now let's
see<00:05:33.260> how<00:05:33.440> they<00:05:33.620> do<00:05:33.680> against<00:05:34.280> these<00:05:34.910> s<00:05:35.150> quarters

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
see how they do against these s quarters

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.870 
see how they do against these s quarters
why<00:05:36.530> do<00:05:36.590> you<00:05:36.770> want<00:05:37.039> to<00:05:37.130> take<00:05:37.340> care<00:05:37.580> of<00:05:37.729> these

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
why do you want to take care of these

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.719 
why do you want to take care of these
because<00:05:38.330> they<00:05:38.930> will<00:05:39.169> actually<00:05:39.350> scram<00:05:39.919> you<00:05:39.950> so

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
because they will actually scram you so

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:42.159 
because they will actually scram you so
it<00:05:40.850> gotta<00:05:41.030> be<00:05:41.120> just<00:05:41.419> a<00:05:41.570> little<00:05:41.600> bit<00:05:41.870> careful

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
it gotta be just a little bit careful

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.940 
it gotta be just a little bit careful
but<00:05:42.950> here<00:05:43.160> comes<00:05:43.430> the<00:05:44.410> serpent<00:05:45.410> this<00:05:45.530> medium

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
but here comes the serpent this medium

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.190 
but here comes the serpent this medium
commander<00:05:46.430> Rick<00:05:46.610> and<00:05:46.850> its<00:05:47.270> shadow<00:05:47.510> serpentis

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
commander Rick and its shadow serpentis

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.100 
commander Rick and its shadow serpentis
so<00:05:48.740> that's<00:05:48.889> one<00:05:49.100> of<00:05:49.220> them<00:05:49.400> done<00:05:49.610> I'm<00:05:49.850> I'm<00:05:50.539> not

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
so that's one of them done I'm I'm not

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.379 
so that's one of them done I'm I'm not
feeling<00:05:51.530> like<00:05:51.950> any<00:05:52.370> decrease<00:05:52.970> in<00:05:53.270> performance

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
feeling like any decrease in performance

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.710 
feeling like any decrease in performance
here<00:05:53.960> looking<00:05:54.229> at<00:05:54.350> the<00:05:54.470> one<00:05:54.650> shot<00:05:54.950> and<00:05:55.130> escort

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
here looking at the one shot and escort

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.300 
here looking at the one shot and escort
not<00:05:56.720> bad<00:05:56.990> not<00:05:57.020> bad<00:05:57.320> let's<00:05:58.039> also<00:05:58.220> targets<00:06:00.310> the

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
not bad not bad let's also targets the

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.540 
not bad not bad let's also targets the
rake<00:06:01.520> here<00:06:01.550> let's<00:06:02.000> see<00:06:02.180> if<00:06:02.270> I<00:06:02.330> can<00:06:02.360> actually<00:06:02.810> do

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
rake here let's see if I can actually do

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.810
