00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.849
 well, it's everyone's cabbage 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.559
 the ball today we find ourselves 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.699
 for a new tutorial so 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.890
 today I 'm going to show you how 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.579
 to install the mode to small fine therefore 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.679
 obviously on minecraft so first 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.569
 as usual you will go into the 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:29.269
 description and you will click on the 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:31.579
 first link I would have put you this 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.980
 so will the mode link that you 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.160
 will redirect to that page on 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.899
 minecraft france you go down a little 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.250
 and you click on the little hd fans 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:49.039
 c4 ultra that's it so go to 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.690
 had a hi fly at the top right so it's ok 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.160
 ask you to wait five seconds 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.980
 it seems to me you click on that one 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.219
 announcement then you click on download 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:02.120
 to small fine 1.5.1 so that's ok 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:06.830
 you download the mode you put it 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:10.160
 on your desk where you want in good 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.020
 that's just reducing so you double 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:17.180
 click on it 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:19.190
 so here is your keyboard 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.970
 you press the windows key and 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.600
 air at the same time that you open so the 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:30.140
 little executor in you will score 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.470
 so percent ap data % you will click 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.390
 on ok then you get back into the 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:42.170
 minecraft and bim dot folder 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:45.200
 and that's so, then, we have a 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.170
 file man point a file - minecraft 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.390
 point jar forgive excuse me so if 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.990
 you have these guys makes you right click 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.520
 it's cheap and open up so that's okay 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.470
 you open the folder if you do not 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.540
 not seized aps 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.420
 so you right click open with 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.770
 and winrar so here is exactly the 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.670
 same thing it's just that these two 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.730
 different software 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.310
 so if we can close to the dish so 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.230
 here on the left we have our minecraft 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.890
 jar point and right we have our mode 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.540
 so small fine first so 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.640
 in minecraft that we will click on meta 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:27.080
 betaine and we will delete it 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.180
 here it is to delete it finally yes here 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.470
 so otherwise it will not work it's okay 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.470
 will make a black screen 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.280
 then we're going to take 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.380
 all there is in small fine and 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.250
 we will drag it into minecraft point 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.530
 jar did ok and so here is the 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.150

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.250

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.450
