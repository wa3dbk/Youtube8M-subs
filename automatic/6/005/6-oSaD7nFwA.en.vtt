00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
in-game to do this like these slots here

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.180 
in-game to do this like these slots here
represent<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.480> crafting<00:00:15.929> grid<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.379> all

I've got name door now so the next one
will<00:02:39.209> be<00:02:39.239> a<00:02:39.390> shaped<00:02:39.870> recipe<00:02:40.550> that's<00:02:41.550> good

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
will be a shaped recipe that's good

will be a shaped recipe that's good
redstone<00:02:42.750> lamp<00:02:43.620> comparator<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.819> solar

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
redstone lamp comparator and a solar

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.119 
redstone lamp comparator and a solar
panel<00:02:45.390> can<00:02:45.810> create<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.440> weighted<00:02:46.890> pressure

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
panel can create a weighted pressure

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.150 
panel can create a weighted pressure
plate<00:02:47.400> because<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:47.700> makes<00:02:47.879> sense<00:02:49.160> sorry

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
plate because that makes sense sorry

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.119 
plate because that makes sense sorry
we'll<00:02:50.400> have<00:02:50.430> this<00:02:51.030> shape<00:02:51.360> creates<00:02:52.349> the

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
we'll have this shape creates the

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.559 
we'll have this shape creates the
weighted<00:02:53.430> pressure<00:02:53.640> plate<00:02:54.349> and<00:02:55.550> an<00:02:56.569> enchanted

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
weighted pressure plate and an enchanted

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.540 
weighted pressure plate and an enchanted
diamond<00:02:57.690> sword<00:02:58.170> because<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.650> makes<00:02:58.830> so<00:02:59.370> much

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
diamond sword because that makes so much

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:06.260 
diamond sword because that makes so much

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
a extra enchanted sword should have

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.160 
a extra enchanted sword should have
appeared

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
appeared

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.790 
appeared
turns<00:04:02.170> out<00:04:02.590> that<00:04:03.960> the<00:04:04.960> fact<00:04:05.230> that<00:04:05.350> it<00:04:05.530> was<00:04:05.650> in

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
turns out that the fact that it was in

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.160 
turns out that the fact that it was in
charge<00:04:06.280> had<00:04:06.580> broke<00:04:06.940> it<00:04:07.210> only<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:08.440> fix

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
charge had broke it only to fix

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.790 
charge had broke it only to fix
enchanted<00:04:11.280> things<00:04:12.360> but<00:04:13.360> yeah<00:04:13.510> I'll<00:04:14.110> just<00:04:14.350> make

enchanted things but yeah I'll just make
another<00:04:15.070> one<00:04:15.160> of<00:04:15.700> those<00:04:15.820> examples<00:04:16.150> where<00:04:16.510> it's

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
another one of those examples where it's

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.420 
another one of those examples where it's
not<00:04:17.020> in<00:04:17.169> Shona<00:04:17.440> just<00:04:17.770> to<00:04:17.890> show<00:04:18.100> that<00:04:18.130> that

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
not in Shona just to show that that

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.320 
not in Shona just to show that that
works<00:04:19.230> like<00:04:20.230> multiple<00:04:20.739> items<00:04:21.040> work<00:04:21.310> I'll<00:04:22.000> just

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
works like multiple items work I'll just

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.690 
works like multiple items work I'll just
do<00:04:22.770> flour<00:04:23.770> parts<00:04:24.690> so<00:04:25.690> that<00:04:26.169> shape<00:04:26.560> will<00:04:27.370> create

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
do flour parts so that shape will create

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.150 
do flour parts so that shape will create
red<00:04:28.000> sin<00:04:28.210> lamp<00:04:28.419> and<00:04:28.690> shopmen<00:04:28.900> table<00:04:29.530> and<00:04:29.830> a

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
red sin lamp and shopmen table and a

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:37.000 
red sin lamp and shopmen table and a
sign

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:53.120 

yeah<00:04:38.010> but<00:04:38.220> next<00:04:41.450> and<00:04:44.660> okay

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.160 

okay<00:04:54.130> we'll<00:04:54.310> definitely<00:04:54.580> fix<00:04:55.120> that<00:04:55.300> but<00:04:56.020> what

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
okay we'll definitely fix that but what

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.780 
okay we'll definitely fix that but what
should<00:04:56.350> happen<00:04:56.410> is<00:04:56.800> multiple<00:04:57.280> items<00:04:57.610> should

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
should happen is multiple items should

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:04.110 
should happen is multiple items should
appear<00:05:01.770> and<00:05:02.770> they<00:05:02.980> didn't<00:05:03.250> so<00:05:03.520> I<00:05:03.700> will<00:05:03.940> fix

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
appear and they didn't so I will fix

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.820 
appear and they didn't so I will fix
that<00:05:04.210> now<00:05:04.810> next<00:05:05.590> is<00:05:06.040> furniture<00:05:06.700> space<00:05:07.710> okay<00:05:08.710> so

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
that now next is furniture space okay so

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.850 
that now next is furniture space okay so
let's<00:05:09.280> say<00:05:09.580> you<00:05:10.480> smell<00:05:10.690> baccala<00:05:11.500> Bissell<00:05:11.800> is

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
let's say you smell baccala Bissell is

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.650 
let's say you smell baccala Bissell is
early<00:05:12.250> and<00:05:12.400> for<00:05:12.550> some<00:05:12.790> odd<00:05:12.910> reason<00:05:12.940> it<00:05:13.450> turns

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
early and for some odd reason it turns

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.840 
early and for some odd reason it turns
into<00:05:13.870> sponge<00:05:14.200> to<00:05:14.950> make<00:05:15.070> this<00:05:15.250> recipe<00:05:15.490> you

into sponge to make this recipe you

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.670 
into sponge to make this recipe you
would<00:05:15.940> just<00:05:16.090> put<00:05:16.330> this<00:05:16.480> anyway<00:05:17.080> I<00:05:17.110> just<00:05:17.530> like

putting it in the middle and then you

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:26.480 
putting it in the middle and then you
just<00:05:19.510> put<00:05:19.660> that<00:05:19.690> there<00:05:24.510> let's<00:05:25.510> just<00:05:25.630> call<00:05:25.840> it
