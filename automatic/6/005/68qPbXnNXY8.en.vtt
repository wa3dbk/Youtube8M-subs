gannets<00:03:14.360> I'm<00:03:15.360> finding<00:03:15.810> out<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.980> area

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
gannets I'm finding out and the area

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.570 
gannets I'm finding out and the area
that's<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:18.390> bit<00:03:18.510> deeper<00:03:18.750> like<00:03:19.140> 22<00:03:19.890> metres<00:03:20.190> plus

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
that's a bit deeper like 22 metres plus

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.060 
that's a bit deeper like 22 metres plus
they're<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.180> sporadic<00:03:21.660> workups<00:03:22.290> which<00:03:22.860> you

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
they're the sporadic workups which you

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.340 
they're the sporadic workups which you
know<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.610> way<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.760> catch<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.180> fish<00:03:24.330> here<00:03:24.540> has

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
know the way to catch the fish here has

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.949 
know the way to catch the fish here has
chase<00:03:25.769> them<00:03:25.980> down<00:03:26.010> get<00:03:26.640> ahead<00:03:26.850> of<00:03:26.910> them<00:03:27.120> drop

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
chase them down get ahead of them drop

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.509 
chase them down get ahead of them drop
your<00:03:28.110> lures<00:03:28.290> down<00:03:28.530> with<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:28.890> birds<00:03:29.100> of<00:03:29.250> diving

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
your lures down with the birds of diving

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.949 
your lures down with the birds of diving
maybe<00:03:29.880> it's<00:03:30.000> just<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.209> few<00:03:30.420> birds<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.780> they're

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
maybe it's just a few birds and they're

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.509 
maybe it's just a few birds and they're
real<00:03:31.170> short<00:03:31.470> workups<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:32.010> your<00:03:32.100> pull<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.310> few

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
real short workups and your pull a few

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:33.740 
real short workups and your pull a few
out<00:03:32.670> then<00:03:32.820> you<00:03:32.940> have<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.180> move<00:03:33.300> to<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.600> knicks

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
out then you have to move to the knicks

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.810 
out then you have to move to the knicks
on<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.019> you're<00:03:34.140> kind<00:03:34.200> of<00:03:34.350> bunny<00:03:34.530> hop<00:03:34.800> you<00:03:35.700> know

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
on so you're kind of bunny hop you know

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.180 
on so you're kind of bunny hop you know
between<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.600> workups<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:37.350> then<00:03:38.040> i<00:03:38.130> came

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
between the workups and then i came

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.280 
between the workups and then i came
further<00:03:38.700> in<00:03:38.970> here<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.450> this<00:03:39.840> is<00:03:40.019> where<00:03:40.170> the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
further in here and this is where the

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.530 
further in here and this is where the
bigger<00:03:40.530> workup<00:03:41.010> seem<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.430> be<00:03:41.580> more<00:03:42.090> gannets

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
bigger workup seem to be more gannets

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.300 
bigger workup seem to be more gannets
more<00:03:42.780> dolphins<00:03:43.019> lasting<00:03:43.709> longer<00:03:43.920> and<00:03:44.130> more

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
more dolphins lasting longer and more

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.000 
more dolphins lasting longer and more
intense<00:03:44.730> but<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.840> fish<00:03:46.080> was<00:03:46.110> smaller<00:03:46.739> and

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
intense but the fish was smaller and

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.040 
intense but the fish was smaller and
there<00:03:47.370> was<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.489> few<00:03:47.760> Carlo<00:03:48.269> mixed<00:03:48.630> in<00:03:48.750> as<00:03:48.870> well
