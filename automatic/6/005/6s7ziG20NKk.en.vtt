basically what this is is you buy a game

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.029 
basically what this is is you buy a game
from<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.599> marketplace<00:00:15.960> or<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.560> buy<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> game

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
from the store you bring the game home

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.890 
from the store you bring the game home
you<00:00:19.800> put<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.310> game<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:21.180> install<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.750> and

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
you put in the game you install it and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.740 
you put in the game you install it and
it<00:00:22.529> takes<00:00:22.740> like<00:00:22.920> five<00:00:23.310> hours<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.820> install<00:00:24.150> so

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
it takes like five hours to install so

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.929 
it takes like five hours to install so
that's<00:00:24.930> pretty<00:00:25.230> annoying<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:25.830> then<00:00:26.340> what

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
that's pretty annoying but then what

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.000 
that's pretty annoying but then what
happens<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.420> once<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.140> game<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.410> installed<00:00:28.619> you

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
happens is once a game is installed you

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.040 
happens is once a game is installed you
try<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.250> play<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.640> game<00:00:29.670> but<00:00:30.510> instead<00:00:30.869> of

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
try to play the game but instead of

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.440 
try to play the game but instead of
building<00:00:31.590> up<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.830> game<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.279> just<00:00:33.030> gives<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.360> a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
building up the game it just gives you a

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.630 
building up the game it just gives you a
blank<00:00:33.719> screen<00:00:34.050> now<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.800> makes<00:00:35.340> me<00:00:35.489> mad

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
blank screen now that makes me mad

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.790 
blank screen now that makes me mad
because<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.030> waited<00:00:36.300> like<00:00:36.600> five<00:00:36.870> hours<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
because I waited like five hours for the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.410 
because I waited like five hours for the
game<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.070> install<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:38.550> now<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:39.270> this

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
game to install but now I have this

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.150 
game to install but now I have this
blank<00:00:39.690> screen<00:00:40.050> where<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.290> can't<00:00:40.559> even<00:00:40.649> play<00:00:40.950> it

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
blank screen where I can't even play it

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.380 
blank screen where I can't even play it
I<00:00:41.540> at<00:00:42.540> first<00:00:42.899> basically<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:44.149> stayed<00:00:45.149> there

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
I at first basically just stayed there

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.900 
I at first basically just stayed there
just<00:00:45.870> waited<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.309> see<00:00:47.520> if<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.760> would

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
just waited for it to see if it would

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.940 
just waited for it to see if it would
boot<00:00:48.149> up<00:00:48.329> thinking<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> Xbox<00:00:49.620> was<00:00:49.770> being

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
boot up thinking that the Xbox was being

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.610 
boot up thinking that the Xbox was being
slow<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.460> no<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.059> was<00:00:51.930> sitting<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.440> my

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
chair waiting for the Xbox to boot up

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.939 
chair waiting for the Xbox to boot up
but<00:00:56.399> really<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.059> wouldn't<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.890> is

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
but really it wouldn't do it so this is

after you do that what you're going to

after you do that what you're going to

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
want to do is you're going to want to

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.020 
want to do is you're going to want to
take<00:01:17.640> out<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.869> power<00:01:19.439> cable<00:01:19.950> now<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.610> reason

take out the power cable now the reason

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.429 
take out the power cable now the reason
why<00:01:21.090> you're<00:01:21.330> going<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.540> want<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.720> do<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.140> is

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
why you're going to want to do that is

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.100 
why you're going to want to do that is
because<00:01:22.680> your<00:01:23.400> Xbox<00:01:23.880> isn't<00:01:24.299> fully<00:01:24.540> off<00:01:24.810> by

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
because your Xbox isn't fully off by

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.859 
because your Xbox isn't fully off by
just<00:01:25.320> pressing<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.400> power<00:01:26.610> button<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:27.240> like

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
just pressing the power button it's like

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.140 
just pressing the power button it's like
in<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.140> sleep<00:01:28.439> mode<00:01:28.740> or<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.280> temporarily<00:01:29.820> off

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
in a sleep mode or it's temporarily off

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.350 
in a sleep mode or it's temporarily off
because<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:32.130> was<00:01:32.340> fully<00:01:32.640> off<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.180> wouldn't

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
because if it was fully off you wouldn't

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.350 
because if it was fully off you wouldn't
be<00:01:34.140> able<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.470> say<00:01:34.770> Xbox<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.970> then<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.240> the

be able to say Xbox on and then have the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.200 
be able to say Xbox on and then have the
Kinect<00:01:36.659> turn<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:36.990> Xbox<00:01:37.409> for<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.490> take<00:01:39.000> out

the power cable wait at least probably
five<00:01:42.000> seconds<00:01:42.570> or<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.170> then<00:01:44.100> after<00:01:44.399> that

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
five seconds or so and then after that

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.429 
five seconds or so and then after that
five<00:01:44.909> seconds<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.479> up<00:01:45.509> what<00:01:46.020> you're<00:01:46.170> going<00:01:46.380> to
