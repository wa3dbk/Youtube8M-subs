because I can get on ten to twelve hours

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.600 
because I can get on ten to twelve hours
in<00:01:20.140> this<00:01:20.229> laptop<00:01:20.440> that'll<00:01:21.070> be<00:01:21.280> a<00:01:21.310> good<00:01:21.399> type<00:01:21.580> of

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
and I'm using an Intel i5 4 gen so it's

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.570 
and I'm using an Intel i5 4 gen so it's
going<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.289> save<00:01:35.440> a<00:01:35.560> lot<00:01:35.740> of<00:01:35.860> power<00:01:36.039> but<00:01:36.340> for

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
going to save a lot of power but for

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.669 
going to save a lot of power but for
some<00:01:36.850> reason<00:01:37.179> you<00:01:37.330> know<00:01:37.479> this<00:01:37.720> may<00:01:38.619> actually

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
some reason you know this may actually

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:41.940 
some reason you know this may actually
still<00:01:39.220> not<00:01:39.460> as<00:01:39.640> good<00:01:40.149> as<00:01:40.330> supposed<00:01:41.319> to<00:01:41.440> be<00:01:41.590> so

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
still not as good as supposed to be so

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.219 
still not as good as supposed to be so
we're<00:01:42.220> going<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.429> find<00:01:42.789> out<00:01:43.000> what<00:01:43.780> is<00:01:43.960> draining

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
we're going to find out what is draining

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.370 
we're going to find out what is draining
it<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.520> I<00:01:45.549> have<00:01:45.850> to<00:01:46.000> go<00:01:46.149> to<00:01:46.210> go<00:01:46.479> to<00:01:46.509> task<00:01:46.899> manager

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
it so I have to go to go to task manager

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.249 
it so I have to go to go to task manager
and<00:01:47.530> you<00:01:47.740> can<00:01:47.890> see<00:01:48.130> on<00:01:48.280> processes<00:01:49.030> scroll<00:01:49.960> down

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
and you can see on processes scroll down

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.809 
and you can see on processes scroll down
you'll<00:01:50.560> see<00:01:50.590> this<00:01:52.110> three<00:01:53.110> processes<00:01:54.100> it's<00:01:54.610> all

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
you'll see this three processes it's all

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.630 
you'll see this three processes it's all

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
this usage so this will drain some power

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.830 
this usage so this will drain some power
a<00:02:03.880> lot<00:02:04.209> and<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:06.280> deal<00:02:06.970> with<00:02:07.000> this<00:02:07.179> problem<00:02:07.420> I

when's<00:02:22.870> your<00:02:22.959> system<00:02:23.590> starts<00:02:24.129> up<00:02:24.220> if<00:02:24.879> I<00:02:25.000> start

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
when's your system starts up if I start

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.270 
when's your system starts up if I start
automatically<00:02:25.980> even<00:02:26.980> though<00:02:27.099> you're<00:02:27.250> on

housing what you still start up so

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.380 
housing what you still start up so
that's<00:02:29.379> bad<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.610> don't<00:02:30.760> have<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.060> happen

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
on your battery and ok now I okay this

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.530 
on your battery and ok now I okay this
is<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.459> previous

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
is the previous

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.570 
is the previous
estimated<00:02:56.260> time<00:02:56.440> so<00:02:56.650> now<00:02:56.890> we<00:02:56.950> have<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.280> wait<00:02:57.400> Oh

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
estimated time so now we have to wait Oh

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.990 
estimated time so now we have to wait Oh
next<00:02:58.360> percentage<00:02:58.900> 96<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.800> we'll<00:03:00.550> see<00:03:00.730> how

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
next percentage 96 and we'll see how

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.899 
next percentage 96 and we'll see how
long<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.450> can<00:03:01.629> last<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.349> now<00:03:03.190> is<00:03:03.430> saying<00:03:03.700> why

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
long it can last and now is saying why

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.059 
long it can last and now is saying why
was<00:03:04.090> cause<00:03:04.269> it's<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.569> old<00:03:04.840> one<00:03:05.080> yeah<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:05.830> I'll

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
was cause it's the old one yeah so I'll

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:12.809 
was cause it's the old one yeah so I'll
see<00:03:06.129> you<00:03:06.370> in<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.510> sec

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.449 

and<00:03:13.819> I'm<00:03:14.180> back<00:03:14.360> again<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:15.019> my<00:03:15.739> percentage<00:03:16.340> has

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
and I'm back again and my percentage has

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.059 
and I'm back again and my percentage has
dropped<00:03:16.489> until<00:03:17.180> 95%<00:03:17.930> as<00:03:18.049> you<00:03:18.230> can<00:03:18.379> see<00:03:18.590> I<00:03:18.620> can

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
dropped until 95% as you can see I can

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.630 
dropped until 95% as you can see I can
last<00:03:19.340> 10<00:03:19.610> hours<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:20.329> battery<00:03:20.480> time<00:03:21.230> so<00:03:21.650> the

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
last 10 hours of battery time so the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.690 
last 10 hours of battery time so the
culprit<00:03:23.090> was<00:03:23.299> that<00:03:23.810> process<00:03:24.349> a<00:03:24.379> process<00:03:24.769> as<00:03:25.519> I

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
culprit was that process a process as I

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.080 
culprit was that process a process as I
said<00:03:25.970> which<00:03:26.359> is<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:27.010> Microsoft<00:03:28.010> search<00:03:28.430> indexes

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
said which is a Microsoft search indexes

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.479 
said which is a Microsoft search indexes
so<00:03:29.329> yeah<00:03:29.870> so<00:03:30.260> that's<00:03:30.409> why<00:03:30.590> is<00:03:30.650> levels<00:03:31.189> that

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
so yeah so that's why is levels that

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.030 
so yeah so that's why is levels that
what<00:03:31.730> was<00:03:31.939> causing<00:03:32.209> all<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.540> drain<00:03:32.859> as<00:03:33.859> you

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
what was causing all the drain as you

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.899 
what was causing all the drain as you
drain<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:35.260> if<00:03:36.260> this<00:03:36.709> tin<00:03:36.980> fix<00:03:37.189> a<00:03:37.280> problem<00:03:37.489> it

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
drain and if this tin fix a problem it

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.149 
drain and if this tin fix a problem it
could<00:03:38.060> be<00:03:38.180> some<00:03:38.359> other<00:03:38.390> apps<00:03:38.870> or<00:03:39.200> process<00:03:40.129> that

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159 
could be some other apps or process that

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.440 
could be some other apps or process that
it<00:03:40.430> could<00:03:40.549> be<00:03:40.640> draining<00:03:40.879> your<00:03:41.090> battery<00:03:41.209> as

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
it could be draining your battery as
