some<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> biggest<00:00:33.149> changes<00:00:33.390> not<00:00:33.989> too<00:00:34.110> many

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
some of the biggest changes not too many

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.049 
some of the biggest changes not too many
crazy<00:00:34.649> things<00:00:35.100> there<00:00:35.340> are<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.610> know<00:00:35.700> some

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
crazy things there are you know some

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.000 
crazy things there are you know some
things<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.600> are<00:00:36.989> noteworthy<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.469> guess<00:00:37.739> so

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
things that are noteworthy I guess so

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.770 
things that are noteworthy I guess so
we're<00:00:38.550> gonna<00:00:38.640> take<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> look<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.329> guys<00:00:39.480> at

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
we're gonna take a look you guys at

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.350 
we're gonna take a look you guys at
those<00:00:40.200> rosters<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.520> biggest<00:00:41.850> thing<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.059> think

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
those rosters the biggest thing I think

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.420 
those rosters the biggest thing I think
is<00:00:42.540> probably<00:00:42.840> Hammond<00:00:43.770> obviously<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
is probably Hammond obviously the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.400 
is probably Hammond obviously the
Hamburglar<00:00:44.910> playing<00:00:45.570> unreal<00:00:45.870> he<00:00:46.050> got<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> big

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
Hamburglar playing unreal he got a big

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.380 
Hamburglar playing unreal he got a big
upgrade<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.280> everyone<00:00:47.850> else<00:00:47.879> pretty<00:00:48.149> much<00:00:48.270> is

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
upgrade but everyone else pretty much is

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.450 
upgrade but everyone else pretty much is
just<00:00:48.420> one<00:00:48.719> or<00:00:48.840> two<00:00:48.870> overall<00:00:49.320> change<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.160> know

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
just one or two overall change so I know

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.189 
just one or two overall change so I know
one<00:00:50.940> kind<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.360> big<00:00:51.480> change<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.840> me<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.960> guess

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
one kind of big change to me I guess

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.170 
one kind of big change to me I guess
Patrick<00:00:52.620> sharp<00:00:52.860> he<00:00:53.309> wasn't<00:00:53.640> 90s<00:00:53.969> actually

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
Patrick sharp he wasn't 90s actually

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.630 
Patrick sharp he wasn't 90s actually
dropped<00:00:54.660> all<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.930> way<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.230> 87<00:00:55.739> overall<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.430> I

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
dropped all the way to 87 overall so I

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.479 
dropped all the way to 87 overall so I
take<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> look<00:00:57.329> at<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.510> now<00:00:57.719> as<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:57.989> see

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
take a look at that now as you can see

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.310 
take a look at that now as you can see
3-3<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.579> scharping<00:01:00.030> that's<00:01:00.180> pretty<00:01:00.480> big<00:01:01.050> a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
3-3 of scharping that's pretty big a

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.060 
3-3 of scharping that's pretty big a
downgrade<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.550> think<00:01:03.210> Toronto<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.170> Ottawa<00:01:04.650> I

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
downgrade I think Toronto and Ottawa I

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.289 
downgrade I think Toronto and Ottawa I
think<00:01:05.280> both<00:01:05.430> had<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> lot<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:05.939> different

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
think both had a lot of different

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.810 
think both had a lot of different
changes<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:06.960> Ottawa<00:01:07.830> crystals<00:01:08.250> are<00:01:08.369> actually

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
changes so Ottawa crystals are actually

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.250 
changes so Ottawa crystals are actually
going<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.000> upgrade<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.299> think<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.600> an<00:01:09.689> 81

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
going to upgrade I think is like an 81

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.250 
going to upgrade I think is like an 81
now<00:01:10.500> was<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> 79<00:01:11.479> maybe<00:01:12.479> was<00:01:12.689> even<00:01:12.900> actually

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
now was a 79 maybe was even actually

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.890 
now was a 79 maybe was even actually
let's<00:01:13.830> see<00:01:14.040> if<00:01:14.159> I'm<00:01:14.280> right<00:01:14.400> on<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.840> yeah<00:01:15.840> it

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
let's see if I'm right on that yeah it

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.450 
let's see if I'm right on that yeah it
was<00:01:16.020> Arnold's<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.500> was<00:01:16.590> an<00:01:16.680> 80<00:01:16.860> now<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.100> think<00:01:17.250> he

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
was Arnold's I was an 80 now I think he

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.270 
was Arnold's I was an 80 now I think he
was<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.729> semi<00:01:17.939> 8<00:01:18.060> or<00:01:18.150> sunny<00:01:18.360> 9<00:01:19.070> trunk<00:01:20.070> are

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
was like a semi 8 or sunny 9 trunk are

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.380 
was like a semi 8 or sunny 9 trunk are
before<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:20.909> we<00:01:21.180> should<00:01:21.240> actually

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
before we do that we should actually

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.210 
before we do that we should actually
show<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.720> him<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.290> was<00:01:22.409> saying<00:01:22.560> he

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220
