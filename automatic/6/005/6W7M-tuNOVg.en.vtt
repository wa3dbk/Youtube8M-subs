00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
well dash cancelling is one way dash

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.810 
well dash cancelling is one way dash
canceling<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.279> something<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.400> goes<00:00:26.609> back

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
canceling is a something that goes back

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.970 
canceling is a something that goes back

dashing cancelling your dash with a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.870 
dashing cancelling your dash with a
crouch<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.349> then<00:00:31.830> dashing<00:00:32.250> again<00:00:32.520> what<00:00:32.790> if

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
crouch and then dashing again what if

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.310 
crouch and then dashing again what if
this<00:00:32.940> does<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.480> allows<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.899> travel<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
this does is it allows you to travel the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.840 
this does is it allows you to travel the
full<00:00:34.559> distance<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> screen<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.670> matter

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
full distance of the screen in a matter

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.979 
full distance of the screen in a matter
of<00:00:35.940> seconds<00:00:38.149> this<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.270> one<00:00:39.450> really<00:00:39.719> good<00:00:39.870> way

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
of seconds this is one really good way

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.360 
of seconds this is one really good way
of<00:00:40.020> getting<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.440> especially<00:00:40.860> when<00:00:40.980> people<00:00:41.219> do

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
of getting in especially when people do

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.950 
of getting in especially when people do
moves<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.360> lot<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.600> frames

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
moves that have a lot of frames

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.720 
moves that have a lot of frames
afterwards<00:00:43.530> where<00:00:43.710> they're<00:00:43.829> vulnerable<00:00:44.010> I'll

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
afterwards where they're vulnerable I'll

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.490 
afterwards where they're vulnerable I'll
show<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.270> quick<00:00:45.570> example<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.320> dash

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
show you a quick example of a dash

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:57.740 
show you a quick example of a dash
cancel<00:00:46.980> right<00:00:47.219> now

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.470 

you<00:00:58.350> notice<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.370> dashes<00:00:59.730> cancels<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.240> crouch

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
you notice the dashes cancels the crouch

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.920 
you notice the dashes cancels the crouch
and<00:01:00.600> then<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.840> stand<00:01:01.080> in<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.260> hit<00:01:01.380> dash<00:01:01.560> again

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
and then you stand in you hit dash again

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.390 
and then you stand in you hit dash again
all<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.589> hit<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.890> two<00:01:05.010> buttons<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
all it is is you hit the two buttons the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:19.029 
all it is is you hit the two buttons the
dash<00:01:05.580> down<00:01:05.850> dash<00:01:07.970> dash<00:01:08.970> down<00:01:09.240> dash

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.399 

five

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.550 

you<00:01:23.409> have<00:01:23.590> cool<00:01:23.770> setups<00:01:24.100> like<00:01:24.159> that<00:01:25.560> anyway

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
you have cool setups like that anyway

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.109 
you have cool setups like that anyway
didn't<00:01:26.770> notice<00:01:27.009> that<00:01:27.040> was<00:01:27.310> a<00:01:27.490> level<00:01:27.880> three

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
didn't notice that was a level three

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.700 
didn't notice that was a level three
that<00:01:28.390> did<00:01:28.659> pull<00:01:29.619> damage<00:01:29.950> on<00:01:30.070> Dante<00:01:31.650> okay<00:01:32.650> so

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
that did pull damage on Dante okay so

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.120 
that did pull damage on Dante okay so
that's<00:01:33.490> one<00:01:33.729> way<00:01:33.880> dash<00:01:34.119> canceling<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:36.040> a

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
that's one way dash canceling it's a

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.820 
that's one way dash canceling it's a
good<00:01:36.280> way<00:01:36.399> to<00:01:36.430> get<00:01:36.640> in<00:01:36.810> also<00:01:37.810> it's<00:01:38.020> very<00:01:38.080> very

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
good way to get in also it's very very

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.760 
good way to get in also it's very very
powerful<00:01:39.369> in<00:01:40.890> getting<00:01:41.890> in<00:01:42.039> and<00:01:42.280> getting<00:01:42.340> away

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
powerful in getting in and getting away

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.020 
powerful in getting in and getting away
the<00:01:44.770> best<00:01:44.950> way<00:01:45.070> to<00:01:45.130> do<00:01:45.250> is<00:01:45.399> not<00:01:45.580> to<00:01:45.700> hold<00:01:45.820> like

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
the best way to do is not to hold like

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.210 
the best way to do is not to hold like
down<00:01:46.299> back<00:01:46.600> to<00:01:47.789> dash<00:01:48.789> down<00:01:49.090> back<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.630> block<00:01:50.220> but

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
down back to dash down back to block but

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.999 
down back to dash down back to block but
that's<00:01:51.399> a<00:01:51.460> little<00:01:51.520> tough<00:01:51.729> to<00:01:51.789> get<00:01:51.970> used<00:01:52.180> to

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
that's a little tough to get used to

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.050 
that's a little tough to get used to
then<00:01:54.009> sometimes<00:01:54.399> you<00:01:54.460> actually<00:01:54.580> do<00:01:54.880> hyper

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
then sometimes you actually do hyper

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.010 
then sometimes you actually do hyper
combos<00:01:55.450> like<00:01:55.539> that<00:01:55.840> but<00:01:56.649> i'll<00:01:56.770> just<00:01:57.369> hit<00:01:57.460> down

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
combos like that but i'll just hit down

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.190 
combos like that but i'll just hit down
just<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.110> straight<00:01:59.380> down<00:01:59.619> to<00:02:00.039> dash<00:02:00.220> cancel

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
just a straight down to dash cancel

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.809 
just a straight down to dash cancel
what's<00:02:02.200> also<00:02:02.350> good<00:02:02.619> for<00:02:02.800> evading<00:02:03.220> but<00:02:03.640> you

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
what's also good for evading but you

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.350 
what's also good for evading but you
have<00:02:03.909> to<00:02:04.000> hold<00:02:04.179> back<00:02:05.610> as<00:02:06.610> for<00:02:06.940> normally<00:02:07.240> you

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
have to hold back as for normally you

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.139 
have to hold back as for normally you
automatically<00:02:07.990> dash<00:02:08.289> forward<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.910> most

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
automatically dash forward in most

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.430 
automatically dash forward in most
instances<00:02:10.959> without<00:02:11.620> holding<00:02:11.800> a<00:02:11.950> direction<00:02:12.220> so

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
instances without holding a direction so

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.630 
instances without holding a direction so
that's<00:02:14.440> dash<00:02:14.680> canceling<00:02:15.130> another<00:02:15.340> good<00:02:15.519> way

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
that's dash canceling another good way

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.960 
that's dash canceling another good way
of<00:02:15.670> getting<00:02:16.060> in<00:02:16.209> is<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.510> triangle<00:02:17.410> jump<00:02:20.280> like<00:02:21.280> we

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
of getting in is a triangle jump like we

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.580 
of getting in is a triangle jump like we
have<00:02:22.090> we<00:02:22.480> had<00:02:22.600> covered<00:02:22.900> before<00:02:23.019> as<00:02:23.350> well<00:02:23.470> as

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
have we had covered before as well as

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:35.400 
have we had covered before as well as
getting<00:02:23.769> out
