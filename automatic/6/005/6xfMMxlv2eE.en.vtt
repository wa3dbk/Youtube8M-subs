00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.629
 1 very good people you are all watching 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.670
 on the screen a reception of the 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:08.980
 cinema mode the game was started 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.440
 as you are seeing but well I start 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.870
 here to gas to stop you see that I carry the map 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.990
 There the map and destroy but what 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.850
 I say is that I carry the reader is the 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.940
 first weapon that takes me out of gold if not 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.439
 out pw it was this or the second one was not 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.270
 I do not know how good he is doing is 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.039
 hot spot on the green map I think 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.930
 which is called this map map to one of the 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.510
 new maps I think that as I did not get 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.889
 nothing powerful on the maps as this is going to 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.649
 be the only thing you're going to have of maps 

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:37.989
 new is a game I say I was 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.460
 started and I say goes as it is 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.870
 start I'll catch the reader because 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.969
 I wanted to record the tubes but as I say 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.909
 even begun then well recorded 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.399
 then the thing while you see that I 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:51.309
 gusts the ones they used to live 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:54.129
 more or less those of the raptor I do not know if 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.039
 change the help package or I do not know I do not know 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.449
 what changes then that led to vv's 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.670
 answer already good and the package then 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.039
 it happens then to see that it came out in the 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.629
 good packages that entity the package 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.100
 that I would not know where the package will go 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.049
 I would know if it went off the map 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.700
 the question is, well, the game 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.170
 of doing quite well this host of 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.030
 modding I'm commenting on it while 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.070
 I look at the cinema mode here, I'm going to 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.750
 catch so I tell you it's worth it 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.970
 busting is not the people who were there 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.320
 and good first dragon pack fight 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.720
 pretty cool 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.130
 they throw me a rpg that I do not know why I do not 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.170
 I kill because it does not take to throw them vest 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.549
 I did not wear a ghost, I do not know, I do not know 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.500
 I do not know exactly what I was carrying 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.850
 dragons I think the hard line I think not 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.979
 you make a lot of case I think it was line 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.300
 it lasts yes here you see hard line more 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.610
 germans analysis z 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.530
 and as I said, you can see that I have been running 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.690
 very low those of rock which he used to 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.510
 the rock dubÃ³n normally in gusts 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.490
 low and wait first I'll comment 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.470
 one thing is the dragon fire now that 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.450
 I'm killing super pretty well with the 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.340
 dragon fire but you will see then a 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.510
 dauphas I do not know if this one or is another one that I'm going 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.040
 to throw away and my mother or I spent ten 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.470
 seconds firing without failing or a 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.320
 bullet and was unable to kill a 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:10.630
 person the question was going right now and 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.130
 11-2 the game is a 46 51 46 to 6 or 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.920
 something like that I do not remember much 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.099
 a 47 to 6 I think it's 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.660
 and well, it was really going to get me 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.220
 a member and I think that's the 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.569
 technique then when you want to take a 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.209
 gameplay do not go for it or be 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.430
 just play play and play or not 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.930
 play and play 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.520
 I played three games and the second was 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.440
 that is, it was not playing and playing 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.550
 play simply then play 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.800
 fun play 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.180
 to have fun to play with friends 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.540
 at this moment I was playing alone 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.490
 because they were good they are 12 o'clock in the 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.600
 tomorrow right now that I just 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.800
 lift and well sincerely not 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.840
 I expected is that I already say is that I do not 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.160
 I was hoping to take out a gameplay here 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.680
 good streak defending the point 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.360
 hot that is pretty pretty 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.520
 it was not planned to record it to send 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.340
 optics is anything but 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.590
 well I will not go through if 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.000
 I would have recorded live, yes, yes, 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.400
 I would have done it or been recorded at least 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.990
 the game does not say the comment but 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.150
 I say the game at least happens that no 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.700
 is recording because then I say this 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.130
 I told him that you have already recorded it and 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.240
 well here is a super larraz or I do not know 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.430
 what has happened here that changes me 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.350
 character do not ask me why but 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.240
 I change my character has changed or 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.100
 I do not understand I do not understand right now 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.460
 I not mean a blow yo PSRM 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.220
 character 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.350
 and you see I think I have not been killed by a 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.860
 for the moment they have killed us again from 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.030
 the down fire and I do not know I do not know what 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.430
 passed because this has been changed 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.470
 camera is on no button or anything but 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.900
 well just this example and what 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.340
 I wanted to use for attention here my fucking 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.890
 fairy I came all with the side that I 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.090
 it just burst 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.739
 in 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.379
 what I wanted to say is in this example 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.390
 and part of the connection topic because I 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.550
 They gave each on each side and it came out 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.330
 lost connection with the game if it would be 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.940
 everything is that 26 4 and I have a variety 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.099
 of points 3 thousand points with 26 losses is 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.540
 I tell you a lot, you have a lot 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.830
 to go for the point more than anything 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.680
 I wanted to use this example and so for 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.599
 tell you that especially if you have 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.250
 a youtube channel do not go to take out 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.900
 another example and if you do not go play go to 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.880
 have a good time that is when those who 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.590
 place them I mean it seriously here I see 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.850
 that my turret is coming back 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.240
 pulled back and web 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.400
 I'm going to kill him 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.680
 and well, well 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.750
 big big this site the turret me 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.280
 he liked quite a lot in another game too 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.509
 I put it and the truth that does quite 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.580
 because people always go through the 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:38.169
 medium and you are going to see here one thing that 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.030
 I screwed up quite a bit that supposedly goes 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.120
 by Achilles they shoot at the turret and 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.610
 a little bit like that they kill me and I stay 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.810
 I caught here you have to go 29-4 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.699
 I think the game is pretty 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.979
 Movidita is pretty cool and good is 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.690
 a new map that in theory is going to 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.190
 bring anything in the new maps because it does not 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.289
 I get nothing because I go much more with 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.020
 the new maps but good are parts 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:00.639
 very entertaining I think is cool from 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.220
 which I like to play the one of the 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.690
 that I like to upload or if you comment if 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.160
 were in the jce much better I have as 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.169
 games and where I think it's the 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.419
 rise a week ago or do good 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.070
 less than a week the previous week 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.660
 here you see I was going to throw the water and 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.510
 just because I could not 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.620
 throw 9 more to the uncle to be but good 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:23.110
 I think the game is pretty good 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:25.690
 I make a 15- year streak of 16 x 16 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.009
 in a week here is the dragon for 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.199
 that I say that I pass shooting average 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.940
 one person time and I am unable to kill 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:33.220
 look at it here bone 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.800
 dark from here to this uncle here in the 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.240
 game and I'm going down playing in 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.710
 the game was giving him but here in 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.790
 the 100 s mode of fake already seen now 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.920
 but my mother or I swear to you that I 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.910
 was giving in the game and unable to 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.140
 kill him 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.180
 now what they educated in cinema mode that 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.220
 it's that fake, well, well maybe it's not 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.560
 I was giving you already see that with the down 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.000
 fire I also make my dishes that do not 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.040
 I like nothing to the dragon fighting never 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.500
 I put it on but well, I just 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.449
 derive here with a stinger surely 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.189
 I do not think it was an RPG or anything like that 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.349
 and nothing because I simply wanted 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:07.939
 tell you this if you want to get the 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:10.400
 do not go for them to go to 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:12.770
 play go have a good time which is what 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.080
 really cool you do not get mad when you 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.210
 kill to see sometimes yes but about 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.039
 everything because everything happens well that what 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.050
 right now I'm looking for there that stressed 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.550
 my package and I shit on everything no longer 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.770
 I knew where they came from because they had 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.529
 everywhere and good I had to lose 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.029
 but well nothing happens 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:29.739
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:35.349
 whenever I say if he still has one 

00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:37.149
 little bit and what I wanted to comment is that 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:40.119
 the vector goes pretty well 

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:42.129
 now that they have lowered it has lowered the p 

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:45.459
 of w have dropped several weapons here the 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:46.989
 tie that hits simply is because I 

00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:49.059
 was coming connection lost rabbits 

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:51.069
 what goes out came a lot in whites 

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:52.659
 when they pulled the cable, a 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:56.529
 cable so good as if great 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:57.969
 of the cable I do not know why nothing about that 

00:06:56.529 --> 00:07:00.939
 I wanted to tell you that I do not remember 

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:03.549
 yes show the head you wanted 

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:07.179
 just tell you that the 

00:07:03.549 --> 00:07:08.439
 vector pretty good in clau 6 because 

00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:10.299
 now that all the others have gone down 

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:12.009
 arms this pretty good here I duck 

00:07:10.299 --> 00:07:15.039
