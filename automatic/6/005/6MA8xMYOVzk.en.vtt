00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hey how are you my name is gordon 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.750
 welcome to the questions 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.910
 gabriel drummer friend jose let me 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.370
 tell you something look here where I live 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.960
 I found in a lagoon this weird fish that 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.960
 fish is beautiful look 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.970
 this fish is a kind of wild molly 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.770
 and is known as molly liberty or police 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.630
 salvatoris since it is in 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.910
 Central America and more specifically in the 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.580
 Savior is not a fish highly recommended in 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.110
 aquariums because it is usually violent with 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.300
 the other fish and lose the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.070
 characteristic color of its fins are 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.110
 fish like mills evils that 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.390
 they need several females for each male 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.430
 but more exaggerated and not be in less 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.500
 of 100 liters plus is a fish that has 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.820
 by habit of jumping out of aquariums like this 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.410
 how careful has there been some 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.839
 comments that have put 5000 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.610
 ahead but not for the special 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.650
 I will answer them in this way 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.559
 video and they will not go to the special as per 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.360
 example karim eduardo says 5000 kervin 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.580
 Hello, Jose, I would like to know how 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.920
 we can exhar to African circuits 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.900
 yellows and with what ciphers I can 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.120
 forget thank you jose I love your 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.220
 videos go on like this to differentiate these 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.530
 fish the simplest technique is 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.570
 Group them and wait for it 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.659
 form a couple and then separate them 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.760
 the males are thinner and elongated 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.390
 larger size and more vivid color the 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.340
 idealization between cycle 2 is not 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.290
 because if you lose the purity of the species 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.600
 and often copies are obtained 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.119
 with unwanted colors I do not know much 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.280
 of this topic but the truth is that in the 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.680
 vine or chrome and you can see and hit on 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.570
 mudas or hybrids of the lake malawi me 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.820
 it seems a physical aspect and if the color 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.520
 it's very similar it will be easier and see and 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.649
 indeed give the cicuito lemon 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.720
 they sell varied different specimens 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.789
 that come from hatcheries and sometimes with 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.830
 supposed civilizations angel hernandez 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.460
 also use the 5,000 but os 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:01.310
 I ask you please for the specials 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.690
 do not use the special title and that 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.759
 then it is not a video for the special 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.460
 itself because if not then I delayed the 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.769
 I work and says well hi jose I think that you 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.600
 I insist but it would be good how to do 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.549
 homemade active carbon to my friend who 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.650
 thanks to that helm all of which I 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.080
 it has worked I see your videos a lot already 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.030
 who also planned to do it and if it is 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.650
 possible can you tell me if the dragon 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.450
 African is compatible with the barbel 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.130
 tiger because I put up here the link to 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.690
 this video that tells us angel and that 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.549
 is right because it is worth 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.760
 for aquariums although I would trust 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:34.099
 more of the activated carbon that we buy 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.140
 if you can get it if not then 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.670
 this other method is very good carbon 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.590
 activated in general you get from 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.030
 different types of materials and the coconut 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.310
 burnt is one of them for the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.200
 aquariums the african dragon is impossible 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.939
 to keep with fish like boats 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.650
 tiger because as far as they go in their 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.959
 mouth would eat them they have to be 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.970
 colleagues in any case that are what 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.099
 Large enough and calm 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.470
 so as not to disturb Estevez, which is half 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.930
 blind in aquariums of hundreds of liters and 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.269
 ana cardenas says hello today acquired 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.700
 ramírez yes but although the store was 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.769
 sure they were male and female at home 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.840
 I entered doubt so I come to ask 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.489
 to see if you can tell me which is that the 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.290
 ramírez if they can be differentiated rather 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.940
 for small details that by large 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.859
 differences so sometimes we can 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.109
 wrong but I think they are what 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.030
 next here we see how this copy 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.609
 has the spines of the dorsal fin 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.709
 quite longer and a good body 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.379
 stylized in addition to the black spot 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.930
 central without blue dots so 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.819
 should be a male despite the 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.019
 pink spot of belly and stripes 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.019
 black in the pelvic fins 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.150
 on the other hand this other fish has the 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.740
 spine very small the spot 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.740
 black with little blue dots inside 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.820
 and the pink spot of the belly besides 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.040
 a body more rounded than the previous 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.440
 so it should be a female to 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.550
 despite not having very marked stripes 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.550
 black pelvic fins 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.230
 the color changes in the fish are 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.970
 normal is to say when you are stressed 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.890
 alignment and when they get to the 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.960
 defensive intensify as well you 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.240
 have commented but the ideal is that the 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.070
 colors are intense while the fish 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.380
 he is calm that is when more comfortable 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.600
 is ricardo cornejo says hello 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.970
 mister aquarius I have a 300 tank 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.130
 liters and I want to put records in addition to 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.440
 the two that I have how many I can put and 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.780
 What plants can you put in 300 liters? 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.610
 can put a maximum of six discs in 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.560
 total taking into account the liters 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.780
 lost could be less decoration 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.810
 for these times it must be an abundant 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.820
 planted and put many logs of the 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.410
 type of roots the plants can 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.120
 depend more on your preferences 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.100
 for example if you do not know much about the subject 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.100
 you can put easy plants like 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.340
 bases and little donuts to brides for 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.260
 cups ferns mosses etc. always 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.060
 have some fertilizer and make good 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.580
 partial water changes every week 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.530
 on the other hand if you are going to put plants of 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.300
 the complicated or too demanding 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.210
 you are going to need a very good 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.160
 nutritious substrate lighting and co2 without 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.060
 doubt some good guys this has been 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.770
 all for today 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.240
