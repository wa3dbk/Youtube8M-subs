 the shoe repair business has evolved 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.449
 much faster because the main 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.250
 the task is of course a set of those customers 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.410
 who will pay for your work here 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.680
 in order to attract the maximum 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:42.270
 fast customers and make such an accurate 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.160
 advertising is for people who are shoes 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.450

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.059
 and although you have such a segment is 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.489
 shop and shopping is possible 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.800

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:11.430
 shoes of this one which is still a marriage there 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.740

 talk to walrus stores 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.300

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.240
 print here such flyers time 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:25.009
 leaflets I did my horror discovered 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.160
 I donâ€™t have any 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:31.140
 no business cards, that is, before that 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.899
 I had business cards 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.369
 and for each store its own 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.149
 here see along the line was such in 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.700
 the store

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.800
 fabia 2 brand lines represented and 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.259
 I had a special business card for them 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.390
 it is already cut off a little more on 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.569

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.060

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:15.970

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.100
 to the place of your workshop and to each 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.410

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:28.080
 embedded here is a snip and sidekick or 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:31.600
 making fun of the warranty card 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.000
 sellers must sell 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.430

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.150
 problems with shoes please contact 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.060
 this is our warranty workshop 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.209
 it gives a certain status 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.860
 and people trust you more but at the same time 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.730
 of course you must comply 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.280
 exactly 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.030
 the status of the store with whom you 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.550
 collaborate further 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.040
 what else works well what is checked 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.400
 on myself 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.440
 this discount card is such a discount 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.130
 card is for 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.040
 I did for my workshop on the back 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.819
 to the side 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.010
 addresses of shops 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:19.840
 soon mia at that time had a very 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.140
 close relationship that is, we 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.930
 agreed here by this scheme I 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.570
 served them as a guarantee 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.190
 workshop 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.500
 respectively, all the stones did 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.540
 the flow of people who came to this 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.400
 the store was bought first then from them 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:42.010
 problems occurred current or 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.730
 associated there with culling 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.030
 and automatically sent you here 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.700
 these are business cards 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.400
 when a person gets to you here already 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.120
 here's a good peg is 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.880
 discount card is the only thing that's on 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.840
 discount card, I do not advise you now 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.610
 I also ask you to specify the experience 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.360
 met and stores at a discount 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:15.970
 the map is better to be yours clean 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:18.070
 information there with advertisements of those kinds 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.190
 the activities that you do those 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.740
 types of work that can do it 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.610
 be owl shoe repair cut like that 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.030
 my version that in general gives more 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.880
 wide 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:36.510
 audience reach and people accordingly 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.810
 start by these bags from jackets to 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.470
 the result is now at the moment I 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.900
 jackets bags 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.150
 if they take about very, very 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.940
 selectively that is it should be 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:52.920
 dear cube with steam there anyway 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.840
 expensive zipper replacement bag there either with 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.060
 cut there all sorts of options 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.170
 happen 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:05.580
 why because but you understand yes 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:07.740
 that is, as if in serious repair 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.630
 invested money allowable bags that 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.650
 same in order to change the mole is not necessary 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.200
 choose lining 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:19.110
 dismantle all of these are normally done 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:22.770
 since it was but it is worth parsing the whole 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.990
 with the whole bag the lining compartment up 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.830
 then we collect all this also beautifully 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:33.090
 and accordingly the price is why I say 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:36.080
 that it makes no sense to repair very 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:39.150
 cheap things you can try to go out 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.460
 level when things bring you 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:45.360
 expensive enough to 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:48.060
 man giving back money for repairs not 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.700
 regretted what he did 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.730

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:57.750

 advertising on citywide is also 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:08.490
 interesting such an experience that I spent 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.790
