00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.080 
and Ninja Pro and I've never played
free-for-all<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.349> Havana<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.519> run<00:00:29.789> out<00:00:29.970> to

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
free-for-all on Havana so I run out to

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.650 
free-for-all on Havana so I run out to
the<00:00:30.179> left

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
the left

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.770 
the left
there's<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.019> guy<00:00:31.230> there<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:32.189> die<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:33.660> it

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
there's a guy there and I die and it

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.959 
there's a guy there and I die and it
sucks<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.950> if<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.219> ever<00:00:35.370> spawn<00:00:35.640> there<00:00:35.850> on

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
sucks so if you ever spawn there on

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.720 
sucks so if you ever spawn there on
Havana<00:00:36.120> there's<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.570> guy<00:00:36.660> right<00:00:36.840> there<00:00:36.899> ah<00:00:37.730> yeah

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
Havana there's a guy right there ah yeah

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.540 
Havana there's a guy right there ah yeah
so<00:00:38.879> let's<00:00:39.120> talk<00:00:39.210> about<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.660> m14<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.920> m14<00:00:41.370> has

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
so let's talk about the m14 the m14 has

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.330 
so let's talk about the m14 the m14 has
20<00:00:41.879> bullets<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.239> its<00:00:42.390> clip<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.809> has<00:00:43.110> 60<00:00:43.739> extra

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
20 bullets in its clip and has 60 extra

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.010 
20 bullets in its clip and has 60 extra
bullets<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:44.879> that's<00:00:45.120> three<00:00:45.390> more<00:00:45.600> clips<00:00:45.840> that

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
bullets so that's three more clips that

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.750 
bullets so that's three more clips that
you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.230> go<00:00:46.379> through<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.860> that's<00:00:47.460> actually<00:00:47.610> a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
you can go through and that's actually a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.369 
you can go through and that's actually a
lot<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:47.969> ammo<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.600> don't<00:00:48.899> really<00:00:49.140> need

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
lot of ammo so you don't really need

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.459 
lot of ammo so you don't really need
like<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:50.010> scavenger<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.910> or<00:00:51.059> anything<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:52.260> gun

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
like a scavenger on or anything this gun

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.840 
like a scavenger on or anything this gun
kills<00:00:52.739> then<00:00:52.920> two<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.219> three<00:00:53.399> shots<00:00:53.579> depending

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
kills then two to three shots depending

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.990 
kills then two to three shots depending
on<00:00:54.180> distance<00:00:55.309> expected<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.399> kill<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.730> three

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
on distance expected to kill in three

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.389 
on distance expected to kill in three
but<00:00:57.360> sometimes<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.899> goes<00:00:58.050> into<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.770> I've<00:00:59.100> also

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
but sometimes it goes into and I've also

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.790 
but sometimes it goes into and I've also
seen<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.690> faster<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.260> shoot<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
seen that like the faster you shoot the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.439 
seen that like the faster you shoot the
more<00:01:01.980> bullets<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.609> takes<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.030> don't<00:01:03.210> know<00:01:03.329> if

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
more bullets it takes I don't know if

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.479 
more bullets it takes I don't know if
that's<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.650> know<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:05.010> lag<00:01:05.250> or

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
that's just you know just lag or

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.310 
that's just you know just lag or
something<00:01:05.610> but<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.479> seems<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:06.960> that's<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
something but it seems like that's the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.080 
something but it seems like that's the
faster<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.920> shoot<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.460> more<00:01:08.670> bullet<00:01:08.939> it

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
faster you shoot the more bullet it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.640 
faster you shoot the more bullet it
takes<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.570> think<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.439> because

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
takes and I think I like that because

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.770 
takes and I think I like that because
like<00:01:10.950> if<00:01:11.070> people<00:01:11.220> use<00:01:11.490> mods<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.570> think

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
like if people use mods like I think

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.090 
like if people use mods like I think
that's<00:01:12.900> how<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.049> should<00:01:13.110> be<00:01:13.320> if<00:01:13.500> someone<00:01:13.740> uses

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
that's how it should be if someone uses

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.980 
that's how it should be if someone uses
the<00:01:14.189> mod<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.640> they<00:01:14.760> shoot<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:15.570> say<00:01:15.780> 10

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the mod and they shoot like say 10

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.359 
the mod and they shoot like say 10
bullets<00:01:16.290> out<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.770> should<00:01:17.040> take<00:01:17.189> all

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
bullets out of that it should take all

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.520 
bullets out of that it should take all
ten<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.610> those<00:01:17.820> bullets<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.299> kill<00:01:18.330> not<00:01:19.290> two

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
ten of those bullets to kill not two

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.469 
ten of those bullets to kill not two
bullets<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.430> seems<00:01:20.640> like<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> faster<00:01:21.360> you

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
bullets so it seems like the faster you

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.200 
bullets so it seems like the faster you
shoot<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.409> more<00:01:22.590> bullet<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.130> takes<00:01:23.430> now<00:01:24.060> when

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
shoot the more bullet it takes now when

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.510 
shoot the more bullet it takes now when
you<00:01:24.299> use<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.450> m14<00:01:24.990> you're<00:01:25.680> most<00:01:25.950> likely<00:01:26.159> gonna

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
you use the m14 you're most likely gonna

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.840 
you use the m14 you're most likely gonna
lose<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.390> anyone<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.930> has<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.110> submachine<00:01:28.650> gun

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
lose to anyone that has a submachine gun

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.359 
lose to anyone that has a submachine gun
or<00:01:29.850> an<00:01:30.360> assault<00:01:30.630> rifle<00:01:30.720> that's<00:01:31.110> automatic<00:01:31.650> so

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
or an assault rifle that's automatic so

our only gameplay but scavenger Pro

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.780 
our only gameplay but scavenger Pro

doesn't give you more flamethrower ammo
which<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.209> kind<00:03:07.079> of<00:03:07.139> lame<00:03:07.349> I<00:03:08.159> liked<00:03:08.819> it<00:03:08.969> more<00:03:09.090> to

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
which is kind of lame I liked it more to

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.879 
which is kind of lame I liked it more to
war<00:03:09.359> with<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.540> flamethrower<00:03:10.109> like<00:03:10.469> rebuilt

war with a flamethrower like rebuilt

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.420 
war with a flamethrower like rebuilt
like<00:03:11.129> re<00:03:11.689> re<00:03:12.829> what's<00:03:13.829> weird<00:03:14.010> I'm<00:03:14.129> thinking

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
like re re what's weird I'm thinking

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.289 
like re re what's weird I'm thinking
like<00:03:14.579> recharged

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
like recharged

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.270 
like recharged
I<00:03:15.450> guess<00:03:16.169> but<00:03:16.469> I<00:03:16.530> guess<00:03:16.709> it<00:03:16.859> doesn't<00:03:17.159> make

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
I guess but I guess it doesn't make

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.219 
I guess but I guess it doesn't make
sense<00:03:17.310> cuz<00:03:17.940> you're<00:03:18.359> not<00:03:18.419> just<00:03:18.659> gonna<00:03:18.750> recharge

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.229 
sense cuz you're not just gonna recharge

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.530 
sense cuz you're not just gonna recharge
your<00:03:19.530> uh<00:03:19.560> your<00:03:20.549> thing<00:03:20.760> but<00:03:20.909> I<00:03:20.940> wish<00:03:21.150> like<00:03:21.359> you

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
your uh your thing but I wish like you

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.059 
your uh your thing but I wish like you
could<00:03:21.720> at<00:03:21.840> least<00:03:21.870> get<00:03:22.199> that<00:03:22.379> like<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.889> flame

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
could at least get that like the flame

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.439 
could at least get that like the flame
Turkish<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.639> mean<00:03:23.849> the<00:03:23.909> flamethrower<00:03:24.239> is<00:03:24.299> not

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:24.449 
Turkish I mean the flamethrower is not

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.659 
Turkish I mean the flamethrower is not
overpowered<00:03:24.959> at<00:03:25.139> all<00:03:25.379> it's<00:03:25.590> crap<00:03:26.010> but<00:03:26.609> I

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
overpowered at all it's crap but I

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.699 
overpowered at all it's crap but I
thought<00:03:26.849> it<00:03:27.030> would<00:03:27.090> be<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.239> cool<00:03:27.479> game<00:03:27.659> game<00:03:28.530> to

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
thought it would be a cool game game to

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.349 
thought it would be a cool game game to
get<00:03:28.859> but<00:03:29.159> sadly<00:03:29.430> I'm<00:03:29.669> not<00:03:29.849> gonna<00:03:30.000> waste<00:03:30.180> my

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
get but sadly I'm not gonna waste my

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.270 
get but sadly I'm not gonna waste my
time<00:03:30.510> because<00:03:30.689> I<00:03:30.870> would<00:03:30.989> have<00:03:31.139> to<00:03:31.290> I<00:03:31.560> think<00:03:32.159> he

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
time because I would have to I think he

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.189 
time because I would have to I think he
gives<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.549> enough<00:03:32.760> for<00:03:32.939> like<00:03:33.060> two<00:03:33.239> two<00:03:33.870> kills

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
gives you enough for like two two kills

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.259 
gives you enough for like two two kills
but<00:03:35.129> if<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.340> want<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.549> put<00:03:35.669> the<00:03:35.790> flamethrower

gun works if you see me get like eleven
kills<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:23.099> then<00:04:23.190> I'm<00:04:23.279> in<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.520> chopper<00:04:23.700> going

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:23.969 
kills and then I'm in a chopper going

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.730 
kills and then I'm in a chopper going
into<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.180> rest<00:04:24.330> of<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:24.570> game<00:04:24.719> kind<00:04:25.380> of<00:04:25.529> boring

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
into the rest of the game kind of boring

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.360 
into the rest of the game kind of boring
so<00:04:26.310> I<00:04:26.340> figured<00:04:26.700> you<00:04:26.969> know

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
so I figured you know

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.640 
so I figured you know
my<00:04:27.790> my<00:04:28.240> free-for-all<00:04:28.780> scores<00:04:29.050> might<00:04:29.350> not<00:04:29.500> be

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
my my free-for-all scores might not be

guess like I did get the pro perks but I

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.870

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
because they did patch the glitch so

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.150 
because they did patch the glitch so
it's<00:05:41.320> not<00:05:41.530> a<00:05:41.590> big<00:05:41.770> deal

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160
