00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:54.840
 infinite and the south of the world we put

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.289
 I'm back on the guys finally 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.390
 tablet I want to do I want to start 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:11.909
 these new series on the tablet for 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:14.010
 just to diversify a little from others 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.620
 youtuber 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:22.890
 furthermore I'll do this example has crashed 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:27.780
 minecraft but had to do so because i 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:34.560
 like i'm wrong sorry world i 'm a 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.430
 genius with the title b of hockey o 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.270
 good heavens 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:44.220
 thank goodness there is water goodbye ok he has us 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.250
 spurred on in a slightly strange world to say 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:55.229
 the truth is a world will excuse lag 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:59.900
 a moment graphic options franzi 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.900
 graphics we put low 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.670
 ok now it's ok guys 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.789
 let's see, let's start a little new 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.560
 series let's see how it goes I hope you like it 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.560
 let's start by taking some wood 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.080
 I hope you really like it very much 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.470
 and I'm recording in 1080p because point 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:27.060
 on my tablet which is a nexus 7 you can 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:31.380
 precisely record 1080p and does not have the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.570
 life while playing at least in low 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.040
 resolution 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:40.800
 let's look at a small cow and 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.430
 I would say to take because the 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.040
 square are now currently not sure what 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.550
 minecraft version that on the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.060
 pocket edition but it's a version 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:57.180
 not quite old is not so much 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.290
 old boys is very recent though not 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.430
 it obviously doesn't have all the things it knows 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.430
 that are on the computer 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.790
 I would make a map table a bit 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:19.860
 I would do a little bit of wood 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:28.910
 sticks and place the cart in the wall 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:34.150
 and I'd say get us a pickaxe 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:36.710
 and to go and immediately dig underground 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.010
 it will be a little more difficult difficult 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:43.970
 check let's say the character 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:49.070
 wapa because the money alone is still 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:53.030
 ok let's go underground guys is 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:57.590
 really an ethical game on the 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:00.020
 mobile because it is much more we say with 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.270
 less stuff so much lighter a lot 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.870
 more soft 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:08.090
 we can say so let's take some 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.060
 stone still really very much 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.780
 better than the one on the computer 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:18.049
 according to me at least because in the meantime it is 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.260
 cool because if I know you have a 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.970
 cell phone and a tablet at home when 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.590
 invite your friends 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:30.770
 just turn on your minecraft 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:36.590
 and you can play in two because there is 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:38.060
 allan mode also on the sky computer 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.630
 modest allan but a little more difficult 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.060
 we say so to do because they want us 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.520
 two computers and two computers 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.430
 they want enough power 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.650
 if we can say so sorry I took it off 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.300
 a moment the charge because you are 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:58.460
 heating up a bit on the tablet 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.380
 however this will be a short episode 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.990
 also not to overheat the 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.990
 tablet that really does a bit of effort 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.740
 the processor let's say above all 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:14.250
 in the summer it is a bit of a struggle to 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:17.919
 cook it is cooked that stupid cook 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.449
 let's say work so I'd say do a 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:26.470
 bit of charcoal 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:29.349
 let's wait for it to be a little bit like it 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:33.520
 he says in short and we take some mushrooms 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:35.789
 that we make soup with 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:42.099
 guys there is no hunger bar 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:45.580
 so there is no area bar e 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:51.720
 so we never get tired but the food 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:58.380
 therefore it serves to restore life 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:06:02.530
 kill this cow qua mori ok e 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:07.259
 let's go and see ours which is the 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:10.259
 carbonella we have it and coach love 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:10.259
 this 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:30.740
 with wooden blanks and let's do one 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:33.200
 torch 4 torches a coffee kosÃ¨ boys ho 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:40.240
 tried doing it i don't know what i 'm a 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:42.770
 cutter or that exists on the PC and I do n't think so 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.360
 guys this is a cool thing because 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:48.020
 a new thing 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:54.170
 that is, I did not really know this 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:56.060
 different from the PC and therefore ambesi the cobol 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:59.600
 stones lab 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:02.240
 oh well this exists god rit ma boys but 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.090
 this is like the new version ie the 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.340
 diorite has recently been added to the 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:13.270
 version 1.8 which has not yet been released on PC 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:18.560
 boys so let's say this one 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:21.620
 here is a version is a mixture of 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.810
 so many versions then from the one over 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:28.060
 old the newer one because 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.469
 the older one had no bar 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.999
 of hunger therefore in fact in this 

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:33.669
 game we don't have the hunger bar 

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:37.539
 but we have objects that have been 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:40.210
 come in 1.8 and it's really epic 

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:43.810
 boys that is, this one serves for 

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:46.419
 build things in wood a kind of 

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:49.960
 perilli crafting cable will be held on 

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:52.330
 expected stone sorry I said wood e 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:55.900

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:57.639
