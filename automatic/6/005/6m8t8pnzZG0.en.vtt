things are and my mistake is I put one
next<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.869> mortar<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.710> kind<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.159> blew<00:01:35.310> up

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
next to a mortar and it kind of blew up

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.319 
next to a mortar and it kind of blew up
so<00:01:36.150> they're<00:01:36.360> my<00:01:36.720> Archer<00:01:37.049> has<00:01:38.060> destroyed<00:01:39.060> those

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
so they're my Archer has destroyed those

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.800 
so they're my Archer has destroyed those
two<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.460> there's<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.520> giant<00:01:41.850> bomb<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.390> Tesla

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.179 
two and there's a giant bomb in a Tesla
right<00:01:42.960> there<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.350> you're<00:01:43.500> going<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.680> place<00:01:43.860> one

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
right there so you're going to place one

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.050 
right there so you're going to place one
hog<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:46.040> after<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.159> bomb<00:01:47.460> blows<00:01:47.700> up<00:01:47.909> you're

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
hog and after that bomb blows up you're

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.810 
hog and after that bomb blows up you're
going<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.240> use<00:01:48.329> two<00:01:48.570> fingers<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.430> or<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.460> use

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
going to use two fingers and or I use

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.910

two<00:01:51.000> fingers<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.899> put<00:01:52.110> both<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.380> them<00:01:52.649> and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
two fingers and I put both of them and

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.219 
two fingers and I put both of them and
try<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.189> get<00:01:53.399> those<00:01:53.579> air<00:01:53.820> defenses<00:01:54.360> now<00:01:55.020> if<00:01:55.110> you

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
try to get those air defenses now if you

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.539 
try to get those air defenses now if you
could<00:01:55.350> spread<00:01:55.710> them<00:01:55.860> out<00:01:55.950> more<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.399> would<00:01:56.460> be

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
could spread them out more that would be

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.670 
could spread them out more that would be
awesome<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:57.119> places<00:01:58.049> he'll<00:01:58.170> spoil<00:01:58.439> right

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
awesome but places he'll spoil right

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.590 
awesome but places he'll spoil right
away<00:01:58.890> or<00:01:59.040> else<00:01:59.189> they're<00:01:59.399> going<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.579> die<00:01:59.880> all<00:02:00.210> of

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
away or else they're going to die all of

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.499 
away or else they're going to die all of
them<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.409> what<00:02:01.740> went<00:02:01.920> wrong<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.430> most<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.299> Hogs

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
them so what went wrong is most the Hogs

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.510 
them so what went wrong is most the Hogs
went<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> left<00:02:04.290> now<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.369> make

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
went to the left now if you can make

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
down to the pair of walls I use for wall

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.040

breakers<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:41.760> didn't<00:02:42.090> go<00:02:42.120> exactly<00:02:42.330> as<00:02:42.870> I

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050

wanted but it went fine I use a dragon
down<00:02:46.650> here<00:02:47.300> because<00:02:48.300> there's<00:02:48.870> only<00:02:49.019> that

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
down here because there's only that

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.809 
down here because there's only that
wizard<00:02:49.680> tower<00:02:49.830> that<00:02:50.040> can<00:02:50.220> hit<00:02:50.370> them<00:02:50.459> for<00:02:50.730> now

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819
