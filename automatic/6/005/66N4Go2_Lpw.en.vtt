00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.720
 I deal with the oil and 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.669
 Filter change filters in the car are 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.789
 important but let's hand on her heart 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.710

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.279
 You can make yourself a few euros 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.680
 save up 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.270
 First, I start with the drain 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.370
 the individual steps are in the reason 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.950
 quite simply vehicle on the car lift 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.809
 to get on the way to work 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.940
 bring and if necessary the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.160
 remove underbody protection I use 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.780
 a special oil collector in the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.270
 However , every ten liters is done as well 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.460
 bucket pair of rags should you 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.790
 ready to lay and suitable tool in 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.810
 our trap in semmering keys 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.810
 I loosen the drain plug 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:07.610
 unscrew this and let the oil 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.490
 From Makoto technology has a broad 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.870
 assortment of air and interior filters 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.500
 as well as fuel and oil filter the 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.840
 program 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.840
 You can find these on the homepage 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.320
 www.mach.de so the vehicle is again 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.540
 let down 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.950
 Next we change to oil filter 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.270
 In our case, an oil filter use 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.670
 we then have to go to the lids of the fzl 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:55.850
 unscrew in our case with 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:59.149
 a 36 o'clock going on I trade the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.490
 seal the oil filter cover this 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.170
 get hard and can leak 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.200
 due to thermal stress and 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.060
 oil 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.950
 this new seal is included 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.950
 the power contains oil filter 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.130
 so and now it goes on again 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.760
 with the installation of the new abo oil filter 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.760
 is used 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:37.709
 the lid back on and with 25 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.709
 pulled newton meter firmly 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.670
 the filter installed 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.830
 next it goes to the 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.360
 Interior filters in our case are 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:55.270
 Two I start cleaning the 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.660
 outdoor area from the filter cash register 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.070
 dirt and other foreign bodies a good one 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.620
 tool here is one 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.350
 commercial vacuum cleaner and a whole 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.910
 normal swabs I remove contents 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:13.000
 Take the box of the FÃ¼rth box 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.069
 cover and thus can the old 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.790
 Remove the interior filter 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:25.010
 I wish the filter kassen with a 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:27.469
 rag out, if necessary, come again 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.760
 the vacuum cleaner for use it sets the 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:30.760
 new abo interior filter 1 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:42.480
 park the lid here on it 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.349
 close with the old feather and 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.260
 so are the interior filters 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.189
 changed so it goes on with the same 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.890
 the air filter 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:53.120
 For this I have to go to such channels and 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.120
 remove the engine cover 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.320
 The air filter box exposed as 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.690
 Next I remove the 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.100
 fixing screws from the lid and 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.100
 can thus the air filters remove 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:34.020
 solved tom sense 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:38.340
 so I can remove the lid and 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.290
 take out the air filter made 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.120
 vision of the air filter box can the 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.120
 new macro air filters are used 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.450
 and it goes back to the assembly 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.850
 the fixing screws will be replaced 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.479
 dressed and the other channels again 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.479
 used 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.610
 and with that we can already do it 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.500
 last filter of the fuel filter at 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:31.139
 diesel vehicle one of the most important 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:33.949
 I remove filter can clamp keep 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.949
 then deduct them 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.260
 Now I write off the haltestelle 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.090
 and have the old fuel filter 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.770
 one hand the new macbook 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.320
 I have fuel filters with something 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:08.330
 diesel fills up the ventilation time 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.330
 shorten so I put him in 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:17.660
 attach again with the stop 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:29.000
 put the wires back on and 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.000
 tighten the clamps again 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:37.519
 Lastly, I finish the change 

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:39.679
 I screw the drain plug again 

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:42.469
 Of course I use one 

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:45.999
 new sealing ring will be the drain plug 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:45.999
 tightened with 20 newton meters 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:54.259
 according to the manufacturer's data completely 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:58.210
 needed quality and quantity of oil 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:58.210
 in our case, it's six liters 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:12.050
 check as last step 

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:14.889
 I adjust the oil level of this and so 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.889
 All work is complete 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.599
 It is very important when changing the oil and 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:22.430
 when changing all filters pay attention to the 

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:27.830
 predetermined change intervals of the 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:29.900
 vehicle manufacturer that was the change 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.599
 the different filters in the car thinks 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.159
 he will attend the regular exchange 

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:36.939
 good ride on all wheels wishes you 

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:36.939
 the screwdriver
