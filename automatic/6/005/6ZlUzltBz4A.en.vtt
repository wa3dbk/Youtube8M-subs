00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
sure a lot of you guys that want to have

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.940 
sure a lot of you guys that want to have
a<00:03:09.519> huge<00:03:09.910> farm<00:03:10.299> will<00:03:10.959> have<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.380> problem<00:03:11.799> with

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
a huge farm will have a problem with

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.130 
a huge farm will have a problem with
this<00:03:12.040> as<00:03:12.220> well<00:03:12.370> because<00:03:12.549> it<00:03:12.850> takes<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.420> long<00:03:13.450> to

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
this as well because it takes so long to

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.069 
this as well because it takes so long to
plant<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.950> water<00:03:15.190> all<00:03:15.519> these<00:03:15.880> crops<00:03:16.120> like<00:03:16.870> it

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
plant and water all these crops like it

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.640 
plant and water all these crops like it
just<00:03:17.350> takes<00:03:17.500> way<00:03:17.739> too<00:03:17.769> long<00:03:18.100> now<00:03:18.340> for

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
just takes way too long now for

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.619 
just takes way too long now for
seasons<00:03:20.159> they<00:03:20.280> have<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.489> new<00:03:20.849> system<00:03:21.450> which<00:03:21.599> is

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
seasons they have a new system which is

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.410 
seasons they have a new system which is
called<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.079> farming<00:03:22.560> by<00:03:22.939> 3x3<00:03:23.939> fields<00:03:24.299> which

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
called the farming by 3x3 fields which

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.309 
called the farming by 3x3 fields which
means<00:03:24.629> you<00:03:24.750> can<00:03:24.900> farm<00:03:25.370> 9<00:03:26.370> plots<00:03:26.939> at<00:03:27.180> once<00:03:27.510> that

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
means you can farm 9 plots at once that

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.319 
means you can farm 9 plots at once that
is<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:28.829> much<00:03:29.069> better<00:03:29.310> they<00:03:29.549> actually<00:03:30.060> have<00:03:30.299> a

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
is so much better they actually have a

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.539 
is so much better they actually have a
mass<00:03:30.689> irrigation<00:03:31.409> mass<00:03:31.620> planting<00:03:31.950> system

mass irrigation mass planting system

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.509 
mass irrigation mass planting system
that<00:03:33.150> makes<00:03:33.390> farming<00:03:33.900> large<00:03:34.379> field<00:03:34.739> so<00:03:35.159> much

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
that makes farming large field so much

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.179 
that makes farming large field so much
easier<00:03:36.359> I<00:03:36.569> don't<00:03:36.629> know<00:03:37.049> how<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.500> can<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.920> know<00:03:38.040> I
