 Hi guys, in today's video I'm going to talk 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.379
 a little about the version of the pole they have 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.420
 sound controls and other adjustments 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:12.690
 directly in the steering wheel in this case here 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.460
 vehicle is also equipped with bluetooth 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.550
 that is, you can answer the phone 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.580
 phone and listen and chat directly 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.460
 by the vehicle's sound system is this is 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.560
 Grandma without taking her hands off the wheel. 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.590
 you press the middle button that has a 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.030
 symbol and answers the call. 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.230
 or make calls is during which you drive 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.570
 pressing this button and if the phone 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.940
 android or iphone and in the car with 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.800
 bluetooth enabled it will have to 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.239
 navigate through your phone contacts and 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.160
 discharge indirectly through the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.989
 buttons up and down the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.899
 contacts will appear on the goal sound 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.610
 through this treasure here of sound and you 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.579
 can dial without having to pick up the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.469
 device is very interesting after you 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.780
 have that kind of professional you stay 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.579
 Addicted, right? 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.949
 besides being able to make calls you can 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.210
 listen to any audio that is in the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.260
 cell phone such as podcast 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.270
 any other audio you 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.159
 Saved to listen in car courses 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.220
 language courses in general 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.170
 well here the options increase and 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.860
 Turn the volume down, up and down. 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.240
 modify the song you have 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.009
 a wine both on the right and on the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.680
 left and you will navigate the lights 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.119
 that you have on your SD memory card 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.619

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.619
 or sb and the template button is possible 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.399
 modify the source of the audio input from 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.119
 capital to mrm 1 is the same if it is going to be the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.159
 streaming from phone call 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.799
 on the right side to a control for 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.420
 interact with the on- board computer 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.340
 all controls except setting 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.740
 time are made through these buttons 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.380
 here and there on the dashboard has a little button 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.380
 the smaller is that a small wash the yard is 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.619
 to set the time 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.950
 all other settings are made 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.810
 through that these controls is here 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.680
 good because it's easy to check the 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.629
 average of you 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.579
 the mileage adi is general information 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.579
 and can be obtained by the computer 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.180
 you can do this 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.670
 quickly 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.010
 an important detail of being crimped is 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.129
 that the steering wheel controls work 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.750
 only with ignition switched on for example 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.519
 modifying the volume will not go here 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.859
 putting too high does not 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.260
 but if you turn off the power switch 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:43.730
 vehicle 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:47.129
 turn it off even if you turn on the radio 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.260
 the steering wheel controls they up 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.870
 they pay for backlighting and do not 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.909
 works more 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.090
 Good, is this good, and until the next 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.090
 video
