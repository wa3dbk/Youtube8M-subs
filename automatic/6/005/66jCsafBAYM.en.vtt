00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.240
 he tries it was clear to me the most 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.940
 important was to start with goal 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.750
 so he did not want to book the best messi 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.750
 he launched the first 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.529
 I read no mistake I had already met but 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.970
 it was the worst he joined his classmates 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.060
 in the middle of the field and started the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.060
 suffering 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.340
 / final penalty your head looks after you 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.570
 they returned ghosts of the past as the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.640
 last elimination and copa america 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.230
 also because you had defeat in the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.960
 World Cup final for the occasions 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.969
 failed minutes before ghosts that 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.969
 they came and went as the session went 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.130
 although everything went well at the same time if it marked 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.620
 the fourth penalty 5 and if Colombia failed 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.570
 Argentina was in semis 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.550
 it serves me and the triumph close 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.390
 so for a moment he thought that 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.390
 rosemary took it out 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.110
 but it did not matter it reached the fifth if 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.949
 it marked Argentine bible they were semis and 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.350
 this time 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.539
 no second chance 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.140
 wasted and in the head of leo in 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.850
 some ghosts 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.220
 and if I had thrown the fifth in the 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.870
 first but it was too late there was no 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.870
 time nor margin of error 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.920
 in the neighborhood of his friend he left 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.920
 drive once more 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.020
 third chance he played red 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.460
 but not this time either 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.990
 and everything came down 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.990
 until murillo 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.490
 it was the fourth opportunity I read scream to 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.490
 you look 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.880
 cheer up red hugged banega and to see 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.880
 yes 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.260
 and this time the cry of 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.390
 Argentine liberation was already in itself 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.190
 same 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.080
 and after suffering and then finally 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.080
 I can say goodbye to the ghosts
