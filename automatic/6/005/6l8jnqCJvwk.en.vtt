00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello how welcome are you to my channel 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.779
 upiita in this video I'm going to talk to you 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.269
 of an uncle or rather of a 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.429
 mask to whiten the skin of the 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.320
 face that or word in which any 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.080
 body area that you want to clarify 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.330
 this mix this mask that we are going to 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.850
 prepare will help us to withdraw all 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.490
 the little spots that we have the cloth 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.279
 freckles caused by the sun and give a 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.890
 more uniform tone to the face 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.730
 ok what is it about we are going to add in a 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.220
 skillet 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.220
 natural yogurt ok 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.570
 let's add natural yogurt 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.840
 and here I have it, let's also add 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:50.610
 a teaspoon or half a teaspoon of 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.610
 almonds oil 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.040
 and we're also going to add half a 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.130
 lemon these are all the ingredients 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:06.490
 we will need lemon oil 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:10.920
 almonds and natural yogurt ok 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:14.320
 and let's mix the perfectly fine 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.930
 well mixed the lemon oil and the 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.030
 natural yogurt and since it is well 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.130
 mixed this we will not apply it in 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.009
 the face or in the area that we want 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.009
 clarify or we want to erase spots 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.380
 or eliminate small cloth by the sun and 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.330
 we're going to leave it from 15 to 20 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.780
 we're going to do it three times a minute 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.000
 week 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.189
 if you want faster results three 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.649
 times per week if you want if you do not 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.289
 interesting or not you want the results 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.060
 be like this and quickies you can apply it 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.549
 until once a week but let it be 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.429
 constant and do not stop making it a 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.990
 once a week but constant do not leave 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.090
 to do it not to see you jump the weeks 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.780
 Of course, if you do it three per week 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.530
 the result will be much faster ok what 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.450
 I repeat again 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.909
 we are going to apply in the face the boron what 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.549
 let's leave 15 to 20 minutes and 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.549
 then we rinse our face or what 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:10.090
 we wash as we usually do ok 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.869
 it's a very easy type, very simple 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.080
 Y 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.000
 in cash another very important thing 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.760
 everything always I have told you that 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.409
 whenever you 're going to use lemon in 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.739
 any mask and you are going to apply 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:25.629
 in the face you always have to use 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.209
 some sunscreen ok 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:31.239
 because the lemon works wonders 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.930
 but it 's acid and if you do not protect yourself the 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.970
 face or where you apply this mixture is going to 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.579
 be counterproductive and instead of that 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.379
 I will clarify the spots will be recorded or 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.390
 the cloth the nuggets are going to be recorded 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:46.870
 then I recommend you to use 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.440
 the sun protection factor ok 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.230
 a sunscreen if you want 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.180
 exfoliate the face if you want to apply 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.459
 this mask and in turn wants to remove 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.040
 all dead cells of the face 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.780
 then we add sugar and start 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.910
 exfoliate the whole face ok 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.590
 and it's going to remove all the cells 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.990
 dead and in turn will bleach us 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.030
 also the face although that is already 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.740
 optional if you want to exfoliate add 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.900
 sugar if you do not want to exfoliate without anything 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.209
 mast is clean then well let what 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.940
 I got that sugar and it's perfect that 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.700
