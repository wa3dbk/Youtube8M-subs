was<00:00:22.130> jumping<00:00:22.490> around<00:00:22.580> and<00:00:23.090> I<00:00:23.650> was<00:00:24.650> sweating

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
was jumping around and I was sweating

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.170 
was jumping around and I was sweating
because<00:00:25.160> the<00:00:25.279> phantom<00:00:25.610> was<00:00:25.670> in<00:00:25.820> the<00:00:25.910> air<00:00:26.000> like

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
because the phantom was in the air like

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.640 
because the phantom was in the air like
always<00:00:28.990> heading<00:00:29.990> up<00:00:30.080> to<00:00:30.170> the<00:00:30.230> border<00:00:30.530> right

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
always heading up to the border right

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.799 
always heading up to the border right
now

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:31.809 
now

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:42.299 
now
do<00:00:32.809> you<00:00:32.930> ever<00:00:33.020> passports<00:00:33.559> ready<00:00:38.770> ready

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.189 

Zep<00:00:43.309> didn't<00:00:43.670> seem<00:00:43.820> to<00:00:43.940> want<00:00:44.030> to<00:00:44.180> start<00:00:44.479> but<00:00:45.170> I

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
Zep didn't seem to want to start but I

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.560 
Zep didn't seem to want to start but I
think<00:00:45.650> it's<00:00:45.890> honestly<00:00:46.339> whenever<00:00:46.489> I<00:00:47.000> park

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
think it's honestly whenever I park

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.310 
think it's honestly whenever I park
parked<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.620> van<00:00:48.739> in<00:00:48.890> a<00:00:48.949> steep<00:00:49.190> angle<00:00:50.320> for

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
parked the van in a steep angle for

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.110 
parked the van in a steep angle for
those<00:00:51.440> of<00:00:51.589> no<00:00:51.680> cars<00:00:51.949> pretty<00:00:52.220> well<00:00:52.460> this<00:00:52.909> is<00:00:53.089> a

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
those of no cars pretty well this is a

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.710 
those of no cars pretty well this is a
direct<00:00:53.570> port<00:00:53.870> injection<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:54.830> with<00:00:55.670> that<00:00:55.909> it's

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
direct port injection and with that it's

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.869 
direct port injection and with that it's
basically<00:00:56.930> two<00:00:59.589> two<00:01:00.589> fuel<00:01:01.070> injectors<00:01:01.489> right

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
basically two two fuel injectors right

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.729 
basically two two fuel injectors right
into<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:02.540> thing<00:01:03.260> it's<00:01:03.409> pretty<00:01:03.530> much<00:01:03.680> a

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
into a thing it's pretty much a

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.680 
into a thing it's pretty much a
carburetor<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:04.460> I<00:01:04.879> think<00:01:05.120> whenever<00:01:05.299> it<00:01:05.540> sits

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
carburetor and I think whenever it sits

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.170 
carburetor and I think whenever it sits
at<00:01:05.780> an<00:01:05.870> angle<00:01:06.170> it<00:01:06.350> puts<00:01:06.590> too<00:01:06.799> much<00:01:06.830> fuel<00:01:07.370> in<00:01:07.580> so

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
at an angle it puts too much fuel in so

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.670 
at an angle it puts too much fuel in so
when<00:01:08.540> it's<00:01:08.659> sitting<00:01:08.810> up<00:01:08.930> like<00:01:09.140> this<00:01:09.380> it

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
when it's sitting up like this it

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.570 
when it's sitting up like this it
doesn't<00:01:09.890> want<00:01:10.010> to<00:01:10.070> start<00:01:10.280> when<00:01:10.369> it's<00:01:10.490> sitting

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
doesn't want to start when it's sitting

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.800 
doesn't want to start when it's sitting
down<00:01:10.729> I<00:01:10.760> got<00:01:10.970> it<00:01:11.030> doesn't<00:01:11.240> want<00:01:11.360> to<00:01:11.420> start<00:01:11.630> but

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
down I got it doesn't want to start but

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.289 
down I got it doesn't want to start but
that<00:01:11.960> was<00:01:12.200> I<00:01:12.500> was<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.310> longest<00:01:13.700> it's<00:01:13.909> taken<00:01:14.240> a

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
that was I was a longest it's taken a

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.110 
that was I was a longest it's taken a
long<00:01:14.540> time<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.170> I<00:01:15.500> think<00:01:16.460> he's<00:01:16.580> had<00:01:16.730> enough<00:01:16.940> for

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
long time so I think he's had enough for

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.340 
long time so I think he's had enough for
the<00:01:17.180> day<00:01:17.240> we<00:01:17.450> have<00:01:17.480> a<00:01:17.600> hundred<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:18.110> fifty

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
the day we have a hundred and fifty

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.540 
the day we have a hundred and fifty
kilometers<00:01:18.500> left<00:01:19.010> so<00:01:20.050> everything<00:01:21.050> goes

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
kilometers left so everything goes

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:28.870 
kilometers left so everything goes
smoothly<00:01:23.320> so<00:01:24.320> get<00:01:24.680> you<00:01:24.860> back<00:01:25.040> after<00:01:25.460> this<00:01:27.880> I

smoothly so get you back after this I

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:38.560 
smoothly so get you back after this I
