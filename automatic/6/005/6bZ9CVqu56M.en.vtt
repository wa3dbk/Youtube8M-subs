00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
and take it out and use it so here we go

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.430 
and take it out and use it so here we go
so<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.940> wrapped<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.149> bubble<00:00:36.780> wrap<00:00:36.960> here

see<00:02:11.550> me<00:02:11.700> filming<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:17.780> very<00:02:18.780> thin<00:02:19.050> profile

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
see me filming this very thin profile

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.190 
see me filming this very thin profile
they<00:02:19.739> should<00:02:19.920> fit<00:02:20.239> well<00:02:21.239> in<00:02:21.420> my<00:02:21.510> pocket<00:02:22.019> I

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
they should fit well in my pocket I

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.500 
they should fit well in my pocket I
think<00:02:22.500> there's<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.709> may<00:02:22.890> even<00:02:23.069> be<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.580> case<00:02:24.269> for

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
think there's a may even be a a case for

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.070 
think there's a may even be a a case for
this<00:02:24.599> too<00:02:24.840> will<00:02:25.049> see<00:02:26.660> buttons<00:02:27.660> here<00:02:27.870> on<00:02:27.959> the

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
this too will see buttons here on the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.080 
this too will see buttons here on the
side<00:02:28.400> but<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.489> is<00:02:29.670> what<00:02:29.819> I'm<00:02:29.910> most

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
side but this is what I'm most

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.539 
side but this is what I'm most
interested<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:31.140> folks<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.920> keyboard

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
interested in folks is the keyboard

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.940 
interested in folks is the keyboard
because<00:02:32.760> as<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.660> business<00:02:34.170> user<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.799> am

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
because as a business user and I am

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.589 
because as a business user and I am
doing<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.430> quite<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.730> bit<00:02:38.819> because<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.299> want<00:02:39.510> to

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
doing this quite a bit because I want to

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.600 
doing this quite a bit because I want to
see<00:02:39.810> how<00:02:39.959> well<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.319> can<00:02:40.530> hold<00:02:40.680> up<00:02:40.890> here<00:02:41.130> this

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
see how well this can hold up here this

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.190 
see how well this can hold up here this
I<00:02:41.880> believe<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.420> little<00:02:42.690> strip<00:02:42.870> here<00:02:43.049> in<00:02:43.140> the

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
I believe this little strip here in the

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.140 
I believe this little strip here in the
middle<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.650> more<00:02:43.890> for<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.280> stability<00:02:44.459> of<00:02:44.849> the

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
middle is more for the stability of the

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.589 
middle is more for the stability of the
of<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.769> keyboard<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:47.849> sliding<00:02:48.299> in<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.480> out

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
of the keyboard and sliding in and out

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.170 
of the keyboard and sliding in and out
but<00:02:48.810> we'll<00:02:48.930> find<00:02:49.170> out<00:02:49.380> so<00:02:49.739> I'll<00:02:50.610> become<00:02:50.879> quite

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
but we'll find out so I'll become quite

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.619 
but we'll find out so I'll become quite
a<00:02:51.209> bit<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.569> sliding<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.049> out<00:02:53.510> it's<00:02:54.510> got

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
a bit of the sliding in and out it's got

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.250 
a bit of the sliding in and out it's got
a<00:02:54.660> solid<00:02:55.459> space<00:02:56.459> bar<00:02:56.730> here<00:02:56.970> good<00:02:57.209> size<00:02:57.420> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
a solid space bar here good size the

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
characters here the at sign is its own

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.009 
characters here the at sign is its own
key<00:03:11.430> which<00:03:11.639> is<00:03:11.790> great<00:03:12.060> especially<00:03:12.359> for<00:03:12.630> typing

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
key which is great especially for typing

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.289 
key which is great especially for typing
in<00:03:13.109> emails<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:16.709> number<00:03:16.950> pad<00:03:17.160> this<00:03:17.459> is<00:03:17.670> an<00:03:17.880> a/v

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
in emails the number pad this is an a/v

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.270 
in emails the number pad this is an a/v
control<00:03:18.720> here<00:03:19.019> i<00:03:19.049> believe<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.470> na'vi<00:03:19.709> control

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
control here i believe the na'vi control

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.830 
control here i believe the na'vi control
would<00:03:21.269> then<00:03:21.510> flip<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.049> use<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:23.040> like<00:03:23.549> this<00:03:24.480> but

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
would then flip to use it like this but

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.740 
would then flip to use it like this but
we'll<00:03:25.019> soon<00:03:25.319> find<00:03:25.349> out<00:03:26.299> also<00:03:27.299> interested<00:03:27.720> in

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
we'll soon find out also interested in

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.059 
we'll soon find out also interested in
seeing<00:03:27.989> how<00:03:28.019> well<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.349> pictures<00:03:28.709> take<00:03:28.920> on

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
seeing how well the pictures take on

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.030 
seeing how well the pictures take on
here<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:30.079> don't<00:03:31.079> know<00:03:31.170> if<00:03:31.260> that's<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.530> zeiss<00:03:31.739> lens

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
here I don't know if that's a zeiss lens

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.759 
here I don't know if that's a zeiss lens
or<00:03:32.250> not<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:35.310> this<00:03:35.579> is<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.169> e75<00:03:37.169> let's<00:03:37.500> see<00:03:37.620> what

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
or not so this is the e75 let's see what

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:46.460 
or not so this is the e75 let's see what
else<00:03:37.799> is<00:03:38.040> in<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.250> box<00:03:38.459> here<00:03:44.780> underneath<00:03:45.780> here

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
else is in the box here underneath here

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:54.039 
else is in the box here underneath here
that<00:03:46.829> gives<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.340> case<00:03:48.680> which<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:49.919> nothing<00:03:50.130> open

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.940 

kind<00:03:55.049> of<00:03:55.109> a<00:03:55.609> velvet<00:03:56.609> like<00:03:57.349> case<00:03:58.349> with<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.709> piece

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
kind of a velvet like case with a piece

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.210 
kind of a velvet like case with a piece
of<00:03:58.980> foam<00:03:59.370> inside<00:03:59.849> of<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.269> I<00:04:00.650> can<00:04:01.650> get<00:04:01.829> this<00:04:01.980> out

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
of foam inside of it I can get this out

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.520

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
of here else velcro strap so I guess I

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.510 
of here else velcro strap so I guess I
would<00:04:07.709> just<00:04:07.739> slide<00:04:08.099> right<00:04:09.349> in<00:04:10.349> a<00:04:10.829> little<00:04:11.579> tight

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520
