done<00:03:35.780> by<00:03:35.990> us<00:03:36.170> like<00:03:36.530> this<00:03:36.740> is<00:03:36.890> from<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.340> crash<00:03:37.690> so

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
done by us like this is from a crash so

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.880 
done by us like this is from a crash so
I<00:03:38.990> mean<00:03:39.550> from<00:03:40.550> that<00:03:40.690> we've<00:03:41.690> actually<00:03:41.870> if<00:03:42.800> you

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
I mean from that we've actually if you

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.400 
I mean from that we've actually if you
think<00:03:42.950> about<00:03:43.160> it<00:03:43.430> with<00:03:43.850> that<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:44.300> remind<00:03:45.110> it's

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
think about it with that and remind it's

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.790 
think about it with that and remind it's
actually<00:03:45.739> been<00:03:45.860> a<00:03:45.890> pretty<00:03:46.040> good<00:03:46.280> car<00:03:46.489> but<00:03:47.770> so<00:03:48.770> I

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
actually been a pretty good car but so I

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.890 
actually been a pretty good car but so I
got<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.100> replace<00:03:49.280> that<00:03:49.370> um<00:03:50.830> this<00:03:51.830> thing<00:03:52.540> on<00:03:53.540> the

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
got to replace that um this thing on the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.370 
got to replace that um this thing on the
other<00:03:53.930> side<00:03:54.730> scattery<00:03:55.730> replace<00:03:56.060> because<00:03:56.930> it

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
other side scattery replace because it

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.620 
other side scattery replace because it
is<00:03:57.680> broken<00:03:58.130> off<00:03:58.400> I<00:03:58.610> believe<00:03:58.640> I<00:03:59.270> don't<00:03:59.360> know<00:03:59.540> if

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
is broken off I believe I don't know if

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.229 
is broken off I believe I don't know if
you<00:03:59.690> can<00:03:59.780> see<00:03:59.989> that<00:04:00.170> I<00:04:00.400> can't<00:04:01.400> see<00:04:01.580> it<00:04:01.670> myself

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
you can see that I can't see it myself

do the alarm rotor that prevents and
when<00:04:34.669> you<00:04:34.790> unlock<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.360> car<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:36.200> micro<00:04:36.530> switch

when you unlock the car the micro switch

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.460 
when you unlock the car the micro switch
switches<00:04:37.460> off<00:04:37.610> right<00:04:38.000> well<00:04:38.720> in<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.110> driver's

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
switches off right well in the driver's

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.070 
switches off right well in the driver's
side<00:04:39.790> the<00:04:40.790> micro<00:04:41.030> switch<00:04:41.240> is<00:04:41.390> not<00:04:41.540> switching

new<00:04:46.010> nuts<00:04:46.220> so<00:04:47.150> that's<00:04:47.479> unfortunate<00:04:48.080> but<00:04:48.200> we're

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
new nuts so that's unfortunate but we're

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.870 
new nuts so that's unfortunate but we're
going<00:04:48.470> to<00:04:48.530> see<00:04:48.830> if<00:04:48.950> we<00:04:49.040> can<00:04:49.160> get<00:04:49.250> a<00:04:49.280> new<00:04:49.430> locking

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
going to see if we can get a new locking

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.420 
going to see if we can get a new locking
mechanism<00:04:50.390> this<00:04:50.690> is<00:04:50.900> easiest<00:04:51.290> way<00:04:51.500> my<00:04:52.070> teacher

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
mechanism this is easiest way my teacher

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.880 
mechanism this is easiest way my teacher
