00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
listened to it like said if I if I hear

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.930 
listened to it like said if I if I hear
noise<00:02:05.980> it<00:02:06.310> doesn't<00:02:06.640> sound<00:02:06.790> good

or<00:02:10.530> when<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.620> spin<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.040> engine<00:02:12.310> over<00:02:12.580> if<00:02:12.760> it

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
or when you spin the engine over if it

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.370 
or when you spin the engine over if it
sounds<00:02:13.209> like<00:02:13.300> one<00:02:13.450> cylinders<00:02:13.930> lost

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
compression it speeds up momentarily you

got<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:22.180> got<00:02:22.330> more<00:02:22.480> going<00:02:22.780> on<00:02:22.900> than<00:02:24.989> then<00:02:25.989> you

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
got you got more going on than then you

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.199 
got you got more going on than then you
were<00:02:27.730> hoping<00:02:28.000> or<00:02:28.480> how<00:02:28.750> many

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.770 

whether<00:02:31.810> how<00:02:31.989> many<00:02:32.260> uh<00:02:32.379> I<00:02:33.299> mean<00:02:34.299> belts<00:02:34.659> like

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
whether how many uh I mean belts like

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.819 
whether how many uh I mean belts like
burned<00:02:35.079> off<00:02:35.319> on<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:36.430> far<00:02:37.560> but<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:38.650> don't

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
burned off on this so far but I don't

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.319 
burned off on this so far but I don't
hear<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.189> so<00:02:39.459> what<00:02:39.610> I'm<00:02:39.700> gonna<00:02:39.790> do<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.209> I'm

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
hear that so what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.210 
hear that so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna<00:02:40.420> start<00:02:40.750> at<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.930> very<00:02:41.200> end<00:02:42.689> of<00:02:44.220> the

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
gonna start at the very end of the

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.649 
gonna start at the very end of the
ignition<00:02:45.430> system<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:46.120> that's<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.360> spark

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
ignition system and that's the spark

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.500 
ignition system and that's the spark
plugs<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.170> start<00:02:47.650> pulling<00:02:47.829> plugs<00:02:48.099> out<00:02:48.720> and

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
plugs and start pulling plugs out and

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.729 
plugs and start pulling plugs out and
whatever<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.689> reason<00:02:53.049> if<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.290> have<00:02:53.439> a<00:02:53.470> dead

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
whatever the reason if you have a dead

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.649 
whatever the reason if you have a dead
sooner<00:02:54.099> then<00:02:54.430> you're<00:02:54.579> gonna<00:02:54.700> find<00:02:55.359> it<00:02:55.540> when

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
sooner then you're gonna find it when

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.240 
sooner then you're gonna find it when
you<00:02:55.720> pull<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.959> plug<00:02:56.170> out<00:02:56.379> because<00:02:56.769> that<00:02:56.980> plug

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
you pull the plug out because that plug

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.759 
you pull the plug out because that plug
is<00:02:57.400> gonna<00:02:57.549> be<00:02:58.079> you<00:02:59.079> know<00:02:59.140> it's<00:02:59.470> gonna<00:02:59.560> be<00:02:59.680> all

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
is gonna be you know it's gonna be all

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.740 
is gonna be you know it's gonna be all
fouled<00:03:00.129> and<00:03:00.459> do<00:03:00.640> because<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.269> Sooners<00:03:01.629> I'm

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
fouled and do because the Sooners I'm

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.240 
fouled and do because the Sooners I'm
gonna<00:03:01.959> firing<00:03:02.319> the<00:03:02.409> rest<00:03:02.590> of<00:03:02.769> them<00:03:02.859> will<00:03:02.920> be<00:03:02.980> at

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
gonna firing the rest of them will be at

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.089 
gonna firing the rest of them will be at
least<00:03:03.540> clean<00:03:04.540> enough<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:05.019> work<00:03:05.230> so<00:03:05.769> that's

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
least clean enough to work so that's

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.160 
least clean enough to work so that's
what<00:03:06.340> we're<00:03:06.489> gonna<00:03:06.579> do<00:03:06.849> first

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
what we're gonna do first

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.680 
what we're gonna do first
I<00:03:08.200> always<00:03:09.129> start<00:03:09.519> at<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.730> very<00:03:09.970> end<00:03:10.269> work<00:03:10.540> the

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
I always start at the very end work the

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.610 
I always start at the very end work the
way<00:03:10.810> back<00:03:12.359> if<00:03:13.359> I<00:03:13.540> find<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.870> plug<00:03:14.079> that's<00:03:14.260> looking

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
way back if I find a plug that's looking

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.890 
way back if I find a plug that's looking
bad<00:03:14.799> which<00:03:15.040> I'm<00:03:15.190> expecting<00:03:15.819> I<00:03:15.909> will<00:03:16.120> then<00:03:16.870> the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
bad which I'm expecting I will then the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.589 
bad which I'm expecting I will then the
next<00:03:17.200> thing<00:03:17.379> I'll<00:03:17.530> do<00:03:17.709> is<00:03:19.439> how

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.890 

I'll<00:03:23.079> put<00:03:23.260> us<00:03:23.760> I'll<00:03:24.760> put<00:03:24.969> a<00:03:25.000> spark<00:03:25.329> tester<00:03:25.780> on

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
I'll put us I'll put a spark tester on

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.959 
I'll put us I'll put a spark tester on
that<00:03:26.110> that<00:03:26.769> wire<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:28.439> see<00:03:29.439> if<00:03:29.560> it<00:03:29.709> has<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:29.969> spark

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:30.969 
that that wire and see if it has a spark

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.270 
that that wire and see if it has a spark
getting<00:03:31.209> out<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.540> it<00:03:31.739> if<00:03:32.739> it<00:03:32.859> doesn't<00:03:33.159> know<00:03:33.189> I

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
getting out to it if it doesn't know I

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.039 
getting out to it if it doesn't know I
don't<00:03:33.519> know<00:03:33.609> I<00:03:33.640> gotta<00:03:33.909> go<00:03:34.030> further<00:03:34.299> up<00:03:34.450> it<00:03:34.840> does

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
don't know I gotta go further up it does

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.899 
don't know I gotta go further up it does
I<00:03:35.260> know<00:03:35.409> that<00:03:35.709> you<00:03:35.950> know<00:03:36.099> I<00:03:36.450> had<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.480> plug<00:03:37.810> issue

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
I know that you know I had a plug issue

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.190 
I know that you know I had a plug issue
and<00:03:39.909> plugs<00:03:40.209> don't<00:03:40.390> normally<00:03:40.780> just<00:03:40.930> file<00:03:41.170> out

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
and plugs don't normally just file out

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.899 
and plugs don't normally just file out
on<00:03:41.590> their<00:03:41.709> own<00:03:41.769> this<00:03:41.980> looks<00:03:42.250> like<00:03:42.400> it<00:03:42.519> has<00:03:42.670> some

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
on their own this looks like it has some

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.140 
on their own this looks like it has some
newer<00:03:43.120> plugs<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:44.290> wires<00:03:45.000> but<00:03:46.000> that

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
newer plugs and wires but that

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.910 
newer plugs and wires but that
carburetor<00:03:46.510> with<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:46.989> choke<00:03:47.230> being<00:03:47.470> that<00:03:47.709> close

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
carburetor with a choke being that close

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.339 
carburetor with a choke being that close
that<00:03:48.220> one<00:03:48.430> it's<00:03:48.879> been<00:03:49.030> running<00:03:49.389> bad<00:03:49.629> for<00:03:50.290> a

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
that one it's been running bad for a

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.520 
that one it's been running bad for a
while<00:03:50.530> anyway<00:03:50.739> so<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.900> know<00:03:53.049> when<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:53.290> got<00:03:53.409> an

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
while anyway so you know when you got an

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.440 
while anyway so you know when you got an
engine<00:03:53.799> like<00:03:53.920> this<00:03:54.099> has<00:03:54.310> got<00:03:54.459> untold<00:03:54.879> miles<00:03:55.120> on

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
engine like this has got untold miles on

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.699 
engine like this has got untold miles on
it<00:03:55.889> you<00:03:56.889> know<00:03:57.670> he<00:03:57.819> might<00:03:58.000> have<00:03:58.180> a<00:03:58.379> valve<00:03:59.379> stem

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
it you know he might have a valve stem

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.349 
it you know he might have a valve stem
seal<00:04:00.010> leaking<00:04:00.370> a<00:04:00.400> little<00:04:00.609> bit<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:01.000> it<00:04:01.150> just

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
seal leaking a little bit so it just

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.509 
seal leaking a little bit so it just
kind<00:04:01.629> of<00:04:01.659> adds<00:04:02.470> up<00:04:02.739> and<00:04:02.950> it<00:04:03.069> just<00:04:03.340> finally

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
kind of adds up and it just finally

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.250 
kind of adds up and it just finally
fouls<00:04:03.909> it<00:04:04.150> out<00:04:05.700> but<00:04:06.700> one<00:04:06.909> thing<00:04:07.120> I<00:04:07.269> noticed<00:04:07.659> he

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
fouls it out but one thing I noticed he

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.479 
fouls it out but one thing I noticed he
is<00:04:09.659> looking<00:04:10.659> back<00:04:10.840> here<00:04:11.019> these<00:04:11.169> plugs<00:04:11.500> you'll

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
is looking back here these plugs you'll

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.819 
is looking back here these plugs you'll
notice<00:04:13.379> that<00:04:14.379> that<00:04:14.439> rear<00:04:15.069> one<00:04:15.280> back<00:04:15.459> there<00:04:16.829> you

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
notice that that rear one back there you

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:25.530 
notice that that rear one back there you
can<00:04:17.919> see<00:04:18.130> that<00:04:18.160> I<00:04:18.639> got<00:04:18.820> my<00:04:19.000> life<00:04:19.209> here

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.480 

the<00:04:26.050> rear<00:04:26.290> plug<00:04:26.590> back<00:04:26.860> there<00:04:27.100> you<00:04:27.250> see<00:04:27.460> that

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
the rear plug back there you see that

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.610 
the rear plug back there you see that
that<00:04:28.150> plug<00:04:28.510> how<00:04:28.780> far<00:04:28.990> out<00:04:29.140> that<00:04:29.170> plug<00:04:29.470> is

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
that plug how far out that plug is

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.310 
that plug how far out that plug is
that's<00:04:29.800> got<00:04:29.920> a<00:04:29.980> non<00:04:30.220> Fowler<00:04:30.550> in<00:04:30.820> it<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:32.080> I<00:04:32.290> know

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
that's got a non Fowler in it and I know

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.480 
that's got a non Fowler in it and I know
like<00:04:33.190> seeing<00:04:33.580> that<00:04:33.730> because<00:04:34.800> non<00:04:35.800> power<00:04:36.130> is

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490

so<00:06:46.010> you<00:06:47.010> know<00:06:47.160> especially<00:06:47.370> if<00:06:47.610> I<00:06:47.700> see<00:06:47.940> this

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
so you know especially if I see this

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.870 
so you know especially if I see this
thing's<00:06:48.360> already<00:06:48.540> got<00:06:49.340> recent<00:06:50.340> plugs<00:06:50.550> and

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 
thing's already got recent plugs and

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.310 
thing's already got recent plugs and
plug<00:06:51.060> wires<00:06:51.330> and<00:06:51.570> I<00:06:51.690> don't<00:06:51.900> know<00:06:51.990> about<00:06:52.110> the

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.320 
plug wires and I don't know about the

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.750 
plug wires and I don't know about the
distributor<00:06:52.800> cap<00:06:52.830> it<00:06:53.160> doesn't<00:06:53.460> look<00:06:53.580> too

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
distributor cap it doesn't look too

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.170 
distributor cap it doesn't look too
recent<00:06:55.130> nothing<00:06:56.130> is<00:06:56.340> you<00:06:56.520> need<00:06:56.670> to<00:06:56.760> go<00:06:56.910> with

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
recent nothing is you need to go with

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.260 
recent nothing is you need to go with
some<00:06:57.390> some<00:06:58.350> hints<00:06:58.770> that<00:06:59.400> you<00:06:59.460> find<00:06:59.820> like<00:07:00.090> that

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270 
some some hints that you find like that

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.320 
some some hints that you find like that
thing<00:07:00.510> over<00:07:00.750> there<00:07:00.900> and<00:07:01.110> that<00:07:01.200> little<00:07:01.380> uh<00:07:01.530> I

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330 
thing over there and that little uh I

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.730 
thing over there and that little uh I
guess<00:07:03.330> that's<00:07:03.540> actual<00:07:03.870> a<00:07:03.900> spark<00:07:04.230> plug<00:07:04.290> tester

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
guess that's actual a spark plug tester

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.300 
guess that's actual a spark plug tester
never<00:07:05.670> seen<00:07:05.880> one<00:07:06.090> like<00:07:06.210> that<00:07:06.270> but<00:07:07.130> you<00:07:08.130> know<00:07:08.250> I

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.320 
found that and then inside of it I found

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.290 
found that and then inside of it I found
another<00:07:10.590> coil<00:07:11.160> that<00:07:11.370> goes<00:07:11.580> on<00:07:11.790> the<00:07:11.880> kappa's

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
another coil that goes on the kappa's

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.940 
another coil that goes on the kappa's
