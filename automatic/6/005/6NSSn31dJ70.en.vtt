british scientists have successfully
tested<00:00:03.179> missiles<00:00:03.510> which<00:00:03.689> they<00:00:03.840> intend<00:00:04.140> to

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200

hour before crashing into a block of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.469 
hour before crashing into a block of
sand<00:01:25.110> that's<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.890> same<00:01:26.130> consistency<00:01:26.880> as<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.050 
sand that's the same consistency as the
moon<00:01:27.689> but<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.500> big<00:01:28.829> question<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
moon but the big question is have the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.690 
moon but the big question is have the
instruments<00:01:30.689> survive<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.290> impact<00:01:31.670> we<00:01:32.670> have

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
instruments survive the impact we have

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.219 
instruments survive the impact we have
every<00:01:33.000> confidence<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.509> we'll<00:01:33.689> find<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.079> very

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
every confidence that we'll find it very

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.370 
every confidence that we'll find it very
in<00:01:34.439> there<00:01:34.650> pretty<00:01:34.890> well<00:01:35.130> intact

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
in there pretty well intact

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.310 
in there pretty well intact
but<00:01:37.189> to<00:01:37.369> be<00:01:37.490> sure<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.969> scientists<00:01:38.600> firstly<00:01:39.079> to

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
but to be sure the scientists firstly to

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.920 
but to be sure the scientists firstly to
find<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:39.799> penetrator<00:01:42.640> found<00:01:43.640> it<00:01:43.880> back<00:01:44.600> in<00:01:44.810> the

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
find the penetrator found it back in the

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.779 
find the penetrator found it back in the
lab<00:01:45.140> computer<00:01:45.920> tests<00:01:46.159> showed<00:01:46.430> that<00:01:46.460> the

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
lab computer tests showed that the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.179 
lab computer tests showed that the
instruments<00:01:47.420> have<00:01:47.600> survived<00:01:48.020> before<00:01:48.920> these

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
instruments have survived before these

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.999 
instruments have survived before these
trials<00:01:49.729> everything<00:01:50.509> had<00:01:50.630> been<00:01:50.659> on<00:01:50.960> paper<00:01:51.259> now

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
trials everything had been on paper now

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.490 
trials everything had been on paper now
we<00:01:52.070> have<00:01:52.520> some<00:01:52.789> real<00:01:52.970> hardware<00:01:53.539> to<00:01:54.320> show

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
we have some real hardware to show

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.899 
we have some real hardware to show
people<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.100> that<00:01:55.189> makes<00:01:55.429> all<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.729> difference

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
people and that makes all the difference

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.660 
people and that makes all the difference
the<00:01:56.780> penetrators<00:01:57.530> have<00:01:57.740> passed<00:01:58.009> their<00:01:58.310> first

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
the penetrators have passed their first

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.389 
the penetrators have passed their first
big<00:01:58.939> test<00:01:59.360> the<00:02:00.140> instruments<00:02:00.710> inside<00:02:00.860> has

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
big test the instruments inside has

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.359 
big test the instruments inside has
survived<00:02:01.789> the<00:02:02.030> impact<00:02:02.409> this<00:02:03.409> means<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:04.130> team

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
survived the impact this means the team

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.639 
survived the impact this means the team
here<00:02:04.700> are<00:02:05.090> an<00:02:05.210> important<00:02:05.750> step<00:02:06.020> forward<00:02:06.380> in

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
here are an important step forward in

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.800 
here are an important step forward in
launching<00:02:07.130> Britain's<00:02:07.610> first<00:02:07.909> ever<00:02:08.300> mission

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
launching Britain's first ever mission

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.500 
launching Britain's first ever mission
to<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:08.989> moon<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:10.459> results<00:02:10.940> have<00:02:11.000> been<00:02:11.090> so

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
to the moon the results have been so

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.570 
to the moon the results have been so
successful<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:12.290> space<00:02:12.739> agencies<00:02:13.400> are

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
successful that space agencies are

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.059 
successful that space agencies are
already<00:02:14.000> thinking<00:02:14.090> beyond<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.080> moon<00:02:15.290> the
