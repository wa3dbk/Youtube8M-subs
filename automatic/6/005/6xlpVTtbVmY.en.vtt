MacBooks the the white ones is that you

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.230

the hard drive you can access the RAM

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.480 
the hard drive you can access the RAM
very<00:01:17.880> easily<00:01:18.210> unlike<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.200> MacBook<00:01:20.189> Pros

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
very easily unlike the MacBook Pros

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.800 
very easily unlike the MacBook Pros
where<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.180> take<00:01:21.330> off<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.659> whole

where you have to take off the whole
back<00:01:22.290> cover<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.860> access<00:01:23.159> all<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.820> stuff<00:01:24.180> this

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
back cover to access all that stuff this

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.140 
back cover to access all that stuff this
is<00:01:25.020> very<00:01:25.290> user<00:01:25.619> friendly<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.670> believe<00:01:27.560> so

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
is very user friendly I believe so

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.660 
is very user friendly I believe so
that's<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.420> oh<00:01:30.710> do<00:01:31.710> they<00:01:31.829> even<00:01:32.040> show<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.400> side<00:01:32.640> I

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
that's a oh do they even show the side I

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.730 
that's a oh do they even show the side I
probably<00:01:33.060> done<00:01:33.450> these<00:01:33.869> are<00:01:34.049> all<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.290> ports<00:01:34.590> of

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
probably done these are all the ports of

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.789 
probably done these are all the ports of

computer works great I have let's see

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.249 
computer works great I have let's see
it's<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.310> 160<00:01:59.310> gigabyte<00:01:59.700> hard<00:01:59.880> drive<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:03.869> 2

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
gigabyte of RAM I I'm going to upgrade

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.550 
gigabyte of RAM I I'm going to upgrade
that<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.590> its<00:02:08.069> max<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.789> 4<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.599> believe<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.470> will

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
that to its max of 4 I believe it will

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.300 
that to its max of 4 I believe it will
make<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.830> run<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.550> course<00:02:11.819> faster

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
make it run of course faster

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
make it run of course faster
and<00:02:14.020> it<00:02:15.020> is<00:02:15.140> running<00:02:15.530> ten<00:02:15.980> point<00:02:16.400> eight<00:02:16.640> point

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
and it is running ten point eight point

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.740 
and it is running ten point eight point
whatever<00:02:18.160> it's<00:02:19.160> on<00:02:19.490> right<00:02:19.670> now<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.150> we'll

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
whatever it's on right now and we'll

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.230 
whatever it's on right now and we'll
figure<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.140> out<00:02:21.200> when<00:02:21.440> we<00:02:21.470> turn<00:02:21.709> on<00:02:22.240> the

all<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.430> fingerprints<00:02:26.060> there's<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.840> little

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
all the fingerprints there's a little

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.460 
all the fingerprints there's a little
bit<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.500> scratching<00:02:28.069> over<00:02:28.580> here<00:02:28.850> but<00:02:29.470> nothing

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470

to<00:02:30.980> be<00:02:31.310> worried<00:02:32.060> about<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:33.050> course<00:02:33.489> this<00:02:34.489> is

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
to be worried about of course this is

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.809 
to be worried about of course this is
all<00:02:34.910> perfectly<00:02:35.630> clean<00:02:36.310> which<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.340> pretty<00:02:37.610> hard

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
all perfectly clean which is pretty hard

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.090 
all perfectly clean which is pretty hard
to<00:02:37.880> do<00:02:38.090> with<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.540> light<00:02:38.950> MacBooks

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
to do with the light MacBooks

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.070 
to do with the light MacBooks
anyway<00:02:41.090> we<00:02:41.720> will<00:02:41.959> turn<00:02:42.950> off<00:02:43.190> these<00:02:44.080> video

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
anyway we will turn off these video

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:56.740 
anyway we will turn off these video
lights<00:02:45.380> here<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:48.610> let's<00:02:49.610> turn<00:02:49.940> it<00:02:50.090> on<00:02:55.750> of

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
lights here and let's turn it on of

getting it nice and center my tripod is

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.740 
getting it nice and center my tripod is
kind<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.380> funny<00:03:22.920> it's<00:03:23.250> really<00:03:23.490> slanted<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:24.300> if

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
kind of funny it's really slanted so if

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.059 
kind of funny it's really slanted so if
you<00:03:24.870> ever<00:03:24.990> look<00:03:25.319> at<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.500> videos<00:03:25.800> and<00:03:25.950> you're

you ever look at the videos and you're
like<00:03:26.220> oh<00:03:26.459> this<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:27.000> really<00:03:27.030> slanted<00:03:27.750> well

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
like oh this is really slanted well

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.350 
like oh this is really slanted well
that's<00:03:28.770> my<00:03:28.980> tripod<00:03:29.430> for<00:03:29.700> you

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.630 

on<00:03:33.360> camera<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:34.170> can<00:03:34.350> see<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.620> waves<00:03:34.860> going<00:03:35.400> up

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
on camera you can see the waves going up

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.020 
on camera you can see the waves going up
but<00:03:36.390> in<00:03:36.540> person<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.050> don't<00:03:37.230> see<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.530> at<00:03:37.709> all

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
but in person you don't see that at all

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.400 
but in person you don't see that at all
on<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.270> lights<00:03:39.480> doing<00:03:39.840> that<00:03:39.989> on<00:03:40.140> camera

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
on the lights doing that on camera

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.530 
on the lights doing that on camera
usually<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:41.959> LCD<00:03:42.959> displays<00:03:43.620> or<00:03:43.860> whatever

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
usually the LCD displays or whatever

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.710 
usually the LCD displays or whatever
don't<00:03:45.540> do<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:45.989> on<00:03:46.140> camera<00:03:47.450> it's<00:03:48.450> taking<00:03:48.690> a

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
don't do that on camera it's taking a

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.180 
don't do that on camera it's taking a
little<00:03:48.780> while<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.080> turn<00:03:49.410> on<00:03:49.530> here<00:03:49.769> that's<00:03:50.010> why

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
little while to turn on here that's why

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.020 
little while to turn on here that's why
I<00:03:50.220> think<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.610> four<00:03:51.330> gigabyte<00:03:52.140> of<00:03:52.350> RAM<00:03:52.590> will<00:03:53.030> do

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
I think the four gigabyte of RAM will do

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:05.490 
I think the four gigabyte of RAM will do
good<00:03:54.330> for<00:03:54.600> this<00:03:54.959> computer

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.250 

then<00:04:06.500> we're<00:04:06.950> still<00:04:07.160> waiting<00:04:07.960> we'll<00:04:08.960> get<00:04:09.080> there

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
then we're still waiting we'll get there

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.030 
then we're still waiting we'll get there
someday<00:04:09.590> today<00:04:11.410> it's<00:04:12.410> kind<00:04:12.500> of<00:04:12.590> a<00:04:12.680> good<00:04:12.980> thing

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
someday today it's kind of a good thing

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.150 
someday today it's kind of a good thing
it<00:04:13.280> took<00:04:13.460> so<00:04:13.640> long<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:14.840> know<00:04:14.960> so<00:04:15.320> I<00:04:15.350> could<00:04:15.710> not

it took so long you know so I could not

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.370 
it took so long you know so I could not

I'll<00:04:48.110> be<00:04:48.140> upgrading<00:04:49.130> that<00:04:49.160> to<00:04:49.490> four<00:04:49.820> in<00:04:50.690> the

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
I'll be upgrading that to four in the
