00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
into this math and he'll shoot it out

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.900 
into this math and he'll shoot it out
and<00:00:26.519> here's<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.660> armor<00:00:28.050> dragon<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.910> here's

so let's check out how the armor sits on

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.090 
so let's check out how the armor sits on
the<00:00:34.649> armor<00:00:34.980> dragon<00:00:36.200> alright<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.559> get<00:00:37.860> two

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
the armor dragon alright so you get two

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.920 
the armor dragon alright so you get two

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
pieces of armor and they just clip on

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.560 
pieces of armor and they just clip on
either<00:00:40.140> side<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.800> Dragon<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:41.969> got<00:00:42.329> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
either side of the Dragon so you got a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.420 
either side of the Dragon so you got a
hole<00:00:42.809> right<00:00:43.020> here<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:43.890> put<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.250> in

hole right here and you just put it in

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.720 
hole right here and you just put it in
here<00:00:46.850> whoops<00:00:47.850> wrong<00:00:48.690> side<00:00:49.430> say<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.489> got<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
hole you just put it in there and you

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.950 
hole you just put it in there and you
click<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:54.180> then<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.480> click<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.899> one

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
click it in and then you click this one

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.119 
click it in and then you click this one
into<00:00:55.559> also<00:00:55.969> and<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:58.199> way<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.559> armor<00:00:58.890> flies

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
into also and the way the armor flies

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.340 
into also and the way the armor flies
off<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.180> hand<00:01:00.449> right<00:01:00.660> here<00:01:00.870> usually<00:01:01.260> got

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
off is this hand right here usually got

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.910 
off is this hand right here usually got
to<00:01:01.469> push<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.070> they<00:01:02.940> just<00:01:02.969> fly<00:01:03.480> off

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.649 

all<00:01:08.460> right<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:08.880> now<00:01:09.030> let's<00:01:09.270> check<00:01:09.450> out

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
all right so now let's check out

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.080 
all right so now let's check out
toothless<00:01:10.050> eight<00:01:10.380> missiles<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.760> missile

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
toothless eight missiles so the missile

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.750 
toothless eight missiles so the missile
just<00:01:12.330> sits<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.630> his<00:01:12.750> mouth<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.700> so<00:01:14.700> you

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
just sits in his mouth like that so you

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.420 
just sits in his mouth like that so you
just<00:01:14.970> put<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.450> there<00:01:15.690> and<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:17.220> way<00:01:17.369> you

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
just put it in there and the way you

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.020 
just put it in there and the way you
shoot<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:18.960> push<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.729> right<00:01:20.729> here

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
shoot it is you just push on right here

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.120 
shoot it is you just push on right here
my<00:01:21.479> thumb<00:01:21.720> where<00:01:21.930> my<00:01:22.050> thumb<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.710> push

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
my thumb where my thumb is you just push

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.590 
my thumb where my thumb is you just push
and<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.700> shoots<00:01:25.820> so<00:01:26.820> now<00:01:26.970> let's<00:01:27.180> try<00:01:27.300> to<00:01:27.390> get

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and it shoots so now let's try to get

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.330 
and it shoots so now let's try to get
this<00:01:27.750> armor<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.229> fly<00:01:28.410> off<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.950> missile

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
this armor to fly off with this missile

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:47.029 
this armor to fly off with this missile
I<00:01:44.840> don't<00:01:45.840> think<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.080> has<00:01:46.200> enough<00:01:46.350> strength<00:01:46.800> in

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
I don't think it has enough strength in

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.590 
I don't think it has enough strength in
there<00:01:47.250> let's<00:01:47.640> give<00:01:47.789> it<00:01:47.820> one<00:01:47.940> more<00:01:48.180> shot<00:01:48.210> from

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
there let's give it one more shot from

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:58.100 
there let's give it one more shot from
up<00:01:48.750> close

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.390 

yeah<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.290> missile<00:01:59.619> does<00:01:59.740> not<00:01:59.890> have<00:02:00.100> enough

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
yeah the missile does not have enough

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.390 
yeah the missile does not have enough
power<00:02:00.430> to<00:02:00.850> is<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.259> armored<00:02:02.650> dragon's<00:02:03.130> hand

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
power to is the armored dragon's hand

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.690 
power to is the armored dragon's hand
hard<00:02:03.729> enough<00:02:04.030> for<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.659> armor<00:02:04.960> to<00:02:04.990> fly<00:02:05.290> off<00:02:05.700> but

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
hard enough for the armor to fly off but

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.940 
hard enough for the armor to fly off but
this<00:02:07.330> is<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.509> fun<00:02:07.780> toy<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.110> play<00:02:08.289> with<00:02:08.470> you<00:02:08.800> can

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
this is a fun toy to play with you can

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.680 
this is a fun toy to play with you can
do<00:02:09.039> it<00:02:09.190> manually<00:02:09.550> just<00:02:09.850> by<00:02:10.030> pushing<00:02:10.300> on<00:02:10.539> the

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
do it manually just by pushing on the

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.580 
do it manually just by pushing on the
hand<00:02:12.630> okay<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.870> also<00:02:14.560> have<00:02:14.920> stormfly<00:02:15.730> and

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
hand okay so I also have stormfly and

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.110 
hand okay so I also have stormfly and
Astrid<00:02:17.590> here<00:02:17.890> so<00:02:18.190> let's<00:02:18.489> check<00:02:18.730> out<00:02:18.880> if

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
Astrid here so let's check out if

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.229 
Astrid here so let's check out if
stormfly's<00:02:19.750> missile<00:02:20.290> can<00:02:20.650> get<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.819> armor<00:02:22.209> off

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
stormfly's missile can get the armor off

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:29.270 
stormfly's missile can get the armor off
the<00:02:22.540> armor<00:02:22.840> dragon<00:02:24.510> three<00:02:25.510> two<00:02:26.080> one<00:02:26.739> blast<00:02:27.640> off

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
the armor dragon three two one blast off

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.740
