00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
how to get the ac-130 or the military

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.900 
how to get the ac-130 or the military
cargo<00:00:09.120> plane<00:00:09.510> from<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.530> fort<00:00:11.130> Zancudo<00:00:11.370> I

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
cargo plane from the fort Zancudo I

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.120 
cargo plane from the fort Zancudo I
believe<00:00:12.090> that's<00:00:12.269> how<00:00:12.360> it's<00:00:12.599> called<00:00:12.630> in<00:00:13.019> GTA<00:00:13.679> 5

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
believe that's how it's called in GTA 5

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.700 
believe that's how it's called in GTA 5
now<00:00:14.849> before<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.389> do<00:00:15.509> this<00:00:15.660> up<00:00:15.870> save<00:00:16.410> right

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
now before you do this up save right

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.380 
now before you do this up save right
before<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.220> fly<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.670> that's<00:00:17.789> what<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:17.940> do<00:00:18.029> if

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
before you fly and that's what I do if

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.810 
before you fly and that's what I do if
you<00:00:18.779> die<00:00:19.020> because<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.830> X<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.400> good<00:00:20.580> chance

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
you die because that X is a good chance

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.390 
you die because that X is a good chance
you<00:00:21.029> will<00:00:21.119> die<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:22.020> make<00:00:22.710> sure<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:22.980> save<00:00:23.220> so

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
you will die so make sure you save so

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.099 
you will die so make sure you save so
you<00:00:23.460> could<00:00:23.609> keep<00:00:23.760> reloading<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.720> as<00:00:24.840> soon<00:00:24.990> as

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
you could keep reloading it as soon as

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.650 
you could keep reloading it as soon as
you<00:00:25.289> die<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.760> right<00:00:26.880> here<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.180> got<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.420> fly

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
you die so right here you got to fly

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.390 
you die so right here you got to fly
right<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.140> get<00:00:28.230> as<00:00:28.410> close<00:00:28.710> as<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:29.340> to

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
this big-ass plane get as close as you

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.400 
this big-ass plane get as close as you
can<00:00:32.610> because<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:33.210> soon<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.960> land<00:00:34.110> there

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.380 
can because as soon as you land there
they're<00:00:34.620> gonna<00:00:34.710> be<00:00:34.800> swarming<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:36.329> you

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
they're gonna be swarming you so you

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.380 
they're gonna be swarming you so you
want<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.719> run<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> ac-130<00:00:39.149> at<00:00:39.329> a

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
want to run to the to the ac-130 at a

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.150 
want to run to the to the ac-130 at a
lot<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.050> call<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.410> c-130<00:00:40.800> because<00:00:41.070> it

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
lot I like to call it a c-130 because it

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.670 
lot I like to call it a c-130 because it
looks<00:00:41.399> like<00:00:41.430> any<00:00:41.550> c-130<00:00:42.090> but<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.140> guess<00:00:43.500> it's

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
looks like any c-130 but I guess it's

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.990 
looks like any c-130 but I guess it's
more<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.040> cargo<00:00:44.250> plane<00:00:44.489> since<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.820> can't

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
more of a cargo plane since you can't

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.880 
more of a cargo plane since you can't
shoot<00:00:45.149> from<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.320> want<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.530> get<00:00:46.590> inside

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
shoot from it so you want to get inside

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.639 
shoot from it so you want to get inside
and<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.340> soon<00:00:47.610> as<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.879> get<00:00:48.059> inside<00:00:48.469> you<00:00:49.469> want

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
and as soon as you get inside you want

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.950 
and as soon as you get inside you want
to<00:00:49.739> quick<00:00:49.890> save<00:00:50.300> just<00:00:51.300> make<00:00:51.480> sure<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.780> click

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
right here I try to escape with it and

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.750 
right here I try to escape with it and
this<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.080> why<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.320> got<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> quick<00:01:07.710> save<00:01:07.979> because

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
this is why I got a quick save because

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.179

like<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.840> said<00:01:09.900> before<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.680> military's<00:01:11.130> gonna

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
like I said before the military's gonna

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.870 
like I said before the military's gonna
swarm<00:01:11.580> your<00:01:11.820> ass<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:13.490> you're<00:01:14.490> probably<00:01:14.610> gonna

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
swarm your ass and you're probably gonna

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.130 
swarm your ass and you're probably gonna
die<00:01:15.320> but<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.549> save<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.330> mean<00:01:18.840> when<00:01:19.049> you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
die but if you save I mean when you

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.910 
die but if you save I mean when you
reload<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:20.000> it<00:01:21.000> automatically<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:21.930> spawns

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
reload it it automatically like spawns

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.670 
reload it it automatically like spawns
you<00:01:23.070> with<00:01:23.220> full<00:01:23.430> health<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.540> jet<00:01:25.350> will<00:01:25.500> have

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
you with full health the jet will have

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.950 
you with full health the jet will have

the plane will have full health and the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.539 
the plane will have full health and the
military<00:01:28.350> will<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.590> more<00:01:28.799> spread<00:01:29.159> out<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
military will be more spread out the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.789 
military will be more spread out the
military<00:01:29.820> will<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:30.720> placed<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.619> was

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799
