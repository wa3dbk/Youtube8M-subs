luck to accomplish i I haven't been able

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.160 
luck to accomplish i I haven't been able
to<00:00:23.550> recreate<00:00:23.880> but<00:00:24.180> it's<00:00:24.330> it's<00:00:24.570> it's<00:00:24.869> kind<00:00:25.109> of

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
to recreate but it's it's it's kind of

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.290 
to recreate but it's it's it's kind of
difficult<00:00:25.350> but<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:26.099> map<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:27.000> glitchy

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
difficult but this map is so glitchy

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.720 
difficult but this map is so glitchy
that<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.869> it'll<00:00:28.500> be<00:00:28.619> easy<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.949> recreate<00:00:29.369> at<00:00:29.609> one

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
that it it'll be easy to recreate at one

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.970 
that it it'll be easy to recreate at one
point<00:00:29.880> if<00:00:30.179> not<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.810> can<00:00:30.929> miss<00:00:31.050> me<00:00:31.230> over<00:00:31.560> xbox

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
allows you to do this now basically what

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.900 
allows you to do this now basically what
you're<00:00:38.040> gonna<00:00:38.160> want<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.520> do<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.879> make

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
you're gonna want to do is make

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.810 
you're gonna want to do is make
basically<00:00:39.840> what<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> Gumby<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.010> glitch<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.610> is

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
basically what a Gumby to glitch that is

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.580 
basically what a Gumby to glitch that is
probably<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> easiest<00:00:42.450> way<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.079> explaining

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
probably the easiest way of explaining

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.740 
probably the easiest way of explaining
it<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.640> I'm<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.149> going<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.329> speed<00:00:45.570> up<00:00:45.660> the

of glitches and he usually finds some

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.970 
of glitches and he usually finds some
pretty<00:00:59.910> easy<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.600> good<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.050> see<00:01:01.320> but<00:01:01.859> this

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
pretty easy so it's good to see but this

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.920 
pretty easy so it's good to see but this
is<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> best<00:01:02.489> way<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.670> getting<00:01:02.940> out<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
is the best way of getting out of the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.600 
is the best way of getting out of the
rise<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:04.559> get<00:01:04.650> cinematics<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.489> your

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
rise so you can get cinematics for your

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.219 
rise so you can get cinematics for your
videos<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.119> plan<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.540> doing<00:01:06.840> any<00:01:06.990> and

you<00:02:01.710> all<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.070> barriers<00:02:02.399> because<00:02:03.000> he's

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
you all the barriers because he's

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.910

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
doesn't really matter once you get

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.070 
doesn't really matter once you get
outside<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.550> map<00:02:11.730> about<00:02:11.970> right<00:02:12.180> here<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.900> can

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
outside the map about right here you can

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.580 
outside the map about right here you can
actually

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
actually

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.020 
actually
detached<00:02:14.099> from<00:02:14.280> him<00:02:14.459> but<00:02:14.640> i'll<00:02:14.790> let<00:02:14.910> them

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
detached from him but i'll let them

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.320 
detached from him but i'll let them
guide<00:02:15.239> show<00:02:15.709> there<00:02:16.709> so<00:02:17.099> I'm<00:02:17.340> detached<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.879> now

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
guide show there so I'm detached and now

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.410 
guide show there so I'm detached and now
you<00:02:18.390> can<00:02:18.660> go<00:02:18.780> explore<00:02:19.650> outside<00:02:20.010> um<00:02:20.790> there's

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
you can go explore outside um there's

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.660 
you can go explore outside um there's
lots<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.780> invisible<00:02:22.319> walls<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.860> still<00:02:23.400> like

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
lots of invisible walls you still like

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.729 
lots of invisible walls you still like
you<00:02:24.150> can't<00:02:24.360> really<00:02:24.599> go<00:02:24.720> all<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.379> way<00:02:25.410> inside

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
you can't really go all the way inside

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.860 
you can't really go all the way inside
in<00:02:25.890> most<00:02:26.069> places<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.819> kind<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.120> does<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.330> but

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
in most places it kind of does that but

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.350 
in most places it kind of does that but
that's<00:02:28.200> not<00:02:28.349> really<00:02:28.590> an<00:02:28.769> issue<00:02:29.000> but<00:02:30.000> this<00:02:30.209> gets

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
that's not really an issue but this gets

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.180 
that's not really an issue but this gets
you<00:02:30.540> allow<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.319> can<00:02:31.470> go<00:02:31.620> out<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.890> look

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
you allow so you can go out and look

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.130 
you allow so you can go out and look
around<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.790> really<00:02:33.299> allows<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.780> get<00:02:33.900> some

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
around and really allows you to get some

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.320 
around and really allows you to get some

about pretty far out there is kind of a
limit<00:03:16.230> but<00:03:16.709> I'm<00:03:16.920> like<00:03:17.220> this<00:03:17.459> building<00:03:17.880> over

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
limit but I'm like this building over

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.370 
limit but I'm like this building over
here<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.269> believe<00:03:18.389> this<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:18.780> one<00:03:19.049> of<00:03:19.079> them<00:03:19.230> that

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
here I believe this is one of them that

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.830 
here I believe this is one of them that
you<00:03:19.470> can<00:03:19.590> actually<00:03:19.709> go<00:03:19.980> up<00:03:20.010> into<00:03:20.370> our<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:21.420> think
