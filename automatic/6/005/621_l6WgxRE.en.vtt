UFOs and so on I thought it would be a
lark<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:51.079> what<00:01:52.079> happened<00:01:52.470> was<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:53.280> I

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
lark and what happened was that as I

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.370 
lark and what happened was that as I
started<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.939> do<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.360> found<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.990> was<00:01:55.200> good

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
started to do it I found that I was good

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.459 
started to do it I found that I was good
at<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.820> I<00:01:56.820> would<00:01:57.149> get<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> testimony<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.350> I

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
at it and I would get a testimony and I

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.780 
at it and I would get a testimony and I
would<00:01:58.680> get<00:01:58.860> people<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.280> talk<00:01:59.460> about
