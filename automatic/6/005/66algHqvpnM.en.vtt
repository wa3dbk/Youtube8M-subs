 so when you arrive on a mop 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.650
 the application you arrive on 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.620
 the video interface so close you can 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.420
 also bring videos 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.410
 since your film so I'm going 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.019
 take for example this video that I have 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.510
 imported so two masts film so 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.370
 how to edit a video already in 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.220
 your film then simply he 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:16.860
 so just click so I resume 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.900
 so there you import your video into 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.130
 pressing the bench arrow next 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.740
 on cameron and then you click 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.070
 the video that the little miniature that 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.500
 you want sos the cros will bring 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.020
 your video so once your video 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.070
 bring you so click on the on the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.820
 miniature pike then on edith and 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.830
 then you click on this lot and 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.040
 then you can you can see 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.510
 so the speed for example to settle 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.549
 so the slowness of the video I'm going 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.930
 make an example 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:58.130
 so there you can see with a slot in 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.130
 50% so the slowness so the video 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.570
 then if for example you put to 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.600
 sumptuous frame so that's going to be a 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.670
 speed increased by 4 times the four 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.629
 times higher than normal so that's it 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.629
 so you can see the difference 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.510
 or so after you can do with 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.170
 super slow motion at 500 or 1000 images 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.030
 per second 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.180
 example I'm going to take 500 so you 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.180
 see you immediately start the year 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.440
 so once you have selected 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.540
 so the mode you want so me 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.710
 I will take for example slower cac 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.590
 40 % so you can so defined so 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.350
 for example the beginning of the slow motion of 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.690
 your video so just so 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.220

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:01.590
 click on speed in here is your 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.780
 slow motion video will start from 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.400
 from that moment on then you can 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.050
 so continue the video in slow and 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.570
