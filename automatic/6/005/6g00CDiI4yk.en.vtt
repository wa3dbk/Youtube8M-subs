00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
it's not just a splitter one person

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.880 
it's not just a splitter one person
asked<00:02:45.960> me<00:02:46.020> they're<00:02:46.200> like<00:02:46.320> that's<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.650> really

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
big splitter it's not a splitter it's an

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.770 
big splitter it's not a splitter it's an
amplifier<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:50.370> what<00:02:50.880> I'm<00:02:51.000> gonna<00:02:51.120> do<00:02:51.330> now<00:02:51.510> is

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
amplifier so what I'm gonna do now is

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.390 
amplifier so what I'm gonna do now is
also<00:02:52.260> show<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.530> another<00:02:52.800> way<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.070> can<00:02:53.280> do

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.400 
also show you another way you can do
this<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.640> can<00:02:53.670> plug<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.120> line<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:54.810> you

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
this you can plug this line in and you

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.050 
this you can plug this line in and you
could<00:02:55.560> use<00:02:55.830> say<00:02:56.070> your<00:02:56.280> macbook<00:02:56.730> or<00:02:56.940> your

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
could use say your macbook or your

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.020 
could use say your macbook or your
computer<00:02:57.660> or<00:02:57.900> your<00:02:58.320> Zune<00:02:59.130> or<00:02:59.370> any<00:02:59.550> device<00:03:00.000> that

computer or your Zune or any device that

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.570 
computer or your Zune or any device that
doesn't<00:03:00.600> have<00:03:00.750> this<00:03:00.960> 30-pin<00:03:01.560> dock<00:03:01.800> connection

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
doesn't have this 30-pin dock connection

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.940 
doesn't have this 30-pin dock connection
this<00:03:02.670> was<00:03:02.880> like<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.060> $13<00:03:03.870> cable<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.470> if<00:03:04.860> you

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
this was like a $13 cable and if you

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.560 
this was like a $13 cable and if you
plan<00:03:05.160> on<00:03:05.190> picking<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.640> e7<00:03:06.030> up<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.270> really

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
plan on picking the e7 up you really

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.670 
plan on picking the e7 up you really
should<00:03:06.750> pick<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.050> up<00:03:07.200> because<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.650> just

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
should pick this up because it just

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.640 
should pick this up because it just
maximizes<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.760> quality<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:10.290> iPhone<00:03:10.620> and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
maximizes the quality of the iPhone and

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.670 
maximizes the quality of the iPhone and
iPods<00:03:11.040> audio<00:03:11.430> tenfold<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:12.600> digital<00:03:13.290> line<00:03:13.470> out

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
iPods audio tenfold the digital line out

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.230 
iPods audio tenfold the digital line out
on<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:13.980> iPhone<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.430> significantly<00:03:15.030> better

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
on the iPhone is significantly better

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.840 
on the iPhone is significantly better
than<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.720> headphone<00:03:16.140> jack<00:03:16.170> line<00:03:16.710> out<00:03:16.950> okay<00:03:17.790> so

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
than the headphone jack line out okay so

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.820 
than the headphone jack line out okay so
we<00:03:18.150> go<00:03:18.300> into<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.600> bottom<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.080> Pheo<00:03:19.260> seven

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
we go into the bottom of the Pheo seven

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.680 
we go into the bottom of the Pheo seven
we'll<00:03:20.130> have<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.370> turn<00:03:20.580> on<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:20.850> Fiocchi<00:03:21.360> seven

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.330 
we'll have to turn on the Fiocchi seven

apologize you can adjust the EQ which is
really<00:03:43.680> not<00:03:43.800> an<00:03:43.950> EQ<00:03:44.280> adjustment<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:44.880> just<00:03:45.090> is

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
like a bass booster if we press this

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.200 
like a bass booster if we press this
real<00:03:47.880> quick<00:03:49.190> it'll<00:03:50.190> say<00:03:50.340> bass<00:03:50.610> boost<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.060> can

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
real quick it'll say bass boost you can

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.760 
real quick it'll say bass boost you can
say<00:03:51.330> one<00:03:51.540> two<00:03:51.690> or<00:03:51.840> three<00:03:51.990> I<00:03:52.020> leave<00:03:52.320> it<00:03:52.410> on<00:03:52.470> zero

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
say one two or three I leave it on zero

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.290 
say one two or three I leave it on zero
just<00:03:53.010> because<00:03:53.250> I<00:03:53.280> like<00:03:53.550> a<00:03:53.580> relatively<00:03:54.060> flat

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
just because I like a relatively flat

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.840 
just because I like a relatively flat
frequency<00:03:54.630> response<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:56.340> can<00:03:56.490> choose<00:03:56.670> to

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
frequency response you can choose to

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.850 
frequency response you can choose to
charge<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.210> over<00:03:57.420> USB<00:03:57.630> while<00:03:57.900> you<00:03:58.020> use<00:03:58.260> it<00:03:58.440> they

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
charge it over USB while you use it they

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.830 
charge it over USB while you use it they
allow<00:03:59.070> you<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.340> disable<00:03:59.610> that<00:03:59.940> so<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:00.720> don't

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
allow you to disable that so you don't

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.100 
allow you to disable that so you don't
get<00:04:01.050> external<00:04:01.590> noise<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:03.660> then<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.930> sleep

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
get external noise and then the sleep

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.860 
get external noise and then the sleep
time<00:04:04.350> basically<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.340> menu<00:04:05.640> is<00:04:05.760> very<00:04:05.870> basic

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
time basically the menu is very basic

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.350 
time basically the menu is very basic
but<00:04:07.050> this<00:04:07.170> is<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.740> device<00:04:07.980> itself<00:04:08.310> okay<00:04:08.940> you

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
but this is the device itself okay you

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.970 
but this is the device itself okay you
turn<00:04:09.570> it<00:04:09.690> on<00:04:09.750> you<00:04:10.080> can<00:04:10.110> control<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.830> volume

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
turn it on you can control the volume

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.449 
turn it on you can control the volume
that<00:04:11.250> goes<00:04:11.550> out<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:13.290> your<00:04:13.500> headphones<00:04:13.860> now

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
that goes out to your headphones now

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.550 
that goes out to your headphones now
this<00:04:15.030> not<00:04:15.270> only<00:04:15.420> provides<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:15.959> lot<00:04:16.140> more<00:04:16.320> power

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
this not only provides a lot more power

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.710 
this not only provides a lot more power
so<00:04:16.830> that<00:04:16.859> you<00:04:17.100> can<00:04:17.280> get<00:04:17.400> a<00:04:17.459> louder<00:04:17.850> sound<00:04:18.030> into

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
so that you can get a louder sound into

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.750 
so that you can get a louder sound into
your<00:04:18.840> headphones<00:04:19.200> but<00:04:19.709> it<00:04:19.830> really<00:04:20.160> kind<00:04:20.640> of

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
your headphones but it really kind of

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.790 
your headphones but it really kind of
equalizes<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.750> audio<00:04:22.080> now<00:04:22.380> I'm<00:04:22.440> not<00:04:22.620> going<00:04:22.740> to

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
equalizes the audio now I'm not going to

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.580 
equalizes the audio now I'm not going to
say<00:04:22.979> it<00:04:23.160> provides<00:04:23.520> bass<00:04:23.820> booster<00:04:24.360> or<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:25.320> Jazz

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
say it provides bass booster or the Jazz

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.960 
say it provides bass booster or the Jazz
setting<00:04:26.070> that's<00:04:26.190> on<00:04:26.370> your<00:04:26.520> iPhone

setting that's on your iPhone
it<00:04:27.300> really<00:04:27.600> just<00:04:28.020> flattens<00:04:28.920> the<00:04:29.220> frequency

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
it really just flattens the frequency

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.700 
it really just flattens the frequency
response<00:04:29.850> most<00:04:30.750> people<00:04:31.080> will<00:04:31.200> tell<00:04:31.380> you<00:04:31.440> if

also<00:05:41.940> this<00:05:42.720> acts<00:05:42.990> as<00:05:43.169> a<00:05:43.230> USB<00:05:43.620> DAC<00:05:44.040> which<00:05:44.310> is<00:05:44.460> why

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
also this acts as a USB DAC which is why

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.640 
also this acts as a USB DAC which is why
this<00:05:44.700> is<00:05:44.880> cool<00:05:45.270> you<00:05:45.450> can<00:05:45.870> actually<00:05:46.020> dock<00:05:46.410> this

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
this is cool you can actually dock this

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.700 
this is cool you can actually dock this
into<00:05:47.160> the<00:05:47.430> other<00:05:47.700> $99<00:05:48.570> desktop<00:05:49.080> amplifier<00:05:49.530> the

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
into the other $99 desktop amplifier the

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.300 
into the other $99 desktop amplifier the
Pheo<00:05:50.010> 9<00:05:50.460> and<00:05:50.760> that<00:05:51.419> will<00:05:51.630> change<00:05:51.960> that<00:05:52.310> analog

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
Pheo 9 and that will change that analog

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.240 
Pheo 9 and that will change that analog
converter<00:05:53.760> into<00:05:54.750> a<00:05:54.990> digital<00:05:55.710> to<00:05:55.830> analog

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
converter into a digital to analog

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.730 
converter into a digital to analog
converter<00:05:56.280> as<00:05:56.820> well<00:05:57.080> now<00:05:58.080> this<00:05:58.320> is<00:05:58.380> really

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
converter as well now this is really

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.340 
converter as well now this is really
great<00:05:58.919> because<00:05:58.980> it<00:05:59.910> allows<00:05:59.940> you<00:06:00.419> to<00:06:00.660> actually

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
great because it allows you to actually

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.040 
great because it allows you to actually
