00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.150
 I'm coming back with a bun that I've 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.740
 posted jeanne list 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.240
 instagram attention since the week 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.070
 last so I like a crazy I 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.570
 already posted a trick a day brief 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.250
 and so I put this picture of buns 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.630
 and it seemed to please you so I 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.430
 shows you how does it look like 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.740
 a lot to the bun that I did 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.050
 cannon bun is easy before the holidays 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.070
 that's almost the same thing 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.960
 I juggle a little bit 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.210
 so we first take a big 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.430
 bar and we get a half-tail 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.719
 so that's it depends on you from 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.449
 your head of what you like about this 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.239
 that you do not like me there I 'm going 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:43.929
 take about half of the head 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:47.190
 to make it a base either 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:47.190
 bass actually even a little bit lower 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.179
 then the crooked there is the part that 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.769
 I do not like it when it's really cool 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:56.499
 you see my pretty something I have 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.629
 not the issue does not know how to hide them and 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:01.420
 if we want to float a little we get some 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.129
 wicks like that to the front and that 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.379
 will do a little bit less severe 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.400
 will do a little more yes I did a 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.400
 bun coming out of the shower 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.030
 if it can be a little gain there is 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.160
 better then after as for the bun 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.380
 that I had done last time 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.270
 take wicks 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.210
 so this time we do not alternate 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.250
 braids the stuff bar 2 etc did that 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.750
 stuff by two then to do 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.600
 study by two i'm showing you for 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.010
 those who had not seen hop we take 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:36.160
 two wicks when entering a big wick 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.490
 which separates it in two, turns each 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:44.050
 match on it even a little while 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.940
 Too much too long and two years 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.740
 continue as and when and after 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.900
 take them in the opposite direction for 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.580
 to turn on each other in 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:57.240
 continuous sent every time I do 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:02:00.610
 a hop pass game over the days texting 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.909
 and that's it and so on until 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.499
 that it is well at the end in fact 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.640
 so what is top with this 

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:07.530
 technique is that for the hair 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.300
 long it's a lot faster than 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.209
 press and I am a big one of a 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.340
 patient so that drunk me completely 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.330
 if I want to make a nice hairstyle 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.150
 I know I have to have time in 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.069
 done with the braids while that's it 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.420
 a good hairstyle by putting the alarm clock 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.799
 ten minutes earlier we can do it 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.709
 to go to work in the morning I like 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.970
 well a little elastic bah me I 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.379
 will take because on my hair the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.260
 transparent and white era so ca 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.330
 it's a little nasty so here's something 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.440
 found in stores 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.160
 I want supermarkets all the stuff 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.390
 like that hop and so we continue we do 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.390
 that for all he has behind 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.190
 here 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.260
 strikes in front of behind we take the 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.060
 ahead of time so we do not worry and 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.040
 then this is the phase where everything is going 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.770
 to play is the phase where we all 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.110
 the locks so and painted the chemo 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.990
 like that to start the ones that 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.580
 are not plaster there we do not go out badly 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:31.790
 according to the length the thickness of 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:34.880
 hair etc and so we come up and we 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.730
 sting in the middle of the mat and we 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.140
 sinking through things then the first 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.920
 hold there means and then the more that will go 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.810
 better this tree is there for that 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.209
 stay super good I sting in time 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.060
 the elastic there the part is in doing 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.690
 get into the stic like that it gives 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.390
 a little more grip also the same 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.730
 things that she falls and there you see that 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.910
 lease a little for now I do not know 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:05.000
 if you wanted to act like that because 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.640
 that it's the sides and that's the base I 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.750
 will do it in the end never 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.070
 if you want it to be a bit more 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.090
 tight too you can return the 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:16.780
 wick on it even like that so I 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.780
 go to school next door 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.930
 we put all the locks stood up 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.610
 so now it's going to be handy 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.530
 you touch what is not what will 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.960
 what is wrong and will help you and 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:22.660
 correct straight hair group ic 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:25.340
 but it's not very good taste rich man 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.760
 jean sala i want to do it with a 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.360
 little flat stuffing sure and fructi it 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.360
 can be hiding below 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.290
 too happy I feel like it has 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.840
 the air to go then down that I'm the 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.210
 to make it look like 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.660
 ears like that be I put behind 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.860
 ears 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.470
 here it is simpler and the locks of 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.670
 in front of the bottom if it falls well you 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.710
 can leave them to me I find that she 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.790
 does not fall well so I just have with 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.530
 flat pliers 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.180
 the hooked but especially not pull too much 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.860
 for her to keep the facts that I have 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.820
 done at the beginning in kz and removing the 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.680
 wicks of the bar 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.140
 it comes from a little bit a little side 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.200
 blurred the very important to keep the 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.660
 blurred side on lake and kossi 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.260
 behind that we are sure that 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.470
 stay all night 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:27.070
 a priori the move as a genius at all 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.930
 no problem it's super long 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:32.630
 Well, you see it's not so complicated 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:35.000
 to do it's a little bit long especially 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.260
 spices and in the end it's really so 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.820
 you have a little mirror and you can 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.169
 see you it's cool me i do it at the 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.030
 blind in general and I check everything to 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.530
 the end so it's a bit of a luck on 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.030
 two of the times it's ugly but that's it 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.530
 I hope you like it I make you 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.530
 big kisses and thursday reindeer
