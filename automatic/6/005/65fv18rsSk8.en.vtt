00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.580
 measurement 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:22.860
 and here I am 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:27.470
 Joasaph what do we removed the bumper will 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:30.769

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.640
 led taxi 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.640

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.309
 yamaha that's gotta do ordered them 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.920
 rather 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.739
 by reference which will indicate there is a couple 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.769
 plant installation principle well, you'll see that 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.769
 it turned out sticking a pair with 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.190
 so further this one is unscrewed 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.199
 the holder but the problem is that 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.800
 Korean car is not plastic here 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.960

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.320
 I had to take a grinder to cut a piece 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:20.119
 now there is no way back as they say 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.119
 Now we are going to insert here 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.380
 exactly so the second will be all this line 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.659
 and fix on double-sided tape and not 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.659
 we will actually collect recovered 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.670
 the second just see what 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:44.670

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.480

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.870
 pulled out two light bulbs 1 which 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.450
 the turn is not heated along the edge with 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.880
 screwdriver and everything should be necessary to warm up 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.550

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.980
 dismantling further pasted with

 crowned reflector removed them here 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.360
 here where is the glass which 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:02.160
 and here that it is removed 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:08.640
 to make them beautiful 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:11.519
 called to transparent although they do not need 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.379
 so many threads 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.470
 about reflecting I say that if he 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:19.420
 changed it had to pylons bulgarian 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.610
 but now actually a rebel collector 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.660
 the diode line was on a two-way 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:29.739
 Scotch tape is glued more and more often then 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:33.940

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:54.010
 part of the set bumper together 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:56.140
 more conveniently everything here I went thought 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:07.780

 there is no reverse as they say 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:57.509
 when the cat has nothing to do it lies its own 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.509
