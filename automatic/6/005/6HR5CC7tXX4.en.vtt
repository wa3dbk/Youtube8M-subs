brush and I don't really recommend these
paint<00:01:33.180> brushes<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.540> think<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.200> briar<00:01:34.860> did<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
paint brushes I think that briar did a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.590 
paint brushes I think that briar did a
really<00:01:35.369> cheap<00:01:35.700> job<00:01:35.939> with<00:01:36.180> them<00:01:36.360> personally

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
really cheap job with them personally

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.450 
really cheap job with them personally
because<00:01:37.409> whenever<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.770> start<00:01:38.009> painting<00:01:38.220> with

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
because whenever you start painting with

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.249 
because whenever you start painting with
them<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.150> little<00:01:39.390> hairs<00:01:39.630> from<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> brushes

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
them the little hairs from the brushes

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.200 
them the little hairs from the brushes
come<00:01:40.619> off<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.579> they<00:01:41.640> start<00:01:41.909> getting<00:01:42.090> on

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
come off so and they start getting on

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.240 
come off so and they start getting on
your<00:01:42.329> horse<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.320> really<00:01:43.799> recommend<00:01:44.189> that

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
kind of has a gloss to it so

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.250 
kind of has a gloss to it so
your<00:02:13.180> horses<00:02:13.360> look<00:02:13.600> really<00:02:13.870> kind<00:02:14.050> of<00:02:14.110> fake
