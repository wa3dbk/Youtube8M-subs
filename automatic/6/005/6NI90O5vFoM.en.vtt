holla was entrusted with their delivery

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.009 
holla was entrusted with their delivery
I<00:00:21.500> drove<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.740> my<00:00:22.830> hotel<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.630> then<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.779> had<00:00:24.930> to

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
I drove it to my hotel and then I had to

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.450 
I drove it to my hotel and then I had to
take<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.230> out<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.529> my<00:00:25.710> car<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:25.980> had<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.340> bring

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
take it out of my car and had to bring

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.849 
take it out of my car and had to bring
it<00:00:26.580> into<00:00:26.699> my<00:00:26.849> room<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.410> keep<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:28.680> my<00:00:28.800> room

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
it into my room and keep it in my room

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.519 
it into my room and keep it in my room
overnight<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:30.179> make<00:00:30.390> sure<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.840> no<00:00:30.990> one<00:00:31.230> could

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
overnight to make sure that no one could

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.130 
overnight to make sure that no one could
tamper<00:00:32.399> with<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.759> steal<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.420> or<00:00:33.630> whatever<00:00:33.899> it

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
tamper with it steal it or whatever it

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.750 
tamper with it steal it or whatever it
was<00:00:34.200> because<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.250> was<00:00:35.280> classified

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
was because it was classified

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.470 
was because it was classified
confidential<00:00:37.610> it<00:00:38.610> was<00:00:38.730> awesome<00:00:38.820> worth

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
confidential it was awesome worth

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.229 
confidential it was awesome worth
probably<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.989> pretty<00:00:40.140> penny<00:00:40.790> so<00:00:41.790> yeah<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
probably a pretty penny so yeah the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.119 
probably a pretty penny so yeah the
first<00:00:42.450> suit<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.809> delivered<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.200> NASA<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.829> slept

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
first suit I delivered to NASA I slept

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:52.330 
first suit I delivered to NASA I slept
with<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.480> it<00:00:45.480> wasn't<00:00:45.719> very<00:00:45.899> enjoyable

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.870 

almost<00:00:53.210> immediately<00:00:53.540> NASA<00:00:54.410> began<00:00:54.950> to<00:00:55.400> reject

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
almost immediately NASA began to reject

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.390 
almost immediately NASA began to reject
them

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.300 

they<00:00:59.030> were<00:00:59.090> bulky<00:00:59.590> they<00:01:00.590> were<00:01:00.650> tough<00:01:00.980> to<00:01:01.220> move

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
they were bulky they were tough to move

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.730 
they were bulky they were tough to move
around<00:01:01.490> in<00:01:01.940> they<00:01:02.090> were<00:01:02.150> tough<00:01:02.420> to<00:01:02.630> where<00:01:02.870> they

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
around in they were tough to where they

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.640 
around in they were tough to where they
were<00:01:03.800> heavy<00:01:04.130> and<00:01:04.660> so<00:01:05.660> the<00:01:05.960> customer<00:01:06.200> wasn't

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
were heavy and so the customer wasn't

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.710 
were heavy and so the customer wasn't
very<00:01:07.010> happy<00:01:07.310> about<00:01:07.580> them<00:01:07.970> they<00:01:08.090> expected<00:01:08.690> to

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
very happy about them they expected to

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.220 
very happy about them they expected to
see<00:01:08.990> much<00:01:09.710> more<00:01:10.150> progress<00:01:13.450> one<00:01:14.450> of<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.690> tests

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
see much more progress one of the tests

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.680 
see much more progress one of the tests
was<00:01:15.710> in<00:01:15.890> an<00:01:16.010> aircraft<00:01:16.490> that<00:01:16.820> was<00:01:17.240> used<00:01:17.570> to

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
was in an aircraft that was used to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.970 
was in an aircraft that was used to
simulate<00:01:17.990> lunar<00:01:18.470> gravity<00:01:20.590> you<00:01:21.590> had<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:21.860> be

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
simulate lunar gravity you had to be

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.100 
simulate lunar gravity you had to be
able<00:01:22.040> to<00:01:22.190> fall<00:01:22.430> on<00:01:22.640> your<00:01:22.760> back<00:01:23.060> like<00:01:23.630> a<00:01:23.660> turtle

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
able to fall on your back like a turtle

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.260 
able to fall on your back like a turtle
and<00:01:24.410> then<00:01:24.860> successfully<00:01:25.520> get<00:01:25.730> back<00:01:26.030> up

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
and then successfully get back up

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:36.400 
and then successfully get back up
without<00:01:27.170> any<00:01:27.440> assistance

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410

unfortunately the new design space suit

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.250 
unfortunately the new design space suit
wasn't<00:01:39.360> able<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.780> do<00:01:39.960> that

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260 

there<00:01:46.260> are<00:01:46.350> laws<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.770> physics<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.880> say<00:01:48.210> you

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
there are laws of physics that say you

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.400 
there are laws of physics that say you
can't<00:01:48.540> do<00:01:48.780> certain<00:01:49.020> things<00:01:52.070> as<00:01:54.410> the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
to tell us how to build suits and they

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.330 
to tell us how to build suits and they
thought<00:02:07.170> they<00:02:07.290> were<00:02:07.350> helping<00:02:07.530> us<00:02:07.920> but<00:02:08.130> there

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
thought they were helping us but there

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.070 
thought they were helping us but there
was<00:02:08.430> more<00:02:08.460> turmoil<00:02:09.360> involved<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:09.990> this

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
was more turmoil involved in this

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.940 
was more turmoil involved in this

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.920 

here<00:02:23.760> we<00:02:23.880> are<00:02:24.000> trying<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.270> build<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.540> suit<00:02:24.750> that

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
here we are trying to build a suit that

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.930 
here we are trying to build a suit that
the<00:02:25.140> industry<00:02:25.350> would<00:02:25.920> find<00:02:26.160> acceptable<00:02:26.280> and

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
the industry would find acceptable and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.820 
the industry would find acceptable and
it<00:02:27.360> just<00:02:27.840> wasn't<00:02:28.170> working<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.530> was<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.650> very

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
it just wasn't working it was a very

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.690 
it just wasn't working it was a very
poor<00:02:29.190> marriage<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:30.090> just<00:02:30.270> didn't<00:02:30.540> work
