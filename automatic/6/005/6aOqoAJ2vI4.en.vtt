okay<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:54.030> way<00:00:54.210> prism<00:00:54.899> works<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.770> remember

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
okay the way prism works if you remember

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.459 
okay the way prism works if you remember
is<00:00:56.809> we<00:00:57.809> analyze<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.710> pixels<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.609> screen

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
is we analyze the pixels on the screen

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.960 
is we analyze the pixels on the screen
every<00:01:01.469> single<00:01:01.890> frame<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:03.199> change<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.439> color

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
every single frame and change the color

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.289 
every single frame and change the color
and<00:01:06.530> change<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.710> backlight<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.729> at<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.060> same

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
and change the backlight and at the same

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.899 
and change the backlight and at the same
time<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.500> our<00:01:10.650> eye<00:01:10.830> sees<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> city<00:01:11.549> it's

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
time so that our eye sees the city it's

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.950 
time so that our eye sees the city it's
using<00:01:12.360> image<00:01:12.810> processing<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.909> battery<00:01:14.909> life

then how many degrees of differentiation

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.710 
then how many degrees of differentiation
can<00:04:10.900> get<00:04:11.140> from<00:04:11.350> them<00:04:11.590> success<00:04:12.510> whatever<00:04:13.510> your

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
okay so zip it one millimeter image one

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.360 
okay so zip it one millimeter image one
millimeter<00:04:25.060> resolution<00:04:26.220> look<00:04:28.380> it<00:04:29.380> tells<00:04:29.680> it

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
millimeter resolution look it tells it

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.460 
millimeter resolution look it tells it
can<00:04:30.550> tell<00:04:30.760> I<00:04:31.030> just<00:04:31.240> changed<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:31.960> thickness
