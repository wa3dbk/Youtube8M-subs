00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
away from TLC but most of the matches

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.220 
away from TLC but most of the matches
have<00:00:10.260> now<00:00:10.650> been<00:00:10.920> set<00:00:11.460> or<00:00:11.700> implanted<00:00:12.540> for<00:00:12.809> TLC

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
have now been set or implanted for TLC

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.440 
have now been set or implanted for TLC
pretty<00:00:14.130> much<00:00:14.340> they've<00:00:14.519> only<00:00:14.670> announced<00:00:14.969> one<00:00:15.420> I

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
pretty much they've only announced one I

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.410 
pretty much they've only announced one I
think<00:00:15.599> so<00:00:15.990> far<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.770> Big<00:00:17.039> Show<00:00:17.420> vs

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
think so far and that is Big Show vs

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.510 
think so far and that is Big Show vs
sheamus<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.230> Chairs<00:00:19.560> match<00:00:19.859> obviously<00:00:20.130> they

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
sheamus in a Chairs match obviously they

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.070 
sheamus in a Chairs match obviously they
weren't<00:00:20.670> gonna<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.210> know<00:00:21.330> TLC<00:00:21.750> match<00:00:21.930> or

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080

weren't gonna you know TLC match or
anything<00:00:22.350> like<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.560> but<00:00:23.189> i<00:00:23.250> think<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.670> card

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
anything like that but i think the card

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.769 
anything like that but i think the card
is<00:00:24.300> pretty<00:00:24.750> well<00:00:24.990> set<00:00:25.470> as<00:00:25.880> far<00:00:26.880> as<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
is pretty well set as far as the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.740 
is pretty well set as far as the
pay-per-view<00:00:28.080> goes<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.830> here's<00:00:29.130> how<00:00:29.340> now<00:00:30.330> i

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
through the table so there's a huge

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.300 
through the table so there's a huge
chance<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:13.260> match<00:01:13.560> will<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.159> fact

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
chance here that that match will in fact

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.050 
chance here that that match will in fact
be<00:01:14.460> tables<00:01:14.850> match<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.270> then<00:01:15.900> Ryback<00:01:16.729> vs<00:01:17.729> CM

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
be tables match and then Ryback vs CM

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.710 
be tables match and then Ryback vs CM
Punk<00:01:18.450> will<00:01:18.750> end<00:01:18.900> up<00:01:19.080> being<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.530> TLC<00:01:19.830> match<00:01:20.720> you

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
Punk will end up being a TLC match you

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.320 
Punk will end up being a TLC match you
know<00:01:21.869> instead<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.439> tables<00:01:22.799> match<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:23.330> think

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
know instead of a tables match I think

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.859 
know instead of a tables match I think
to<00:01:24.630> me<00:01:25.970> putting<00:01:26.970> Ryback<00:01:27.360> through<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.659> table

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
to me putting Ryback through a table

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.649 
to me putting Ryback through a table
twice<00:01:28.229> from<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.979> three<00:01:29.220> men<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:30.240> sign<00:01:30.630> that

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
twice from the three men is a sign that

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.510 
twice from the three men is a sign that
they<00:01:30.960> should<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.200> competing<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.130> tables

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
they should be competing in a tables

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.340 
they should be competing in a tables
match<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.150> my<00:01:33.329> personal<00:01:33.570> opinion<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.170> want

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
match that is my personal opinion I want

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.170 
match that is my personal opinion I want
to<00:01:34.409> see<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> minute<00:01:34.829> tables<00:01:35.130> match<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:36.000> there

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
to see a minute tables match but there

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.609 
to see a minute tables match but there
would<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.420> little<00:01:36.630> bit<00:01:36.810> more<00:01:36.930> mistake<00:01:37.350> with

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
would be a little bit more mistake with

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.420 
would be a little bit more mistake with
the<00:01:37.740> TLC<00:01:38.070> match<00:01:38.490> between<00:01:39.030> CM<00:01:39.630> Punk<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.430> Ryback

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430
