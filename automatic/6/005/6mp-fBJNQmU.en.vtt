00:00:04.753 --> 00:00:06.567
 We are at the Museum of Modern Art 

00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:10.802
 in front of this little painting by Salvador Dali, which everyone here wants to see. 

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:14.964
 This and Van Gog's "Star Night" are the stars of the museum. 

00:00:14.964 --> 00:00:20.476
 Perhaps it would be interesting to discuss why this picture is so popular. 

00:00:20.476 --> 00:00:24.086
 This is Salvador Dali's "Memory Suspension". 

00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:27.708
 I now understand how people manage to connect with this picture. 

00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:33.872
 Everyone who ever tried to make a rock album was inspired by Dali. 

00:00:33.872 --> 00:00:39.835
 There is also the question, "What exactly am I looking at?", There is a game with reality. 

00:00:39.835 --> 00:00:41.733
 Something like a visual conundrum. 

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:45.636
 Is that why it's so popular? Is that why it's on the cover art? 

00:00:45.636 --> 00:00:50.220
 Because the rational attack is such a tempting idea ... 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:57.872
 Yes, it's a tease for the mind, I like how you define it - an "attack on the rational." 

00:00:57.872 --> 00:01:02.764
 He mentioned album covers, posters, perhaps in a student room, 

00:01:03.183 --> 00:01:07.349
 but the interesting thing is that these artists really took these things seriously. 

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:09.177
 This is Surrealism. 

00:01:09.177 --> 00:01:10.995
 This is a picture of 1931. 

00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:15.373
 Whether a Spanish, indeed a Catalan artist, has just arrived in Paris, 

00:01:15.373 --> 00:01:17.223
 to join the surrealists. 

00:01:17.223 --> 00:01:21.415
 Yes, I suppose it was significant because it was actually the first one, 

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:25.517
 who painted these landscapes of dreams, these attacks on the rational. 

00:01:25.517 --> 00:01:27.310
 We literally go beyond this picture. 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.244
 We enter this deep, open and lonely space. 

00:01:32.244 --> 00:01:34.677
 And this is a very quiet and quiet image. 

00:01:34.677 --> 00:01:36.709
 There is some desert landscape. 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:38.685
 If you ignore the melting clocks, 

00:01:38.685 --> 00:01:45.407
 yes, you can feel that time does not matter in this space. 

00:01:45.407 --> 00:01:48.612
 You can just go and die there and nobody knows. 

00:01:48.612 --> 00:01:52.024
 And the water in the background - no waves in it. 

00:01:52.024 --> 00:01:53.687
 Time seems to have stopped. 

00:01:53.687 --> 00:01:55.030
 There is no movement. 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.565
 There is an intolerable sense of silence. 

00:01:57.565 --> 00:02:04.110
 There is almost no movement and it really seems desert, very hot, time has literally melted. 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.440
 We have this absurd environment, very naturalistic. 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.424
 He spoke a dried tree to the left. 

00:02:15.424 --> 00:02:22.108
 But it grows from something created by man, something geometric - mass. 

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:29.438
 There are also ants that are obviously attracted to a piece of metal, which, however, resembles a piece of meat. 

00:02:29.438 --> 00:02:33.987
 Yes, indeed, I had not noticed. They eat it. 

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.741
 And, of course, the melting clocks. 

00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:41.235
 This is a very interesting, provocative idea because time is something so strict. 

00:02:41.235 --> 00:02:43.816
 Time is something that drives us. 

00:02:43.816 --> 00:02:49.590
 Something that is strongly associated with the industrial culture we live in. 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.830
 And here it meets the environment as we ourselves respond to it. 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.135
 We have this table and nothing else. 

00:02:58.135 --> 00:03:02.570
 And the light - see the way it falls on the rocks in the back. 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.754
 It's like a sunset, but it's past, who cares. 

00:03:05.754 --> 00:03:12.332
 There are some recognizable things, despite all the absurdity of the things we see. 

00:03:12.332 --> 00:03:15.553
 However, there are things artists can recognize. 

00:03:15.553 --> 00:03:22.493
 The rocks in the back, we think, are the rocks on the Catalan coast in northern Spain, where Dali is. 

00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:25.298
 So here we have his childhood maybe. 

00:03:25.298 --> 00:03:37.192
 Some believe that this strange figure is a profile of a human face with very long lashes, with a nose and a tongue ... 

00:03:37.192 --> 00:03:43.082
 Here is Dali's optical illusion. Yes, I thought it was a blanket, but now I see the lashes. 

00:03:43.082 --> 00:03:53.995
 Yes, Does this strange thing - an object might be several others at a time. 

00:03:53.995 --> 00:03:55.767
 It is very convincing sometimes. 

00:03:55.767 --> 00:04:00.914
 Some believe that this is his face, but somehow dreamy, with the guesses of it. 

00:04:00.914 --> 00:04:06.348
 I think that goes into that category of art, which is largely an optical illusion. 

00:04:06.348 --> 00:04:14.274
 Yes, surrealism holds that the rational world in which we believe so much, 

00:04:14.274 --> 00:04:16.441
 may not really deserve all this confidence. 

00:04:16.441 --> 00:04:18.998
 Irrational is just as important. 

00:04:18.998 --> 00:04:24.332
 But we have tried to suppress it, to remove it from our lives. 

00:04:24.332 --> 00:04:30.339
 Some of these artists thought they could bring us back into the world of dreams. 

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:35.030
 Some of them have read Freud, some have only heard of him from others. 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.173
 But the idea that sleep is the place where the irrational mind can manifest without limitations ... 

00:04:41.173 --> 00:04:43.955
 This is something I often encounter. 

00:04:43.955 --> 00:04:50.460
 Even the way we perceive what we call an objective reality depends on how our brain is tuned. 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.945
 We see what creates an effect, we see time linearly. 

00:04:53.945 --> 00:04:55.607
 This is the way people are tuned. 

00:04:55.607 --> 00:04:57.662
 I think this is interesting for such things. 

00:04:57.662 --> 00:05:04.156
 You say that there are different forms of reality, and we, like creatures that are set in one way, 

00:05:04.156 --> 00:05:07.542
 discuss it as real or unreal. 

00:05:07.542 --> 00:05:15.071
 People have seen this picture and tried to link it to Einstein's early ideas ... 

00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:17.417
 About time distortion? 

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:20.239
 Yes that time is not really a concept. 

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:26.789
 But I think he'd rather ponder the ideas of a philosopher named Bergson. 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:34.289
 Bergson considered the time not as something that was recorded by a clock but believed that there was also a more subjective time. 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:39.453
 A time that is shortened according to our experiences. 

00:05:39.453 --> 00:05:43.854
 Time is something that sometimes scares us because we do not understand it at all, 

00:05:43.854 --> 00:05:46.931
 and it is an integral part of our existence. 

00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:54.051
 We try to measure, limit or define it in a way that is logical for us. 

00:05:54.051 --> 00:05:58.167
 In fact, maybe it's trying to make this picture too. 

00:05:58.167 --> 00:06:00.286
 Perhaps the clocks are stupid. 

00:06:00.286 --> 00:06:06.612
 They are just our attempt to label something and measure it. 

00:06:06.612 --> 00:06:09.290
 We understand it, but not really. 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.323
 Here are all ideas of objectivity. 

00:06:13.323 --> 00:06:18.213
 We see an art that confronts these ideas in a very interesting way.
