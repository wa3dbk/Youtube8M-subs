psychosis I believe there's some

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.390 
psychosis I believe there's some
psychiatrists<00:01:05.470> are<00:01:05.560> not<00:01:05.770> necessarily

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
but as far as I can tell this is one of

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.700 
but as far as I can tell this is one of
the<00:01:14.079> reasons<00:01:14.439> as<00:01:14.740> to<00:01:14.799> why<00:01:14.950> I<00:01:15.609> had<00:01:16.119> this

the<00:02:54.630> most<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.990> delusions<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.800> have<00:02:56.040> which

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
the most the delusions that I have which

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.400 
the most the delusions that I have which
I<00:02:57.420> think<00:02:58.880> are<00:02:59.880> an<00:03:00.330> extension<00:03:01.970> because

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
I think are an extension because

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.040 
I think are an extension because
whenever<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.680> become<00:03:05.040> depressed<00:03:05.490> before<00:03:06.450> I

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
whenever I become depressed before I

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.920 
whenever I become depressed before I
become<00:03:07.620> psychotic<00:03:08.959> what<00:03:09.959> tends<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.290> happen<00:03:10.380> is

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
become psychotic what tends to happen is

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.000 
become psychotic what tends to happen is
I'll<00:03:12.930> get<00:03:13.230> quite<00:03:13.580> dissociated<00:03:14.840> quite

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
I'll get quite dissociated quite

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.300 
I'll get quite dissociated quite
depersonalized

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
depersonalized

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.000 
depersonalized
and<00:03:19.610> if<00:03:20.610> you<00:03:20.820> think<00:03:21.060> about<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.620> it's<00:03:22.620> only<00:03:22.890> a

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
and if you think about that it's only a

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.150 
and if you think about that it's only a
hop<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.400> skip<00:03:24.110> really<00:03:25.110> I<00:03:26.450> think<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:28.440> the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
hop and a skip really I think the the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.870 
hop and a skip really I think the the
depersonalization<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:31.100> dissociation<00:03:32.100> are

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
depersonalization a dissociation are

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.900 
depersonalization a dissociation are
probably<00:03:33.360> more<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:34.320> do<00:03:34.500> with<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.370> portal<00:03:35.790> and

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
probably more to do with the portal and

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.330 
probably more to do with the portal and
aspects<00:03:36.540> there<00:03:37.320> is<00:03:37.470> an<00:03:37.590> overlap<00:03:38.010> there<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.370> a

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
aspects there is an overlap there is a

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.080 
aspects there is an overlap there is a
they<00:03:41.340> tend<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.670> bounce<00:03:42.660> off<00:03:42.959> each<00:03:43.140> other

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
which goes into in-depth more about the

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.390 
which goes into in-depth more about the

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
that is the case how did those features

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.320 
that is the case how did those features
manifest<00:05:05.410> in<00:05:05.650> you<00:05:08.190> perhaps<00:05:09.190> we<00:05:09.460> can<00:05:09.520> start<00:05:09.970> to

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
manifest in you perhaps we can start to

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.050 
manifest in you perhaps we can start to
find<00:05:10.720> out<00:05:10.870> if<00:05:10.990> there<00:05:11.199> are<00:05:12.060> any<00:05:13.710> correlations

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
find out if there are any correlations

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.020 
find out if there are any correlations
perhaps<00:05:16.060> with<00:05:17.460> psychotic<00:05:18.460> depressive
