now<00:00:21.539> our<00:00:21.720> truck<00:00:22.020> has<00:00:22.230> had<00:00:22.260> some<00:00:22.650> modifications

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
now our truck has had some modifications

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.099 
now our truck has had some modifications
so<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.760> removal<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.330> grill<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.750> different

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
so the removal of the grill is different

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.670 
so the removal of the grill is different
than<00:00:25.199> normal<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:26.099> we<00:00:26.130> will<00:00:26.550> not<00:00:26.760> be<00:00:26.910> showing<00:00:27.180> it

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
than normal so we will not be showing it

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.870 
than normal so we will not be showing it
with<00:00:28.680> our<00:00:28.859> grille<00:00:29.099> out<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.460> way

our cooler is secured and we're ready to
run<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> line<00:01:21.540> going<00:01:22.530> around<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.040> radiator

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
run the line going around the radiator

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.460 
run the line going around the radiator
we'll<00:01:23.640> pass<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.970> line<00:01:24.150> through<00:01:24.570> here<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
we'll pass the line through here to the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.270 
we'll pass the line through here to the
factory<00:01:25.860> cooler<00:01:27.950> next<00:01:28.950> we'll<00:01:29.100> need<00:01:29.130> to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
factory cooler next we'll need to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.340 
factory cooler next we'll need to
identify<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.909> downstream<00:01:30.570> transmission

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
identify the downstream transmission

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.440 
identify the downstream transmission
line<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.549> line<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
the line that feels cooler is the one

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.090 
the line that feels cooler is the one
we'll<00:01:49.240> be<00:01:49.270> installing<00:01:49.720> our<00:01:49.900> new<00:01:49.960> cooler<00:01:50.530> into
