00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.300
 and Nissan Frontier 2015 the frontier is a 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.130
 average size peak whose main 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.870
 feature is its versatility 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.750
 according to the lifestyle of each 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.119
 user fits perfectly both 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.520
 for recreational use as for the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.070
 work unlike the models that 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.800
 they precede us this new generation possesses 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.560
 a more modern design its forms 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.900
 they print an aggressive and sporty look 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.140
 The time is a direct rival of products 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.940
 like the ford rangers the toyota tacoma and 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.940
 the red chevrolet 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.820
 the new frontier or np300 is produced in 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.700
 the civac plant in morelos a model 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.309
 most proudly made in mexico and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.289
 specifically in this plant since the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.160
 production history of vans in 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.730
 civac dates from 1976 with the datsun 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.590
 520 bloomberg for the realization of the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.530
 sixth generation of this model in 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.290
 mexico nissan invested more than 1100 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.430
 million pesos to adapt the line 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.280
 of assembly according to the new 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.820
 of quality and processes that required 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.700
 np300 what also meant the 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.650
 creation of 700 new direct jobs 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.170
 in the plant one of the main 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.140
 virtues of the frontier has been his 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.970
 ability to endure abuse 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.119
 battered streets and any road 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.430
 wild does not seem to bother him 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.520
 otherwise it seems to be their natural habitat 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.260
 my name is gabriel rivers and I 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.600
 I want to present the advantages and benefits 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.149
 of the new social investment walk 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.110
 2016 we mainly incorporated a 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.360
 25 engine 2.5 - liter that provides 158 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.100
 horsepower and 170 pound foot of 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.110
 torque we also incorporate a 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.490
 6-speed manual transmission that 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.890
 together an engine and transmission 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.690
 being more sufficient we can have a 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.430
 better fuel efficiency the np 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.770
 300 does not have a new one 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.300
 suspension is a multilingual suspension 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.910
 in five arms with that is with axis 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.100
 rigid that also and the bands that this 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.960
 allows you is that the occupants 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.940
 driver passengers and occupants who 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.899
 serve in the back bench will have a 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.970
 better fortune 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.920
 Another strong point we have is that the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.379
 loading surface we are incorporating 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.299
 a bed line the advantages that you are 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.819
 trainer has mainly is will give you 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:24.010
 a better appearance number 2 has you 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.129
 allows a ease of cleaning and 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.620
 point number 3 that also allows you 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.209
 avoid scratches damage to the surface of 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.650
 the load for any load that you 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.420
 next you want to register 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.159
 incorporates the strengths that 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.319
 I want to stand out in the inner part of the 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.540
 vehicle is that we have an audio 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.940
 5 inch color display that have 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.549
 diverse applications we have a 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.190
 screen here and question in the part 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.500
 internal board you have the consumption of 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.690
 fuel you have travel autonomy 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.609
 and many other things and 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.389
