snow-peak can't find the lid separately

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.910 
snow-peak can't find the lid separately
so<00:01:26.759> I'm<00:01:26.970> gonna<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.420> ignore<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.380> but<00:01:28.860> it

middle for their press now their press

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.460 
middle for their press now their press
separates<00:01:40.880> down<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.180> length<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:43.170> this

length and then screws into the bottom

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.530 
length and then screws into the bottom
here<00:01:45.899> what<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.740> discovered<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:49.310> their<00:01:50.310> press<00:01:50.640> if

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
here what I discovered is their press if

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.710 
here what I discovered is their press if
you<00:01:51.689> hold<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.020> up<00:01:52.140> straight<00:01:52.799> up<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.100> down<00:01:53.720> it's

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
you hold it up straight up and down it's

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.240 
you hold it up straight up and down it's
perfectly<00:01:55.229> nice<00:01:55.500> no<00:01:55.680> peek<00:01:55.890> 700<00:01:56.490> now<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.509> also

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
perfectly nice no peek 700 now it also

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.749 
perfectly nice no peek 700 now it also
fits<00:01:59.250> perfectly<00:01:59.729> in<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.990> optimists<00:02:01.950> crux<00:02:02.340> it

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
fits perfectly in the optimists crux it

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.929 
fits perfectly in the optimists crux it
has<00:02:03.180> these<00:02:03.360> little<00:02:03.649> cut<00:02:04.649> away<00:02:04.890> plastic<00:02:05.460> fins
