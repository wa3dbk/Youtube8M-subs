00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
either side on the sides so if you want

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.820 
either side on the sides so if you want
to<00:02:15.970> keep<00:02:16.090> your<00:02:16.270> wig<00:02:16.450> secure<00:02:16.960> you're<00:02:17.230> going<00:02:17.650> to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.760 
have to use bobby pins or something like
that<00:02:21.000> but<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.240> do<00:02:22.300> like<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.720> fact<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.290> does

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
that but I do like the fact that it does

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.960 
that but I do like the fact that it does
have<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.690> dark<00:02:25.990> root<00:02:26.320> on<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.130> edges<00:02:27.670> all

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.200 
the way down on the side because a lot
of<00:02:29.560> wigs<00:02:29.830> don't<00:02:30.190> have<00:02:30.490> that<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:30.790> only<00:02:30.970> like

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
of wigs don't have that is only like

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.360 
of wigs don't have that is only like
right<00:02:31.420> in<00:02:31.570> this<00:02:31.780> part<00:02:32.080> right<00:02:32.200> here<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:33.070> like<00:02:33.220> if

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
right in this part right here so like if

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.670 
right in this part right here so like if
the<00:02:33.490> wind<00:02:33.670> blows<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.540> see<00:02:34.810> it's<00:02:35.410> not

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
the wind blows and you see it's not

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.070 
the wind blows and you see it's not
matching<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:36.370> you'd<00:02:36.490> have<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.820> take<00:02:37.510> something

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
matching so you'd have to take something

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.190 
matching so you'd have to take something
like<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.880> marker<00:02:39.880> or<00:02:39.910> some<00:02:40.180> makeup<00:02:40.600> eye<00:02:40.870> shadow

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
like a marker or some makeup eye shadow

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.199 
like a marker or some makeup eye shadow
something<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:41.800> try<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.010> match<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.340> but

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
something to try to match that but

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.240 
something to try to match that but
that's<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.540> inside<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:43.990> the<00:02:44.080> cab<00:02:45.420> okay<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:47.250> see

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
know I like it but one thing I don't

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.260 
know I like it but one thing I don't
like<00:04:50.450> about<00:04:50.600> it<00:04:51.430> is<00:04:52.430> that<00:04:52.669> let<00:04:52.790> me<00:04:52.880> get<00:04:53.030> down<00:04:53.150> so

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
like about it is that let me get down so

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.930 
like about it is that let me get down so
you<00:04:53.360> can<00:04:53.480> see<00:04:53.630> a<00:04:53.660> little<00:04:53.840> bit<00:04:54.020> it<00:04:54.830> has<00:04:55.190> like

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
you can see a little bit it has like

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.909 
you can see a little bit it has like
this<00:04:56.240> kind<00:04:56.750> of<00:04:56.780> like<00:04:56.930> a<00:04:56.960> little<00:04:57.320> bit<00:04:57.440> of<00:04:57.470> a<00:04:57.620> hump

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
this kind of like a little bit of a hump

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.130 
this kind of like a little bit of a hump
and<00:04:58.250> I<00:04:58.910> guess<00:04:59.120> like<00:04:59.300> if<00:04:59.540> you<00:04:59.630> turn<00:04:59.840> the<00:04:59.990> wig

and I guess like if you turn the wig

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.750 
and I guess like if you turn the wig
inside<00:05:00.560> out<00:05:00.740> it<00:05:00.890> would<00:05:00.980> kind<00:05:01.340> of<00:05:01.400> get<00:05:01.550> rid<00:05:01.730> of

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
inside out it would kind of get rid of

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.520 
inside out it would kind of get rid of
that<00:05:01.850> a<00:05:01.970> little<00:05:02.300> bit<00:05:02.450> but<00:05:02.750> it<00:05:03.020> does<00:05:03.260> have<00:05:03.500> a
