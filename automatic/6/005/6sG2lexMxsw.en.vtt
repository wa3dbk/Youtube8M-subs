00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.040
 Welcome to gaigg that 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.120
 worst game of all time now 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.390
 maybe heard 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.869
 from the year 1982 good in the desert 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.180
 from new mexico shows up 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.920
 dug up and what's up with it 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.390
 has and how bad play really 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.059
 that is what we are showing you now in the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:36.300
 rest the episode so looks in the year 1982 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:39.239
 no menu definitely not so too 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.780
 all work is through 0 one would be 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.739
 plays or you play me 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.510
 we would not like to play but so 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.969
 a channel for which we record videos 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:55.059
 therefore trust would be timely 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:57.019
 yes what you see here with the 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.829
 spaceship looks more like a 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.210
 we have arrived 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.769
 9999 steps we are allowed to go 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.899
 they disappear as soon as you leave 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.520
 before we start with anything 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:16.220
 first of all this fantastic 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:17.869
 Sound effects on there we see that 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.280
 explain element of this game and in 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.420
 holes fall the target is that 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.250
 Silva needs three parts of one 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.110
 Interstellar phone get the in 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.789
 These holes are yes, I have them yes 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.659
 maybe the movie with him after 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.710
 home phone accurately and though 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.149
 with the phone can then go home 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.190
 phoning and the people you call 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.310
 just saw that the evil fbi 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.569
 agent and the mosel scientist the 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.979
 a deter and eleven 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.630
 cloud a part of it and this 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:49.130
 scientist who looks like one 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.149
 African construction workers down there too 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.600
 always that should be 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.820
 who comes in and leads one 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.390
 research because they do not like that 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.560
 but a Roman villa above 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.149
 stood you can you briefly to 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.969
 peculiar let me now of the 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.989
 case should somehow something yes 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:11.000
 and now we are in the antique 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:12.049
 Ancient Greece and now I can 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.120
 here, in principle, go away again 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:17.359
 even if i have that fbi fun too 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.079
 Could you also get these little pixels 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.720
 to collect there 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.760
 there are good ones for the one group h 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.260
 and a question mark and i believe if 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.859
 I now fall into this hole then 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.420
 nothing comes 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:28.340
 perhaps because but including 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.160
 be aware of the free sign if you 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.120
 Press marks 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.880
 here are actually a part of the phone 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.130
 1 of 3 does not sound like it at all 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.480
 a lot if you have these three days then 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.800
 you can go back to the elevator 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.800
 drive up and is and again at 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.580
 his homies in the universe away from the 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.530
 bad people 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.180
 but for that we have to get out of the first 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.290
 hole out exactly that is actually the 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.150
 main difficulty of which at the latest 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.830
 now come out in holes as in 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.710
 real life is a bit like being with 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.880
 depressions 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.710
 if you are at a hole you come 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.860
 Do not hold out but still 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.740
 Once done then again 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.870
 all good until the next hole so 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.540
 I'm a bit scared 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.820
 to be seen in the cut because of it 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.090
 simply no music works otherwise 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:19.630
 the music overcomes that 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.850
 What we say is so sad is yes 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.160
 not even what you get there you see 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.300
 it clearly because that has a penis 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.870
 stay understand once 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.790
 look that is a change penis very much 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.870
 had nice quite loose behind inside 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.760
 still be very calm 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.810
 And yes, that was our car 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.490
 that maybe noticed that the 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.080
 Kartage that it in houston again 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.900
 but at that time 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.520
 so in 1982 as the movie very much 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.230
 has been successful in cinemas 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.780
 Atari, of course, secured the right and 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.130
 thought horny here a killing made you 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.450
 really much coal in the one video game 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.490
 Eso also brings out this 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.230
 At that time, video games were even the first 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:02.560
 drilling phase just above the first popular 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.930
 phase and of course thought 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.220
 then make the game then too 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.600
 we said okay that has to be christmas 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.950
 be done that we still half too 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.800
 take away and that all your children 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.360
 give and so that was unfortunately so that 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.709
 Christmas was only five weeks away 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.660
 accordingly, they do not have that much 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.100
 time the game to design and notices 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.230
 then you play the game very much 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.560
 yes in any case it was in the course of 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.840
 nevertheless very successful and 15 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.550
 sold 15 million sold her 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.200
 you have to imagine this game that 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.160
 has me like an app today 79 cents 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.620
 actually cost 50 dollars 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.930
 that has a normal full-price game so 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.729
 Look for these three parts and then 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.960
 the complete toys away again the 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.990
 not through the tutorial or now 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.910
 but the whole game but you see so 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.740
 already it actually as something previously 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.060
 never actually played that 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.250
 I just do not want to be 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.260
 pro gamer actually designate 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.580
 Not too bad , that is 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.950
 not just so it just one 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.539
 playable just as bad too, so ne 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.180
 because you can see next to the hole but 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:03.310
 Nevertheless, he is exactly in and it is 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.710
 So sometimes everything does not work 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.360
 now for the second time is coming again 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.250
 for this track you will be charging 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.950
 has collected another 1500 give me 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.560
 steps and how did it continue? 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.390
 Christmas Atari was completely 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.490
 become megalomaniacal and has 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.720
 somehow 34 million far reaching 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.220
 she was playing this game 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.110
 Of course, that gf thought like 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.280
 cut bread away this classic 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.169
 the modern entertainment 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.490
 Unfortunately, it has also as a 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.110
 a little bit talked about the game 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.550
 complete garbage is and attacks as well 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.580
 somehow great competition get like that 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.210
 slow with sensible play 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.669
 accordingly, they are the whole 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.640
 to stay world and what do you do when 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:43.060
 get four million copies of eto 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.410
 call all the advantages what do you do 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.710
 if you have four million copies of 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.180
 the game has 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.500
 I would definitely in New Mexico in 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.919
 bury the desert what would you do 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.940
 do 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:55.160
 has its four million games from the 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.350
 I can tell you one thing one thing can do 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.960
 I recommend you play is not 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.900
 not a single game no part of it and 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:06.130
 as another phone 32 I come 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.130
 let that be closer 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.220
 And it's exactly these players you have now 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.330
 recently rediscovered along with 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.280
 a few consoles not synonymous 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.220
 have been sold and the implementation 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.700
 from pacman at that time which certainly 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.930
 topspiel but technically completely in 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.570
 sand set and therefore it has too 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.280
 somehow or not good 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:29.000
 sold and just everything in trash 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.430
 has thrown and 0 later he lies 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.250
 comes back he again pour 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.860
 for you no that was game over 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:41.910
 and what's so good about you? 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:43.410
 would the concord exchange 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.270
 yes that was more or less the whole 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.760
 play what you said now that 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.430
 quite clever the darkest of the darkest 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.470
 darkest darkest the darkest hour 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.420
 from gamepro we already have many 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.050
 things played kevin james next 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.690
 topmodel 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.690
 yes that was not good but that 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.280
 Completely finished say we see it 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.500
 but friday at travelport 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.880
 accordingly, please do not play that 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.340
 funny behind it is to the people there 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.780
 Out of grief why is it called ? 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.400
 simply are things let the yet 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.930
 simply the program has had one 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.760
 reason that you buried again 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:21.890
 let it just let it rest 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.890
 It's good to rest dead
