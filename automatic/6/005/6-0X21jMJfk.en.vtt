 special mesh bow do not use all 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.670
 equal burn try evenly

 distribute the kebab on a skewer so 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.790
 to make it the same everywhere 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.370

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.930
 leave gaps between the pieces so 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.850
 it will be more juicy but not 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.010

 pieces require a different temperature and 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.150
 different degree of roasting than thinner ones 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.780
