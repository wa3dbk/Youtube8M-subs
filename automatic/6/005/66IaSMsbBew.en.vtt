00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
remind me away big too much that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.789 
remind me away big too much that
combined<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.520> weird<00:01:09.140> weird<00:01:10.140> way<00:01:10.590> his

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
combined with the weird weird way his

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.020 
combined with the weird weird way his
neck<00:01:11.520> looks<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.780> very<00:01:12.990> off-putting<00:01:13.229> I

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
neck looks this is very off-putting I

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.490 
neck looks this is very off-putting I
mean<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.630> see<00:01:15.840> how<00:01:16.110> much<00:01:16.140> he

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
mean you can just see how much he

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.440 
mean you can just see how much he
doesn't<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:17.100> way<00:01:17.250> big<00:01:17.430> when<00:01:17.610> compared<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.090> do

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
doesn't like way big when compared to do

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.859 
doesn't like way big when compared to do
he<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.810> $5<00:01:19.710> more<00:01:20.040> counterpart<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.880> uh<00:01:21.030> way

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
he is a $5 more counterpart of uh way

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.080 
he is a $5 more counterpart of uh way
big<00:01:22.140> oh<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.159> gonna<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> problem<00:01:23.790> isn't

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
big oh this is gonna be a problem isn't

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.440 
big oh this is gonna be a problem isn't
it

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
it

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.469 
it
ok<00:01:24.750> let's<00:01:25.200> fix<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.790> there<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:27.000> go<00:01:27.180> that's

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
ok let's fix that there we go that's

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.929 
ok let's fix that there we go that's
much<00:01:27.869> more<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.189> can<00:01:29.369> see<00:01:29.579> if<00:01:29.790> you

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
much more like it and you can see if you

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.179 
much more like it and you can see if you
look<00:01:29.970> side<00:01:30.659> by<00:01:30.869> side<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> way<00:01:31.650> bigs<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
look side by side with the way bigs a

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.700 
look side by side with the way bigs a
much<00:01:32.850> less<00:01:33.329> accurate<00:01:33.900> compared<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> other

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
much less accurate compared to the other

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.300 
much less accurate compared to the other
figures<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.579> line<00:01:35.790> anyway<00:01:37.310> unfortunately

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
figures in the line anyway unfortunately

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.090 
figures in the line anyway unfortunately
way<00:01:38.700> big<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.409> least<00:01:40.770> accurate

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
way big is one of the least accurate

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.289 
way big is one of the least accurate
figures<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.240> line<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:44.070> me<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.970> is

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
figures in the line and to me that is

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.630 
figures in the line and to me that is
probably<00:01:45.329> his<00:01:46.290> downfall<00:01:46.560> went<00:01:47.280> for<00:01:47.460> five

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
probably his downfall went for five

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.880 
probably his downfall went for five
dollars<00:01:47.850> more<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:48.869> get<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> much<00:01:49.439> more

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
dollars more you can get a much more

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.580 
dollars more you can get a much more
accurate<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.700> much<00:01:50.790> more<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.420> scale<00:01:51.930> way<00:01:52.320> big

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
accurate and much more in scale way big

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.100 
accurate and much more in scale way big
I<00:01:52.890> don't<00:01:53.790> really<00:01:54.060> see<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.540> point<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.930> picking

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
I don't really see the point of picking

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.959 
I don't really see the point of picking
up<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.560> guy<00:01:55.740> anyway<00:01:56.610> thank<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.909> for
