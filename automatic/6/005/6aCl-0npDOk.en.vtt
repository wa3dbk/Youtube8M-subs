on top and I'm going to cover it now and

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.460 
on top and I'm going to cover it now and
let<00:04:43.950> it<00:04:43.980> rise<00:04:44.280> for<00:04:44.760> about<00:04:45.510> an<00:04:45.840> hour<00:04:45.990> or<00:04:46.380> a

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
let it rise for about an hour or a

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.520 
let it rise for about an hour or a
little<00:04:47.160> bit<00:04:47.340> less<00:04:47.580> in<00:04:48.000> a<00:04:48.150> more<00:04:48.390> in<00:04:48.510> place<00:04:48.840> until

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
little bit less in a more in place until

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.220 
little bit less in a more in place until
it<00:04:49.920> doubles<00:04:50.160> its<00:04:50.610> size<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:51.300> then<00:04:51.900> we<00:04:52.050> can

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
it doubles its size and then we can

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.790 
it doubles its size and then we can
continue<00:04:52.770> working<00:04:53.310> with<00:04:53.520> it
