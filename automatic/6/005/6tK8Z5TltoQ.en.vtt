last<00:02:02.160> year<00:02:02.400> we<00:02:02.490> got<00:02:02.640> used<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.940> Julio<00:02:03.360> stays<00:02:03.630> are

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
last year we got used to Julio stays are

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.280 
last year we got used to Julio stays are
in<00:02:03.990> there

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
in there

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.499 
in there
Julio<00:02:05.280> brought<00:02:05.610> some<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.180> things<00:02:06.420> that

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
Julio brought some of the things that

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.350 
Julio brought some of the things that
URI<00:02:06.780> doesn't<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:08.280> URI<00:02:08.520> brings<00:02:08.850> a<00:02:09.060> lot<00:02:09.209> of

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
URI doesn't have but URI brings a lot of

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.290 
URI doesn't have but URI brings a lot of
stuff<00:02:09.570> that<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.929> Julio<00:02:10.410> didn't<00:02:10.649> have<00:02:10.830> so

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
stuff that that Julio didn't have so

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.030 
stuff that that Julio didn't have so
it's<00:02:12.300> going<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.570> be<00:02:12.660> different<00:02:13.050> but<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.560> think

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
it's going to be different but I think

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.160 
it's going to be different but I think
once<00:02:14.250> we<00:02:14.310> get<00:02:14.489> used<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.820> it<00:02:15.030> we're<00:02:15.510> gonna<00:02:15.630> be<00:02:15.870> an

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
once we get used to it we're gonna be an

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:25.160 
once we get used to it we're gonna be an
even<00:02:16.800> better<00:02:17.010> team<00:02:17.330> possession<00:02:18.330> wise<00:02:24.050> he<00:02:25.050> had

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
even better team possession wise he had

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.780 
even better team possession wise he had
