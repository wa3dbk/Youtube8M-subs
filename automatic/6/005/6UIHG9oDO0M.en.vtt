works<00:01:56.979> so<00:01:57.520> I'm<00:01:57.790> going<00:01:58.120> to<00:01:58.150> cut<00:01:58.479> off<00:01:58.690> the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
works so I'm going to cut off the

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.830 
works so I'm going to cut off the
sleeves<00:01:59.229> and<00:01:59.440> I'm<00:01:59.500> going<00:01:59.830> to<00:01:59.860> start<00:02:00.280> about<00:02:00.840> two

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
sleeves and I'm going to start about two

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.010 
sleeves and I'm going to start about two
inches<00:02:02.470> down<00:02:03.010> from<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.670> seam<00:02:03.970> and<00:02:04.300> as<00:02:04.450> I<00:02:04.750> cut

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
inches down from the seam and as I cut

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.880 
inches down from the seam and as I cut
up<00:02:05.200> I'm<00:02:05.590> going<00:02:05.979> to<00:02:06.100> cut<00:02:06.490> toward<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:08.320> seam<00:02:08.619> if

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
up I'm going to cut toward the seam if

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.160 
up I'm going to cut toward the seam if
that<00:02:09.429> makes<00:02:09.759> any<00:02:10.320> sense<00:02:11.320> at<00:02:12.130> all<00:02:12.780> but<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.990> will

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
that makes any sense at all but I will

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.650 
that makes any sense at all but I will
show<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:14.470> here<00:02:14.800> in<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.980> second

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
show you here in a second

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.280

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
chop-chop-chop-chop see from the bottom

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.620

I<00:02:20.590> cut<00:02:21.010> down<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.700> then<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:21.940> can<00:02:22.090> tell<00:02:22.360> where<00:02:22.600> I

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
I cut down and then you can tell where I

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.090 
I cut down and then you can tell where I
cut<00:02:23.200> slowly<00:02:23.680> up<00:02:24.420> towards<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:26.080> shoulder<00:02:26.770> seam

I<00:02:27.370> hope<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.880> makes<00:02:28.060> sense<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:28.630> I'm<00:02:28.750> just

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
I hope that makes sense and I'm just

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.060 
I hope that makes sense and I'm just
going<00:02:28.989> to<00:02:29.020> do<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.560> same<00:02:29.800> on<00:02:29.950> the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
going to do that to the same on the

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.390 
going to do that to the same on the
other<00:02:30.100> side<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:31.030> then<00:02:31.930> I'm<00:02:32.050> going<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.380> tug<00:02:32.980> at

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
other side and then I'm going to tug at

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.070 
other side and then I'm going to tug at
it<00:02:33.550> so<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:34.680> doesn't<00:02:35.680> look<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.880> know<00:02:37.060> so<00:02:37.690> like

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
it so it doesn't look you know so like

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.600 
it so it doesn't look you know so like
what<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.620> took<00:02:38.800> scissors<00:02:39.130> to<00:02:39.220> that<00:02:39.370> didn't

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
top and I'm going to cut straight across

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.580 
top and I'm going to cut straight across
and<00:03:51.239> then<00:03:52.239> so<00:03:52.780> far<00:03:52.989> it'll<00:03:53.230> look<00:03:53.320> something

I mean tank top and now at the bottom
I'm<00:03:59.320> going<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.650> start<00:03:59.949> cutting

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
I'm going to start cutting

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.100 
I'm going to start cutting
fringe<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.250> these<00:04:01.520> will<00:04:01.670> be<00:04:01.700> about<00:04:02.000> three<00:04:02.540> to

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
fringe and these will be about three to

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.020 
fringe and these will be about three to
four<00:04:03.320> inches<00:04:03.560> long<00:04:03.800> and<00:04:04.040> about<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.310> half<00:04:04.790> an

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
inch wide and the bottom should look

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.180 
inch wide and the bottom should look
something<00:04:09.140> like<00:04:09.200> this<00:04:09.470> once<00:04:09.740> you've<00:04:09.890> chopped

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
something like this once you've chopped

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.000 
something like this once you've chopped
it<00:04:10.340> all<00:04:10.460> up<00:04:10.700> and<00:04:11.000> now<00:04:11.810> I'm<00:04:12.080> going<00:04:12.350> to<00:04:12.470> pull<00:04:12.740> on

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
it all up and now I'm going to pull on

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.610 
it all up and now I'm going to pull on
them<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.490> make<00:04:13.700> them<00:04:13.760> longer<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.390> it<00:04:15.080> gives<00:04:15.380> me

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
them to make them longer and it gives me

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.699 
them to make them longer and it gives me
something<00:04:15.950> to<00:04:16.430> work<00:04:16.850> with<00:04:17.200> so<00:04:18.200> now<00:04:18.410> I'm<00:04:18.530> going

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
something to work with so now I'm going

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.060 
something to work with so now I'm going
to<00:04:18.859> take<00:04:19.160> the<00:04:19.940> two<00:04:20.299> pieces<00:04:21.170> and<00:04:21.709> I'm<00:04:21.769> going<00:04:22.040> to

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
to take the two pieces and I'm going to

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.520 
to take the two pieces and I'm going to
tie<00:04:22.430> them<00:04:22.730> together<00:04:22.940> once<00:04:23.360> and<00:04:24.080> tie<00:04:24.320> them

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
tie them together once and tie them

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.710 
tie them together once and tie them
together<00:04:24.740> a<00:04:24.980> second<00:04:25.580> time<00:04:25.790> and<00:04:26.060> pull<00:04:26.390> to

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
together a second time and pull to

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.960 
together a second time and pull to
really<00:04:27.170> make<00:04:27.350> sure<00:04:27.620> it<00:04:27.740> stays<00:04:28.010> in<00:04:28.040> place<00:04:28.520> and

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
really make sure it stays in place and

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.940 
really make sure it stays in place and
I'm<00:04:29.870> just<00:04:29.930> going<00:04:30.230> to<00:04:30.320> repeat<00:04:30.650> this<00:04:30.830> process

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
I'm just going to repeat this process

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.570 
I'm just going to repeat this process
along<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:32.270> whole<00:04:32.660> entire<00:04:33.700> fringe<00:04:34.700> bottom

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
along the whole entire fringe bottom

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.820 
along the whole entire fringe bottom
pineapple<00:04:37.580> bottom<00:04:38.000> ok<00:04:38.930> so<00:04:39.260> then<00:04:39.410> the<00:04:39.530> bottom

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
pineapple bottom ok so then the bottom

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.070 
pineapple bottom ok so then the bottom
knots<00:04:40.160> will<00:04:40.430> look<00:04:40.580> something<00:04:40.880> like<00:04:41.060> this<00:04:41.540> and

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
knots will look something like this and

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.750 
knots will look something like this and
then<00:04:42.890> when<00:04:43.040> you're<00:04:43.160> all<00:04:43.190> done<00:04:43.400> it'll<00:04:43.610> look

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
then when you're all done it'll look

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.100 
then when you're all done it'll look
like<00:04:43.910> that<00:04:43.970> and<00:04:44.450> you<00:04:44.540> could<00:04:44.660> either<00:04:44.780> leave<00:04:45.050> it

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
like that and you could either leave it

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.140 
like that and you could either leave it
like<00:04:45.410> that<00:04:45.620> I<00:04:45.650> have<00:04:45.950> seen<00:04:46.250> some<00:04:46.670> tops<00:04:46.940> like

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
the bottoms take them off we don't need

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.310 
the bottoms take them off we don't need
them<00:04:58.460> so<00:04:59.150> then<00:04:59.330> it'll<00:04:59.510> give<00:04:59.630> it<00:04:59.660> this<00:04:59.960> kind<00:05:00.200> of

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320
