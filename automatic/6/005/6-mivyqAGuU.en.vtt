it I watched this episode in Japanese so

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.930 
it I watched this episode in Japanese so
there<00:00:09.540> probably<00:00:09.570> might<00:00:10.050> have<00:00:10.200> been<00:00:10.380> some

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
there probably might have been some

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.499 
there probably might have been some
difference<00:00:11.990> some<00:00:12.990> differences<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.330> just<00:00:15.330> in

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
difference some differences and just in

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.120 
difference some differences and just in
terms<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.320> episode

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
terms of the episode

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.620 
terms of the episode
I<00:00:17.160> mean<00:00:17.550> nonetheless<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.210> still<00:00:18.390> thought<00:00:18.570> it

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
I mean nonetheless I still thought it

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.510 
I mean nonetheless I still thought it
would<00:00:18.840> be<00:00:18.990> good<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.500> English<00:00:19.890> but<00:00:20.039> since<00:00:20.430> I

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
would be good in English but since I

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.700 
would be good in English but since I
missed<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.119> have<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.449> watch<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:22.020> Japanese

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
missed it I have to watch it in Japanese

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.820 
missed it I have to watch it in Japanese
with<00:00:23.310> English<00:00:23.460> subtitles<00:00:24.260> but<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.289> was<00:00:25.529> able<00:00:25.800> to

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
with English subtitles but I was able to

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.349 
with English subtitles but I was able to
watch<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.189> episode<00:00:26.250> which<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.820> really<00:00:27.180> good

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
watch the episode which is really good

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.300 
watch the episode which is really good
so<00:00:27.390> but<00:00:28.109> there<00:00:28.380> might<00:00:28.590> be<00:00:28.619> some<00:00:28.920> differences

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
so but there might be some differences

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.479 
so but there might be some differences
in<00:00:29.490> terms<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.900> soundtrack<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:31.980> this

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
in this episode is just really glad I

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.770 
in this episode is just really glad I
don't<00:03:42.400> know<00:03:42.549> what<00:03:42.700> they<00:03:42.790> did<00:03:42.970> in<00:03:43.180> English<00:03:43.510> but

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
don't know what they did in English but

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.479 
don't know what they did in English but
I<00:03:44.019> know<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.970> Japanese<00:03:47.220> version<00:03:48.220> was

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
I know and the Japanese version was

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.490 
I know and the Japanese version was
really<00:03:48.940> really<00:03:49.450> really<00:03:49.630> good<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.230> you<00:03:50.350> know

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
really really really good and you know

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.599 
really really really good and you know
there<00:03:50.709> probably<00:03:50.829> would<00:03:51.130> have<00:03:51.190> been<00:03:51.340> really

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
there probably would have been really

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.759 
there probably would have been really
good<00:03:51.730> because<00:03:52.269> it's<00:03:52.630> not<00:03:52.780> like<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.260> sweetness

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
good because it's not like the sweetness

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.949 
good because it's not like the sweetness
and<00:03:53.950> stuff<00:03:54.190> like<00:03:54.340> that<00:03:54.609> just<00:03:54.639> just<00:03:55.389> goes<00:03:55.600> away

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
and stuff like that just just goes away

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.780 
and stuff like that just just goes away
because<00:03:56.170> of<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.500> soundtrack<00:03:57.160> it's<00:03:57.370> just<00:03:57.609> that

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
because of the soundtrack it's just that

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.819
