a<00:03:15.670> chroma<00:03:16.420> number<00:03:16.750> 2<00:03:16.959> is<00:03:17.140> right<00:03:17.350> underneath<00:03:17.650> it

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
a chroma number 2 is right underneath it

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.930 
a chroma number 2 is right underneath it
but<00:03:19.360> really<00:03:19.950> fantastic<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.160> at<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.700> end<00:03:21.820> of

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
but really fantastic and at the end of

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.160

this video I think I'm just gonna show a
bunch<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:23.860> close-ups<00:03:25.020> yeah<00:03:26.050> there's<00:03:26.530> the

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
bunch of close-ups yeah there's the

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.970 
bunch of close-ups yeah there's the
other<00:03:26.830> chroma<00:03:27.520> and<00:03:28.140> this<00:03:29.140> a<00:03:29.170> chroma<00:03:29.560> if<00:03:29.830> I

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
other chroma and this a chroma if I

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.880 
other chroma and this a chroma if I
remember<00:03:30.550> correctly<00:03:31.000> don't<00:03:31.840> don't<00:03:32.410> take<00:03:32.680> it

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
remember correctly don't don't take it

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.380 
remember correctly don't don't take it
as<00:03:33.010> absolute<00:03:33.550> truth<00:03:33.580> but<00:03:33.910> if<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.090> remember

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
as absolute truth but if I remember

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.380 
as absolute truth but if I remember
correctly<00:03:34.660> she's<00:03:35.380> actually<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:37.120> Time

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
correctly she's actually the the Time

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.160 
correctly she's actually the the Time

just<00:04:14.230> feels<00:04:14.439> so<00:04:14.709> weird<00:04:14.950> on<00:04:15.159> these<00:04:15.370> though<00:04:16.229> it

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
just feels so weird on these though it

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.379 
just feels so weird on these though it
makes<00:04:17.410> me<00:04:17.590> wonder<00:04:17.859> if<00:04:18.009> they<00:04:18.190> can<00:04:18.400> even<00:04:18.729> be

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
makes me wonder if they can even be

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.529 
makes me wonder if they can even be
flattened<00:04:20.019> out<00:04:20.430> cuz<00:04:21.430> you<00:04:21.850> know<00:04:21.940> it<00:04:22.060> comes<00:04:22.300> in

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
flattened out cuz you know it comes in

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.480 
flattened out cuz you know it comes in
