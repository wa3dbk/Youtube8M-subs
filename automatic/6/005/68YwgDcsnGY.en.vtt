 so we are quiet so 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.280
 you must at all costs land in 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.810
 your garage lock and that's important I 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.070
 you say so if you appear 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.510
 in your simple built house you 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.340

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.640
 efa brief you do what I tell you 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.990
 huh so you test me what 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.190
 you will see I have these two ways 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.170
 so the first way I bought a 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.610
 shitty car that you have to know 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.200
 I bought a big shitty car 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.370
 or that color does not matter to you 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.750
 put the color you see me 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.070
 I bought those there could all 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.750
 just buy another car me 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.850
 I do it in two ways it's good 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.320
 to show that it works then 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.490
 you asked yourself to replace the 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.650
 vehicle ben you are simply 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.630
 supported on which you and vehicles that 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.410
 you want without confirming and starting 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.180
 from the moment you go in the 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.830
 playstation store and bat attention you 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.100
 have you all believe that 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.570
 will immediately select the glitch 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.710
 because the slides are going there he is going 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.510
 trigger at the moment that you have then 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.740
 extra while loading the ps 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.150
 store and you're just going 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.710
 land in your house 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.030
 there you have not shut up in your garage 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.380
 or just in your house since 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.220
 the couch him what makes a real but 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.900
 you know a little whores and everything 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.890
 here you will land it then you 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.060
 simply have it in your garage 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.229
 and the magnificent waho we have our 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.590
 car so I 'm stubborn how he 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.180
 is already called but at 4-4 I'm over at 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.010
 a rating code and you'll hop 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.720
 also see that do not suffer at all 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.200
 moved so it's true they have no 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.780
 everything moved 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.890
 So here we go again in detail so 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.660
 You are well in option point 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.400
 of appearance you will put property 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.840
 which is very important also what 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.090
 is very important especially it's having 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.410
 the garage full so you do the 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.480
 full if you want to buy some 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.709
 adhere and all that and bought well the 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.560
 not directly you go all 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.580
 just buy crappy cars 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.930
 you are going to buy crappy cars 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.370
 to taste car costs 15000 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.709
 motorcycles maybe not like you want a 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.390
 could I motorcycles at 15000 you 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.190
 fill your garage with motorcycles then 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.530
 you do this glitch this is what I have 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.510
 want to say you have six bikes that 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.060
 costs 15 miles that makes us a total of 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.290
 100 me pretty much you finally buy 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.270
 you buy you do the glitch you 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.530
 have if they adhere 6 million I think 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.480
 it's worth it between us it's worth 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.070
 really blow 1 I think anyway 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.050
 if you did not understand me about those 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.030
 glitch lustings simply look at the 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.430
 at the beginning in any case I put all the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.959
 annotations on on turkotte guy all this 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.330
 which was important it's just to have 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.070
 the garage full after that's just me 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.050
 understand and it's perfect anyway 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.040
 I liked it on this video for you 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.140
