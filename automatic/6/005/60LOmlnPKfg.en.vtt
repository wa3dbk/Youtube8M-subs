 dyn 1 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.230
 dollar touched he had up stealing no matter who he is or have to have this book 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.459
 about the roles as 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.969
 the first edition is from 51 and a few days ago manolo from his kitchen I 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.760
 gave a second edition since the 70s and I will prepare but it is not what 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.800
 the author proposes although as always, versioning a bit 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.400
 The first thing we are going to do is a broth with martí crabs, the thorn of the 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.780
 tail of monkfish we propose in a casserole we cover it with water we add a little 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.399
 of salt when it breaks to boil remove the foam and leave it for about ten minutes 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.930
 while we are preparing the bite, we open a chorizo ​​pepper 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.360
 and we remove the seeds 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.090
 and then we had a boa so that it is very clean 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.290
 the cousins ​​well if necessary you can do it with a little bit of paper or 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.340
 a rag and we will put a pan to fry with a good jet of oil 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.039
 olive 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:09.039
 and in addition we are also going to believe a slice of white bread 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.440
 the case is already 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.500
 we remove it and drain it well and ricky land or the pepper and toast 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.720
 To make us feel good, I had to take a little bit of color from both sides and not 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.650
 remove as it is with the first bite that we do expose the mortar three 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.950
 garlic cloves six almonds isabella was born a pinch of salt and most 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.950
 famous to have a homogeneous mixture 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.960
 then we add the bread and the choricero pepper and it's not about having a 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.329
 homogenous mix this is going to take your time in fact equal with a blender 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.329
 it is easier 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.060
 sic 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.250
 Once ready, we put it on the trunk, which is the bread and the 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.250
 choricero pepper we distribute it well 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.900
 and we cover it and we leave it 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.020
 15 20 seconds let's be careful because if it does not burn us when there is 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.909
 After that time we added a couple of cases of the broth 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.909
 previously 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.030
 and we can now live the fisherman on this occasion arrate and we have spoken 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:38.040
 previously 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.689
 and this leaves it afterwards depending on the fish if after a while I like what I 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:47.890
 I recommend it is that the root on both sides then saw a few minutes 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.629
 enough on each side and then remove it and if you like that sauce 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.260
 have more body let this reduce to broth until it thickens 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.019
 already before serving is a little bit of parsley 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.079
 avoid that they only devoted themselves to see I do not know if I believe it 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:19.649
