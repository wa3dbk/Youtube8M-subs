minutes ago when I started the video so

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.490 
minutes ago when I started the video so
it's<00:04:04.800> really<00:04:05.010> fingerprint<00:04:05.640> prone<00:04:05.910> which

this<00:04:14.190> thing<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.550> think<00:04:14.580> they<00:04:14.790> really<00:04:15.060> should

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
this thing I think they really should

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.280 
this thing I think they really should
have<00:04:15.300> done<00:04:15.330> that<00:04:16.609> but<00:04:17.989> overall<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.139> device

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
have done that but overall the device

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.289 
have done that but overall the device
has<00:04:20.100> pretty<00:04:20.310> nice<00:04:20.489> physical<00:04:20.850> design<00:04:21.120> the
