question so to give a real and helpful

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.760 
question so to give a real and helpful
answer<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.360> would<00:02:06.600> probably<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.320> talk<00:02:07.560> to

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
answer I would probably have to talk to

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.249 
answer I would probably have to talk to
the<00:02:07.860> person<00:02:08.069> more<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.550> depth<00:02:08.849> but<00:02:09.720> at<00:02:09.959> a

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
the person more in depth but at a

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.199 
the person more in depth but at a
surface<00:02:10.649> level<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.580> thing<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.060> would

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
surface level the thing that I would

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.370 
surface level the thing that I would
suggest

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
suggest

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.190 
suggest
is<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:14.040> if<00:02:14.520> this<00:02:15.270> person<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.830> holding<00:02:16.830> on<00:02:16.980> to

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
is that if this person is holding on to

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.450 
is that if this person is holding on to
their<00:02:19.200> difficult<00:02:19.650> childhood<00:02:20.220> as<00:02:20.430> a

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
their difficult childhood as a

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.550 
their difficult childhood as a
definition<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.240> who<00:02:21.420> they<00:02:21.600> are<00:02:21.720> right<00:02:21.990> now<00:02:22.260> my

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
definition of who they are right now my

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.250 
definition of who they are right now my
guess<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.190> they<00:02:23.340> are<00:02:23.490> fighting<00:02:24.260> against

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
guess is that they are fighting against

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.640 
guess is that they are fighting against
it<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.770> instead<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.730> would<00:02:27.060> suggest

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
it and instead I would suggest

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.650 
it and instead I would suggest
approaching<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:29.340> situation<00:02:29.550> with<00:02:30.360> an

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
approaching the situation with an

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.190 
approaching the situation with an
attitude<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.860> surrender<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:33.200> acceptance

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
attitude of surrender and acceptance

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.730 
attitude of surrender and acceptance
because<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.880> difficult<00:02:36.270> childhood<00:02:36.840> while<00:02:37.230> it

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
because the difficult childhood while it

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.360 
because the difficult childhood while it
was<00:02:38.190> certainly<00:02:38.670> I'm<00:02:39.450> sure<00:02:39.510> horrific<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:41.190> in

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
was certainly I'm sure horrific it is in

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.110 
was certainly I'm sure horrific it is in
the<00:02:41.460> past<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:42.380> exists<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:44.120> unchangeable

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
the past it exists it is unchangeable

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.990 
the past it exists it is unchangeable
and<00:02:45.270> there<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.430> no<00:02:48.440> rational<00:02:49.440> reason<00:02:49.820> to<00:02:50.820> do

and there is no rational reason to do
anything<00:02:51.030> other<00:02:51.780> than<00:02:52.020> accept<00:02:52.590> things<00:02:53.340> that
