00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 very good to all kids welcome 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.370
 once again to my good channel you can see it 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.690
 in the title closed for vacations what 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.010
 let's explain now very fast of 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.840
 several things that I want to comment so 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.360
 well it will not be a I do not think it's a 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.099
 very long video but we close by 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.289
 vacation for a fundamental reason and 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.260
 see what my parents said about ago 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.340
 January of this year and such is that we are going 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.980
 to do home works and it's going to be 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.779
 impossible to record the works include my 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.160
 room that we're going to change the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.820
 So, all this has to be done 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.080
 move it you have to take it out the move 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.529
 of the soil is that it is going to put new things 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.079
 under 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.719
 change park for I do not know how much ink 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.430
 so they are going to do a lot of things and 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.150
 bitch is that minimum only my room 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.800
 it's going to be a month 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.850
 that is my room with everything 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.580
 they have to do is three weeks 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.380
 almost a month later another room that 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.900
 they have to do next that is the bathroom 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.700
 that there is a room that they are going to take out and 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.400
 such more makes a move and in the background 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.020
 low as I understand do 23 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.000
 months are now beginning to measure 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.640
 bring things also the materials to 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.559
 that everything is fine and good how do you see the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.600
 bernabéu this weekend italy and that 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.420
 we can see each other because I take advantage of it and 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.760
 I say then do not worry that I do not know 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.510
 stop youtube I have even if I leave the 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.760
 channel I'm already up to the cold and I do not know 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.650
 that is, it is simply that I am not going to 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.540
 power though I could record though 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.660
 they will start on the other hand and there will be 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.430
 a lot of noise work all day long and 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.930
 then it 's another one that no no we're not going to live 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.360
 here while the works are done because 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.260
 it is impossible the dust to me kills me 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.350
 noise is not time to rest are 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.450
 vacation and get up and at eight o'clock 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.750
 tomorrow because they start chopping is a 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.790
 But what good is the year 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.580
 past I suffered the neighbors who had 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.940
 the same hours that is, this year 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.940
 they play 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.340
 and on the other hand also give you the 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.560
 thank you because it has been a fantastic year 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.320
 I have really met very good people 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.150
 which of those that you keep for all the 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.979
 life has been a very good year 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.800
 the whore has been that the fifa good then 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.729
 has had good things bad things 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.100
 roads of the figures that has most 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.720
 excited and I liked a little 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.610
 more than we give him because the 14th by the 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.620
 issue of the centers that does not 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.410
 I could tolerate that I was chetout 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.390
 and he fucked me about the running 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.830
 when you see those matches in which 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.860
 begins to run not stop her and says 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.630
 this match such on the other hand also 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.459
 I would like to wish luck to all people 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.630
 which is going to be submitted to selectivity 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.090
 this year a lot of luck and a council 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.310
 the first one is some better advice 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.860
 The first is do not study in the days of 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.400
 selectivity I tell you on my own 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.100
 experience 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.270
 I studied the last four days before 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.530
 to start selectivity 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.070
 before that I think I started a 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.320
 Wednesday and ended on Friday I studied 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.510
 well that the weekend he started the 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.270
 saturday was saturday sunday monday and 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.490
 Tuesday study those 4 days 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.710
 your subjects I already took subjects 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.390
 they did well and such and is the selectivity 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.430
 is that they raise any subject note 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.720
 I'm telling you this because surely 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.930
 are lying so you can get 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.450
 study selectivity is easy, that is the 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.470
 test more than 90% of the people my year 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.210
 it was 95 percent there's no such thing that 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.580
 it's called selectivity to select 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.330
 so calm you're going to try everything 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.200
 you are going to wish it is so it is the putada 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.750
 come to the note that you want to 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.700
 study what you want and everyone goes 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.960
 well to others in which we present ourselves 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.160
 selectivity also very much luck 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.920
 with the final exams 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.740
 I hope we can do well and come to 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.300
 bernabéu do not miss it on the 13th 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.750
 we started at 11 in the morning 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.460
 so do not miss it either and nothing 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.770
 I wish you a good summer more than 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.770
 you pass very well the same I think for me 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.580
 I hope it's a good summer and such 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.990
 I'm probably going to work because 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.930
 it's going to be a boring summer 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.150
 and nothing that you have a lot of fun 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.370
 we are lucky with selectivity in the 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.330
 bernabéu and see you especially in 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.520
 September from September 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.940
 let's hope we start already the fifa 16 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.510
 I start there and nothing a greeting to 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.680
 all a big hug and see you in what 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.680
 soon possible goodbye
