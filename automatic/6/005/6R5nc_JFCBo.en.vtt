00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.819 
drain and dragon pulse and then a hidden
power<00:01:41.579> i'd<00:01:41.850> say<00:01:42.030> probably<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.600> best<00:01:42.829> unless

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
power i'd say probably is best unless

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:44.960 
power i'd say probably is best unless
you<00:01:43.920> want<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> think<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.280> throne<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.610> support

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
you want to think of throne and support

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.740 
you want to think of throne and support
moving<00:01:45.090> there<00:01:45.329> maybe

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
moving there maybe

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.560 
moving there maybe
yeah<00:01:45.900> I<00:01:46.700> don't<00:01:47.700> think<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:47.970> leaves<00:01:48.090> seeing<00:01:48.360> to

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
yeah I don't think it leaves seeing to

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.540 
yeah I don't think it leaves seeing to
get<00:01:48.690> a<00:01:48.720> root<00:01:48.900> one<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.290> leave<00:01:49.590> seen<00:01:49.860> me<00:01:50.340> give<00:01:50.490> you

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
get a root one we leave seen me give you

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.330 
get a root one we leave seen me give you
a<00:01:50.580> couple<00:01:50.700> things<00:01:51.020> his<00:01:52.020> base<00:01:52.260> speed<00:01:52.620> is<00:01:53.010> right

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
a couple things his base speed is right

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.180 
a couple things his base speed is right
now<00:01:53.490> once<00:01:53.760> Pawnee<00:01:54.060> if<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.810> shoots<00:01:55.050> up<00:01:55.320> only<00:01:55.530> 20

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
now once Pawnee if it shoots up only 20

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.860 
now once Pawnee if it shoots up only 20
points<00:01:56.670> which<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.000> think<00:01:57.450> they're<00:01:57.600> gonna<00:01:57.690> make

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
points which I think they're gonna make

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.780 
points which I think they're gonna make
it<00:01:57.960> faster<00:01:58.320> because<00:01:58.470> he<00:01:58.800> became<00:01:59.010> grass<00:01:59.310> dragon

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
it faster because he became grass dragon

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.670 
it faster because he became grass dragon
I<00:01:59.940> think<00:02:00.600> they're<00:02:00.750> gonna<00:02:00.870> make<00:02:01.050> it<00:02:01.140> faster<00:02:01.500> if

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
I think they're gonna make it faster if

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.370 
I think they're gonna make it faster if
all<00:02:02.160> it<00:02:02.400> needs<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.790> go<00:02:02.940> is<00:02:03.150> 20<00:02:03.660> points<00:02:04.020> up<00:02:04.200> to

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
all it needs to go is 20 points up to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.890 
all it needs to go is 20 points up to
140<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.040> tie<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.369> with<00:02:05.580> with<00:02:05.970> with<00:02:06.330> electrode

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
140 to tie it with with with electrode

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.410 
140 to tie it with with with electrode
so<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:07.920> it's<00:02:08.070> any<00:02:08.280> more<00:02:08.520> than<00:02:08.640> 20<00:02:08.940> points<00:02:09.300> it's

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
so if it's any more than 20 points it's

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.240 
so if it's any more than 20 points it's
gonna<00:02:09.539> be<00:02:09.660> out<00:02:09.810> speeding<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.470> shitload<00:02:10.950> of

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
gonna be out speeding a shitload of

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.620 
gonna be out speeding a shitload of
things<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.970> think<00:02:12.000> that'll<00:02:12.300> make<00:02:12.330> only

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
things and I think that'll make only

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.380 
things and I think that'll make only
like<00:02:12.840> deoxys<00:02:13.350> attack<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.890> speed<00:02:14.240> faster<00:02:15.240> than

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
like deoxys attack and speed faster than

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.910 
like deoxys attack and speed faster than
it<00:02:15.540> once<00:02:15.690> it's<00:02:15.930> faster<00:02:16.200> than<00:02:16.260> electrode<00:02:16.680> so

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
it once it's faster than electrode so

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.850 
it once it's faster than electrode so
yeah<00:02:17.490> other<00:02:17.820> duties<00:02:18.540> potential<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.500> be<00:02:19.620> one<00:02:19.800> of

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
yeah other duties potential to be one of

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.560 
yeah other duties potential to be one of
the<00:02:19.980> fastest<00:02:20.489> boat<00:02:20.640> one<00:02:20.850> in<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.510> game<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:23.570> feel

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
the fastest boat one in the game I feel

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.120 
the fastest boat one in the game I feel
well<00:02:24.900> obviously<00:02:25.200> it's<00:02:25.620> good<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.010> came

well obviously it's good that you came

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.590 
well obviously it's good that you came

to paralyze gonna be great thing he can

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.090 
to paralyze gonna be great thing he can
