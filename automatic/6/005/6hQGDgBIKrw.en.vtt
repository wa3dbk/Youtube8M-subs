that<00:01:07.430> well<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.640> next<00:01:08.790> tip<00:01:09.119> I'm<00:01:09.330> going<00:01:09.690> to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
that well the next tip I'm going to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.830 
that well the next tip I'm going to
share<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.290> will<00:01:11.070> teach<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.700> how<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.540> do

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
share with you will teach you how to do

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.580 
share with you will teach you how to do
more<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.350> less<00:01:13.409> time<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.750> strategy<00:01:16.380> is

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
more in less time so this strategy is

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.490 
more in less time so this strategy is
called<00:01:17.220> batching<00:01:18.170> basically<00:01:19.170> what<00:01:19.470> that

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
called batching basically what that

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.700 
called batching basically what that
means<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:20.270> not<00:01:21.270> doing<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> same<00:01:21.810> thing<00:01:22.320> too

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
means is not doing the same thing too

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.940 
means is not doing the same thing too
many<00:01:22.920> times<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.789> the<00:01:23.970> day<00:01:24.180> instead<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.560> pile

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
many times in the day instead just pile

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.350 
many times in the day instead just pile
it<00:01:25.979> all<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.729> do<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.630> once<00:01:28.440> or<00:01:28.740> twice<00:01:29.270> let<00:01:30.270> me

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
it all and do it once or twice let me

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.560 
it all and do it once or twice let me
give<00:01:30.539> you<00:01:30.660> an<00:01:30.780> example<00:01:32.060> before<00:01:33.060> learning

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
give you an example before learning

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.139 
give you an example before learning
about<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.200> strategy<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.039> used<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.700> check<00:01:35.940> my

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
about the strategy I used to check my

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.790 
about the strategy I used to check my
email<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.600> love<00:01:36.840> checking<00:01:37.080> my<00:01:37.350> email<00:01:37.619> by<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
email I love checking my email by the

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.160 
email I love checking my email by the
way<00:01:38.039> I<00:01:38.250> used<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.789> check<00:01:39.060> my<00:01:39.240> email<00:01:39.630> every<00:01:39.960> hour

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
way I used to check my email every hour

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.219 
way I used to check my email every hour
and<00:01:40.649> I<00:01:41.460> would<00:01:41.640> do<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:41.970> approximately<00:01:42.840> about

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
and I would do this approximately about

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.249 
and I would do this approximately about
10<00:01:43.679> times<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.130> day<00:01:44.179> so<00:01:45.179> each<00:01:45.360> time<00:01:45.690> i<00:01:45.720> would<00:01:46.080> have

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
10 times a day so each time i would have

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.940 
10 times a day so each time i would have
to<00:01:46.410> log<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.890> then<00:01:47.490> check<00:01:48.210> my<00:01:48.450> email<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
to log in then check my email but the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.740 
to log in then check my email but the
thing<00:01:50.160> is<00:01:50.190> though<00:01:50.580> because<00:01:50.970> i<00:01:51.149> checked<00:01:51.539> so

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
thing is though because i checked so

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.020 
thing is though because i checked so
often<00:01:52.200> there<00:01:52.890> really<00:01:53.190> wasn't<00:01:53.429> too<00:01:53.820> many

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
often there really wasn't too many

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.359 
often there really wasn't too many
emails<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.860> new<00:01:56.490> emails<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.150> is<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:59.159> got

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
emails the new emails that is so it got

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.609 
emails the new emails that is so it got
me<00:01:59.520> depressed<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.270> also<00:02:00.570> i<00:02:00.600> wasted<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.350> lot<00:02:01.380> of

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
me depressed and also i wasted a lot of

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.850 
me depressed and also i wasted a lot of
time<00:02:01.820> to<00:02:02.820> log<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.420> wait<00:02:03.990> for<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.320> emails<00:02:04.650> to

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
time to log in wait for the emails to

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.030 
time to log in wait for the emails to
load<00:02:05.659> so<00:02:07.100> this<00:02:08.100> strategy<00:02:08.759> batching<00:02:10.040> basically

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
load so this strategy batching basically

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.430 
load so this strategy batching basically
what<00:02:11.310> i<00:02:11.340> would<00:02:11.640> do<00:02:11.820> with<00:02:11.970> emails<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.660> check<00:02:13.260> it

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
what i would do with emails is check it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.970 
what i would do with emails is check it
just<00:02:13.799> two<00:02:14.100> times<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:15.420> day<00:02:15.630> i'll<00:02:16.290> check<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.799> at

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
just two times in a day i'll check it at

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.360 
just two times in a day i'll check it at
noon<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.489> at<00:02:18.239> night<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:19.440> saves<00:02:19.709> me<00:02:19.829> a<00:02:19.950> lot<00:02:20.130> of

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
noon and at night that saves me a lot of

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.640 
noon and at night that saves me a lot of
time<00:02:20.760> instead<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.540> having<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.989> check<00:02:22.320> ten

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
time instead of having to check ten

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.920 
time instead of having to check ten
times<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:23.100> day<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.880> now<00:02:24.150> i<00:02:24.180> may<00:02:24.450> have<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.630> check

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
times a day and now i may have to check

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.770 
times a day and now i may have to check
it<00:02:25.110> twice<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:26.100> each<00:02:26.459> time<00:02:26.820> i'll<00:02:27.150> get<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.570> read

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
it twice and each time i'll get to read
