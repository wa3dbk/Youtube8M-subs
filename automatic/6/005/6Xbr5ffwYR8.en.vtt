00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.339
 we are on Sakhalin Island 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.559
 small village half the troubles right behind 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.809
 me is the Tatar strait which 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.350
 divides the main land and the island 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.180
 Sakhalin to her of our project to cross this 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.720
 open water space in the free 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.979
 fall 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.979
 suit wing 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.900
 horizon distance between extreme 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.870
 dots of the big land of acute Sakhalin 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.660
 about eight kilometers I guess 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.700
 jump in excess of 4,000 meters above 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.770
 With water , we have very simple conditions for 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.700
 the morning wind in different directions 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.600
 heights with quite strong and 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.670
 the main challenge for me is the main 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.410
 complexity and danger it does not fly to 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.140
 opposite shore and land in 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.940
 water water is very cold with it 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.530
 the real danger is that just the volume 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.190
 because suits parachute fast 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.190
 collect water 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.780
 mechanically by performing a complex jump 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.270
 is that i have to 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.280
 jump together with valery we are constantly 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.520
 keep it in frame whatever 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.950
 conditions I completely trust Valeria I do not 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.550
 I look where I fly and focusing only 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.550
 on him 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.910
 on combat 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.780
 ecopark won the question but then 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.020
 and 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.150
 itself is not very pretty amazing we 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.370
 a country with a large and therefore not 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.290
 look pretty cold upstairs behind 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.650
 Murphy detail display and very strong 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.390
 weber 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.750
 Well and from there I do not speak on 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.750
 Maidan
