00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
press and it does heat up the concept of

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.500 
press and it does heat up the concept of
it<00:03:31.739> is<00:03:31.769> it<00:03:32.220> presses<00:03:32.640> out<00:03:32.730> your<00:03:32.910> tortillas<00:03:33.299> and

cooks them you can also do things like
none<00:03:36.000> or<00:03:36.420> pitas<00:03:36.870> on<00:03:37.110> it<00:03:37.290> but<00:03:37.799> we<00:03:37.920> found<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:38.459> it

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
none or pitas on it but we found that it

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.759 
none or pitas on it but we found that it
does<00:03:38.820> not<00:03:39.150> do<00:03:39.780> well<00:03:39.989> with<00:03:40.019> heating<00:03:40.650> up

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
does not do well with heating up

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.430 
does not do well with heating up
tortillas<00:03:41.280> tortillas<00:03:41.640> get<00:03:42.330> lots<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.780> bubbles

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
tortillas tortillas get lots of bubbles

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.530 
tortillas tortillas get lots of bubbles
in<00:03:43.650> them<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.220> want<00:03:44.519> them<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:44.820> bubble<00:03:45.299> up

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
in them and you want them to bubble up

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.930 
in them and you want them to bubble up
so<00:03:46.200> pressing<00:03:46.440> them<00:03:46.709> flat<00:03:46.980> in<00:03:47.160> that<00:03:47.370> we<00:03:47.820> were

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
so pressing them flat in that we were

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.850 
so pressing them flat in that we were
getting<00:03:48.060> rock-hard<00:03:48.720> tortillas<00:03:49.350> that<00:03:49.590> weren't

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
getting rock-hard tortillas that weren't

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.670

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
fluffy or soft at all so I was just

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.340 
fluffy or soft at all so I was just
showing<00:03:52.980> you<00:03:53.010> my<00:03:53.100> setup<00:03:53.670> we<00:03:54.269> have<00:03:54.510> the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
showing you my setup we have the

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.550 
showing you my setup we have the
tortilla<00:03:55.799> press<00:03:56.070> and<00:03:56.549> my<00:03:56.730> husband<00:03:57.380> turns<00:03:58.380> it

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
tortilla press and my husband turns it

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.800 
tortilla press and my husband turns it
on<00:03:58.709> just<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:59.130> little<00:03:59.160> bit<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.940> heat<00:04:00.150> it<00:04:00.269> up<00:04:00.450> so

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
on just a little bit to heat it up so

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.840 
on just a little bit to heat it up so
that<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.140> tortillas<00:04:01.620> don't<00:04:01.830> stick<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.489> that

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
that the tortillas don't stick to that

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.479 
that the tortillas don't stick to that
hot<00:04:03.150> plate<00:04:03.360> then<00:04:04.200> he<00:04:04.350> presses<00:04:04.769> them<00:04:04.950> out<00:04:05.190> and

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
hot plate then he presses them out and

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.370 
hot plate then he presses them out and
then<00:04:05.670> we<00:04:05.820> cook<00:04:06.060> them<00:04:06.239> in<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.420> skillet<00:04:06.780> like<00:04:07.110> in

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
then we cook them in the skillet like in

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.100 
then we cook them in the skillet like in
my<00:04:07.620> tortilla<00:04:08.040> recipe<00:04:08.549> video<00:04:08.850> and<00:04:09.209> we<00:04:09.690> skipped

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
my tortilla recipe video and we skipped

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.530 
my tortilla recipe video and we skipped
the<00:04:10.230> steaming<00:04:10.709> step<00:04:11.220> altogether<00:04:11.519> because<00:04:12.269> we

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
the steaming step altogether because we

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.140 
the steaming step altogether because we
have<00:04:12.690> that<00:04:12.870> foil<00:04:13.230> pocket<00:04:13.769> in<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.400> foil<00:04:14.730> pocket

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
have that foil pocket in the foil pocket

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.300 
have that foil pocket in the foil pocket
we<00:04:15.329> just<00:04:15.540> stick<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:16.019> tortillas<00:04:16.530> in<00:04:16.739> as<00:04:17.070> soon

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
we just stick the tortillas in as soon

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.039 
we just stick the tortillas in as soon
as<00:04:17.430> they're<00:04:17.609> done<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:18.090> they<00:04:18.660> steam

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
as they're done and they steam

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.170 
as they're done and they steam
themselves<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:19.950> they<00:04:20.040> stay<00:04:20.310> warm<00:04:20.669> they<00:04:20.940> stay

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
themselves and they stay warm they stay

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.300 
themselves and they stay warm they stay
nice<00:04:21.390> and<00:04:21.630> soft<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.229> it's<00:04:22.950> just<00:04:23.160> absolutely

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
nice and soft and it's just absolutely

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.020 
nice and soft and it's just absolutely
perfect<00:04:23.910> that<00:04:24.510> way<00:04:24.720> so<00:04:25.320> there's<00:04:25.590> no<00:04:25.770> step<00:04:26.490> for

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
perfect that way so there's no step for

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.540 
perfect that way so there's no step for
the<00:04:27.510> steaming<00:04:27.840> anymore

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
the steaming anymore

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.820 
the steaming anymore
and<00:04:29.479> as<00:04:29.599> you<00:04:29.690> can<00:04:29.780> see<00:04:29.840> it's<00:04:30.080> just<00:04:30.259> bubbling<00:04:30.620> up

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
and as you can see it's just bubbling up

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.619 
and as you can see it's just bubbling up
and<00:04:31.039> I<00:04:31.129> kind<00:04:31.310> of<00:04:31.460> flattened<00:04:31.819> the<00:04:31.910> bubbles<00:04:32.210> to

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:32.629 
and I kind of flattened the bubbles to

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:33.879 
and I kind of flattened the bubbles to
make<00:04:32.660> sure<00:04:32.930> everything<00:04:33.410> gets<00:04:33.590> cooked

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
make sure everything gets cooked

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.980 
make sure everything gets cooked
thoroughly<00:04:34.250> it<00:04:35.150> doesn't<00:04:35.509> take<00:04:35.660> very<00:04:35.690> much

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
thoroughly it doesn't take very much

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.460 
thoroughly it doesn't take very much
time<00:04:36.470> maybe<00:04:36.800> 20<00:04:37.610> minutes<00:04:37.909> per<00:04:38.150> side<00:04:38.389> and<00:04:38.840> my

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
time maybe 20 minutes per side and my

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.200 
time maybe 20 minutes per side and my
husband<00:04:39.860> just<00:04:39.889> presses<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.490> tortillas<00:04:40.970> out

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
husband just presses the tortillas out

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.480 
husband just presses the tortillas out
twice<00:04:41.750> and<00:04:42.139> they<00:04:42.319> come<00:04:42.560> out<00:04:42.590> nice<00:04:42.949> and<00:04:43.280> flat

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
twice and they come out nice and flat

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.999 
twice and they come out nice and flat
and<00:04:43.759> round<00:04:43.940> every<00:04:44.479> time<00:04:44.720> whereas<00:04:45.500> when<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:45.830> was

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
and round every time whereas when I was

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.680 
and round every time whereas when I was
rolling<00:04:46.370> them<00:04:46.520> out<00:04:46.639> with<00:04:46.819> a<00:04:46.849> rolling<00:04:47.060> pin<00:04:47.210> I

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
rolling them out with a rolling pin I

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.629 
rolling them out with a rolling pin I
wasn't<00:04:48.259> getting<00:04:48.500> them<00:04:48.650> quite<00:04:48.949> as<00:04:49.069> flat<00:04:49.340> and

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
wasn't getting them quite as flat and

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.520 
wasn't getting them quite as flat and
they<00:04:49.729> definitely<00:04:50.030> weren't<00:04:50.720> beautiful<00:04:50.990> and

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
they definitely weren't beautiful and

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.110 
they definitely weren't beautiful and
round<00:04:51.800> like<00:04:51.949> they<00:04:52.250> are<00:04:52.460> with<00:04:52.669> the<00:04:52.759> tortilla

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
round like they are with the tortilla

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.570 
round like they are with the tortilla
press<00:04:53.330> so<00:04:54.050> I<00:04:54.080> still<00:04:54.620> highly<00:04:54.949> recommend<00:04:55.490> the

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
press so I still highly recommend the

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.730 
press so I still highly recommend the
tortilla<00:04:55.970> press<00:04:56.240> even<00:04:57.110> if<00:04:57.229> you<00:04:57.349> just<00:04:57.500> get<00:04:57.710> a

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
tortilla press even if you just get a

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.270 
tortilla press even if you just get a
manual<00:04:58.159> one<00:04:58.930> not<00:04:59.930> one<00:05:00.169> that<00:05:00.349> heats<00:05:00.650> up<00:05:00.979> it

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
manual one not one that heats up it

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.279 
manual one not one that heats up it
would<00:05:01.520> be<00:05:01.639> great<00:05:01.940> but<00:05:02.330> it<00:05:02.599> definitely<00:05:02.840> does

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
would be great but it definitely does

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.529 
would be great but it definitely does
not<00:05:03.319> work<00:05:03.710> for<00:05:03.919> cooking<00:05:04.130> so<00:05:04.460> here<00:05:04.789> is<00:05:04.940> our<00:05:05.090> foil

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
not work for cooking so here is our foil
