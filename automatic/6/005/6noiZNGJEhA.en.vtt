00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
use scrap paper do all sorts of trials I

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.940 
use scrap paper do all sorts of trials I
want<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.569> to<00:02:06.659> be<00:02:06.780> particular<00:02:07.409> where<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.770> how

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
want you to be particular where of how

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.720 
want you to be particular where of how
the<00:02:08.549> proportions<00:02:09.330> are<00:02:09.420> kind<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.629> strange<00:02:10.019> the

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 
the proportions are kind of strange the

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.699 
the proportions are kind of strange the
top<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:12.000> very<00:02:12.420> large<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:12.930> that's<00:02:13.170> because<00:02:13.379> it

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
top is very large and that's because it

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.250 
top is very large and that's because it
fits<00:02:14.010> underneath<00:02:14.580> here<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.900> always<00:02:16.140> have

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
fits underneath here so you always have

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.979 
fits underneath here so you always have
to<00:02:16.560> think<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.890> terms<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:18.390> body<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.840> the

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
to think in terms of the body of the

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.660 
to think in terms of the body of the

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:59.740 
it's completely covered and it's about
to<00:04:53.280> see<00:04:53.900> so<00:04:54.900> there<00:04:55.889> they<00:04:56.039> are

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.090 

and<00:05:00.350> they're<00:05:00.530> fairly<00:05:00.920> close<00:05:02.530> as<00:05:03.530> I<00:05:03.650> said<00:05:03.920> oh

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
and they're fairly close as I said oh

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.070 
and they're fairly close as I said oh
now<00:05:04.730> that<00:05:04.910> I've<00:05:05.030> dragged<00:05:05.330> it<00:05:05.480> it's<00:05:05.630> perfect

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
now that I've dragged it it's perfect

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.050 
now that I've dragged it it's perfect
and<00:05:06.680> now<00:05:06.890> I'm<00:05:07.100> going<00:05:07.310> to<00:05:07.370> first<00:05:07.610> do<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:07.790> ribbon

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
and now I'm going to first do the ribbon

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.330 
and now I'm going to first do the ribbon
one<00:05:08.330> that's<00:05:08.750> the<00:05:09.320> solution<00:05:09.590> for<00:05:10.130> this

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
one that's the solution for this

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.660 
one that's the solution for this
invitation<00:05:10.810> so<00:05:11.810> if<00:05:12.260> the<00:05:12.650> instructions<00:05:13.430> call

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
invitation so if the instructions call

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.090 
invitation so if the instructions call
for<00:05:13.940> eight<00:05:14.090> inches<00:05:14.590> so<00:05:15.590> I'm<00:05:15.710> going<00:05:15.770> to<00:05:15.950> mark

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
for eight inches so I'm going to mark

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:22.990 
for eight inches so I'm going to mark
out<00:05:16.370> my<00:05:16.610> eight<00:05:16.820> inches<00:05:17.240> and<00:05:19.690> cut<00:05:20.690> it<00:05:20.840> I<00:05:21.970> like<00:05:22.970> a

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
out my eight inches and cut it I like a

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.980 
out my eight inches and cut it I like a
little<00:05:23.210> tapered<00:05:23.750> end<00:05:25.300> not<00:05:26.300> tape<00:05:26.690> with<00:05:26.900> the

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
little tapered end not tape with the

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.110 
little tapered end not tape with the
other<00:05:27.110> end<00:05:27.320> just<00:05:27.530> because<00:05:27.650> by<00:05:28.070> the<00:05:28.130> time<00:05:28.220> I've

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
other end just because by the time I've

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.120 
other end just because by the time I've
got<00:05:29.180> the<00:05:29.600> whole<00:05:29.750> thing<00:05:29.780> sinners<00:05:30.320> I'm<00:05:30.530> going<00:05:31.010> to

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
got the whole thing sinners I'm going to

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.880 
got the whole thing sinners I'm going to
probably<00:05:31.760> have<00:05:32.030> to<00:05:32.180> cut<00:05:32.360> we<00:05:32.540> cut<00:05:32.720> both<00:05:32.930> ends<00:05:33.169> so

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
probably have to cut we cut both ends so

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.340 
probably have to cut we cut both ends so
now<00:05:34.070> the<00:05:34.130> trick<00:05:34.460> is<00:05:34.490> to<00:05:34.669> feed<00:05:35.150> it<00:05:35.360> and<00:05:36.050> this<00:05:36.200> is

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
now the trick is to feed it and this is

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.440 
now the trick is to feed it and this is
the<00:05:36.530> challenge<00:05:37.280> on<00:05:37.490> this<00:05:37.610> invitation<00:05:38.240> is<00:05:38.300> to

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
the challenge on this invitation is to

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.790 
the challenge on this invitation is to
get<00:05:38.630> it<00:05:38.750> through<00:05:38.780> these<00:05:39.230> little<00:05:39.850> holes<00:05:41.470> so<00:05:42.470> I

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
get it through these little holes so I

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.530 
get it through these little holes so I
always<00:05:43.040> take<00:05:43.220> it<00:05:43.280> off<00:05:43.490> like<00:05:43.730> that<00:05:43.910> an<00:05:44.090> image

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
always take it off like that an image

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.340 
always take it off like that an image
and<00:05:44.840> do<00:05:45.020> it<00:05:45.140> one<00:05:45.320> at<00:05:45.620> a<00:05:45.890> time<00:05:47.260> putting<00:05:48.260> my

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
and do it one at a time putting my

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.690 
and do it one at a time putting my
invitation<00:05:48.980> layers<00:05:49.190> through<00:05:49.840> and<00:05:51.460> then<00:05:52.460> my

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
invitation layers through and then my

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.720 
invitation layers through and then my
top<00:05:53.120> layer<00:05:53.650> and<00:05:54.650> then<00:05:55.040> you<00:05:55.190> start<00:05:55.430> to<00:05:55.460> work<00:05:55.610> on

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
top layer and then you start to work on

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:56.950 
top layer and then you start to work on
the<00:05:55.820> other<00:05:55.880> side<00:05:56.240> and<00:05:56.390> the<00:05:56.480> trick<00:05:56.720> with<00:05:56.930> that

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
the other side and the trick with that

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.490 
the other side and the trick with that
is<00:05:57.140> to<00:05:57.380> not<00:05:58.000> lose<00:05:59.000> these<00:05:59.270> so<00:05:59.810> that's<00:06:00.169> how<00:06:00.350> it's

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
is to not lose these so that's how it's

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.969 
is to not lose these so that's how it's
done<00:06:01.000> now<00:06:02.000> I'm<00:06:02.300> going<00:06:02.600> to<00:06:03.460> do<00:06:04.460> this<00:06:04.669> sign<00:06:05.979> as

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
done now I'm going to do this sign as

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.320 
done now I'm going to do this sign as
you<00:06:07.100> can<00:06:07.220> see<00:06:07.430> this<00:06:07.610> is<00:06:07.820> probably<00:06:08.060> the<00:06:08.240> most

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
you can see this is probably the most

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:15.070 
you can see this is probably the most
time-consuming<00:06:08.840> a<00:06:09.500> part<00:06:09.890> of<00:06:09.979> this<00:06:10.130> invitation

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.890 

I<00:06:15.199> don't<00:06:15.860> know<00:06:15.979> if<00:06:16.099> you<00:06:16.220> can<00:06:16.449> see<00:06:17.449> this<00:06:17.629> very

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900

I don't know if you can see this very
well<00:06:18.289> but<00:06:19.009> it's<00:06:19.220> it's<00:06:19.580> you<00:06:20.030> just<00:06:20.270> go<00:06:21.169> like<00:06:21.199> that

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
well but it's it's you just go like that

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.559 
well but it's it's you just go like that

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:23.569 
and then you have to kind of reach under

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:27.580 
and then you have to kind of reach under
here<00:06:23.930> and<00:06:25.180> attach<00:06:26.180> it<00:06:26.210> to<00:06:26.419> the<00:06:26.659> other<00:06:26.840> other

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
here and attach it to the other other
