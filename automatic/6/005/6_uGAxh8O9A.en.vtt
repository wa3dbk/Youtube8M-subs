this suit so huh and I think it looks
more<00:01:02.340> much<00:01:02.609> like<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> mutated<00:01:03.660> version<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
more much like a mutated version of the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.750 
more much like a mutated version of the
guy<00:01:05.549> yen<00:01:05.790> let's<00:01:06.060> see<00:01:06.979> this<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> normal<00:01:08.610> guy

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
look like 360 but it really really stiff

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.730 
look like 360 but it really really stiff
kind<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.530> my<00:01:55.740> Godzilla<00:01:56.370> knock<00:01:56.580> off<00:01:57.740> these

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
kind of like my Godzilla knock off these

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.320 
kind of like my Godzilla knock off these
arms<00:01:59.540> move<00:02:00.540> but<00:02:00.960> they're<00:02:01.200> also<00:02:01.620> stiff<00:02:02.330> the

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
feet also move but I will not bother

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.190 
feet also move but I will not bother
moving<00:02:05.580> them<00:02:05.940> because<00:02:06.300> it<00:02:06.570> took<00:02:06.750> me<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.960> while

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
moving them because it took me a while

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.830 
moving them because it took me a while
to<00:02:07.670> have<00:02:08.670> them<00:02:08.850> in<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.060> position<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.810> can

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
to have them in this position so you can

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.070 
to have them in this position so you can
stand<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.640> suppose<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> tail<00:02:12.090> can<00:02:12.360> rotate<00:02:12.570> but

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
stand I suppose a tail can rotate but

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.210 
stand I suppose a tail can rotate but
since<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.650> didn't<00:02:13.860> come<00:02:14.040> with<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.459> don't<00:02:14.730> know

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.280 

now<00:02:20.220> let's<00:02:20.610> just<00:02:20.790> compare<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> basic<00:02:21.840> six

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
now let's just compare to a basic six

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:31.910 
now let's just compare to a basic six
inch<00:02:22.500> figure<00:02:29.330> here's<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.450> 68<00:02:30.870> Godzilla<00:02:31.440> from

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
inch figure here's a 68 Godzilla from
