00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
of a random type pattern here you just

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.470 
of a random type pattern here you just
pick<00:03:09.820> that<00:03:09.850> ever<00:03:10.150> not<00:03:10.390> kick<00:03:11.200> those<00:03:11.410> back<00:03:11.680> off

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
put two clear ones in there I wouldn't

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.100 
put two clear ones in there I wouldn't
be<00:03:26.950> able<00:03:27.010> to<00:03:27.160> hook<00:03:27.310> those<00:03:27.490> up<00:03:27.550> whenever<00:03:28.450> ymf

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
be able to hook those up whenever ymf

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.260 
be able to hook those up whenever ymf
where<00:03:29.350> I<00:03:29.380> wanted<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.770> but<00:03:30.640> they<00:03:30.730> did<00:03:30.910> fill<00:03:31.180> them

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
where I wanted to but they did fill them

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.240 
where I wanted to but they did fill them
fill<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.959> spots<00:03:32.260> in<00:03:32.470> there<00:03:32.590> with<00:03:32.740> blank<00:03:32.950> spots

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
fill the spots in there with blank spots

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.900 
fill the spots in there with blank spots
so<00:03:33.490> you've<00:03:33.610> got<00:03:33.760> six<00:03:34.360> LEDs<00:03:34.840> in<00:03:34.959> your<00:03:35.050> light<00:03:35.230> bar

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
so you've got six LEDs in your light bar

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.470 
so you've got six LEDs in your light bar
two<00:03:36.910> rear-facing<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:38.310> then<00:03:39.310> I'm<00:03:39.700> sorry<00:03:39.850> one

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
two rear-facing and then I'm sorry one

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.240 
two rear-facing and then I'm sorry one
on<00:03:40.600> each<00:03:40.720> side<00:03:40.750> rear<00:03:41.200> facing<00:03:41.440> to<00:03:41.709> total<00:03:42.100> and

on each side rear facing to total and

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.699 
on each side rear facing to total and
then<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.700> four<00:03:42.910> in<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.090> front<00:03:43.470> kind<00:03:44.470> of<00:03:44.590> gives

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
then the four in the front kind of gives

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:45.990 
then the four in the front kind of gives
it<00:03:44.740> a<00:03:44.830> pretty<00:03:45.010> neat<00:03:45.160> flash<00:03:45.400> pattern<00:03:45.880> or

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
it a pretty neat flash pattern or

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.400 
it a pretty neat flash pattern or
looking<00:03:46.240> pick<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:46.690> up<00:03:46.780> from<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:46.959> top<00:03:47.140> there

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
looking pick it up from the top there

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.280 
looking pick it up from the top there
you'd<00:03:47.500> be<00:03:47.560> able<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:47.709> see<00:03:47.920> it<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:49.170> know<00:03:50.170> it

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
you'd be able to see it you know it

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.860 
you'd be able to see it you know it
fills<00:03:50.500> it<00:03:50.620> in<00:03:50.680> pretty<00:03:50.920> well<00:03:50.950> think<00:03:51.430> again<00:03:52.360> same

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
fills it in pretty well think again same

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.640 
fills it in pretty well think again same
with<00:03:53.050> the<00:03:53.140> light<00:03:53.320> bar<00:03:54.000> different<00:03:55.000> patterns

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
with the light bar different patterns

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.300 
with the light bar different patterns
everyone<00:03:56.650> was<00:03:56.739> going<00:03:56.890> through<00:03:57.100> all<00:03:57.160> the

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
everyone was going through all the

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.340 
everyone was going through all the
patterns<00:03:57.670> here<00:03:57.730> go<00:03:57.970> from<00:03:58.170> directional<00:03:59.170> type

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
patterns here go from directional type

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.430 
patterns here go from directional type
pattern<00:04:00.780> again<00:04:01.780> they<00:04:01.900> don't<00:04:01.989> show<00:04:02.200> up<00:04:02.320> very

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
pattern again they don't show up very

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.490 
pattern again they don't show up very
well<00:04:02.530> this<00:04:02.830> camera<00:04:04.110> there's<00:04:05.110> just<00:04:05.320> like<00:04:05.470> a

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
well this camera there's just like a

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.449 
well this camera there's just like a
solid<00:04:05.950> flash<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:09.390> then<00:04:11.070> this<00:04:12.070> one<00:04:12.280> here<00:04:12.400> is

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
solid flash and then this one here is

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.670 
solid flash and then this one here is
more<00:04:12.670> of<00:04:12.790> a<00:04:12.910> back-and-forth<00:04:13.720> type<00:04:14.290> pattern

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
more of a back-and-forth type pattern

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.460 
more of a back-and-forth type pattern
which<00:04:14.800> I<00:04:14.920> like<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.160> best<00:04:15.600> again<00:04:16.600> this<00:04:16.750> looks

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
which I like the best again this looks

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.110 
which I like the best again this looks
so<00:04:17.769> much<00:04:17.799> better<00:04:18.190> in<00:04:18.430> person<00:04:18.609> links<00:04:19.030> it

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
so much better in person links it

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.190 
so much better in person links it
everybody<00:04:19.419> says<00:04:19.570> that<00:04:19.600> once<00:04:19.840> they<00:04:19.900> receive
