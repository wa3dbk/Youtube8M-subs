00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
doesn't happen at all I was thinking of

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.190 
doesn't happen at all I was thinking of
coloring<00:04:22.079> in<00:04:22.169> his<00:04:22.320> eyebrows<00:04:22.800> was<00:04:23.810> black<00:04:24.810> but<00:04:25.110> I

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
coloring in his eyebrows was black but I

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.659 
coloring in his eyebrows was black but I
didn't<00:04:25.590> just<00:04:25.950> left<00:04:26.130> him<00:04:26.250> Brown<00:04:28.580> thought<00:04:29.580> it

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
didn't just left him Brown thought it

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.700 
didn't just left him Brown thought it
would<00:04:29.789> look<00:04:29.880> we<00:04:30.120> in<00:04:30.330> anyway<00:04:30.660> um<00:04:33.410> when<00:04:34.410> I<00:04:34.440> mixed

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
would look we in anyway um when I mixed

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.460 
would look we in anyway um when I mixed
up<00:04:34.800> that<00:04:34.979> paint<00:04:35.340> really<00:04:36.060> well<00:04:36.240> so<00:04:37.200> it<00:04:37.289> looks

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
up that paint really well so it looks

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.100 
up that paint really well so it looks
just<00:04:37.560> like<00:04:38.039> the<00:04:38.340> leg<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.639> color<00:04:40.789> then<00:04:41.789> I<00:04:42.360> think

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
just like the leg of color then I think

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.680 
just like the leg of color then I think
I<00:04:43.229> used

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:05:11.090 

so<00:04:50.690> this<00:04:51.849> kind<00:04:52.849> of<00:04:52.940> darkish<00:04:53.599> yellow<00:04:54.050> paint

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:20.370 

dark<00:05:12.100> green<00:05:12.400> paints

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.510 

and<00:05:20.830> this<00:05:21.130> kind<00:05:21.370> of<00:05:21.550> running<00:05:22.030> flesh<00:05:22.480> color<00:05:23.520> and

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
and this kind of running flesh color and

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.740 
and this kind of running flesh color and
I<00:05:24.580> think<00:05:24.790> it<00:05:24.850> makes<00:05:24.970> the<00:05:25.120> big<00:05:25.300> white<00:05:25.570> at<00:05:25.720> night

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
I think it makes the big white at night

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:36.480 
I think it makes the big white at night
