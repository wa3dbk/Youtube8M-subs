all right welcome back to the review of
the<00:00:02.939> perfect<00:00:03.389> grade<00:00:03.510> GPA<00:00:03.990> 1<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:04.440> here<00:00:05.190> we<00:00:05.310> have

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
the perfect grade GPA 1 and here we have

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.550 
the perfect grade GPA 1 and here we have
ourselves<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:06.029> nice<00:00:06.150> crutch<00:00:06.629> out<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.200> GPO

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
ourselves a nice crutch out of the GPO

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.680 
ourselves a nice crutch out of the GPO
one<00:00:07.910> sorry<00:00:08.910> about<00:00:09.059> that<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.330> just<00:00:09.510> makes

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
one sorry about that it just makes

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.799 
one sorry about that it just makes
recording<00:00:10.469> this<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.620> little<00:00:11.010> bit<00:00:11.130> easier

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
recording this a little bit easier

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.440 
recording this a little bit easier
anyway<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:13.009> here<00:00:14.009> we<00:00:14.099> have<00:00:14.250> our<00:00:14.429> front<00:00:15.120> skirts

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
anyway so here we have our front skirts

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.140 
anyway so here we have our front skirts
and<00:00:15.599> they<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.809> bit<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.440> articulation<00:00:17.150> both

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
and they have a bit of articulation both

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.529 
and they have a bit of articulation both
of<00:00:18.359> these<00:00:18.449> skirt<00:00:19.199> pieces<00:00:19.590> will<00:00:20.060> move<00:00:21.060> straight

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
of these skirt pieces will move straight

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.370 
of these skirt pieces will move straight
up<00:00:21.800> and<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.189> can<00:00:23.810> just<00:00:24.810> kind<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.140> glimpse

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
up and so you can just kind of glimpse

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.500 
up and so you can just kind of glimpse
in<00:00:25.560> there<00:00:25.740> at<00:00:26.250> some<00:00:26.340> minor<00:00:26.789> detail<00:00:27.210> it's

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
in there at some minor detail it's

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.200 
in there at some minor detail it's
nothing<00:00:27.840> all<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:27.960> special<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.099> they're<00:00:30.060> not

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
nothing all that special and they're not

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.359 
nothing all that special and they're not
they<00:00:30.810> can<00:00:30.929> do<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> bit<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.439> side<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.949> side<00:00:32.130> but

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
they can do a bit of side to side but

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.970 
they can do a bit of side to side but
not<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.210> much<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.899> doesn't<00:00:34.230> hinder<00:00:34.440> movement

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
not that much it doesn't hinder movement

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.139 
not that much it doesn't hinder movement
but<00:00:36.050> it<00:00:37.050> doesn't<00:00:37.350> help<00:00:37.530> either<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.399> guess<00:00:39.120> I

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
but it doesn't help either so I guess I

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.350 
but it doesn't help either so I guess I
just<00:00:39.390> did<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.660> because<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.840> could<00:00:40.730> these<00:00:41.730> side

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
just did it because I could these side

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.720 
just did it because I could these side
skirts<00:00:42.719> actually<00:00:43.680> don't<00:00:44.070> have<00:00:44.219> all<00:00:44.460> much

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
skirts actually don't have all much

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.420 
skirts actually don't have all much
articulation<00:00:45.590> it's<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.829> back<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.129> forth

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
articulation it's just back and forth

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.639 
articulation it's just back and forth
for<00:00:47.879> these<00:00:48.000> things<00:00:48.270> there<00:00:48.960> are<00:00:48.989> poly<00:00:49.379> caps

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
for these things there are poly caps

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.090 
for these things there are poly caps
which<00:00:49.829> are<00:00:50.329> kind<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.390> loose<00:00:51.860> when<00:00:52.860> putting

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
which are kind of loose when putting

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.069 
which are kind of loose when putting
them<00:00:53.250> onto<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.610> kit<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:54.329> gets<00:00:54.690> kind<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.020> hard

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
them onto the kit it gets kind of hard

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.360 
them onto the kit it gets kind of hard
because<00:00:56.360> they<00:00:57.680> there's<00:00:58.680> too<00:00:58.859> much<00:00:58.980> space

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
because they there's too much space

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.330 
because they there's too much space
between<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.570> back<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.170> where<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> poly<00:01:02.070> cap

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
between the back and where the poly cap

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.070 
between the back and where the poly cap
is<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> poly<00:01:03.149> cap<00:01:03.359> has<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> tense<00:01:03.840> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
is so the poly cap has a tense and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.560 
is so the poly cap has a tense and
tendency<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.920> push<00:01:05.280> back<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.360> try<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
tendency to push back we can try and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.510 
tendency to push back we can try and
stick<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.229> what<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.350> do<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.799> take<00:01:08.159> apart

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
stick it on so what I do is I take apart

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.600 
stick it on so what I do is I take apart
the<00:01:08.729> inside<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:10.470> black<00:01:10.710> piece<00:01:10.950> apply

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the inside of this the black piece apply

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.670 
the inside of this the black piece apply
it<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.150> kit<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.900> then<00:01:13.049> apply<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.350> white

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
it to the kit and then apply the white

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.920 
it to the kit and then apply the white
piece<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:14.790> makes<00:01:15.000> applying<00:01:15.330> these<00:01:15.659> side

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
piece it just makes applying these side

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.620 
piece it just makes applying these side
skirts<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.530> heck<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.890> lot<00:01:17.009> easier<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:20.630> these

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
skirts a heck of a lot easier and these

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.870 
skirts a heck of a lot easier and these
back<00:01:21.900> skirts<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:23.100> about<00:01:23.340> no

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
back skirts have just about no

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.730 
back skirts have just about no
articulation<00:01:24.330> because<00:01:24.869> they'll<00:01:25.080> impact<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
articulation because they'll impact the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.569 
articulation because they'll impact the
wing<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.520> core<00:01:26.820> fighter<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:28.490> nothing<00:01:29.490> to

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
wing of this core fighter so nothing to

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.840 
wing of this core fighter so nothing to
look<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.850> there<00:01:31.820> for<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> legs<00:01:34.340> they<00:01:35.340> are<00:01:35.490> here

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
look in there for the legs they are here

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.859 
look in there for the legs they are here
on<00:01:36.590> diecast<00:01:37.590> piece<00:01:38.040> there<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> diecast<00:01:39.509> part

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
on diecast piece there on a diecast part

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.080 
on diecast piece there on a diecast part
so<00:01:40.860> they<00:01:41.100> don't<00:01:41.280> snap<00:01:41.869> and<00:01:43.189> go<00:01:44.189> all<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.640> way

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
so they don't snap and go all the way

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.880 
so they don't snap and go all the way
forward<00:01:45.619> so<00:01:46.619> full<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.369> eighty<00:01:48.020> forward<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
forward so full and eighty forward and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.530 
forward so full and eighty forward and
just<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.369> get<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> knee<00:01:50.759> out<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.090> way<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
just to get the knee out of the way a

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.340 
just to get the knee out of the way a
full<00:01:52.290> 180<00:01:52.530> bend<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.280> knee<00:01:53.990> with<00:01:54.990> some

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
full 180 bend for the knee with some

pistons and some other and more frame
stuff<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.380> guys<00:01:58.560> can<00:01:58.829> detail<00:01:59.159> if<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.369> so

stuff you guys can detail if you so

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.410 
stuff you guys can detail if you so
choose<00:02:00.560> but<00:02:01.560> for<00:02:02.040> bringing<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.880> leg<00:02:03.060> back

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
choose but for bringing this leg back

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.020 
choose but for bringing this leg back
doesn't<00:02:05.420> go<00:02:05.540> as<00:02:06.110> far<00:02:06.140> but<00:02:07.100> you<00:02:07.640> still<00:02:07.850> get<00:02:07.970> some

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
doesn't go as far but you still get some

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.240 
doesn't go as far but you still get some
good<00:02:08.330> distance<00:02:08.509> then<00:02:09.500> plus<00:02:09.740> with<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.009> feet

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
good distance then plus with the feet

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.120

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
being able to do good bending you could

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.490 
being able to do good bending you could
probably<00:02:13.250> do<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.550> relatively<00:02:14.540> nice<00:02:14.810> kneeling

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
probably do a relatively nice kneeling

okay
they<00:02:25.790> all<00:02:25.910> have<00:02:26.090> their<00:02:26.270> individual<00:02:27.430> moving

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
they all have their individual moving

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.730 
they all have their individual moving
parts<00:02:28.730> this<00:02:29.600> part<00:02:29.660> can<00:02:30.140> detach<00:02:30.860> here<00:02:31.250> and

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
parts this part can detach here and

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.370 
parts this part can detach here and
these<00:02:33.740> die<00:02:34.580> parts<00:02:34.940> actually<00:02:35.300> come<00:02:35.630> apart<00:02:35.900> too

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
these die parts actually come apart too

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.420 
these die parts actually come apart too
it<00:02:37.100> opens<00:02:37.370> up<00:02:37.520> there<00:02:38.350> then<00:02:39.350> both<00:02:39.770> these<00:02:39.980> side

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
it opens up there then both these side

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.530 
it opens up there then both these side
pieces<00:02:40.670> it'll<00:02:41.540> work<00:02:41.660> with<00:02:41.840> me<00:02:42.010> yep<00:02:43.040> good<00:02:43.540> well

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
pieces it'll work with me yep good well

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.610 
pieces it'll work with me yep good well
actually<00:02:44.720> come<00:02:45.140> down<00:02:45.220> like<00:02:46.220> so<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:47.620> there's

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
actually come down like so and there's

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.550 
actually come down like so and there's
even<00:02:48.950> more<00:02:48.980> in<00:02:49.610> our<00:02:50.600> frame<00:02:50.810> detail<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.380> guys

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
even more in our frame detail you guys

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.150 
even more in our frame detail you guys
could<00:02:51.800> work<00:02:51.920> on<00:02:52.240> if<00:02:53.240> you<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:53.630> choose<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:54.200> can

see I did a small piston in there but
nothing<00:02:59.120> else<00:02:59.800> but<00:03:00.800> if<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.010> guys<00:03:01.130> really

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
hours on inner frame with this thing and

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.320 
hours on inner frame with this thing and
your<00:03:08.540> ankles<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:10.100> armor<00:03:10.430> can<00:03:10.640> go<00:03:10.820> back<00:03:11.120> and

there<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.860> like<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.160> saw<00:03:16.340> at<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:16.580> foot<00:03:16.760> you

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
there and like you saw at the foot you

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.180 
there and like you saw at the foot you
can<00:03:17.660> do<00:03:17.780> quite<00:03:18.140> an<00:03:18.320> impressive<00:03:18.590> bend<00:03:18.980> there

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
can do quite an impressive bend there

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.580 
can do quite an impressive bend there
and<00:03:20.890> an<00:03:21.890> impressive<00:03:22.630> Bend<00:03:23.630> this<00:03:23.900> way<00:03:24.110> but<00:03:24.350> I

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
and an impressive Bend this way but I

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.670 
and an impressive Bend this way but I
don't<00:03:25.220> see<00:03:25.430> how<00:03:25.550> you<00:03:26.330> could<00:03:26.540> logically<00:03:27.410> use

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
don't see how you could logically use

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.050 
don't see how you could logically use
this<00:03:27.950> Bend<00:03:28.370> with<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.390> foot<00:03:29.830> but<00:03:30.850> I'm<00:03:31.850> sure

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
this Bend with the foot but I'm sure

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.009 
this Bend with the foot but I'm sure
they'll<00:03:32.209> find<00:03:32.269> one<00:03:32.600> if<00:03:32.690> you're<00:03:32.810> really

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
they'll find one if you're really

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:40.090 
they'll find one if you're really
looking<00:03:33.140> for<00:03:33.320> it<00:03:35.080> so<00:03:38.200> just<00:03:39.200> bring<00:03:39.650> this<00:03:39.739> camera

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
looking for it so just bring this camera

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.340 
looking for it so just bring this camera
up<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.340> I'll<00:03:40.459> get<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.390> backpack<00:03:41.840> which<00:03:42.200> I

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
up and I'll get to the backpack which I

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.860 
up and I'll get to the backpack which I
should<00:03:42.530> have<00:03:42.650> got<00:03:42.799> to<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.459> done<00:03:44.390> earlier<00:03:44.810> but

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
should have got to the done earlier but

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.550 
should have got to the done earlier but
I<00:03:45.320> kind<00:03:46.280> of<00:03:46.340> spaced<00:03:46.610> it<00:03:46.840> so<00:03:47.840> here<00:03:48.410> with<00:03:48.500> the

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
I kind of spaced it so here with the

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.330 
I kind of spaced it so here with the
backpacks<00:03:48.980> you<00:03:49.160> can<00:03:49.310> see<00:03:49.670> your<00:03:50.299> beam<00:03:50.750> sabers

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
backpacks you can see your beam sabers

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.080 
backpacks you can see your beam sabers
each<00:03:52.340> just<00:03:53.110> pop<00:03:54.110> off<00:03:54.320> and<00:03:54.620> I'll<00:03:55.430> get<00:03:55.880> into

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
each just pop off and I'll get into

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.970 
each just pop off and I'll get into
further<00:03:56.269> detail<00:03:56.720> with<00:03:56.870> them<00:03:57.049> later<00:03:57.650> in<00:03:57.860> their

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
further detail with them later in their

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.630 
further detail with them later in their
view<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.870> the<00:04:00.080> end<00:04:00.350> they<00:04:00.950> have<00:04:01.130> slight

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640
