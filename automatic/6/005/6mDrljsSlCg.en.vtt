that<00:00:43.829> challenge<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.730> thought<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.539> was<00:00:45.690> quite

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
that challenge I thought that was quite

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.299 
that challenge I thought that was quite
interesting<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.710> could<00:00:46.890> tackle<00:00:47.100> those

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
interesting that you could tackle those

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.740 
interesting that you could tackle those
things<00:00:47.579> alone<00:00:47.820> if<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.180> wanted<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.480> challenge

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
things alone if you wanted the challenge

things alone if you wanted the challenge
one<00:00:49.469> thing<00:00:49.680> though<00:00:49.890> he<00:00:50.309> said<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:50.730> nobody<00:00:51.180> else

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
one thing though he said if nobody else

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.569 
one thing though he said if nobody else
joined<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:52.110> making<00:00:52.860> me<00:00:52.949> think<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.280> he<00:00:53.340> meant

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
joined in making me think that he meant

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.520 
joined in making me think that he meant
that<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.090> if<00:00:54.239> no<00:00:54.719> players<00:00:55.020> are<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.379> your

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
that is in if no players are in your

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.529 
that is in if no players are in your
area<00:00:55.920> or<00:00:55.949> those<00:00:56.370> players<00:00:56.610> decide<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.300> avoid

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
area or those players decide to avoid

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.080 
area or those players decide to avoid
the<00:00:57.750> event<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.530> no<00:00:58.649> one<00:00:58.770> ends<00:00:59.039> up<00:00:59.129> joining<00:00:59.399> not

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
the event so no one ends up joining not

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.970 
the event so no one ends up joining not
so<00:01:00.329> much<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.660> changing<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.199> setting<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.590> prevent

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
so much as changing a setting to prevent

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.740 
so much as changing a setting to prevent
anyone<00:01:02.190> from<00:01:02.309> joining<00:01:02.730> if<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.570> made<00:01:03.719> any

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
anyone from joining if that made any

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.960 
anyone from joining if that made any
sense<00:01:03.890> now<00:01:04.890> even<00:01:05.129> though<00:01:05.369> they<00:01:05.519> said<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.909> you

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
sense now even though they said that you

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.370 
sense now even though they said that you
have<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.270> opt<00:01:06.450> into<00:01:06.720> those<00:01:07.020> types<00:01:07.260> of

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
have to opt into those types of

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.800 
have to opt into those types of
experiences<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:08.280> still<00:01:08.970> think<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.270> basically

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
experiences I still think that basically

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.780 
experiences I still think that basically

they said that the world will be

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.870 
they said that the world will be
littered<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:22.560> what<00:01:22.920> earth<00:01:23.130> described<00:01:23.640> as

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
littered with what earth described as

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.660 
by light cooperative play I'm not sure
I'm<00:01:31.259> guessing<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.130> funner<00:01:32.400> or

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
I'm guessing it's just like funner or

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.700 
I'm guessing it's just like funner or
easier<00:01:33.090> little<00:01:33.390> objectives<00:01:33.930> things<00:01:34.560> like

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
easier little objectives things like

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.140 
easier little objectives things like
clearing<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.159> small<00:01:35.400> building<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.850> collect

something or killing a low-level boss
maybe<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.700> don't<00:01:39.180> know<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:39.990> they<00:01:40.110> go<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.530> say

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560

maybe I don't know but they go on to say

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that for those looking for a meteor

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.999 
that for those looking for a meteor
challenge<00:01:42.750> other<00:01:43.079> options<00:01:43.799> will<00:01:43.979> be

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
challenge other options will be

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.580 
challenge other options will be
available<00:01:44.130> then<00:01:45.119> ERG<00:01:45.450> says<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.259> might<00:01:46.409> do<00:01:46.560> a

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
available then ERG says you might do a

available then ERG says you might do a
strike<00:01:46.979> with<00:01:47.220> friends<00:01:47.759> or<00:01:47.880> arrayed<00:01:48.509> with<00:01:48.720> some

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
strike with friends or arrayed with some

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.660 
strike with friends or arrayed with some
of<00:01:48.990> your<00:01:49.140> best<00:01:49.290> friends<00:01:49.799> after<00:01:50.520> which<00:01:50.640> she

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
of your best friends after which she

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.910 
of your best friends after which she
added<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.180> raids<00:01:51.570> would<00:01:51.840> require<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.500> higher

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
added that raids would require a higher

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.310 
added that raids would require a higher
number<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.490> players<00:01:53.729> much<00:01:54.450> more<00:01:54.720> planning<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
number of players much more planning and

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.740 
number of players much more planning and
strategy<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.070> be<00:01:56.640> much<00:01:56.850> more<00:01:57.060> focused<00:01:57.570> for

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
strategy and be much more focused for

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.510 
strategy and be much more focused for
players<00:01:57.990> who<00:01:58.110> want<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.680> type<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.890> experience

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
players who want that type of experience

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.819 
players who want that type of experience
so<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.390> definitely<00:02:00.540> sounds<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.200> raids<00:02:01.560> will

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
so it definitely sounds like raids will

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.139 
so it definitely sounds like raids will
be<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.040> more<00:02:02.189> challenging<00:02:02.399> game<00:02:02.880> mode

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
be the more challenging game mode

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.330 
be the more challenging game mode
requiring<00:02:03.810> more<00:02:04.110> strategy<00:02:04.649> planning<00:02:05.070> and

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
requiring more strategy planning and

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.789 
requiring more strategy planning and
players<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:05.969> he<00:02:06.119> said<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.659> I'm<00:02:07.380> guessing<00:02:07.770> that

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
players as he said and I'm guessing that

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.770 
players as he said and I'm guessing that
things<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:08.310> kidding<00:02:08.610> out<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:09.030> specific<00:02:09.539> gear

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
things like kidding out in specific gear

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.940 
things like kidding out in specific gear
to<00:02:09.989> counter<00:02:10.319> each<00:02:10.530> raids<00:02:10.950> unique<00:02:11.400> complicate

to counter each raids unique complicate

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.290 
to counter each raids unique complicate
asians<00:02:12.160> could<00:02:12.580> be<00:02:12.700> part<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.060> planning

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
asians could be part of the planning

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.479 
asians could be part of the planning
process<00:02:13.629> and<00:02:14.080> I'm<00:02:14.709> guessing<00:02:15.129> that<00:02:15.160> things

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
process and I'm guessing that things

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.550 
process and I'm guessing that things
like<00:02:15.640> kidding<00:02:15.910> out<00:02:16.150> in<00:02:16.360> specific<00:02:16.870> gear<00:02:17.140> to

could be part of the planning process

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.699 
could be part of the planning process
it's<00:02:22.239> also<00:02:22.450> worth<00:02:22.569> noting<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.110> he<00:02:23.290> said<00:02:23.530> you

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
it's also worth noting that he said you

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.740 
it's also worth noting that he said you
might<00:02:23.860> do<00:02:24.069> a<00:02:24.099> strike<00:02:24.489> with<00:02:24.730> friends<00:02:25.239> but<00:02:25.629> then

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
might do a strike with friends but then

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.630 
might do a strike with friends but then
for<00:02:25.959> raids<00:02:26.170> he<00:02:26.440> added<00:02:26.800> some<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:27.310> your<00:02:27.430> best

destiny updates army but I think maybe

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.229 
destiny updates army but I think maybe
that<00:02:44.290> sounds<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.769> little<00:02:45.010> too<00:02:45.040> generic<00:02:45.519> what<00:02:46.180> do

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
that sounds a little too generic what do

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.880 
that sounds a little too generic what do
you<00:02:46.299> guys<00:02:46.480> think<00:02:46.540> does<00:02:47.110> that<00:02:47.230> sound<00:02:47.410> cool<00:02:47.620> or

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
you guys think does that sound cool or

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:48.930 
you guys think does that sound cool or
should<00:02:48.069> we<00:02:48.130> come<00:02:48.280> up<00:02:48.400> with<00:02:48.519> something<00:02:48.790> else

but<00:02:51.280> enough<00:02:51.519> rambling<00:02:52.000> back<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.450> news<00:02:52.630> the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
but enough rambling back to the news the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.440 
but enough rambling back to the news the
next<00:02:53.560> thing<00:02:53.680> eric<00:02:53.950> said<00:02:54.220> was<00:02:54.489> it's<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:55.120> shooter

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
next thing eric said was it's a shooter

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.780 
next thing eric said was it's a shooter
so<00:02:55.750> it's<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:56.019> skill-based<00:02:56.349> game<00:02:56.680> as<00:02:57.010> well<00:02:57.190> it's

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
so it's a skill-based game as well it's

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.000 
so it's a skill-based game as well it's
about<00:02:57.940> targeting<00:02:58.510> AI<00:02:58.720> that's<00:02:59.230> fun<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.530> worthy

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
about targeting AI that's fun and worthy

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.680 
about targeting AI that's fun and worthy
to<00:03:00.160> fight<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.640> using<00:03:01.120> your<00:03:01.150> skills<00:03:01.480> to

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
to fight and using your skills to

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.750 
to fight and using your skills to
overcome<00:03:01.810> them<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.590> believe<00:03:03.370> that's<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.670> first

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
overcome them I believe that's the first

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.759 
overcome them I believe that's the first
time<00:03:04.060> players<00:03:04.599> skill<00:03:04.900> has<00:03:05.079> ever<00:03:05.290> really<00:03:05.500> come

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
time players skill has ever really come

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.319 
time players skill has ever really come
up<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.099> I<00:03:06.340> think<00:03:06.519> that's<00:03:06.640> good<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.910> hear<00:03:07.180> at

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
up and I think that's good to hear at

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.690 
up and I think that's good to hear at
certain<00:03:08.019> points<00:03:08.319> in<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.470> demos<00:03:08.890> destiny<00:03:09.489> did

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
certain points in the demos destiny did

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.910 
certain points in the demos destiny did
seem<00:03:09.970> perhaps<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.450> little<00:03:10.569> too<00:03:10.720> easy<00:03:11.079> but<00:03:11.769> it's

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
seem perhaps a little too easy but it's

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.350 
seem perhaps a little too easy but it's
important<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.459> note<00:03:12.640> that<00:03:12.670> things<00:03:13.120> are

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
important to note that things are

of lighter content and the novelty of

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.229 
of lighter content and the novelty of
some<00:03:41.049> bigger<00:03:41.290> rocks<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.859> content<00:03:42.310> and<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.970> think

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
some bigger rocks of content and I think

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.000 
some bigger rocks of content and I think
we<00:03:43.420> have<00:03:43.450> a<00:03:43.569> really<00:03:43.810> good<00:03:44.139> first<00:03:44.410> stab<00:03:44.739> at<00:03:44.769> what

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
we have a really good first stab at what

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.610 
we have a really good first stab at what
we<00:03:45.310> think<00:03:45.579> people<00:03:45.910> will<00:03:46.030> enjoy<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:47.260> I<00:03:47.290> find

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
we think people will enjoy so I find

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.140 
we think people will enjoy so I find
that<00:03:47.709> pretty<00:03:47.889> interesting<00:03:48.430> they're<00:03:48.910> still

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
that pretty interesting they're still

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.309 
that pretty interesting they're still
deciding<00:03:49.450> on<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.780> balance<00:03:50.170> between

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
deciding on the balance between

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.289 
deciding on the balance between
releasing<00:03:50.980> smaller<00:03:51.280> pieces<00:03:51.519> of<00:03:51.730> content<00:03:51.910> and

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
releasing smaller pieces of content and

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.900 
releasing smaller pieces of content and
larger<00:03:52.959> chunks<00:03:53.410> obviously<00:03:54.310> smaller<00:03:54.549> pieces

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
larger chunks obviously smaller pieces

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.400 
larger chunks obviously smaller pieces
are<00:03:55.150> nice<00:03:55.329> because<00:03:55.569> we<00:03:55.840> can<00:03:55.959> get<00:03:56.109> them<00:03:56.290> more

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
are nice because we can get them more

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.259 
are nice because we can get them more
frequently<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:57.340> we<00:03:57.430> keep<00:03:57.609> getting<00:03:57.730> new<00:03:58.000> things

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
frequently so we keep getting new things

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.330 
frequently so we keep getting new things
to<00:03:58.450> do<00:03:58.599> but<00:03:59.170> they<00:03:59.319> also<00:03:59.530> don't<00:03:59.829> have<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.099> depth

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
to do but they also don't have the depth

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.640 
to do but they also don't have the depth
and<00:04:00.549> scale<00:04:00.849> of<00:04:01.150> a<00:04:01.209> large<00:04:01.420> expansion<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.290> I

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
and scale of a large expansion and I

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.720 
and scale of a large expansion and I
personally<00:04:03.010> think<00:04:03.280> there's<00:04:03.519> something

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
personally think there's something

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.009 
personally think there's something
exciting<00:04:04.090> about<00:04:04.329> waiting<00:04:04.750> for<00:04:04.900> them<00:04:04.989> to

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
exciting about waiting for them to

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.780 
exciting about waiting for them to
finish<00:04:05.230> a<00:04:05.380> big<00:04:05.650> hunk<00:04:05.889> and<00:04:06.099> then<00:04:06.459> getting<00:04:06.639> it

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
finish a big hunk and then getting it

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.909 
finish a big hunk and then getting it
all<00:04:06.940> at<00:04:07.090> once<00:04:07.329> but<00:04:08.019> of<00:04:08.139> course<00:04:08.169> the<00:04:08.500> balance<00:04:08.799> is

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
all at once but of course the balance is

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.670 
all at once but of course the balance is
important<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.459> keep<00:04:09.579> everyone<00:04:09.880> interested

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
important to keep everyone interested

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.080 
important to keep everyone interested
