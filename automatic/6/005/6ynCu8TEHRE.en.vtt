00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
your options I like the texture scaling

your options I like the texture scaling
on<00:03:25.080> nearest<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:26.070> it's<00:03:26.790> just<00:03:27.090> because<00:03:27.480> it

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
on nearest and it's just because it

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.259 
on nearest and it's just because it
gives<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.530> more<00:03:28.799> of<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:29.070> blocky<00:03:29.640> look<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:32.269> hope

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
gives it more of a blocky look I hope

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.780
