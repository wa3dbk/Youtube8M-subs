00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.570
 made our mommy 993 friend who is 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:13.090
 nothing more and nothing less than the currency for 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.400
 the fish 2013 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.240

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.220
 video description 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.039
 well once downloaded the file les 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.390
 there will be a rar file like this we do 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.390
 right click extract here 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.770
 oh, what's up 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.090
 it's not mine but it's from emma and I've only 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.180
 made this video so they know how 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.489
 install it and share it with you 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.390
 well once brought him a 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.390
 folder like this 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.899
 what we are going to do is open it 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.890
 and here I have a file engine 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:03.400
 we have to copy what is inside 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:08.190
 the 306 ing folder 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:11.560
 to the game folder we copy it now 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.899
 we go in the game folder 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.229
 even if they have the game installed on 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.299
 true they have to have the pc installed 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.000
 and it is very important that they have installed 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:25.659
 of the pcb and if not, it can not be 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.600
 once inside the ps folder and we're going 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:34.860
 to the ing folder we go to the 16 and m 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.860
 we paste the file 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.850
 you do not get this because I already 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.960

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.080
