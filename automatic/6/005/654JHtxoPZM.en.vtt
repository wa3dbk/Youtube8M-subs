00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.540
 and it talks about the freedom of the human being 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.330
 at this time the races 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.080
 extraterrestrial races reactivity 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:18.349
 they are prevented from being this human that has 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.140
 a peremptory need to evolve 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.810
 do not finish taking that quantum leap that 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.300
 everyone 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.300
 well wait 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.070
 these entities are not giving us the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.439
 Tripping to say it in some way 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.680
 so that we do not discover who we are 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.800
 that's really the biggest problem 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.899
 beyond the extraterrestrial theme is 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.940
 precisely in discovering us 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.430
 of our essences and our 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.079
 potential and in that we are and I think that 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.089
 that they will not be able to prevent even they 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.510
 nor is anyone else part of a process 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:53.970
 cosmic in the universe 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.359
 relatively recently we are 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.620
 realizing since everything is cyclical what 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.180
 what happened in the past goes back to 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.090
 repeat itself in the future and we are always 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.769
 in a kind of evolution loop 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.300
 so now it's a very 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.850
 important 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.620
 on December 21, 2012 people 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.680
 believes that nothing like this has happened 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.660
 and something else is happening is that the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.800
 perceive people are talking about 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.480
 energy we are talking about 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.120
 molecular transformation we are 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.970
 talking about level transformation 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.290
 mystic deep to the mystic then clear 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.150
 people are very easy to say that they have not 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.010
 past nothing but if there is a 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.110
 transformation of consciousness to all 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.180
 the levels 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.180
 How can we contact you? 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.130
 ask him finally know good 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.940
 I have a website dedicated to the subject of 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.700
 use not here some book that I'm good 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.100
 and followed yes yes I wrote recently 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.020
 a book about the osasuna here is titled 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.120
 Well, that's what the students and creators 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.340
 of humanity and in which he explored everything 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.710
 the theme of human creation too 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.310
 I have other astrology illuminated by 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.910
 the stars and now also comes a 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.580
 third work on the way and good all this 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.680
 information all this data can be 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.480
 find on my website that is 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.030
 also parcerisa punch dot com.ar 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.430
 so many 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.650
 what awaits us immediately to the 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.080
 human beings there is something you have to give a 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.060
 way you are investigating that all 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.900
 we do not know yet 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.220
 Well, I do not think I'm the person 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.850
 suitable to give new information 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.430
 original I think I 'm just 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.710
 investigating what almost everyone 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.010
 look what is to find yourself 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.690
 look for this awakening of conscience and 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.970
 I think we're going to get it all 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.680
 together it's not about that extended 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.910
 optimistic because the times are not 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.260
 precisely 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.129
 accompany 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.720
 the crises in the background are good in the 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.939
 economic crisis 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.980
 you will see that there is crisis at all levels 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:08.379
 and of course, it's an economic crisis 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.269
 spiritual crisis meaning crisis 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:14.019
 the existential life at all levels 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.849
 is this we're about to dream this I 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.319
 I think so because when we are at 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.610
 edge of the precipice is when the being 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.220
 human 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.260
 their resources emerge to see where 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.380
 can hold on or where is it 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.930
 falling down 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.450
 then that's when one 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.099
 in some way it merges with the 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.109
 universe we have to melt ourselves with the 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.849
 universe at the level of consciousness 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.849
 thank you very much to you
