what<00:00:04.230> is<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.440> jet<00:00:04.650> sir<00:00:04.890> it's<00:00:05.460> basically<00:00:05.940> a

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
what is the jet sir it's basically a

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.030 
what is the jet sir it's basically a
surfboard<00:00:06.480> with<00:00:06.899> an<00:00:07.020> engine<00:00:07.290> inside<00:00:07.620> it<00:00:07.770> you

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
surfboard with an engine inside it you

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.830 
surfboard with an engine inside it you
can<00:00:08.250> use<00:00:08.400> it<00:00:08.580> in<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.760> flat<00:00:08.940> water<00:00:09.179> or<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:09.750> the

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
can use it in the flat water or in the

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.890 
can use it in the flat water or in the
big<00:00:10.019> waves<00:00:10.260> as<00:00:10.469> well<00:00:11.150> now<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.179> wondered<00:00:12.660> what

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
big waves as well now I wondered what

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.460 
big waves as well now I wondered what
might<00:00:13.290> be<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.650> next<00:00:13.889> view<00:00:14.280> water<00:00:15.150> sport<00:00:15.570> this

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
might be the next view water sport this

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.140 
might be the next view water sport this
might<00:00:16.680> be<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.330> it's<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.449> game<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:19.580> lot<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.609> surface

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
might be a it's a game a lot of surface

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.240 
might be a it's a game a lot of surface

I<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.510> trip<00:01:12.780> out<00:01:12.960> how<00:01:13.220> how<00:01:14.220> powerful<00:01:14.729> that

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
I just trip out how how powerful that

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:15.870 
I just trip out how how powerful that
little<00:01:15.180> thing

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
little thing

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.240 
little thing
like<00:01:16.509> he's<00:01:16.689> on<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.840> water<00:01:17.079> and<00:01:17.320> it<00:01:17.469> hasn't<00:01:18.070> you

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
like he's on the water and it hasn't you

one<00:01:21.250> of<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.430> biggest<00:01:21.729> challenges<00:01:22.240> was<00:01:22.479> to

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
one of the biggest challenges was to

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.330 
one of the biggest challenges was to
find<00:01:22.960> an<00:01:23.079> engine<00:01:23.380> that<00:01:23.560> could<00:01:23.740> actually<00:01:23.890> fit

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
find an engine that could actually fit

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.010 
find an engine that could actually fit
inside<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.880> surfboard<00:01:25.329> there<00:01:25.570> was<00:01:25.659> nothing

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
inside the surfboard there was nothing

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.749 
inside the surfboard there was nothing
in<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.259> market<00:01:26.649> so<00:01:26.890> we<00:01:27.100> had<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.430> come<00:01:27.579> up<00:01:27.610> with

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
in the market so we had to come up with

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.270 
in the market so we had to come up with
a<00:01:27.880> completely<00:01:28.329> new<00:01:28.479> engine<00:01:29.020> we<00:01:29.829> had<00:01:30.009> to<00:01:30.130> come

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
a completely new engine we had to come

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.069 
a completely new engine we had to come
up<00:01:30.310> with<00:01:30.520> a<00:01:30.549> new<00:01:30.759> style<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.179> exhaust<00:01:31.570> that

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
up with a new style of exhaust that

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.230 
up with a new style of exhaust that
would<00:01:32.350> allow<00:01:32.679> the<00:01:32.860> board<00:01:33.159> to<00:01:33.280> operate<00:01:33.759> in<00:01:34.060> such

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
would allow the board to operate in such

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.450 
would allow the board to operate in such
a<00:01:34.270> confined<00:01:34.720> space<00:01:34.899> without<00:01:35.530> getting<00:01:36.009> too<00:01:36.220> hot

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
a confined space without getting too hot

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.700 
a confined space without getting too hot
here<00:01:37.060> is<00:01:37.179> the<00:01:37.329> throttle<00:01:37.569> so<00:01:38.079> it<00:01:38.229> works<00:01:38.439> just

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
here is the throttle so it works just

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.889 
here is the throttle so it works just
like<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.250> jet<00:01:39.579> ski<00:01:39.700> or<00:01:39.970> a<00:01:40.060> motorbike<00:01:40.450> you

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
like a jet ski or a motorbike you

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.870 
like a jet ski or a motorbike you
squeeze<00:01:41.200> this<00:01:41.409> trigger<00:01:41.590> here<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.670> board

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
squeeze this trigger here and the board

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.330 
squeeze this trigger here and the board
goes<00:01:43.060> faster<00:01:43.569> or<00:01:43.659> slower<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:44.740> have<00:01:44.920> this<00:01:45.069> kill

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
goes faster or slower you have this kill

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.590 
goes faster or slower you have this kill
switch<00:01:45.369> here<00:01:45.789> which<00:01:45.970> goes<00:01:46.119> around<00:01:46.329> your<00:01:46.539> wrist

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
switch here which goes around your wrist

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.929 
switch here which goes around your wrist
for<00:01:46.990> safety<00:01:47.380> it's<00:01:47.920> also<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.399> way<00:01:48.490> you<00:01:48.549> start

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
for safety it's also the way you start

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.240 
for safety it's also the way you start
the<00:01:49.060> port<00:01:49.299> so<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:49.780> put<00:01:50.049> this<00:01:50.170> in<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:50.979> you<00:01:51.069> wait

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
the port so you put this in and you wait

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.070 
the port so you put this in and you wait
five<00:01:51.490> seconds<00:01:51.970> and<00:01:52.240> then<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.509> board<00:01:52.720> starts

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
five seconds and then the board starts

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:05.399 
five seconds and then the board starts
automatically

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.350
