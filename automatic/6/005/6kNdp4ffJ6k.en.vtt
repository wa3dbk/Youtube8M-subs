00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
very good auto rifle and I believe that

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.410

upgraded<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.470> necro<00:03:07.860> chasm<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.820> will<00:03:09.090> be

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
upgraded to the necro chasm this will be

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.050 
upgraded to the necro chasm this will be
the<00:03:09.270> new<00:03:09.750> Beck's<00:03:10.200> mythic<00:03:10.650> class<00:03:10.860> I<00:03:11.130> believe

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
the new Beck's mythic class I believe

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.820 
the new Beck's mythic class I believe
that<00:03:12.209> it<00:03:12.330> does<00:03:12.510> cause<00:03:12.810> art<00:03:13.080> damage<00:03:13.410> though<00:03:13.620> so

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
that it does cause art damage though so

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.560 
that it does cause art damage though so
it<00:03:14.190> won't<00:03:14.370> be<00:03:14.520> solar<00:03:14.820> so<00:03:15.090> if<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.270> have<00:03:15.390> both

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
it won't be solar so if you have both

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.810 
it won't be solar so if you have both
those<00:03:15.750> weapons<00:03:15.959> you'll<00:03:16.770> be<00:03:16.920> set<00:03:17.310> for<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.610> code

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
those weapons you'll be set for the code

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.610 
those weapons you'll be set for the code
is<00:03:17.940> n<00:03:18.060> rate<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.570> you<00:03:18.900> can<00:03:19.019> definitely<00:03:19.170> get
