really<00:04:22.349> decided<00:04:22.770> yet<00:04:22.890> exactly

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
really decided yet exactly

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.180 
really decided yet exactly
approach<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.240> fight<00:04:24.420> I<00:04:24.690> merely<00:04:25.380> decided<00:04:25.830> yeah

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
approach the fight I merely decided yeah

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.800 
approach the fight I merely decided yeah
I<00:04:26.220> mean<00:04:26.430> I<00:04:26.490> think<00:04:26.670> patience<00:04:27.270> is<00:04:27.390> a<00:04:27.420> little<00:04:27.690> bit

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
I mean I think patience is a little bit

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.580 
I mean I think patience is a little bit
more<00:04:28.020> of<00:04:28.770> a<00:04:29.010> key<00:04:29.220> then<00:04:29.540> I'm<00:04:30.540> gonna<00:04:30.720> have<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:31.140> put

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
more of a key then I'm gonna have to put

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.640 
more of a key then I'm gonna have to put
patience<00:04:32.180> down<00:04:33.180> as<00:04:33.360> a<00:04:33.660> key<00:04:33.960> factor<00:04:34.380> in<00:04:34.410> this

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
patience down as a key factor in this
