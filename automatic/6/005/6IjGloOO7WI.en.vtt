00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.860
 I had once said to you and I loved it 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.139
 oriental cuisine today a sample of it 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.290
 we will cook fruit sushi with sauce 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.290
 raspberry 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.869
 the ingredients we need are 150 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.250
 grams of round error 300 milliliters 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:36.290
 of water 175 milliliters of coconut milk 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.290
 75 grams of sugar and exotic fruits 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.230
 and for our raspberry sauce 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.420
 we will need 225 grams of raspberries 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.420
 red and 25 grams of sugar 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.560
 hi this 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.560
 the first step will be to prepare well ice cream 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.130
 for this we will wash very well in order 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.590
 to take all the starch they 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.820
 will be perfect when we see that 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.820
 the water comes out crystal clear 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.900
 what we will do next will be to throw 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.860
 the rice in a pot with the 300 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.860
 milliliters of water 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.799
 stir well 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.960
 and we add coconut milk 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.550
 and we remove again 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.990
 the next step will be to take it to the fire 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.490
 we will have it for 25 minutes without 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.790
 stop stirring so that we do not get 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.790
 stick 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.390
 I recommend that you put it on fire very 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.250
 very slow we should try to make it 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.250
 cook without adding water drop 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.970
 Look how it has to look, you see us 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.970
 practically without any liquid 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.060
 the last step that you have to add the 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.060
 sugar and let it sit overnight 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.720
 sugar will soften the taste of milk 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.520
 of coconut and it will give a special touch that 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.790
 goes great with the fruits that we have 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.790
 selected 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.210
 we can only remove a little bit that 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.890
 mix well rice and sugar 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.890
 and we will have it ready 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.120
 is already resting what we have left is 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.120
 form sushi pieces 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.000
 and do it with your hands and try 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.269
 form more or less pieces of it 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.269
 size 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.860
 the pieces of fruit 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:16.830
 for this we will use mango pineapple kiwi and 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.830
 cannon 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.260
 we will peel and chop we have the fruit 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.390
 our taste is important that all 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.720
 the pieces have a more or less 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.720
 same 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.379
 and we can prepare the pieces of 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.379
 sushi to put the fruit on top 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.170
 and place them with care and we make sure 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.170
 that are firm 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.970
 Watch now we have almost ready 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.630
 and no longer finish our pieces of 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.160
 sushi but not the ducks detail 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.340
 we will prepare our particular sauce 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.340
 soy 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.870
 for this we will chop the raspberries and the 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.360
 sugar in order to get our 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.610
 salsa if at the end of the continue noticing 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.820
 very acidic added a little more than 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.820
 sugar 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.080
 raspberries are rich in Vitamin C 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.610
 besides being a powerful antioxidant 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.610
 for our organism 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.960
 equal to our particular soy sauce 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.960
 completed 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.330
 and now
