00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.580
 the Andean bear also known as bear 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.860
 of spectacles is the only species of bear 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.720
 who live in america lives in the 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.810
 mountain range of the andes in venezuela 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.800
 colombia peru bolivia and ecuador between 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.410
 200 and up to 4 thousand 750 meters on the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.720
 sea ​​level that is perhaps the species 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.210
 most charismatic of wildlife in 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.580
 Colombia and is considered as the guardian 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.839
 of the páramos and the water since it is a 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.809
 umbrella species 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:45.299
 this means that your protection leads 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.299
 to the conservation of other species and 

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:50.760
 ecosystems the Andean bear is characterized 

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:53.070
 for its dark black coat with spots 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.489
 clear on the face neck and chest that 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.650
 they are unique in each individual the sense 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.769
 most developed of these bears is the 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.650
 smell 107 times more powerful than that of 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.810
 a dog the adult males followed 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.689
 on the hind legs reach to 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.750
 measure up to 2 meters with a weight of 140 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.700
 to 175 kilograms 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.860
 while females are a third 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.620
 smaller reaching a height 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.050
 maximum of 16 meters 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.450
 It feeds mainly on plants 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.600
 like rains and bromeliads of fruits 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.640
 sweet like grape shrimp animals 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.820
 wild as you speak deer and 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.940
 insects and occasionally cows and 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.710
 sheep being a scavenger contributes 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.420
 the decomposition of dead animals 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.540
 the use is mainly of habits 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.030
 diurnal solitary day the exception is 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.860
 when the female is with her offspring that 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.470
 stay with her until two years 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.210
 when they become independent and leave in 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.680
 search for a new territory for 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.620
 live 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.050
 It is estimated that they live up to 30 years in the 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.600
 nature the Andean bear has 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.760
 cataloged as a vulnerable species to the 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.830
 extinction according to the criteria of the 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.220
 international union for conservation 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.100
 of nature press and ministry 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.440
 of environment and sustainable development 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.900
 main threat to the existence of 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.030
 bear is the fragmentation of its habitat 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.910
 natural generated by the development 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.459
 economic crisis in Colombia as 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.890
 also by hunting with practice to 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.140
 exhibition for traditional uses or 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.690
 medicinal or in response to the attack 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.260
 of livestock or consumption of crops of the 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.880
 communities surrounding your app in 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.100
 Colombia has registered the presence 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.980
 of the Andean bear mainly in 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.350
 forest ecosystems have liébana 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.660
 where he finds suitable conditions 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.790
 for their subsistence so the 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.820
 national parks protected areas 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.790
 natural resources are important as a refuge and 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.130
 for the existence of the species you know 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.360
 little of this mammal since it is difficult 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.280
 study it 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.440
 the geographical conditions of access 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.350
 difficult to your habitat the lack of 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.740
 technology and economic resources that 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.990
 among other factors make it difficult 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.740
 research on the species 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.920
 However, since 2007 and with the 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:24.610
 support of the wildlife conservation society 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.040
 wcs the program has been developed 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.620
 Andean bear monitoring in the park 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.780
 national natural chingaza which is a 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.510
 pilot program for the other areas 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.030
 protected in colombia 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.739
 the monitoring program has been based on 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.319
 the lifting of information in two 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.060
 techniques the first one focuses on 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.489
 document direct observation and 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.040
 indirect of the species related to 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:52.599
 the records of your prints with nurseries 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.209
 and aces with which it is known that in 47% 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.620
 from the western region of the park 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.150
 there is a hundred percent occupation 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.150
 hundred of the Andean bear 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.599
 the second technique focuses on 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.329
 identify the number of individuals 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:11.329
 present in the park through the 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.129
 photo trapping since 2011 has been 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.829
 monitored the species with cameras 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:18.079
 trap that capture useful images in 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.570
 the individual recognition of bears by 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.789
 half of spots on the face neck and 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.360
 chest unique features for each 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:28.280
 individual the photoframe allows to know 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.830
 aspects of behavior and use of 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.680
 habitat in addition to the identification of 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.260
 bears that consume cattle and therefore 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.360
 generate management strategies with 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.940
 communities in areas of influence of 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.580
 park by not killing the bear when attacked 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.710
 my won my family and I decided 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.000
 put on the conservation shirt 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.979
 now before the tuna in 2011 and 2014 it 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.169
 they installed trap cameras in a small 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.139
 portion of the park with the result that 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:00.250
 in a month effective sampling is 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:02.900
 they identified about 22 bears 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.030
 currently monitoring the species 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.950
 it's a commitment led by the team 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.220
 of the natural national park 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.930
 supported by the double use is where it 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.720
 Expected study units expanded 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.850
 improve the phototraping technique and 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.620
 continue to link communities and 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.840
 local environmental authorities and 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.230
 regional initiatives in the conservation of 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.020
 gandhi 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.750
 the bears that live in zinc azsa are 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.520
 important for conservation as 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.220
 contribute to the dispersion of 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.320
 seeds knock down bushes that allow 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.560
 the passage of light to renew the 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.720
 forests that next to the páramo are vital 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.870
 for water supply 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.640
 in this way they also contribute with 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.070
 the well-being and health of more than 10 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:51.580
 millions of people in Bogota and areas 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.530
 also surrounding the information 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.750
 has generated with active participation 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.760
 of the communities and institutions of the 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.370
 region has made changes in the 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:05.050
 perception of the or some 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:07.420
 distant or non-existent animal now 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.550
 neighbors speak with emotion of the 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.710
 encounters they have with the species and 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.170
 they are aware of the importance of their 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.720
 conservation in this way is 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:19.180
 consolidate cooperation links between 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.780
 natural national parks and the
