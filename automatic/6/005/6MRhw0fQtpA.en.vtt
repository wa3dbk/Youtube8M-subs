pretty<00:00:39.540> good<00:00:39.720> start<00:00:40.220> let<00:00:41.220> me<00:00:41.250> read<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
pretty good start let me read you the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.810 
pretty good start let me read you the
strength<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.210> these<00:00:42.830> it<00:00:43.830> has<00:00:43.890> eight

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820
