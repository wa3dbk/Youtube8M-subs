00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
the green moon will be revolving around

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.840 
the green moon will be revolving around
the<00:04:06.220> earth<00:04:06.750> now<00:04:07.750> once<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.500> moon<00:04:08.850> gets

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
the earth now once the moon gets

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.340 
the earth now once the moon gets
abducted<00:04:10.470> into<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:12.310> Earth's<00:04:12.550> shadow<00:04:13.120> a<00:04:13.450> lunar

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
abducted into the Earth's shadow a lunar

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.750 
abducted into the Earth's shadow a lunar
eclipse<00:04:14.530> is<00:04:15.490> formed<00:04:16.150> and<00:04:17.040> when<00:04:18.040> the<00:04:18.520> moon

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
eclipse is formed and when the moon

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.530 
eclipse is formed and when the moon
leaves<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:20.080> Earth's<00:04:20.320> shadow<00:04:21.240> the<00:04:22.240> lunar

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
leaves the Earth's shadow the lunar

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.120 
leaves the Earth's shadow the lunar
eclipse<00:04:23.140> is<00:04:23.590> no<00:04:23.860> more<00:04:25.320> this<00:04:26.320> happens<00:04:26.830> whenever

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
eclipse is no more this happens whenever

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.170 
eclipse is no more this happens whenever
a<00:04:27.370> full<00:04:27.730> moon<00:04:28.030> enters<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:29.080> shadows<00:04:29.940> so<00:04:30.940> why

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
a full moon enters the shadows so why

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.260 
a full moon enters the shadows so why
don't<00:04:31.450> we<00:04:31.600> get<00:04:31.840> a<00:04:32.080> lunar<00:04:32.770> eclipse<00:04:33.270> whenever

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
don't we get a lunar eclipse whenever

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.220 
don't we get a lunar eclipse whenever
there<00:04:34.570> is<00:04:34.600> a<00:04:35.020> full<00:04:35.260> moon<00:04:35.910> well<00:04:36.910> here<00:04:37.630> is<00:04:37.900> the

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
there is a full moon well here is the

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:45.840 
there is a full moon well here is the
case<00:04:40.770> Earth's<00:04:41.770> axis<00:04:42.730> is<00:04:42.940> our<00:04:43.720> a<00:04:44.170> tilt<00:04:44.850> this

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
case Earth's axis is our a tilt this

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.370 
case Earth's axis is our a tilt this
tilt<00:04:46.210> changes<00:04:46.720> every<00:04:47.380> day<00:04:47.970> you<00:04:48.970> can<00:04:49.150> see<00:04:49.380> it

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
tilt changes every day you can see it

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.230 
tilt changes every day you can see it
tilts

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.930 

see<00:04:55.780> if<00:04:55.870> guilty

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
see if guilty

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.980 
see if guilty
and<00:04:57.750> whenever<00:04:58.050> it<00:04:58.290> tilts<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:59.720> shadow<00:05:00.720> is

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
and whenever it tilts the shadow is

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.340 
and whenever it tilts the shadow is
changed<00:05:02.540> no<00:05:03.540> that's<00:05:03.780> how<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:03.990> share<00:05:04.320> of

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
changed no that's how the share of

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:11.510 
changed no that's how the share of
changes<00:05:07.730> also<00:05:08.730> the<00:05:09.480> moon<00:05:10.520> revolves

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
changes also the moon revolves

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.680 
changes also the moon revolves
differently<00:05:12.500> so<00:05:13.500> let's<00:05:13.770> say<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:15.210> earth<00:05:15.390> was

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
differently so let's say the earth was

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.800 
differently so let's say the earth was
on<00:05:15.780> this<00:05:16.140> tote<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:17.340> moon<00:05:17.550> still<00:05:17.880> revolves<00:05:18.390> but

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
on this tote the moon still revolves but

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.830 
on this tote the moon still revolves but
as<00:05:19.080> you<00:05:19.320> can<00:05:19.470> see<00:05:19.740> it<00:05:20.280> goes<00:05:20.580> above<00:05:21.090> the<00:05:21.510> shadow

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
as you can see it goes above the shadow

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.930 
as you can see it goes above the shadow
for<00:05:22.410> no<00:05:22.890> lunar<00:05:23.550> eclipse<00:05:24.030> same<00:05:24.780> with<00:05:24.990> this<00:05:25.940> the

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
for no lunar eclipse same with this the

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.210 
for no lunar eclipse same with this the
earth<00:05:27.210> goes<00:05:28.050> below<00:05:28.830> the<00:05:29.100> shelves<00:05:30.800> that<00:05:31.800> is<00:05:32.010> why

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
earth goes below the shelves that is why

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.630 
earth goes below the shelves that is why
lunar<00:05:32.730> eclipses<00:05:33.330> are<00:05:33.510> not<00:05:34.350> formed<00:05:34.710> most<00:05:35.400> of

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
lunar eclipses are not formed most of

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.840 
lunar eclipses are not formed most of
the<00:05:35.760> time<00:05:36.000> in<00:05:36.930> fact<00:05:37.140> the<00:05:37.620> only<00:05:37.650> time<00:05:38.430> that<00:05:38.700> a

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
the time in fact the only time that a

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.420 
the time in fact the only time that a
lunar<00:05:39.300> eclipse<00:05:39.450> is<00:05:40.200> formed<00:05:40.710> is<00:05:41.070> when<00:05:41.340> the

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
lunar eclipse is formed is when the

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.640 
lunar eclipse is formed is when the
Earth's<00:05:41.670> axis<00:05:42.450> is<00:05:42.630> on<00:05:43.140> an<00:05:44.540> eclectic<00:05:45.540> yes<00:05:46.350> it's

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
Earth's axis is on an eclectic yes it's

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.430 
Earth's axis is on an eclectic yes it's
eclectic<00:05:47.220> this<00:05:48.060> is<00:05:48.240> when<00:05:48.420> the<00:05:48.540> Earth's<00:05:48.720> axis

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
eclectic this is when the Earth's axis

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.470 
eclectic this is when the Earth's axis
is<00:05:49.830> that<00:05:50.130> a<00:05:50.750> 23<00:05:51.750> point<00:05:51.780> five<00:05:52.290> degree<00:05:52.740> angle

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
is that a 23 point five degree angle

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.320 
is that a 23 point five degree angle
this<00:05:54.480> is<00:05:54.690> when<00:05:55.220> the<00:05:56.220> moon<00:05:56.490> passes<00:05:56.760> directly

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
this is when the moon passes directly

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.990 
this is when the moon passes directly
through<00:05:58.110> the<00:05:58.230> Earth's<00:05:58.410> shadow<00:05:58.950> forming<00:05:59.850> a

lunar<00:06:00.630> eclipse<00:06:00.950> this<00:06:01.950> tilt<00:06:02.880> usually<00:06:03.600> happens

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
lunar eclipse this tilt usually happens

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.090 
lunar eclipse this tilt usually happens
during<00:06:04.260> the<00:06:04.770> winter<00:06:05.130> solstice<00:06:05.400> the<00:06:06.710> moon<00:06:07.710> also

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
during the winter solstice the moon also

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.480 
during the winter solstice the moon also
has<00:06:08.520> to<00:06:08.700> be<00:06:08.790> at<00:06:09.000> a<00:06:09.060> 5<00:06:09.360> degree<00:06:09.540> tilt<00:06:10.310> and<00:06:11.310> when

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
has to be at a 5 degree tilt and when

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.020 
has to be at a 5 degree tilt and when
you<00:06:11.610> have<00:06:11.760> those<00:06:12.000> two<00:06:12.480> key<00:06:12.840> aspects<00:06:13.530> a<00:06:14.030> lunar

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
you have those two key aspects a lunar

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:21.560 
you have those two key aspects a lunar
eclipse<00:06:15.240> is<00:06:16.230> formed<00:06:17.510> that<00:06:18.510> is<00:06:19.640> how<00:06:20.640> a<00:06:20.970> lunar

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
eclipse is formed that is how a lunar
