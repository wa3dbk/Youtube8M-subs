00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.849
 hello my name is Michael Borat and 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.950
 Today I will try to help those who 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.139
 wants to learn to pull more 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.730
 extremely bad weather today and us again 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.080
 come to the store sportmaster 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.090
 and since we are shooting indoors 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.890
 today's lesson will be focused on 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.689
 increasing the number by tags exactly in 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.210
 home conditions that is applicable 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.080
 opportunities and today I will be again 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.940
 help my good friend vova in what 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.620
 exercise you didn't want to increase your 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.540
 indicators you need first 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.940
 know what muscles from exercise 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.980
 performed by the muscles that are involved 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.590
 the loss of her is quite a lot but the main of 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.450
 them this is the latissimus dorsi and biceps 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.610
 these muscles are basically 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.230
 will be activated during pull-ups despite 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.969
 on the fact that the muscles that use 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.620
 pull-ups are completely opposite 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.390
 muscles that engage their desires 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.579
 common logic distributing the load will 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.079
 about the same that is pulling up 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.609
 wider grip gives more 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.469
 part of the load is large muscle groups 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.899
 that is, the broadest back muscles 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.670
 pull-up narrow grip give 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.640
 most of the load is smaller 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.900
 muscle groups ie biceps 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.549
 respectively, theoretically, the loss 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.600
 no wider capable capable 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.970
 give you more 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.710
 reps than potebnya narrow plus 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.979
 loss training no more than gimmick 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.810
 much more promising 1 bus 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.920
 the reach will not achieve much 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.840
 when it is not clear how 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.490
 let's train all the same 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.909
 how to increase the real 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.200
 the number of pull-ups on the bar 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.640
 just want to say that the loss is not it 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.820
 exercise with extremely uneven 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.590
 progress that is up to 20-25 times we can 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.820
 reached, in principle, easily and 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.070
 further to the guest in fact 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.470
 stops and to begin with 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.240
 parse a simpler plot but with 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.149
 which people most often encounter 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.700
 there is how to start catching up 20-25 times 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.200
 if you don't pull up that amount 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.549
 it becomes obvious that you are a beginner 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.380
 and that means you need as often as possible 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.659
 will be an exercise in order to 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.950
 minimum get used to it in order to 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.659
 let your body know what it is 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.060
 exercise will have to choose constantly to 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.829
 he will have to adapt very much 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.990
 good training program is extremely 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:11.170
 you can just play the ladder yourself 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.840
 a rule I think is clear to everyone first 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.610
 pull up once then 2 3 and so 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.950
 further until you reach your 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.209
 maximum limit will be exactly where you are 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.000
 failed to surpass their previous 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.129
 approach after that start going down 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.670
 that is, let's say if you stopped at 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:29.680
 ten pull-ups then comes 987 and 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.060
 so on until the end of the pause between your 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.470
 approaches it is desirable to minimize 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.510
 that is, you got down 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.880
 Ideally, they immediately climbed back and 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.290
 make the following approach advantage 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.970
 such a program is that it 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.459
 fully meets the pace of your progress 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.660
 and absolutely individually that is to my 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.010
 a look impossible to create a program 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.110
 which will be held each in 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.459
 which will be spelled out the numbers and approaches 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.750
 here the program will always be 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.819
 match the pace of your real 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.010
 progress to pass such a ladder 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.500
 must be at least once a day ideally 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.530
 two or three times and after two or three 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.430
 weeks you see real progress 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.380
 exercise with this way you can 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.100
 pretty quickly reach the desired of 20 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.989
 with a little 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.440
 and no tricks except enough 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.989
 there is no hard work here but what to do 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.350
 after 20 times how to train what have 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.209
 advance further after 20 25 times 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.889
 the amount of losses and is not limited even 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.639
 not the work of the main muscles that she 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.799
 engages 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.840
 their fatigue namely that man 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.880
 just stand to hang and from this his hands 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.920
 remain generally suitably your grip 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.540
 tired no number of repetitions from 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.980
 time spent and butt not 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.959
 that is, while he keeps you have to do 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.000
 as many reps as possible 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.579
 but the increase in execution speed 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.349
 reps can improve their quality and 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.400
 especially large increases in the amount of you 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.019
 she wo n't bring either 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.450
 accordingly you will need another 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.130
 for nero vach on i circuit like we already 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.230
 said in pull-ups on the amount 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.109
 a very important role is played by the strength of grip and 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.730
 endurance on this parameter 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.680
 in addition to training pull-ups you need 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.440
 to teach your hands krishna and the crossbar 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.060
 so train it separately or 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.160
 which is easier to contend as often as possible 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.010
 using Vietnamese what is it 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.659
 prominent and pulling up such pulling up 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.939
 after the bath approach in which you are not 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.799
 jump to the ground stay weight on 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.840
 one hand and try to rest on it 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.000
 accordingly changing hands alternately you 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.430
 trying to recover free not 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.169
 involved all by hand until 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.820
 Do not get tired of that on which you hang then 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.470
 changing your main task of such 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.090
 loss of them sooner or later learn 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.340
 recover with your free hand 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.210
 faster and better than tired arm on 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.310
 which you hang 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.479
 so that you can have a little 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.270
 rejuvenate in order to 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.650
 continue pulling and 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.300
 only when it happens can you 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.610
 extremely significant for progress in 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.469
 Bonnet in the shadows on the neck so far with weight 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.880
 on one hand 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:40.990
 The main benefit of this style of training 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.450
 is that you can 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.280
 at the same time progressing and hanging on 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.110
 the crossbar and immediately in pull up on 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.310
 amount i say exactly style 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.960
 workouts they 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.640
 performance for the very reason that on 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.810
 most competitions but we will ban 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.729
 rest on one hand 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.130
 but forbid you to rest on two hands 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.810
 no one can at a certain level 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.030
 mastering the British pull-ups you 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.950
 you can just take the weight on one hand in 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.110
 the second hand not to remove from the bar but not 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.610
 hang on it rest so i 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.440
 i 'm not talking about doing 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.580
 Tomsk scheme pull-ups you just 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.490
 can hang much longer 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.169
 pull up more is the only one 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.880
 the subtlety of such losses of some special 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.710
 marvelous not yachts that you should not in 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.330
 the first continuous approach lay out 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.740
 100 percent you should leave 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.320
 imagine some strength for 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.880
 to hang on one simple hand 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.500
 transition to a system of training 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.539
 insufficient for outstanding results 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.610
 but enough to 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:33.610
 progress further exist 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.070
 various gender training schemes 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.020
 amplitude wave pull-up loss 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.490
 no extra weight and for that 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.979
 to achieve exactly outstanding 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.659
 results need to be used and all but 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.490
 within one lesson 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:47.169
 applicable to all and working 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.539
 home conditions of this more than 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.250
 enough the same absolutely sure that 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.800
 most of you don't need any 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.520
 sky-high incredible numbers more than that 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.080
 they to me 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.330
 I need that is, I have the maximum approach 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.039
 in the pull-ups was 55 soak like 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.690
 you can use your knowledge more often 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:03.580
 develop the power of your reach not 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.289
 stop playing ladder with you 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.539
 or friends use different 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.919
 tricks hone technique and then 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.240
 you will certainly be successful 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.919
 want to say thank you so much 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.599
 sportmaster for granted 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.250
 able to shoot during horrible 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:17.319
 weather outside also for delivered 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.879
 me clothes and compact home 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.470
 simulator on which we filmed it 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:23.080
 thanks to all this our lesson today 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.970
 was born but for now try 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.590
 train swing sign on 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.419
 update write the desired topics 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:32.580
 videos in the comments on y tube and 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:32.580
 it will be even more interesting until 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.350
 as we said in pulling up 

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:09.059
 what exercise you didn't want 

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:12.259
 improve your performance no matter how well 

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:12.259
 let's try
