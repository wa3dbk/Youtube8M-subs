for arma 2 which is a military simulator

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.359 
for arma 2 which is a military simulator
game<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.869> mod<00:00:19.020> started<00:00:19.529> was<00:00:20.010> basically

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
game so the mod started was basically

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.790 
game so the mod started was basically
released<00:00:20.699> in<00:00:20.880> April<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.600> has<00:00:22.050> had<00:00:22.289> quite<00:00:22.500> high

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
released in April and has had quite high

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.859 
released in April and has had quite high
demand<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.210> obviously<00:00:24.480> been<00:00:24.660> quite<00:00:24.840> a

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
demand so it's obviously been quite a

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.109 
demand so it's obviously been quite a
challenging<00:00:25.410> project<00:00:25.949> trying<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.460> trying<00:00:26.970> to

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
challenging project trying to trying to

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.169 
challenging project trying to trying to
deal<00:00:27.269> with<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.980> so<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.580> know<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:29.789> my<00:00:29.970> aim

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
deal with that so you know it's my aim

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.060 
deal with that so you know it's my aim
to<00:00:30.210> sort<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.779> take<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.199> forward<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.679> see<00:00:31.830> if<00:00:31.920> we

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
to sort of take it forward and see if we

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.430 
to sort of take it forward and see if we
can<00:00:32.279> get<00:00:32.550> up<00:00:32.669> made<00:00:32.850> say<00:00:33.090> as<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.420> standalone<00:00:34.020> game

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
can get up made say as a standalone game

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.799 
can get up made say as a standalone game
so<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> lot<00:00:35.010> easier<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.430> install<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.600> for

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
so it's a lot easier to install and for

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.500 
so it's a lot easier to install and for
people<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.170> use<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.530> stuff<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.210> so<00:00:39.210> how

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
people to use and stuff like that so how

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.569 
people to use and stuff like that so how
restricted<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.290> feel<00:00:40.530> you've<00:00:40.710> been<00:00:40.739> being<00:00:41.399> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
restricted you feel you've been being a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.970 
restricted you feel you've been being a
mod<00:00:41.760> rather<00:00:42.570> than<00:00:42.690> us<00:00:42.840> download<00:00:43.200> game<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.680> think

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
mod rather than us download game I think

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.920 
mod rather than us download game I think
the<00:00:44.219> cool<00:00:44.399> thing<00:00:44.640> about<00:00:44.760> armor<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.840> it

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the cool thing about armor is that it

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.470 
the cool thing about armor is that it
out<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> box<00:00:46.620> supports<00:00:47.190> mod<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:48.329> has<00:00:48.450> a

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
out of the box supports mod and has a

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.750 
out of the box supports mod and has a
really<00:00:48.809> awesome<00:00:49.110> editor<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.370> people<00:00:50.640> can

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
really awesome editor that people can

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.250 
really awesome editor that people can
get<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.149> play<00:00:51.329> eve<00:00:51.510> nothing<00:00:51.809> odd<00:00:51.960> into

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
get in and play eve nothing odd into

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.069 
get in and play eve nothing odd into
with<00:00:52.440> modding<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.520> don't<00:00:53.789> think<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.539> not

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
with modding so I don't think it's not

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.139 
with modding so I don't think it's not
super<00:00:55.500> restrictive<00:00:56.039> but<00:00:56.309> obviously<00:00:56.699> what's

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
super restrictive but obviously what's

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.060 
super restrictive but obviously what's
trying<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.539> be<00:00:57.600> done<00:00:57.750> with<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> mod<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.469> very

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
trying to be done with the mod is very

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.399 
trying to be done with the mod is very
outside<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:01.280> ARMA<00:01:02.280> 2<00:01:02.430> does<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.420> dealing

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
outside of what ARMA 2 does so dealing

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.500 
outside of what ARMA 2 does so dealing
with<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.100> as<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.369> bit<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.850> an<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.270> know<00:01:06.360> as<00:01:06.479> a

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
with it as as a bit of an you know as a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.140 
with it as as a bit of an you know as a
bit<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.840> problem<00:01:06.869> sometimes<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:08.030> have<00:01:09.030> you

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
bit of a problem sometimes you have you

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.670 
bit of a problem sometimes you have you
had<00:01:09.330> much<00:01:09.659> support<00:01:10.170> from<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.470> view<00:01:10.619> /

politics<00:01:11.220> or<00:01:11.310> see<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.490> imagine<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.060> has<00:01:12.210> got<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
politics or see I imagine this has got a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.770 
politics or see I imagine this has got a
lot<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.659> sales<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.200> arma<00:01:13.590> 2<00:01:13.740> uh<00:01:14.040> yeah<00:01:14.880> look<00:01:15.060> bis

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
is really supportive of all mods not

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.700 
is really supportive of all mods not
just<00:01:17.729> Daisy<00:01:17.970> obviously<00:01:18.780> daisy<00:01:19.020> has<00:01:19.470> had<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
just Daisy obviously daisy has had a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.450 
just Daisy obviously daisy has had a
very<00:01:20.490> very<00:01:20.700> big<00:01:20.970> impact<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.479> sales<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
very very big impact on sales but the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.910 
very very big impact on sales but the
benefits<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.210> Daisy<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:25.290> gotten<00:01:25.710> out<00:01:25.860> of

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
benefits that Daisy have gotten out of

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.039 
benefits that Daisy have gotten out of
new<00:01:26.280> commands<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.150> fixes<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.720> stuff<00:01:27.869> like

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
new commands and fixes and stuff like

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.810 
new commands and fixes and stuff like
that<00:01:28.110> do<00:01:28.470> blow<00:01:28.890> through<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> other<00:01:29.460> mods

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
that do blow through to the other mods

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.370 
that do blow through to the other mods
so<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.150> think<00:01:30.360> that's<00:01:30.659> been<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.110> really<00:01:31.290> positive

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
so I think that's been a really positive

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.859 
so I think that's been a really positive
effect<00:01:32.040> not<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.700> Daisy<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.360> for<00:01:33.600> other

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
effect not just for Daisy but for other

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.859 
effect not just for Daisy but for other
mods<00:01:34.140> too<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.360> very<00:01:36.600> much

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
mods too so it's very much

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.510 
mods too so it's very much
survival-based<00:01:37.829> there's<00:01:38.130> no<00:01:38.250> real

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
survival-based there's no real

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.359 
survival-based there's no real
objectives<00:01:39.270> what<00:01:39.600> was<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.220> intention<00:01:41.220> behind

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
objectives what was the intention behind

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.780 
objectives what was the intention behind
that<00:01:41.790> yeah<00:01:42.450> well<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.720> think<00:01:42.780> having<00:01:43.380> those

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
that yeah well I think having those

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.450 
that yeah well I think having those
those<00:01:44.790> layer<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.270> subtleties<00:01:46.070> you<00:01:47.070> know<00:01:47.189> in

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
those layer of subtleties you know in

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.160 
those layer of subtleties you know in
order<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.790> survive<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.420> really<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> strength

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
order to survive is really the strength

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.200 
order to survive is really the strength
of<00:01:49.380> Daisy<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.220> you're<00:01:50.399> presented<00:01:50.880> with<00:01:50.880> this

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
of Daisy so you're presented with this

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.620 
of Daisy so you're presented with this
open<00:01:51.689> world<00:01:51.869> with<00:01:52.049> no<00:01:52.229> objectives<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.630> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
open world with no objectives and the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.899 
open world with no objectives and the
aspects<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.770> survival<00:01:56.280> are<00:01:56.369> kind<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.700> subtle

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
aspects of survival are kind of subtle

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.149 
aspects of survival are kind of subtle
so<00:01:57.299> any<00:01:57.600> one<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.930> them<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.350> not<00:01:58.530> particularly

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
so any one of them is not particularly

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.670 
so any one of them is not particularly
over<00:01:59.490> you<00:02:00.000> know<00:02:00.119> like<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.630> hunger<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.409> you

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
over you know like the hunger and you

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.560 
over you know like the hunger and you
need<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.979> drink<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.430> stuff<00:02:02.579> like<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.149> it

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
need to drink and stuff like that so it

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.569 
need to drink and stuff like that so it
adds<00:02:03.689> adds<00:02:04.049> kind<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.770> subtle<00:02:05.100> level<00:02:05.430> of

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
adds adds kind of a subtle level of

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.280 
adds adds kind of a subtle level of
thinking<00:02:06.030> two<00:02:06.329> things<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.899> think<00:02:07.110> that's

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
thinking two things and I think that's

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.050 
thinking two things and I think that's
what<00:02:07.530> maybe<00:02:07.829> attracts<00:02:08.220> people<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.879> it's

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
what maybe attracts people to it it's

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.420 
what maybe attracts people to it it's
maybe<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.840> call<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.259> throw<00:02:10.590> back<00:02:10.800> to

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
maybe a call I throw back to

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.280 
maybe a call I throw back to
you<00:02:11.640> know<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.239> days<00:02:12.420> like<00:02:12.689> when<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.959> was<00:02:12.989> gaming

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
you know the days like when I was gaming

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.660 
you know the days like when I was gaming
on<00:02:13.469> the<00:02:13.620> Amiga<00:02:13.859> and<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.159> where<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.430> games

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
on the Amiga and that where the games

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.369 
on the Amiga and that where the games
are<00:02:14.819> really<00:02:15.090> hard<00:02:15.299> and<00:02:15.780> they<00:02:15.900> force<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.290> to

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
are really hard and they force you to

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.789 
are really hard and they force you to
really<00:02:16.590> think<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.540> because<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.719> and<00:02:19.140> the

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
really think and because of that and the

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.709 
really think and because of that and the
challenge<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.939> having<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.299> deal<00:02:21.450> with<00:02:21.599> a<00:02:21.629> lot

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:21.719 
challenge of having to deal with a lot

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:25.039 
challenge of having to deal with a lot
of<00:02:21.870> human<00:02:22.500> players<00:02:22.799> and<00:02:23.189> has<00:02:23.519> a<00:02:23.549> real<00:02:24.049> like

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
of human players and has a real like

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.770 
of human players and has a real like
almost<00:02:25.290> emotional<00:02:26.010> impact<00:02:26.400> on<00:02:26.579> it<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:27.420> do<00:02:27.719> you

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
almost emotional impact on it so do you

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.199 
almost emotional impact on it so do you
think<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.170> other<00:02:28.620> human<00:02:28.950> players<00:02:29.310> makes<00:02:30.000> it

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
think the other human players makes it

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.819 
think the other human players makes it
more<00:02:30.329> difficult<00:02:30.510> or<00:02:31.019> easier<00:02:31.349> because<00:02:31.560> I'll

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
more difficult or easier because I'll

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.160 
more difficult or easier because I'll
see<00:02:32.010> this<00:02:32.189> betrayal<00:02:32.639> and<00:02:33.030> things<00:02:33.569> like<00:02:33.689> that<00:02:33.750> I

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
see this betrayal and things like that I

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.839 
see this betrayal and things like that I
think<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.709> makes<00:02:34.889> it<00:02:35.069> more<00:02:35.189> difficult<00:02:35.340> but<00:02:35.790> I

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
think it makes it more difficult but I

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.059 
think it makes it more difficult but I
think<00:02:36.120> cool<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.079> really<00:02:37.200> important<00:02:37.709> part<00:02:37.859> of

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
think cool and really important part of

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.520 
think cool and really important part of
it<00:02:38.189> is<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.430> people<00:02:38.849> get<00:02:39.239> this<00:02:40.170> opportunity

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
it is that people get this opportunity

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.449 
it is that people get this opportunity
to<00:02:41.900> two<00:02:42.900> players<00:02:43.170> as<00:02:43.530> they<00:02:43.590> want<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.310> you're

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
to two players as they want so you're

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.129 
to two players as they want so you're
not<00:02:44.549> really<00:02:44.609> forced<00:02:45.209> into<00:02:45.510> one<00:02:45.659> character

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
not really forced into one character

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.780 
not really forced into one character
style<00:02:46.379> and<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.650> think<00:02:46.859> that's<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.159> really<00:02:47.189> key

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
style and I think that's a really key

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.020 
style and I think that's a really key
tenant<00:02:48.150> we<00:02:48.299> want<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.569> key<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.669> know<00:02:50.790> as

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
tenant we want a key and you know as

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.580 
tenant we want a key and you know as
much<00:02:51.180> as<00:02:51.239> people<00:02:51.510> want<00:02:51.689> us<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.079> implement<00:02:52.319> all

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
much as people want us to implement all

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.559 
much as people want us to implement all
what's<00:02:52.799> humanity<00:02:53.340> type<00:02:53.549> stuff<00:02:53.849> to<00:02:54.030> stop

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
what's humanity type stuff to stop

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.240 
what's humanity type stuff to stop
random<00:02:54.959> player<00:02:55.200> killing<00:02:55.590> if<00:02:55.769> we<00:02:55.950> took<00:02:56.099> that

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
random player killing if we took that

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.920 
random player killing if we took that
away<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.700> would<00:02:56.819> really<00:02:57.090> destroy<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.569> spirit

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
away it would really destroy the spirit

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.740 
away it would really destroy the spirit
of<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.019> mod<00:02:58.430> so<00:02:59.430> how<00:02:59.819> much<00:03:00.000> work<00:03:00.419> did<00:03:00.629> you

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
of the mod so how much work did you

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.179 
of the mod so how much work did you
actually<00:03:00.900> do<00:03:01.169> to<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.379> armor<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.769> engine<00:03:02.069> how

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
actually do to the armor to engine how

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.479 
actually do to the armor to engine how
much<00:03:02.400> modification<00:03:03.180> how<00:03:03.629> many<00:03:03.810> hours<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:04.489> don't

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
much modification how many hours I don't

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.640 
much modification how many hours I don't
have<00:03:05.669> any<00:03:05.819> hours<00:03:06.180> quite<00:03:06.419> a<00:03:06.450> lot<00:03:06.689> a<00:03:06.900> lot<00:03:07.139> of<00:03:07.530> it

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
have any hours quite a lot a lot of it

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.399 
have any hours quite a lot a lot of it
is<00:03:07.799> really<00:03:08.370> more<00:03:08.549> about<00:03:08.730> taking<00:03:09.299> stuff<00:03:09.540> out<00:03:09.750> so

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
is really more about taking stuff out so

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.800 
is really more about taking stuff out so
there's<00:03:10.769> a<00:03:10.829> lot<00:03:11.129> and<00:03:11.340> armor<00:03:11.909> too<00:03:12.090> but<00:03:12.389> actually

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
there's a lot and armor too but actually

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.479 
there's a lot and armor too but actually
if<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.049> look<00:03:13.079> at<00:03:13.319> Daisy<00:03:13.560> it's<00:03:13.859> really<00:03:14.189> just<00:03:14.340> a

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
if you look at Daisy it's really just a

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.960 
if you look at Daisy it's really just a
simplified<00:03:15.030> version<00:03:15.209> of<00:03:15.720> armor<00:03:16.019> it<00:03:16.199> takes

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
simplified version of armor it takes

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.189 
simplified version of armor it takes
some<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.180> areas<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.540> are<00:03:18.750> problems<00:03:19.109> with

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
some of the areas that are problems with

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.050 
some of the areas that are problems with
armor<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.739> turns<00:03:19.919> them<00:03:20.069> into<00:03:20.220> strengths<00:03:20.790> and

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
armor and turns them into strengths and

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.689 
armor and turns them into strengths and
it<00:03:21.780> takes<00:03:22.079> away<00:03:22.379> a<00:03:22.409> lot<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.799> AI<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.579> was

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:23.699 
it takes away a lot of the AI that was

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:25.219 
it takes away a lot of the AI that was
causing<00:03:23.940> problems<00:03:24.449> because<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.900> don't<00:03:25.079> need

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:25.229 
causing problems because you don't need

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:27.520 
causing problems because you don't need
these<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.859> be<00:03:25.949> particularly<00:03:26.400> smart

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
these to be particularly smart

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.650 
these to be particularly smart
so<00:03:28.160> yeah<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.850> was<00:03:28.970> really<00:03:29.209> a<00:03:29.240> question<00:03:29.450> of

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
so yeah it was really a question of

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.180 
so yeah it was really a question of
spending<00:03:30.020> the<00:03:30.110> time<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.440> take<00:03:30.590> sup<00:03:30.830> out<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:31.160> a

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
spending the time to take sup out and a

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.910 
spending the time to take sup out and a
lot<00:03:31.370> of<00:03:31.430> trial<00:03:31.819> and<00:03:31.970> error<00:03:32.319> so<00:03:33.319> these<00:03:33.500> zombies

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
lot of trial and error so these zombies

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.559 
lot of trial and error so these zombies
like<00:03:34.459> you<00:03:34.700> say<00:03:34.880> they're<00:03:35.060> not<00:03:35.180> particularly

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
like you say they're not particularly

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.620 
like you say they're not particularly
smart<00:03:35.810> how<00:03:36.020> much<00:03:36.230> like<00:03:37.160> how<00:03:38.030> intelligent<00:03:38.600> are

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
smart how much like how intelligent are

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.000 
smart how much like how intelligent are
because<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:38.959> get<00:03:39.170> a<00:03:39.230> lot<00:03:39.350> of<00:03:39.560> range<00:03:39.830> between

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
because you get a lot of range between

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.390 
because you get a lot of range between
like<00:03:40.420> things<00:03:41.420> like<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:42.170> living<00:03:42.380> dead<00:03:42.500> or<00:03:43.010> like

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
like things like the living dead or like

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.240 
like things like the living dead or like
and<00:03:44.440> compared<00:03:45.440> to<00:03:45.500> like<00:03:45.590> left<00:03:45.800> for<00:03:45.950> dead<00:03:46.069> where

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
and compared to like left for dead where

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.640 
and compared to like left for dead where
there<00:03:46.370> are<00:03:46.430> a<00:03:46.459> lot<00:03:46.610> stronger<00:03:46.910> a<00:03:47.120> lot<00:03:47.300> smarter

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
there are a lot stronger a lot smarter

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.860 
there are a lot stronger a lot smarter
yeah<00:03:48.650> well<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:48.950> idea<00:03:49.069> is<00:03:49.280> that<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:50.450> zombies

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
yeah well the idea is that the zombies

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.650 
yeah well the idea is that the zombies
and<00:03:51.080> Daisy<00:03:51.290> are<00:03:51.470> infected<00:03:52.340> people<00:03:52.580> so<00:03:53.450> they

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
and Daisy are infected people so they

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.059 
and Daisy are infected people so they
they<00:03:54.290> should<00:03:54.760> act<00:03:55.760> quite<00:03:56.150> naturally<00:03:57.069> current

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
they should act quite naturally current

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.220 
they should act quite naturally current
versions<00:03:58.580> that<00:03:58.730> are<00:03:58.790> out<00:03:59.000> are<00:03:59.300> not<00:03:59.750> so<00:03:59.989> good

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
versions that are out are not so good

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.900 
versions that are out are not so good
they're<00:04:00.530> zombies<00:04:00.680> move<00:04:01.130> too<00:04:01.280> fast<00:04:01.489> their

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
they're zombies move too fast their

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.620 
they're zombies move too fast their
animations<00:04:02.570> are<00:04:03.220> basically<00:04:04.220> really<00:04:05.180> warped

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
animations are basically really warped

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.960 
animations are basically really warped
so<00:04:06.500> we're<00:04:06.650> trying<00:04:06.769> to<00:04:07.010> fix<00:04:07.190> that<00:04:07.400> as<00:04:07.580> much<00:04:07.790> as

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
so we're trying to fix that as much as

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.770 
so we're trying to fix that as much as
we<00:04:08.090> can<00:04:08.300> and<00:04:08.810> I<00:04:08.989> think<00:04:09.050> that<00:04:09.489> this<00:04:10.489> this

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
we can and I think that this this

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.910 
we can and I think that this this
version<00:04:11.780> we're<00:04:11.930> trolling<00:04:12.110> here<00:04:12.560> which<00:04:12.739> will

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
version we're trolling here which will

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.650 
version we're trolling here which will
be<00:04:13.010> released<00:04:13.130> soon<00:04:13.519> as<00:04:13.730> a<00:04:13.760> definite<00:04:14.209> step<00:04:14.480> of

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
be released soon as a definite step of

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.990 
be released soon as a definite step of
an<00:04:14.810> improvement<00:04:15.380> in<00:04:15.650> that<00:04:15.830> regard<00:04:16.130> so<00:04:16.549> they're

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
an improvement in that regard so they're

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.880 
an improvement in that regard so they're
supposed<00:04:17.329> to<00:04:17.450> be<00:04:17.600> reasonably<00:04:18.320> smart<00:04:18.590> they're

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
supposed to be reasonably smart they're

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.469 
supposed to be reasonably smart they're
definitely<00:04:19.040> supposed<00:04:19.489> to<00:04:19.640> be<00:04:19.700> a<00:04:19.790> real<00:04:20.090> threat

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
definitely supposed to be a real threat

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.390 
definitely supposed to be a real threat
but<00:04:21.049> you<00:04:21.350> know<00:04:21.440> obviously<00:04:21.560> they<00:04:22.370> can't

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
but you know obviously they can't

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.340 
but you know obviously they can't
compete<00:04:22.850> with<00:04:23.150> players<00:04:23.450> in<00:04:23.720> terms<00:04:23.930> of<00:04:24.020> being<00:04:24.200> a

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
compete with players in terms of being a

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.719 
compete with players in terms of being a
real<00:04:24.530> 3<00:04:26.320> we<00:04:27.320> a<00:04:27.680> lot<00:04:28.040> of<00:04:28.160> people<00:04:28.400> are<00:04:28.490> trying<00:04:28.610> to

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
real 3 we a lot of people are trying to

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.370 
real 3 we a lot of people are trying to
get<00:04:28.880> into<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.120> indie<00:04:29.389> development<00:04:29.900> industry

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
get into the indie development industry

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.190 
get into the indie development industry
how<00:04:30.710> did<00:04:30.919> you<00:04:31.040> come<00:04:31.250> about<00:04:31.370> into<00:04:31.820> it<00:04:32.169> well<00:04:33.169> I

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
how did you come about into it well I

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.900 
how did you come about into it well I
actually<00:04:33.470> have<00:04:33.800> a<00:04:33.860> military<00:04:34.070> background<00:04:34.430> so

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
actually have a military background so

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.670 
actually have a military background so
I've<00:04:35.150> kind<00:04:35.419> of<00:04:35.510> hovered<00:04:35.840> between<00:04:35.870> working<00:04:36.440> and

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
I've kind of hovered between working and

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.250 
I've kind of hovered between working and
games<00:04:36.979> in<00:04:37.280> and<00:04:37.640> in<00:04:37.790> the<00:04:37.910> military<00:04:38.090> and<00:04:38.510> I<00:04:38.720> think

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
games in and in the military and I think

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.930 
games in and in the military and I think
I<00:04:39.410> think<00:04:39.830> modding<00:04:40.160> is<00:04:40.250> a<00:04:40.310> really<00:04:40.550> good<00:04:40.729> way<00:04:40.880> to

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
I think modding is a really good way to

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.150 
I think modding is a really good way to
start<00:04:41.240> because<00:04:41.810> you<00:04:42.500> sort<00:04:42.860> of<00:04:42.979> launch

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
start because you sort of launch

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.460 
start because you sort of launch
yourself<00:04:43.340> into<00:04:43.700> someone<00:04:44.330> else's<00:04:44.630> engine<00:04:45.050> so

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
yourself into someone else's engine so

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.810 
yourself into someone else's engine so
it's<00:04:45.620> kind<00:04:45.830> of<00:04:45.890> like<00:04:46.010> taking<00:04:46.400> something<00:04:46.580> apart

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
it's kind of like taking something apart

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.850 
it's kind of like taking something apart
and<00:04:47.180> figuring<00:04:47.539> out<00:04:47.539> what<00:04:47.900> they<00:04:48.020> did<00:04:48.050> if<00:04:48.680> you

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
and figuring out what they did if you

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.640 
and figuring out what they did if you
start<00:04:49.300> right<00:04:50.300> from<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.840> ground<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.410> know<00:04:51.440> and

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
start right from the ground you know and

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.740 
start right from the ground you know and
write<00:04:51.830> it<00:04:51.950> all<00:04:52.100> yourself<00:04:52.520> c<00:04:52.970> and<00:04:53.090> c++<00:04:53.240> or

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
write it all yourself c and c++ or

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.420 
write it all yourself c and c++ or
something<00:04:54.110> it's<00:04:54.440> it's<00:04:55.190> a<00:04:55.250> lot<00:04:55.400> more

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
something it's it's a lot more

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.650 
something it's it's a lot more
challenging<00:04:56.000> because<00:04:56.090> you<00:04:56.300> have<00:04:56.419> to<00:04:56.539> learn

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
challenging because you have to learn

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.120 
challenging because you have to learn
all<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:56.960> mistakes<00:04:57.260> yourself<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:57.860> you<00:04:57.919> can't

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
all the mistakes yourself and you can't

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.490 
all the mistakes yourself and you can't
sort<00:04:58.340> of<00:04:58.400> see<00:04:58.550> how<00:04:58.760> someone<00:04:59.030> else<00:04:59.270> did<00:04:59.479> it<00:04:59.510> and

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
sort of see how someone else did it and

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.110 
sort of see how someone else did it and
i<00:05:00.680> think<00:05:00.710> yeah<00:05:01.130> so<00:05:01.340> I<00:05:01.370> think<00:05:01.490> mornings<00:05:01.940> are

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
i think yeah so I think mornings are

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.250 
i think yeah so I think mornings are
really<00:05:02.360> good<00:05:02.510> way<00:05:02.690> to<00:05:02.750> get<00:05:03.289> under<00:05:03.560> that

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
really good way to get under that

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:14.380 
really good way to get under that
thank<00:05:04.860> you<00:05:04.920> for<00:05:05.040> your<00:05:05.100> time

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.450 

you
