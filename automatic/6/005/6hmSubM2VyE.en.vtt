gloss<00:01:59.440> looks<00:01:59.800> on<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.070> grill<00:02:00.370> you<00:02:00.550> can<00:02:00.729> kind<00:02:00.909> of

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
gloss looks on the grill you can kind of

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.560 
gloss looks on the grill you can kind of
see<00:02:01.150> in<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.330> light<00:02:01.540> there<00:02:01.840> nice<00:02:02.680> shine<00:02:03.010> to<00:02:03.040> it

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
see in the light there nice shine to it

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.200 
see in the light there nice shine to it
really<00:02:04.570> simple<00:02:04.930> he<00:02:05.470> does<00:02:05.650> roll<00:02:05.950> he<00:02:06.909> rolls<00:02:07.120> a

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
really simple he does roll he rolls a

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.999 
really simple he does roll he rolls a
lot<00:02:07.420> better<00:02:07.630> than<00:02:07.840> hound<00:02:08.080> guys<00:02:08.379> I'll<00:02:08.590> say<00:02:08.769> that

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
lot better than hound guys I'll say that

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.210 
lot better than hound guys I'll say that
how<00:02:09.190> many<00:02:09.250> rolls<00:02:09.909> this<00:02:10.300> one<00:02:10.479> is<00:02:10.929> good<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:11.980> will

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
how many rolls this one is good and will

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.500 
how many rolls this one is good and will
if<00:02:12.340> you<00:02:12.430> start<00:02:12.670> messing<00:02:12.819> with<00:02:13.030> it<00:02:13.209> it<00:02:13.360> will

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
if you start messing with it it will

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.970 
if you start messing with it it will
fall<00:02:13.840> apart<00:02:14.140> in<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.349> back<00:02:14.500> here

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
fall apart in the back here

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.360 
fall apart in the back here
these<00:02:15.430> don't<00:02:15.819> tap<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.629> well<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:18.340> know

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
these don't tap in that well you know

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.009 
these don't tap in that well you know
soon<00:02:18.640> as<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:18.790> start<00:02:19.000> squeezing<00:02:19.239> here<00:02:19.569> to<00:02:19.810> tap

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
soon as you start squeezing here to tap

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.120 
soon as you start squeezing here to tap
that<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.799> this<00:02:21.069> comes<00:02:21.340> on<00:02:21.519> tab<00:02:21.760> so

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
that in and this comes on tab so

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.920 
that in and this comes on tab so
it's<00:02:23.340> not<00:02:23.490> really<00:02:23.940> from<00:02:24.120> this<00:02:24.270> transformation

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
it's not really from this transformation

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.030 
it's not really from this transformation
or<00:02:25.020> anything<00:02:25.140> like<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.350> it's<00:02:25.650> just<00:02:25.680> kind<00:02:25.830> of

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
or anything like that it's just kind of

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.810 
or anything like that it's just kind of
the<00:02:26.130> way<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.400> is

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
the way it is

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.930 
the way it is
so<00:02:27.030> unfortunately<00:02:27.950> quality<00:02:28.950> control<00:02:29.310> lately

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
so unfortunately quality control lately

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.000 
so unfortunately quality control lately
on<00:02:30.150> some<00:02:30.480> things<00:02:30.750> are<00:02:30.930> not<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.440> best<00:02:31.650> but

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
on some things are not the best but

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.300 
on some things are not the best but
they're<00:02:33.000> okay<00:02:33.270> I've<00:02:33.450> seen<00:02:33.480> worse<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.290> here<00:02:35.220> he

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
they're okay I've seen worse so here he

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.970 
they're okay I've seen worse so here he
is<00:02:35.340> in<00:02:35.520> this<00:02:35.610> truck<00:02:35.790> mode<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:37.110> gun<00:02:37.320> does

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
is in this truck mode the gun does

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.740 
is in this truck mode the gun does
nothing<00:02:38.460> for<00:02:38.490> him<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:38.910> truck<00:02:39.060> mode<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:39.540> don't

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
nothing for him in truck mode I don't

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.490 
nothing for him in truck mode I don't
think

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
think

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.590 
think
let's<00:02:40.980> see<00:02:41.130> me<00:02:41.220> yeah<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.790> does<00:02:41.940> peg<00:02:42.210> up<00:02:42.360> top

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
let's see me yeah it does peg up top

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.820 
let's see me yeah it does peg up top
just<00:02:43.500> like<00:02:43.650> with<00:02:43.860> primes<00:02:44.420> but<00:02:45.470> there<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.590> no

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
just like with primes but there is no

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.170 
just like with primes but there is no
way<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.070> I'm<00:02:47.490> gonna<00:02:47.610> put<00:02:47.820> this<00:02:47.940> on<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.120> shelf

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
way that I'm gonna put this on a shelf

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.230 
way that I'm gonna put this on a shelf
like<00:02:49.110> this<00:02:49.380> so<00:02:49.890> it's<00:02:50.490> kind<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.730> useless<00:02:50.910> they

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
like this so it's kind of useless they

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.120 
like this so it's kind of useless they
should<00:02:51.420> just<00:02:51.540> put<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.810> little<00:02:51.960> tab<00:02:52.230> hole<00:02:52.590> right

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
should just put a little tab hole right

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.590 
should just put a little tab hole right
here<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.520> I<00:02:53.550> could<00:02:53.700> even<00:02:53.850> drill<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.150> hole<00:02:54.390> there

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
here and I could even drill a hole there

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.720 
here and I could even drill a hole there
but<00:02:54.630> just<00:02:55.500> put<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.710> hole<00:02:55.830> there<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.160> have<00:02:56.700> it

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
but just put a hole there and have it

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.980 
but just put a hole there and have it
mounted<00:02:56.970> back<00:02:57.360> here<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.780> would<00:02:57.900> obviously

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
mounted back here it would obviously

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.780 
mounted back here it would obviously
look<00:02:58.470> ten<00:02:58.680> times<00:02:58.710> better<00:02:59.070> I<00:02:59.370> don't<00:02:59.520> know<00:02:59.640> why

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
look ten times better I don't know why

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.100 
look ten times better I don't know why
they<00:02:59.910> don't<00:03:00.030> think<00:03:00.300> before<00:03:00.600> they<00:03:00.690> do<00:03:00.750> things

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
they don't think before they do things

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.100 
they don't think before they do things
but<00:03:01.350> I<00:03:01.710> get<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.460> get<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.270> get<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.720> big<00:03:03.960> bad

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
but I get I get it to get this a big bad

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.780 
but I get I get it to get this a big bad
toy<00:03:04.290> store<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:04.830> definitely<00:03:05.280> pick<00:03:05.430> them<00:03:05.580> up<00:03:05.670> if

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
toy store so definitely pick them up if

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.200 
toy store so definitely pick them up if
you'd<00:03:05.940> like<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:06.900> in<00:03:07.050> stock<00:03:08.210> certainly

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
you'd like it is in stock certainly

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.150 
you'd like it is in stock certainly
worth<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.600> just<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.930> loan<00:03:10.080> for<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.320> truck<00:03:10.920> mold

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
worth it just a loan for this truck mold

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.130 
worth it just a loan for this truck mold
it<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:11.430> really<00:03:11.700> nice<00:03:11.850> but<00:03:12.540> let's<00:03:12.840> get<00:03:13.050> them

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
it is really nice but let's get them

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.490 
it is really nice but let's get them
transformed<00:03:13.940> so<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.630> transform<00:03:16.140> them<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.380> is

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
transformed so the transform them it is

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.380 
transformed so the transform them it is
pretty<00:03:16.980> simple<00:03:17.370> I'm<00:03:17.430> just<00:03:17.580> gonna<00:03:17.730> untap<00:03:18.150> these

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
pretty simple I'm just gonna untap these

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.600 
pretty simple I'm just gonna untap these
pieces<00:03:18.720> on<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.110> side<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.980> fold<00:03:20.220> them<00:03:20.340> right

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
pieces on the side to fold them right

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.470 
pieces on the side to fold them right
over<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.210> wheels<00:03:22.100> this<00:03:23.100> one<00:03:23.340> same<00:03:23.670> thing<00:03:23.940> pull

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
over the wheels this one same thing pull

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.960 
over the wheels this one same thing pull
it<00:03:24.630> right<00:03:24.780> over<00:03:24.990> the<00:03:25.080> wheels<00:03:25.580> these<00:03:26.580> front

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
it right over the wheels these front

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.370 
it right over the wheels these front
wheels<00:03:27.210> all<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.630> got<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:27.840> do<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.020> just<00:03:28.170> fold

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
wheels all you got to do is just fold

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.800 
wheels all you got to do is just fold
them<00:03:28.560> right<00:03:29.130> up<00:03:29.310> same<00:03:30.150> thing<00:03:30.300> on<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:30.510> side

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
them right up same thing on this side

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.020 
them right up same thing on this side
and<00:03:31.350> you<00:03:31.440> can't<00:03:31.650> see<00:03:31.860> I<00:03:31.890> mean<00:03:32.040> obviously<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.670> lot

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
and you can't see I mean obviously a lot

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.320 
and you can't see I mean obviously a lot
of<00:03:33.060> robot<00:03:33.540> kibble<00:03:33.930> there<00:03:34.110> underneath<00:03:34.850> so<00:03:35.850> once

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
of robot kibble there underneath so once

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.640 
of robot kibble there underneath so once
you've<00:03:36.450> done<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:36.690> you're<00:03:37.170> just<00:03:37.320> gonna<00:03:37.410> lift

it<00:05:29.550> does<00:05:29.700> look<00:05:29.850> like<00:05:29.880> he's<00:05:30.240> holding<00:05:30.690> a<00:05:31.490> cannon

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
it does look like he's holding a cannon

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.210 
it does look like he's holding a cannon
of<00:05:32.610> some<00:05:32.850> sort<00:05:33.440> like<00:05:34.440> it's<00:05:34.590> an<00:05:34.680> arm<00:05:34.830> cannon

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
of some sort like it's an arm cannon

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.770 
of some sort like it's an arm cannon
that's<00:05:35.340> kind<00:05:35.520> of<00:05:35.550> extended<00:05:36.060> off<00:05:36.180> um<00:05:36.420> not<00:05:36.630> like

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
that's kind of extended off um not like

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.900 
that's kind of extended off um not like
he's<00:05:36.930> holding<00:05:37.290> a<00:05:37.350> gun<00:05:37.530> but<00:05:38.310> if<00:05:38.580> you<00:05:38.610> look<00:05:38.790> to

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
he's holding a gun but if you look to

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.450 
he's holding a gun but if you look to
the<00:05:38.940> side<00:05:39.120> you<00:05:39.270> can't<00:05:39.420> really<00:05:39.570> see<00:05:39.780> cold<00:05:40.020> night

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
the side you can't really see cold night

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.120 
the side you can't really see cold night
it's<00:05:41.460> kind<00:05:41.670> of<00:05:41.730> cool<00:05:41.960> again<00:05:42.960> it<00:05:43.380> you<00:05:43.830> know<00:05:43.950> it

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
it's kind of cool again it you know it

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.550 
it's kind of cool again it you know it
lacks<00:05:44.400> from<00:05:44.700> paint<00:05:45.000> and<00:05:45.360> it<00:05:46.140> has<00:05:46.320> a<00:05:46.350> lot<00:05:46.530> of

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
lacks from paint and it has a lot of

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.430 
lacks from paint and it has a lot of
nice<00:05:46.770> detail<00:05:46.800> just<00:05:47.670> no<00:05:48.600> effort<00:05:48.960> put<00:05:49.170> it<00:05:49.260> into

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
nice detail just no effort put it into

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.460 
nice detail just no effort put it into
it<00:05:49.620> but<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:50.850> figure<00:05:51.150> itself<00:05:51.330> I<00:05:51.750> really<00:05:52.290> like

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
it but the figure itself I really like

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.020 
it but the figure itself I really like
all<00:05:52.680> the<00:05:52.860> blue<00:05:53.070> and<00:05:53.280> we<00:05:53.340> saw<00:05:53.520> from<00:05:53.670> that<00:05:53.730> last

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
all the blue and we saw from that last

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.270 
all the blue and we saw from that last
trailer<00:05:54.570> that<00:05:54.840> he<00:05:55.410> does<00:05:55.560> have<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:55.740> lot<00:05:56.010> of<00:05:56.040> these

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
trailer that he does have a lot of these

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.480 
trailer that he does have a lot of these
like<00:05:56.550> piping<00:05:57.210> and<00:05:57.510> hoses<00:05:58.170> and<00:05:58.530> things<00:05:58.740> because

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
like piping and hoses and things because

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.430 
like piping and hoses and things because
he<00:05:59.610> is<00:05:59.730> human<00:06:00.600> made<00:06:00.810> from<00:06:01.410> leftover<00:06:01.950> parts

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
he is human made from leftover parts

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.020 
he is human made from leftover parts
it's<00:06:04.440> really<00:06:04.710> cool<00:06:04.950> the<00:06:05.250> design<00:06:05.700> work<00:06:05.880> that

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
it's really cool the design work that

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.460 
it's really cool the design work that
went<00:06:06.180> into<00:06:06.300> this<00:06:06.450> he<00:06:06.690> could<00:06:06.930> use<00:06:07.110> some<00:06:07.320> more

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
went into this he could use some more

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.410 
went into this he could use some more
painting<00:06:07.890> I<00:06:08.070> hope<00:06:08.430> that<00:06:08.610> the<00:06:08.700> car<00:06:08.880> versions<00:06:09.330> a

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:09.420 
painting I hope that the car versions a

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.630 
painting I hope that the car versions a
little<00:06:09.630> bit<00:06:09.720> better<00:06:10.220> also<00:06:11.220> one<00:06:11.370> thing<00:06:11.490> that's

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
little bit better also one thing that's

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.220 
little bit better also one thing that's
kind<00:06:11.760> of<00:06:11.850> neat<00:06:12.000> this<00:06:12.180> chess<00:06:12.540> piece<00:06:12.570> you<00:06:13.080> can

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
kind of neat this chess piece you can

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.320 
kind of neat this chess piece you can
actually<00:06:13.380> see<00:06:13.860> straight<00:06:14.760> through<00:06:14.790> the<00:06:15.180> back

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
actually see straight through the back

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.470 
actually see straight through the back
you<00:06:15.870> can<00:06:15.960> kind<00:06:16.170> of<00:06:16.230> see<00:06:16.380> my<00:06:16.530> finger<00:06:16.860> in<00:06:16.980> there

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
you can kind of see my finger in there

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.780 
you can kind of see my finger in there
so<00:06:18.480> kind<00:06:18.870> of<00:06:18.930> a<00:06:18.990> weird<00:06:19.290> but<00:06:19.590> you<00:06:20.430> know<00:06:20.460> I<00:06:20.580> don't

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
so kind of a weird but you know I don't

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.190 
so kind of a weird but you know I don't
know<00:06:20.880> why<00:06:21.000> they<00:06:21.180> did<00:06:21.360> that<00:06:21.510> I<00:06:21.570> really<00:06:22.110> don't

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
know why they did that I really don't

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.020 
know why they did that I really don't
understand<00:06:22.710> why<00:06:22.860> they<00:06:23.040> left<00:06:23.490> that<00:06:23.670> wide<00:06:24.000> open

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
understand why they left that wide open

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.140 
understand why they left that wide open
but<00:06:24.810> it's<00:06:25.470> definitely<00:06:26.150> interesting

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150
