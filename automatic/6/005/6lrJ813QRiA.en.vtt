does she have high combo bility probably

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.410 
does she have high combo bility probably
but<00:02:21.739> she<00:02:21.920> doesn't<00:02:22.250> need<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.640> she's<00:02:22.879> got<00:02:23.120> a

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
but she doesn't need it she's got a

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.960 
but she doesn't need it she's got a
high-low<00:02:24.079> mixed<00:02:24.379> up<00:02:24.500> with<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.769> drill<00:02:25.129> with

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
high-low mixed up with the drill with

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.180 
high-low mixed up with the drill with
the<00:02:26.510> overhead<00:02:27.049> and<00:02:27.319> with<00:02:27.560> one<00:02:27.769> or<00:02:27.890> two<00:02:27.920> little

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
the overhead and with one or two little

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.729 
the overhead and with one or two little
combos<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.120> make<00:02:29.569> it<00:02:29.690> very<00:02:29.720> confusing<00:02:30.379> and

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
combos that make it very confusing and

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.890 
combos that make it very confusing and
so<00:02:31.400> it's<00:02:31.549> kind<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:31.849> a<00:02:31.940> good<00:02:32.090> mix<00:02:32.329> up<00:02:32.510> as<00:02:32.660> she's<00:02:32.870> a

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
so it's kind of a good mix up as she's a

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.110 
so it's kind of a good mix up as she's a
good<00:02:33.140> mix<00:02:33.349> of<00:02:33.500> character<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.340> teleport<00:02:34.819> 2<00:02:34.970> is

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.220 
good mix of character the teleport 2 is
