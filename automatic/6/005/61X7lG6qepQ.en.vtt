00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.200
 how 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.200
 m 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:19.089
 [Music] 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.470
 hello william stone the on williams and 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:23.320
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.329
 to do as soon as a crisis that which then 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.169
 they are simply 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.969
 come down what are we going to do with 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.519
 ice cream and chocolate cookies 

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:31.809
 it's very well known and a lot in summer that 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.290
 in the United States or everywhere 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:34.269
 elsewhere 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.980
 you're going to see on stage is going to be very 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.510
 easy and fast since I'm going 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.500
 use ice that is already all 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.420
 done but you can also use 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.229
 any kind of ice cream and make 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.550
 everything yourself 

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:47.260
 in any case you'll see it's going to be 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.359
 super good elsewhere for the ice cream that 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.910
 chris owens we will need already for 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:54.670
 the basis of one of the chocolate cookies of 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.410
 200 g of sweet butter at temperature 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.489
 very important ambient that it is to 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.100
 ambient temperature 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.870
 here the 210 g icing sugar a 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.910
 teaspoon of natural extract of 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.539
 vanilla powder or liquid no matter 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.600
 two spouses from here I have 65 grams 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:13.960
 cocoa powder so 100% cocoa 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.509
 a pinch of salt and finally 280 g of 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.159
 normal flour and in this verse 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:23.630
 start by beating the heart alone 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:25.460
 for a few seconds per m 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.829
 I'm going to do it's simply 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.719
 now totaled icing sugar since 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:33.950
 he tends to see a lot of humor 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:35.689
 which I prefer to sift all and I 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.979
 mix again for about a 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:42.950
 minute until I have a mix 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:44.720
 light and homogeneous, so that's 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.509
 perfect good homogeneous mixture 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.799
 I add but two yellows of France and 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.079
 although the good salads and if ever 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.210
 you do not have a year you like me seen 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.619
 that here I have one may be neutral in 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.700
 silicone so that allowed to be remembered 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.709
 homework at the same time what is 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.429
 perfect but to remember 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:02.000
 still the edges of the highway 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.399
 salad bowl so now I sift well 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.119
 mixture of cocoa powder and flour 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.920
 and salt simply jalisca the 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.810
 cocoa powder has hugely higher 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.349
 even more than you have there so it is 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:20.480
 really needed the tanner and I 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:21.590
 indoor mix times then like 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.599
 you can see a mix and well 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.819
 eat and it smells super good now 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.930
 I clean my management at the doxa you 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.489
 can see my preparation is good 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.650
 homogeneous but not thick enough for 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.840
 form cookies so now its 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.329
 case is to use a film 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.489
 food like everything in my recipe 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.430
 millions of cookies is what I'm going 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:48.489
 to do so is to deposit my preparation 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.489
 only food films like this 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.130
 so that's perfect now I 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.110
 will spread it on a fairly thin layer 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.450
 for my preparation to harden 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.760
 quickly and below the face and 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.940
 put in the preflower during 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.010
 about an hour until the dough 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.410
 to cookies is very hard too 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.680
 can he then went on roll to 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.680
 pastry 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.820
 then not made the cut he of course if 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.930
 in the fridge for about two 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.700
 hours so it's perfect 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.010
 so now what am I doing with a 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.660
 rolling pin and a little bit of 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.580
 flour we do not stick it I'm going all 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.680
 simply spread the cookie dough on 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.540
 a few millimeters so about 2 to 3 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.830
 mm and then we discover to cookies a 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.290
 once your dough is well said go 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.970
 you will have a drink for example 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.890
 and you go cuts and your 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.720
 cookies so just like those 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.370
 ci as well as you will drop them on 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.950
 a baking sheet covered with paper 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.480
 sulfurized 48 what I see is all 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.620
 just a few laps with the tip 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.810
 a fork because it will make your 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.370
 pity she very nice once he 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.959
 will have cooked and once I will have to 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.150
 cut everything slips so I'm going to them 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.370
 cook in the oven preheated to 180 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.410
 degrees celsius for about ten 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.239
 minutes or until the edges and 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.800
 he cooked well and then I made them 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.410
 rest completely so we can 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.239
 to form our sandwiches that kelly during 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.800
 I also have a big flat dish that 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.150
 perfect for making this kind of recipes 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.110
 to automate a baking tray 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.540
 quite deep 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.459
 at this point or any mold whatsoever 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.470
 and we see what we are going to dance to 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.230
 tackle the dessert class 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.150
 where work to buy ice cream 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.570
 of a trade or so do it yourself 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.030
 even 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.980
 this time I bought site and 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.300
 faster for simple but 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.790
 frankly do not hesitate to do it 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.080
 you yourself will be really better and 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.000
 at least you'll be proud to have 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.170
 make the dessert in its entirety 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.750
 so now if you are going to do 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.310
 to dance and to the east of class here I 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.720
 have a liter but I also have more 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.350
 none where I think I'm going to have 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.840
 need in the ice es5 we wanted 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.890
 go with your husband or spatula up 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.670
 you have a good thickness 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.380
 so now that I have a 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.030
 very uniform layer what I did to 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.620
 to put my ice 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.630
 freezer again during 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.200
 about an hour the time but they 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.920
 cool 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.090
 then we will do the assembly then 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.520
 now that everything is ready to do 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.840
 our her soft cookies is now 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.430
 time to tackle the assembly 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.560
 since I loved couquet what they have 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.780
 performed two minutes and they are very 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.620
 well as you can see you 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.910
 go see that they will start to 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.050
 crack on the sides once they 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.290
 are running away so this is really the 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.900
 moment 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.720
 then to get them out of the oven here I 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.410
 the race spirit so the multicolor so 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.790
 his beautiful big competitions that's 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.080
 buy them in the united states you can 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.970
 very well use anything we 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.420
 do to decorate golden pieces 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.680
 to the cuts and our pic ans 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.330
 experience like that to chocolate has 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.220
 really do what you want from 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.020
 anyway so now we're going 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.610
 start with an assembly of a 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.040
 obviously what am I going to do in 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.580
 do is do it with the same size 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:51.160
 will have that cookies of course to him 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.070
 is just cutting and 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:57.630
 youth like that 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:06:01.200
 and then I learn harper filed 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:04.530
 on a bone of cookies and jose where all 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.950
 in our copy like those here and there in 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:12.210
 Swiss one green is simply 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:14.580
 rolling my goal which in mesrine rumbles 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:18.630
 like these is then you have 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.730
 your cheese album that is sometimes like 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.590
 this one asks for soybeans 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:25.350
 all my liquid sandwiches is 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.020
 exactly like this one are going very well 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.970
 vary the different pleasures m 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.030
 people's flavors and I stayed that way 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:35.930
 today like these is then I 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.550
 I will not stop with you

 are ready I put them about two 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.550
 banking risk freezer hours 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.470
 of us again and then I went out to 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.759
 intimacy for not that I break a 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.370
 tooth eating because my 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:49.850
 freezer is very strong and here is the 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.039
 result 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.320
 Do not hesitate to customize it 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:56.210
 must because a ghz sandwich then 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.410
 to call them like that by putting 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.330
 dead all of renault for example the

 Youtube 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:21.639
 in any case it was as simple as that 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:24.620
 [Music]

 dialysis chocolate super good with a 

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.740
 mass in the future the little hungers cause 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.080
 music of the hour just to add a
