pretty sharp for me it works great in
low<00:03:03.380> light<00:03:03.730> conditions<00:03:04.730> that's<00:03:05.600> the

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
low light conditions that's the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.990 
low light conditions that's the
advantage<00:03:06.080> of<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:07.580> 1.2<00:03:08.210> range<00:03:08.510> there<00:03:10.000> the

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
advantage of the the 1.2 range there the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.449 
advantage of the the 1.2 range there the
nice<00:03:11.240> added<00:03:11.720> benefit<00:03:12.140> that<00:03:12.320> I<00:03:12.380> see<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.740> that<00:03:13.100> by

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
nice added benefit that I see is that by

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.490 
nice added benefit that I see is that by
having<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:14.209> ability<00:03:14.270> to<00:03:14.510> issue<00:03:14.600> data<00:03:15.020> in<00:03:15.410> a

having the ability to issue data in a

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.520 
having the ability to issue data in a
lower<00:03:15.680> light<00:03:15.980> setting<00:03:18.880> on<00:03:19.880> my<00:03:19.910> 5d<00:03:20.540> 2<00:03:20.780> if<00:03:21.200> I<00:03:21.320> used

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
lower light setting on my 5d 2 if I used

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.040 
lower light setting on my 5d 2 if I used
auto<00:03:21.830> ISO<00:03:22.550> it's<00:03:22.820> gonna<00:03:23.030> bump<00:03:23.360> me<00:03:23.510> down<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:24.020> a

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
auto ISO it's gonna bump me down to a

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.850 
auto ISO it's gonna bump me down to a
lower<00:03:24.380> ISO<00:03:25.310> so<00:03:26.180> I'm<00:03:26.570> more<00:03:27.290> frequently

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
lower ISO so I'm more frequently
