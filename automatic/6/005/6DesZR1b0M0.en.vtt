00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:37.770
 So in the final had the five 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.090
 Candidates try the wine first 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.690
 is always quite a challenge 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.340
 because you also on kukacka costa as 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.640
 good acoustics can be wrong 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.890
 he was a horny to describe 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.260
 it was important to just the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.910
 To describe the aroma of the fragrance 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.530
 taste conclusions on the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.510
 storability and potential 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.890
 close and then it went up 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.239
 and to identify the wine 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.070
 that's why it's for one 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.600
 vintage which is grape variety and 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.600
 possibly even cultivation areas of vienna 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.700
 That was very very difficult for us 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.080
 harder because I have to admit that 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.610
 but we have not chosen consciously 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.990
 So simple is the claim 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.720
 of course already be there 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.240
 in 2010 there were big plants 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.320
 was a great wine but I am too 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.320
 do not try very easy 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.840
 then there was a second part 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.619
 in the second part the participants had to 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.300
 answer technical questions 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.100
 There was a question about the German 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.649
 wine and international care in 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.770
 Germany and how critical it is 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.789
 Guests recommend the German red wine 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.679
 because many do not know that we 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.030
 in the meantime also in germany very much 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.030
 have very good red wines 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.580
 and then there was a second part 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.140
 in the second part the participants had to 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.580
 to make a very classic service 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.160
 So actually as it is every day 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.880
 also in the restaurant do weine to the 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.390
 select the respective food 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.530
 Legs present the legs uncork 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.530
 pour classic service 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.299
 it is certainly a simple part 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.530
 However, you can also the tension 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.180
 do not underestimate so I know myself 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.349
 last two years with the final 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.299
 was and still works differently here 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.709
 such a competent and high-caliber 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.319
 jury and all the participants, however 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.480
 my work is different there than in 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.219
 restaurant and tasting is always 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:30.810
 difficult there is no way off 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:32.430
 where I am now the evaluation 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.980
 you can already say that 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.269
 the level is unbelievable me 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.220
 think you have this year in the 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.049
 final again noticed we had great 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.909
 people doing this year very much 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.400
 renowned restaurants very dedicated 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:47.370
 people without so i think german sorry 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.969
 DE or the german junior league 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.969
 shown what they can 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.500
 What was the other way, I think so 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.470
 was not quite like that before the finale 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.850
 as excited as last year 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.050
 of course very tense and 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.790
 but not so excited I concentrated 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:16.180
 This year also took place in advance 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.530
 the field of participants was firstly 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.959
 Of course it was more, but it was also a lot 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.579
 close together what you get so 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.580
 has and many great people where I am 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.570
 still thought of many others 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.419
 that would be in front of me 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.970
 but when finals come and I believe 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:35.020
 also that the level is in the final itself 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.810
 was this really super exciting and 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.010
 have fun again made again 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.850
 Of course I should not do it anymore 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:45.360
 but not every year 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.360
 exciting competition
