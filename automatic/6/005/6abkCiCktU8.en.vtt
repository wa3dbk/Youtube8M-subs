00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.230 

I'm<00:02:37.540> just<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.080> shouting<00:02:38.470> issues<00:02:38.890> really<00:02:39.490> what

definitely<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:45.520> lot<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:46.540> think<00:02:46.960> that<00:02:47.350> is

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
definitely a lot of I think that is

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.200 
definitely a lot of I think that is
because<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:49.570> tracks<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:50.350> know<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.430> the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
because of the tracks you know and the

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.320 
because of the tracks you know and the
tracks<00:02:52.480> they<00:02:53.320> can't<00:02:53.560> roll<00:02:53.830> up<00:02:54.010> forever<00:02:54.330> you

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
tracks they can't roll up forever you

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.750 
tracks they can't roll up forever you
know<00:02:55.450> depends<00:02:55.870> on<00:02:55.930> how<00:02:56.110> they're<00:02:56.290> stitch<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:57.670> it

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
know depends on how they're stitch so it

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.610 
know depends on how they're stitch so it
could<00:02:57.940> be<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.180> stitching<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.990> tracks<00:02:59.290> that

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
could be the stitching the tracks that

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.990 
could be the stitching the tracks that
make<00:02:59.830> it<00:03:01.320> but<00:03:02.320> it<00:03:02.500> falls<00:03:02.680> out<00:03:02.890> when<00:03:03.580> I<00:03:03.610> use<00:03:03.880> a

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
make it but it falls out when I use a

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:14.030

hair<00:04:27.070> right<00:04:27.840> now<00:04:28.840> about

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
hair right now about

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.460 
hair right now about
because<00:04:32.400> of<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:36.000> it's<00:04:36.900> not<00:04:37.050> like<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.289> hair
