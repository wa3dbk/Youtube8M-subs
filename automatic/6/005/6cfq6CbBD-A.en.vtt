fourths<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:36.120> forth<00:00:36.480> we<00:00:36.690> don't<00:00:36.870> know<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.440> your

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
fourths so forth we don't know is your

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.940 
fourths so forth we don't know is your
root<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.760> your<00:00:38.969> fourth<00:00:39.239> interval<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
root and your fourth interval of the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.190 
root and your fourth interval of the
major<00:00:41.879> scale<00:00:42.210> whatever<00:00:42.660> chord<00:00:42.989> you're

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
major scale whatever chord you're

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.549 
major scale whatever chord you're
playing<00:00:43.340> so<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> key<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.750> G<00:00:48.110> so<00:00:49.110> we

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
playing so this is in the key of G so we

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.580 
playing so this is in the key of G so we
have<00:00:49.710> our<00:00:49.860> G<00:00:50.090> our<00:00:51.090> open<00:00:51.510> g<00:00:51.690> string<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
have our G our open g string and the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.799 
have our G our open g string and the
fourth<00:00:52.920> below<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.030> d<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
fourth below it is d so that is the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.170 
fourth below it is d so that is the
first<00:00:58.020> chord<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.160> pick<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.760> with<00:01:00.030> your

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
first chord you can pick this with your

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.399 
first chord you can pick this with your
pick<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:02.149> actually<00:01:03.149> think<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.510> sounds<00:01:03.960> closer
