in case you need to backup or recover
your<00:03:07.709> computer<00:03:08.159> it's<00:03:08.879> there<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:10.140> C<00:03:10.319> Drive<00:03:10.470> ins

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
your computer it's there the C Drive ins

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.429 
your computer it's there the C Drive ins
basically<00:03:11.400> what<00:03:11.640> we<00:03:11.819> used<00:03:12.269> with<00:03:12.810> installing

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
basically what we used with installing

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.649 
basically what we used with installing
our<00:03:13.620> program<00:03:14.099> storing<00:03:14.609> our<00:03:14.760> stuff<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.359> then

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
our program storing our stuff and then

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.289 
our program storing our stuff and then
there's<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.989> system<00:03:16.170> reserved<00:03:16.680> partition<00:03:17.299> so

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
there's a system reserved partition so

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:19.520 
there's a system reserved partition so
you<00:03:18.390> just<00:03:18.540> have<00:03:18.689> to<00:03:18.780> be<00:03:18.900> careful<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.319> cannot

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
you just have to be careful you cannot

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.860 
you just have to be careful you cannot
really<00:03:19.709> delete<00:03:20.640> any<00:03:20.939> partition<00:03:21.420> from<00:03:21.659> it

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
really delete any partition from it

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.930 
really delete any partition from it
which<00:03:22.019> is<00:03:22.170> good<00:03:22.409> you<00:03:22.799> have<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.189> shrink<00:03:23.489> option

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940
