00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
25 stinger kills on the bottom level you

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:01.520 
25 stinger kills on the bottom level you
want<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.510> do<00:03:00.599> it<00:03:00.660> from<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.870> bottom<00:03:01.140> level<00:03:01.290> that

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.110 
want to do it from the bottom level that
way<00:03:01.680> there's<00:03:01.890> less<00:03:02.129> grenade<00:03:02.519> interference

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
way there's less grenade interference

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.520 
way there's less grenade interference
because<00:03:03.180> they<00:03:03.420> really<00:03:03.750> do<00:03:03.870> like<00:03:04.049> throw<00:03:04.379> them

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
is a checkpoint that I like to save now

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.650 
is a checkpoint that I like to save now
I<00:03:44.660> save<00:03:45.110> and<00:03:45.320> quit<00:03:45.470> here<00:03:45.950> which<00:03:46.610> puts<00:03:47.480> that

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
I save and quit here which puts that

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.690 
I save and quit here which puts that

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
checkpoint as my save file and then if I

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.820 
checkpoint as my save file and then if I
screw<00:03:49.970> up<00:03:50.030> later<00:03:50.300> I<00:03:50.540> quit<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:50.900> game<00:03:51.260> via<00:03:51.560> the

screw up later I quit the game via the

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.250 
screw up later I quit the game via the
XMB<00:03:52.490> which<00:03:53.120> doesn't<00:03:53.510> overwrite<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:54.050> same

out with mortars it's actually a little

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.330 
out with mortars it's actually a little
bit<00:04:23.300> quicker<00:04:23.540> than<00:04:23.720> stinger<00:04:24.200> sometimes<00:04:24.650> and

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
bit quicker than stinger sometimes and

might have to wait a while but

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.770 
might have to wait a while but
eventually<00:05:29.490> one<00:05:29.940> will<00:05:30.000> show<00:05:30.180> up<00:05:30.240> and<00:05:30.599> then<00:05:30.750> you
