00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello my lord gone 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.769
 about rods was clearly not enough 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.630
 your heads with different shirts 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.839
 understand that you think that I tried 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.839
 get across 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.880
 Ahead of the question like me and I do not drink 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:29.070
 I know probably not very tall and so 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.360
 the most common type of rods for 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.739
 bmx rides 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:38.879
 this is such a steel 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.650
 48 splined connecting rod with shaft I always 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:50.430
 spoke in the fall they corrected me they said 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:51.330
 that this is a shaft I do not mind what he is 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.489
 I have no words 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.610
 so i'm tired he say the same thing 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.589
 the connecting rods about a Prius 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.030
 three element systems such that you 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:04.049
 can put it on 8 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.090
 but what's the point in the titanium axis when 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.979
 the crank weighs 360g so if you 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.530
 choose yourself 3 elements of rods with 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.619
 aim to put the titanium axis choose 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.030
 connecting rods easier 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.000
 minus 3 alimentary rods is something 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.399
 that a lot of details they lose 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:32.009
 stiffness but with spare parts you can 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:35.369
 change here is another kind of pseudo rods 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.969
 2 element of which is pseudo because the axis 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.170
 plugged into the rod she is not welded then 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:45.000
 there is not a maximum weight saving and 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.390
 that's it exactly this model 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.899
 makes me wild disgust 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.899
 hostility and even hate why 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.749
 that there is too much excess welding 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.380
 and since everybody has to spend money 

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:04.700
 relieve tension after welding what she 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.869
 it turns out very brittle and here it is 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.819
 This welding is full 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.830
 and especially the main tube does not go 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.010
 on the node that captures 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.190
 axis they very often break not be fooled 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.190
 on advertising 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.159
 some ask me what's so bad 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:31.530
 yusa carriage is that it is not clear 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:34.040
 look at its size it's just 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.689
 some kind of madness fuck at all but 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.689
 if buy bmx buy at least mid 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:42.480
 carriage does not have to buy her a she 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.459
 very very very heavy the same 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.819
 also concerns the type of rods that I 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.299
 hold 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.069
 3 elemental star bolts they 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.560
 good only on comp years and if you 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:58.889
 someone gave a beautiful eyes well or 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:00.900
 still for as an anti beautiful place and this 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.669
 pseudo 2 element crank which is not 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:08.669
 disgusts me because he 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:11.549
 made correctly no extra welding in 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:14.250
 I generally dig up what is even 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:19.400
 such nice nishtyaki as a hollow axle fu 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:22.109
 fucking hollow bolts in ace and for asterisk 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.479
 In general, the stake company is not enough 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:29.549
 literate guy now 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:31.290
 explode into the world of fast racing this 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:37.949
 rods truvativ 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:41.609
 x0 they are very light carbon hard and 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:45.510
 lasting only thing they don't like 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:48.419
 these are stones that fall into them 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.180
 but this problem is not a problem for them at 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:53.220
 least not as big as for 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.199
 carbon highway rods and not happen 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.060
 under a single star under a few stars and 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.549
 there is even an opportunity to put here 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.370
 little star 20 in my four 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.889
 or twenty two teeth and use it 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:09.169
 for extreme string disciplines 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:09.169
 to order cipro what the cherry has already done 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.930
 This type of jokers is most often used. 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:16.829
 for cross country 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.269
 and for nothing else because three 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.190
 stars only used for 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.389
 constants here we have a pseudo 2 element 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.969
 but in the blood of these in aluminum rods in 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.320
 their world is neither pseudo two 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:30.800
 items because the crank itself 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.800
 aluminum that is quite competent 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.629
 and the axis is always steel so there is always 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.710
 will be 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:40.789
 the shaft is pressed in more precisely the connecting rod shaft 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.099
 asterisks for such systems are 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.120
 are different 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.879
 stamped like a foot me not them 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.180
 systems can be milled even 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:51.830
 find titanium well, respectively, than 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.509
 more expensive rods the better quality stars 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.419
 they have all kinds of slots 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.430
 to switch everything better so that 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.629
 wear was less 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.030
 the main enemy of such systems is 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:04.219
 disorderly host which does not change in 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.319
 cycle time a chain when stretched 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:14.960
 starts to eat only the tape 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:16.909
 Well, the asterisks in front is cheaper 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.219
 option such a system as sram x0 with 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:21.699
 one asterisk can be put here 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:24.050
 rock ring protect this very star and 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.659
 use it in front with 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.610
 soothing using such systems 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:31.909
 irrationally too big for a straight 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.340
 star and in general the weight of the rods their price 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:38.990
 the same as with mixes and looks at 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.940
 Aluminum rods can not be well 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.279
 essence and one of the cheapest options 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.229
 which remains one quality fever 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:48.620
 blaze problem they only have in 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:50.360
 the carriage is that it unfolds the slots 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.430
 if you are quite a bit 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.069
 forget to tighten the bolt somewhere not 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:58.279
 check all the birds will be annoyed and 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:01.819
 on discharge, you can solve the issue poksipol but 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:03.710
 it will be time happens here 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:05.779
 equipment two stars rock link on 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.300
 which can put a damper circuit 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:13.729
 white equipment three stars armored 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:16.039
 linga star here is big done 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:20.510
 well and a little bit cheaper it 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:22.690
 stamped therefore 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.040
 do not buy rods at random 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:28.010
 be strictly guided by your 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.520
 discipline skating if it is bmx or mtb 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.470
 street 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.410
 look or plan to learn 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.450
 grind or just have no love for 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:38.480
 aluminum as I use 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.880
 other connecting rods 2 element or 3 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.100
 The elements of the boy 8 slots eliade worth 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.460
 you pain thunderbolt 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.150
 if you are ahead of the rest 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.840
 to test 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:54.460
 anything from the carbon world and in all 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.460
 the rest is aluminum 

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:05.479
 all the best friends
