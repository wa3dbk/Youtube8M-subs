going to use this one to one most of the
main<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.899> cleaning<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.500> recommend<00:00:44.070> with

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
main is cleaning that we recommend with

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.119 
main is cleaning that we recommend with
our<00:00:44.370> gloss<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.820> will<00:00:45.329> gel<00:00:45.660> would<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.559> cut<00:00:46.980> it

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
our gloss it will gel would be to cut it

our gloss it will gel would be to cut it
like<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> one<00:00:47.790> to<00:00:47.820> four<00:00:48.210> or<00:00:48.480> even<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.780> 128<00:00:49.230> this

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
like on a one to four or even a 128 this

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.979 
like on a one to four or even a 128 this
will<00:00:50.190> still<00:00:50.370> effectively<00:00:50.879> remove<00:00:51.239> any<00:00:51.390> brake

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
will still effectively remove any brake

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.869 
will still effectively remove any brake
dust<00:00:52.260> after<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> initial<00:00:53.100> cleaning<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.850> the

dust after the initial cleaning of the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.220 
dust after the initial cleaning of the
rim<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.570> we're<00:00:54.690> going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.050> we're<00:00:55.140> going

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
to show a proper application on the rim

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.459 
to show a proper application on the rim
now<00:00:57.390> what<00:00:57.570> I'm<00:00:57.660> going<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.809> do<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.110> I'm<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.350> to

turn this on on the fan mode and I'm

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.740 
turn this on on the fan mode and I'm
going<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.719> take<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.800> product<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:02.539> you<00:01:03.539> see

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750

going to take the product as you see
it's<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> thick<00:01:04.229> gel<00:01:04.530> consistency<00:01:04.770> and<00:01:05.489> I'm

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
it's a thick gel consistency and I'm

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.980 
it's a thick gel consistency and I'm
going<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.789> fan<00:01:06.030> from<00:01:06.210> left<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> right<00:01:06.660> across

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
going to fan from left to right across

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.100 
going to fan from left to right across
like<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.619> even<00:01:07.860> coverage<00:01:08.570> on<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.720> face<00:01:09.899> of<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
like it even coverage on the face of the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.960 
like it even coverage on the face of the
rim

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
rim

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.630 
rim
now<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:13.320> will<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.740> safe<00:01:13.980> if<00:01:14.190> it<00:01:14.280> hits<00:01:14.460> through

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
now this will be safe if it hits through

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.510 
now this will be safe if it hits through
the<00:01:14.970> body<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.870> the<00:01:15.960> car<00:01:16.170> because<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.250> non

face of the powder coat we don't want to
do<00:02:19.739> that<00:02:19.769> so<00:02:20.370> we're<00:02:20.459> going<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.640> take<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.880> brush

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
do that so we're going to take the brush

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.360 
do that so we're going to take the brush
and<00:02:21.420> we're<00:02:21.690> going<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.840> agitate<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:25.050> wheel<00:02:25.370> gel

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
foaming consistency and what that means

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.390 
foaming consistency and what that means
is<00:02:30.540> it's<00:02:30.720> actually<00:02:30.870> lifting<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.530> dirt<00:02:31.739> we're

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
is it's actually lifting the dirt we're

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.800 
is it's actually lifting the dirt we're
actually<00:02:32.550> gonna<00:02:32.730> get<00:02:32.910> inside<00:02:33.030> these<00:02:33.330> lug<00:02:33.570> nuts

if you can see it's got a stick lather
on<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.980> rim<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:45.640> then<00:02:46.640> you<00:02:46.700> can<00:02:46.849> also<00:02:47.000> clean

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
silicone out of the rubber so this

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.430 
silicone out of the rubber so this
cleans<00:03:00.150> not<00:03:00.450> just<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.720> rim<00:03:00.870> but<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.110> face<00:03:01.290> or

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
cleans not just the rim but the face or

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.250 
cleans not just the rim but the face or
the<00:03:01.470> rubber<00:03:01.680> also

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.770
