pot<00:02:07.960> itself<00:02:08.350> can<00:02:08.950> hold<00:02:09.899> approximately<00:02:10.899> you

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
pot itself can hold approximately you

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.180 
pot itself can hold approximately you
can<00:02:11.830> hold<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.070> leader<00:02:12.310> i've<00:02:13.000> actually<00:02:13.209> had<00:02:13.480> six

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
can hold a leader i've actually had six

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.530 
can hold a leader i've actually had six
i've<00:02:15.190> actually<00:02:15.370> had<00:02:15.580> six<00:02:15.760> cups<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.150> water<00:02:16.390> in

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
i've actually had six cups of water in

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.330 
i've actually had six cups of water in
this<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.260> 6<00:02:17.470> cups<00:02:17.709> of<00:02:17.830> water<00:02:17.920> actually

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
this and the 6 cups of water actually

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.790 
this and the 6 cups of water actually
come<00:02:18.730> up<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:20.380> right<00:02:20.860> above<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.340> line<00:02:22.410> on<00:02:23.410> this

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
come up to right above the line on this

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.800 
come up to right above the line on this
probably<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.730> camera<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.060> not<00:02:25.150> focusing<00:02:25.209> well

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
probably the camera is not focusing well

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.630 
probably the camera is not focusing well
on<00:02:25.959> it<00:02:26.110> but<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:26.470> can<00:02:26.560> hold<00:02:26.680> six<00:02:27.010> cups<00:02:27.459> it'll

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
on it but it can hold six cups it'll

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.920 
on it but it can hold six cups it'll
probably<00:02:27.820> come<00:02:28.000> up<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.330> end<00:02:28.390> then<00:02:28.690> your

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
probably come up to the end then your

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.990 
probably come up to the end then your
mark<00:02:29.110> here<00:02:29.470> can<00:02:30.100> probably<00:02:30.310> hold<00:02:30.489> seven<00:02:30.910> or

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
mark here can probably hold seven or

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.580 
mark here can probably hold seven or
eight<00:02:31.120> really<00:02:31.450> easy<00:02:31.630> but<00:02:31.840> you'd<00:02:32.019> be<00:02:32.140> right<00:02:32.440> at

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
eight really easy but you'd be right at

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.850 
eight really easy but you'd be right at
the<00:02:32.620> edge<00:02:32.830> on<00:02:33.130> it<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:34.450> notice<00:02:34.750> it's<00:02:35.590> got<00:02:35.709> the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
the edge on it so notice it's got the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.430 
the edge on it so notice it's got the
bail<00:02:36.010> hook<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:37.540> this<00:02:37.660> hook<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.230> wire

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
bail hook so this hook and the wire

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.009 
bail hook so this hook and the wire
actually<00:02:38.950> allows<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.820> have<00:02:40.150> this<00:02:40.420> over<00:02:40.989> a

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
actually allows you to have this over a

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.620 
actually allows you to have this over a
campfire<00:02:41.440> or<00:02:42.430> get<00:02:42.820> it<00:02:42.940> out<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.269> a<00:02:43.330> campfire

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
campfire or get it out of a campfire

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.479 
campfire or get it out of a campfire
over<00:02:43.780> hang<00:02:44.380> it<00:02:44.470> over<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.680> fire<00:02:44.920> or<00:02:45.100> get<00:02:45.250> it<00:02:45.370> out

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
over hang it over a fire or get it out

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.790 
over hang it over a fire or get it out
of<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.640> campfire<00:02:45.970> really<00:02:46.480> easy<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:47.380> is<00:02:47.590> also

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
of a campfire really easy this is also

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.280 
of a campfire really easy this is also
nice<00:02:48.130> thing<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.489> have<00:02:48.670> on<00:02:48.700> this

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.380 

now<00:02:52.290> these<00:02:52.440> pots<00:02:52.800> themselves<00:02:53.190> actually<00:02:54.180> are

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
now these pots themselves actually are

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.600 
now these pots themselves actually are
aluminum<00:02:55.080> now<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.320> heard<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.310> there<00:02:56.460> is<00:02:56.550> a

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
aluminum now I heard that there is a

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.000 
aluminum now I heard that there is a
stainless<00:02:56.850> steel<00:02:57.000> model<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.600> these<00:02:57.950> this<00:02:58.950> one

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
stainless steel model of these this one

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.820 
stainless steel model of these this one
here<00:02:59.460> is<00:02:59.730> an<00:03:00.090> aluminum<00:03:00.900> model<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.710> then

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
here is an aluminum model and then

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.070 
here is an aluminum model and then
there's<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.130> Trangia<00:03:02.370> stove<00:03:02.990> and<00:03:03.990> the

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
there's the Trangia stove and the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.890 
there's the Trangia stove and the
Trangia<00:03:04.320> itself<00:03:05.390> there's<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.510> little<00:03:06.780> bit

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
Trangia itself there's a little bit

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.900 
Trangia itself there's a little bit
larger<00:03:07.350> than<00:03:07.470> what<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.830> would<00:03:07.950> get<00:03:08.160> from<00:03:08.640> the

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
larger than what you would get from the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.060 
larger than what you would get from the
industrial<00:03:09.480> Trangia<00:03:09.960> that<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.380> would<00:03:10.560> the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
industrial Trangia that you would the

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.680 
industrial Trangia that you would the
the<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.610> mass-produced<00:03:12.270> ones<00:03:12.450> that<00:03:12.600> they

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
the the mass-produced ones that they

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.720 
the the mass-produced ones that they
have<00:03:12.870> now<00:03:13.110> so<00:03:13.830> this<00:03:13.980> one<00:03:14.130> is<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.310> little<00:03:14.610> bit

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
have now so this one is a little bit

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.690 
have now so this one is a little bit
larger<00:03:15.030> by<00:03:15.210> about<00:03:15.480> 10<00:03:15.780> maybe<00:03:16.050> 20%<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.140> is<00:03:19.350> I

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
larger by about 10 maybe 20% and it is I

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.100 
larger by about 10 maybe 20% and it is I
guess<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.820> typical<00:03:21.150> Trangia<00:03:21.510> just<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.960> bit

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
guess the typical Trangia just a bit

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.750 
guess the typical Trangia just a bit
larger<00:03:22.470> cause<00:03:22.710> a<00:03:22.740> little<00:03:23.040> bit<00:03:23.160> more<00:03:23.280> fuel<00:03:23.550> to

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
larger cause a little bit more fuel to

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.420 
larger cause a little bit more fuel to
it<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.540> only<00:03:24.600> thing<00:03:24.990> with<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:25.710> one<00:03:25.890> is<00:03:26.130> when

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
it the only thing with this one is when

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.460 
it the only thing with this one is when
you<00:03:26.520> get<00:03:26.700> if<00:03:26.940> you<00:03:27.060> get<00:03:27.180> one<00:03:27.360> is<00:03:27.660> there's<00:03:28.230> no

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
you get if you get one is there's no

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.650 
you get if you get one is there's no
snuper<00:03:28.890> lid<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.160> comes<00:03:29.370> with<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.210> so<00:03:30.600> you

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
snuper lid that comes with it and so you

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.720 
snuper lid that comes with it and so you
still<00:03:31.020> have<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.470> use<00:03:31.620> this<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.160> snorkel<00:03:32.580> lid

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
still have to use this is a snorkel lid

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.220 
still have to use this is a snorkel lid
I<00:03:33.890> typically<00:03:34.890> use<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.370> snuff<00:03:35.970> mine<00:03:36.270> I<00:03:36.630> use<00:03:36.900> one

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
I typically use to snuff mine I use one

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.700 
I typically use to snuff mine I use one
of<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:38.090> one<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.210> simmer<00:03:39.450> rings<00:03:39.750> from<00:03:40.290> one

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
of the one of the simmer rings from one

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.470 
of the one of the simmer rings from one
of<00:03:40.800> my<00:03:40.890> other<00:03:41.010> transy<00:03:41.460> is<00:03:41.580> I<00:03:41.610> have<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.180> it's

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
of my other transy is I have and it's

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.110 
of my other transy is I have and it's
nuts<00:03:42.810> out<00:03:42.990> it<00:03:43.620> stuffs<00:03:43.920> it<00:03:44.040> out<00:03:44.190> quite<00:03:45.060> well

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
nuts out it stuffs it out quite well

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.750 
nuts out it stuffs it out quite well
then<00:03:45.510> now<00:03:45.930> you<00:03:46.020> have<00:03:46.050> your<00:03:46.290> bottle<00:03:46.590> your<00:03:47.550> fuel

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
then now you have your bottle your fuel

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.550 
then now you have your bottle your fuel
bottle<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.330> this<00:03:48.600> bottle<00:03:48.870> is<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:49.020> typical<00:03:49.380> just

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
bottle and this bottle is a typical just

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.230 
bottle and this bottle is a typical just
a<00:03:49.650> little<00:03:49.830> plastic<00:03:50.220> bottle<00:03:50.520> a<00:03:50.550> pretty

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
a little plastic bottle a pretty

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.050 
a little plastic bottle a pretty
lightweight<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.900> holds<00:03:52.830> around<00:03:52.980> nine<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.030> a

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
lightweight and holds around nine and a

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.120 
lightweight and holds around nine and a
half<00:03:54.209> maybe<00:03:54.450> ten<00:03:54.840> ounces<00:03:55.170> of<00:03:55.320> fuel<00:03:55.560> pretty

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
half maybe ten ounces of fuel pretty

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.940
