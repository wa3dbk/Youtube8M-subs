worth it you get so much more dark

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.110 
worth it you get so much more dark

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
elixir so that'll help with the upgrades

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.729 
elixir so that'll help with the upgrades
that's<00:03:23.450> definitely<00:03:23.600> pretty<00:03:23.959> cool<00:03:24.019> I'm<00:03:24.620> gonna

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.550 
there guys we just have another cannon
right<00:03:44.090> here<00:03:44.480> actually<00:03:45.260> you<00:03:45.320> know<00:03:45.380> what<00:03:45.470> I'm

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
gonna do I'm gonna go ahead and get this

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.600 
gonna do I'm gonna go ahead and get this
cannon<00:03:47.750> upgrading<00:03:48.230> I'll<00:03:48.650> work<00:03:48.860> on<00:03:49.010> that<00:03:49.190> Tesla

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
cannon upgrading I'll work on that Tesla

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.910 
cannon upgrading I'll work on that Tesla
but<00:03:49.850> I<00:03:50.120> think<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:50.900> cannon<00:03:51.200> needs<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:51.560> get<00:03:51.769> up

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
but I think that cannon needs to get up

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.440 
but I think that cannon needs to get up
to<00:03:52.010> level<00:03:52.250> 10<00:03:52.280> so<00:03:52.610> I'm<00:03:52.700> done<00:03:52.850> with<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.030> cannons

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
to level 10 so I'm done with the cannons

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.449 
to level 10 so I'm done with the cannons
then<00:03:54.079> we<00:03:54.200> got<00:03:54.350> only<00:03:54.440> got<00:03:54.680> like<00:03:54.829> one<00:03:55.100> Archer

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
then we got only got like one Archer

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.210 
then we got only got like one Archer
tower<00:03:55.640> two<00:03:55.970> Archer<00:03:56.299> towers<00:03:56.630> left<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:57.530> then

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
tower two Archer towers left and then

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.650 
tower two Archer towers left and then
that's<00:03:58.489> pretty<00:03:58.640> much<00:03:58.880> it<00:03:59.120> this<00:03:59.299> can't<00:03:59.540> be

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
that's pretty much it this can't be

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.100 
that's pretty much it this can't be
upgraded<00:04:00.079> right<00:04:00.640> yeah<00:04:01.640> so<00:04:01.959> everything<00:04:02.959> looks

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.219 
get this by the end of the month guys I
was<00:04:29.120> thinking<00:04:29.150> it<00:04:29.510> would<00:04:29.600> be<00:04:29.660> a<00:04:29.780> lot<00:04:30.020> quicker

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
was thinking it would be a lot quicker

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.800 
was thinking it would be a lot quicker
one<00:04:31.010> guy<00:04:31.190> said<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.490> took<00:04:31.639> him<00:04:31.820> 24<00:04:32.360> days<00:04:32.540> to

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
one guy said it took him 24 days to

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.870 
one guy said it took him 24 days to
grind<00:04:33.080> just<00:04:33.380> for<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.680> gold<00:04:33.919> for<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.639> walls

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.219 
grind just for the gold for the walls
and<00:04:35.300> I<00:04:35.419> didn't<00:04:35.630> think<00:04:35.780> it<00:04:35.840> would<00:04:35.930> take<00:04:36.080> that

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
and I didn't think it would take that

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.189 
and I didn't think it would take that
much<00:04:36.290> longer<00:04:36.770> for<00:04:36.979> the<00:04:37.330> other<00:04:38.330> stuff<00:04:38.630> but<00:04:38.900> it

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
much longer for the other stuff but it

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:40.780 
much longer for the other stuff but it
takes<00:04:39.560> it<00:04:39.740> quite<00:04:40.010> a<00:04:40.040> while<00:04:40.250> I<00:04:40.280> think<00:04:40.400> I've<00:04:40.669> been

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
takes it quite a while I think I've been

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.060 
takes it quite a while I think I've been
at<00:04:40.940> this<00:04:41.120> town<00:04:41.330> all<00:04:41.510> for<00:04:41.720> around<00:04:42.590> two<00:04:42.919> and<00:04:43.010> a

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
at this town all for around two and a

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.390 
at this town all for around two and a
half<00:04:43.190> months<00:04:43.550> now<00:04:43.610> so<00:04:44.360> I'm<00:04:44.630> aiming<00:04:45.110> for<00:04:45.400> three

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
half months now so I'm aiming for three

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.740 
half months now so I'm aiming for three
months<00:04:46.700> I<00:04:46.790> think<00:04:46.970> it<00:04:47.090> should<00:04:47.240> be<00:04:47.360> three<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:47.720> a

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
months I think it should be three and a

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.300 
months I think it should be three and a
half<00:04:47.870> months<00:04:48.260> at<00:04:48.380> ten<00:04:48.590> or<00:04:48.710> level<00:04:48.950> eight<00:04:49.100> and

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
half months at ten or level eight and

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.469 
half months at ten or level eight and
then<00:04:49.460> we'll<00:04:49.639> be<00:04:49.760> at<00:04:49.850> channel<00:04:50.150> level<00:04:50.270> nine

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
then we'll be at channel level nine

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:51.879 
then we'll be at channel level nine
which<00:04:50.660> I'm<00:04:50.750> really<00:04:50.930> excited<00:04:51.080> about<00:04:51.470> I<00:04:51.650> think

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
which I'm really excited about I think

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:53.620 
which I'm really excited about I think
that'll<00:04:52.070> be<00:04:52.100> awesome<00:04:52.310> I<00:04:52.760> haven't<00:04:53.270> decided<00:04:53.479> yet

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
that'll be awesome I haven't decided yet

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.870 
that'll be awesome I haven't decided yet
is<00:04:53.870> once<00:04:54.200> I<00:04:54.320> hit<00:04:54.380> 1000<00:04:54.620> level<00:04:54.950> nine<00:04:55.310> if<00:04:55.580> I<00:04:55.669> want

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
is once I hit 1000 level nine if I want

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.730 
is once I hit 1000 level nine if I want
to<00:04:56.030> max<00:04:56.300> out<00:04:56.450> all<00:04:56.630> these<00:04:56.810> walls<00:04:57.050> first<00:04:57.350> or<00:04:57.530> if<00:04:57.650> I

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
to max out all these walls first or if I

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.260 
to max out all these walls first or if I
want<00:04:57.919> to<00:04:58.010> add<00:04:58.160> in<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.460> other<00:04:58.639> walls<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.180> then

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
want to add in the other walls and then

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.779 
want to add in the other walls and then
just<00:05:00.050> catch<00:05:00.350> those<00:05:00.590> ones<00:05:00.860> up<00:05:01.040> and<00:05:01.340> then<00:05:01.580> max

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
just catch those ones up and then max

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.430 
just catch those ones up and then max
out<00:05:02.000> everything<00:05:02.419> I<00:05:02.600> think<00:05:02.930> I'll<00:05:03.139> probably<00:05:03.200> go

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
out everything I think I'll probably go

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.260 
out everything I think I'll probably go
that<00:05:03.590> route<00:05:03.770> because<00:05:04.130> it's<00:05:04.610> not<00:05:04.820> using

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
that route because it's not using

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.790 
that route because it's not using
everything<00:05:05.930> that<00:05:06.050> the<00:05:06.139> town<00:05:06.320> on<00:05:06.440> level<00:05:06.650> nine

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
everything that the town on level nine

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.650 
everything that the town on level nine
has<00:05:06.950> to<00:05:07.100> offer<00:05:07.220> if<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:07.490> don't<00:05:07.669> do<00:05:07.760> that<00:05:07.880> so<00:05:08.120> I'll
