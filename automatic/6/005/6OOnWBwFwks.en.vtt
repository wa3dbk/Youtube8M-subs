00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
think no matter how high your ranking is

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:04.890 
think no matter how high your ranking is
or<00:04:03.760> what<00:04:04.120> you<00:04:04.270> achieved

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
or what you achieved

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.740 
or what you achieved
I<00:04:05.050> think<00:04:05.709> people<00:04:06.360> respect<00:04:07.360> that<00:04:07.600> from<00:04:07.870> me<00:04:08.020> and

I think people respect that from me and
and<00:04:10.750> that's

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
and that's

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.400 
and that's
think<00:04:11.380> I'm<00:04:11.500> quite<00:04:11.770> proud<00:04:12.040> of<00:04:13.140> well<00:04:14.140> when<00:04:14.380> I

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
think I'm quite proud of well when I

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.349 
think I'm quite proud of well when I
think<00:04:14.710> we<00:04:14.920> finished<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.430> be<00:04:15.580> in<00:04:15.670> tears<00:04:16.060> that

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
think we finished to be in tears that

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.030 
think we finished to be in tears that
we'll<00:04:16.540> probably<00:04:16.810> start<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.410> think<00:04:17.739> a<00:04:17.829> bit<00:04:18.010> more

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
we'll probably start to think a bit more

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.260 
we'll probably start to think a bit more
carry<00:04:18.489> but<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:21.070> know<00:04:21.250> it's<00:04:21.730> probably<00:04:21.970> going

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
carry but you know it's probably going

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.410 
carry but you know it's probably going
to<00:04:22.360> be<00:04:22.420> a<00:04:22.540> tough<00:04:22.810> night<00:04:22.990> to<00:04:23.200> sleep<00:04:23.380> on<00:04:23.940> but<00:04:24.940> I

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
to be a tough night to sleep on but I

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.270 
to be a tough night to sleep on but I
would<00:04:25.960> have<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.200> time<00:04:26.230> to<00:04:26.620> think<00:04:26.800> about<00:04:26.920> what

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
would have the time to think about what

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.140 
would have the time to think about what
I<00:04:27.310> would<00:04:27.430> do<00:04:27.730> next<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.950> probably<00:04:29.950> though<00:04:30.160> the

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
I would do next and probably though the

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.760 
I would do next and probably though the
present<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.780> world<00:04:31.990> we<00:04:32.140> know<00:04:32.380> and

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
present the world we know and

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.620 
present the world we know and
when<00:04:33.520> I<00:04:33.610> will<00:04:33.790> have<00:04:33.850> something<00:04:34.330> that<00:04:34.510> was

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
when I will have something that was

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.590 
when I will have something that was
going<00:04:34.840> on<00:04:35.850> professionally<00:04:36.850> or<00:04:37.090> in<00:04:37.210> my<00:04:37.360> life

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
going on professionally or in my life

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.790 
going on professionally or in my life
but<00:04:38.140> um<00:04:38.790> but<00:04:39.790> for<00:04:40.000> now<00:04:40.330> we<00:04:40.540> love<00:04:40.750> I<00:04:41.110> would

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
but um but for now we love I would

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.400 
but um but for now we love I would
probably<00:04:42.070> just<00:04:42.750> kind<00:04:43.750> of<00:04:43.840> relax<00:04:44.290> and<00:04:46.140> and<00:04:47.140> let

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
probably just kind of relax and and let

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.370 
probably just kind of relax and and let
the<00:04:47.560> stress<00:04:47.860> go<00:04:48.070> out<00:04:48.280> and<00:04:48.580> and<00:04:48.940> and<00:04:49.600> be<00:04:50.080> able<00:04:50.169> to

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
the stress go out and and and be able to
