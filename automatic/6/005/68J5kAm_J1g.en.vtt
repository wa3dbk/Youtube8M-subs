00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.819
 good to all attached to a new video 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.560
 the 419 of the dawn of sage it 

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:07.570
 solves with favorites helps a lot and 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.980
 good news the truth pretty good 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.590
 quite surprising on one side and 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.870
 quite obvious on the other the truth a 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.250
 sample of many statements about 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.560
 all for the developers of 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.199
 video games that said that basically 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.230
 Well, youtubers and others, well, no, 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.300
 they contributed hardly anything to what the 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.479
 video game sales and other 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.769
 others like for example feel fish 

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:31.059
 creator of fez that good that said 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.940
 also because youtubers are about 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:36.460
 thieves for uploading video games and so on and 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.170
 also for making money with it and today 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.390
 basically we find this 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.490
 totally contradictory news all 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.230
 what we have heard previously what 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.430
 that we already know the people that we are 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.800
 here on youtube and the viewers 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.240
 logically that youtube basically 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.280
 It serves to make people discover 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.650
 games that are worthy enough 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.010
 good as you know is that 3 came out 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.079
 2010 and it seems that this year in the kingdom 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.360
 United is being throughout the year 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.220
 among the top 40 of the most games 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.710
 sold in fact these weeks all in 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.460
 number 20 and it seems that the 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.280
 Applications 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.799
 or as they indicate enough 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.500
 magazines and others seems to be that this is 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.150
 this due to the increase of youtube is 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.990
 that the game is going up is that there 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.119
 three in particular so it must be good 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.280
 in their videos because they add millions and 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.960
 millions of visits and logically 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.909
 when people see so much publicity 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.200
 we could say advertising no longer reaches 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.909
 be advertising or when someone sees that 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.009
 he is passing it on to another person well 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.960
 with a video game he ends up buying 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.320
 this could be pretty good for 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.300
 boost the development of skate 4 and 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.190
 it seems that game has even asked 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.920
 electronic arts that make more copies of the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.750
 game to continue selling those of moles 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.250
 good about the year with respect to 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.000
 previous year the sales of this game 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.929
 they have gone up 33 percent which is 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.600
 an authentic past the truth and the 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.720
 we really hope that this kind of thing 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.979
 Well, we could say, taking 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.700
 not that people keep going up 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.789
 good games 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.590
 what do I know I think they are worth much more 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.849
 opinion of someone impartial we could 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.540
 say that maybe a magazine that 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.830
 is subject to criticism of certain 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.170
 aspects that maybe the players do not 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.430
 you are interested at all you do not have to 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.620
 have everything logically has to 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.170
 have youtube and also have to have 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.819
 logically magazines and others and analysis 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.170
 and all this but I think what the 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.610
 consumer after all he wants is 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.160
 have fun is not going to someone else 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.180
 have fun logically he himself knows that 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.980
 you can probably have fun not 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.900
 so good the truth enough 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.519
 quite interesting that news that 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.310
 contradicts all the issues that already 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:46.390
 we had listened let's go in the super 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.390
 next video until next time
