a<00:02:23.670> boost<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.150> energy<00:02:24.210> and<00:02:24.600> caffeine<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.290> I'm

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
a boost of energy and caffeine and I'm

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.870 
a boost of energy and caffeine and I'm
through<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.830> roof<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.280> all<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.520> way<00:02:26.640> I'd

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
through the roof and all the way I'd

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.050 
through the roof and all the way I'd
recommend<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.420> but<00:02:27.660> just<00:02:28.260> on<00:02:28.350> flavor<00:02:28.650> alone

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
recommend this but just on flavor alone

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.070

I'd<00:02:30.060> have<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:30.270> say<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:30.690> can<00:02:30.810> do<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> lot

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
I'd have to say that you can do a lot

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.370 
I'd have to say that you can do a lot
better<00:02:31.140> than<00:02:31.440> this<00:02:32.480> unless<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.660> just<00:02:33.990> might

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
better than this unless you just might

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.870 
better than this unless you just might
as<00:02:34.470> well<00:02:34.590> just<00:02:34.740> drink<00:02:34.950> water<00:02:35.160> right<00:02:35.760> out<00:02:35.790> of

your tab and throw a blue raspberry in

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.350 
your tab and throw a blue raspberry in
it<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.690> I'd<00:02:39.960> have<00:02:39.990> to<00:02:40.170> say<00:02:40.610> no<00:02:41.610> on<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.240> high

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360
