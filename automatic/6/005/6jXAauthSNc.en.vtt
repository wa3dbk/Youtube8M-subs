you

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:01:02.020 

you

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.639 

everybody<00:01:02.899> was<00:01:02.989> pretty<00:01:03.079> concerned<00:01:03.320> about

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
everybody was pretty concerned about

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.049 
everybody was pretty concerned about
conditions<00:01:04.190> with<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.519> rain<00:01:04.640> that<00:01:04.820> we've<00:01:04.940> had

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
conditions with the rain that we've had

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.810 
conditions with the rain that we've had
recently<00:01:05.770> so<00:01:06.770> there's<00:01:07.280> I<00:01:07.430> think<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.640> lot<00:01:07.790> of

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
recently so there's I think a lot of

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.330 
recently so there's I think a lot of
nervous<00:01:08.150> energy<00:01:08.240> at<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.690> start<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.290> lot<00:01:10.250> of

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
nervous energy at the start and a lot of

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.609 
nervous energy at the start and a lot of
really<00:01:10.580> strong<00:01:10.820> riders<00:01:11.240> today<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:12.440> we<00:01:12.590> left

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
really strong riders today so we left

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.280 
really strong riders today so we left
out<00:01:13.040> of<00:01:13.070> here<00:01:13.580> at<00:01:13.640> a<00:01:13.880> pretty<00:01:14.420> breakneck<00:01:14.690> speed

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
out of here at a pretty breakneck speed

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.740 
out of here at a pretty breakneck speed
I<00:01:15.320> thought<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:17.000> as<00:01:17.150> it<00:01:17.390> turned<00:01:17.570> out<00:01:17.690> the

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
I thought and as it turned out the

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.090 
I thought and as it turned out the
conditions<00:01:18.259> were<00:01:18.350> really<00:01:18.470> pretty<00:01:18.710> good<00:01:18.920> there

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
conditions were really pretty good there

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.380 
conditions were really pretty good there
wasn't<00:01:19.130> all<00:01:19.460> that<00:01:19.490> much<00:01:19.640> mud<00:01:19.970> on<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.180> course

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
wasn't all that much mud on the course

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.700 
wasn't all that much mud on the course
we<00:01:20.540> had<00:01:20.659> hop<00:01:20.780> off<00:01:20.930> for<00:01:21.110> bikes<00:01:21.259> a<00:01:21.380> couple<00:01:21.590> times

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
we had hop off for bikes a couple times

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.430 
we had hop off for bikes a couple times
and<00:01:21.979> run<00:01:22.130> through<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.369> weeds<00:01:23.320> affording<00:01:24.320> the

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
and run through the weeds affording the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.680 
and run through the weeds affording the
verdigris<00:01:24.770> River<00:01:24.950> up<00:01:25.820> to<00:01:26.000> your<00:01:26.119> waist<00:01:26.240> almost

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
verdigris River up to your waist almost

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.710 
verdigris River up to your waist almost
was<00:01:26.960> pretty<00:01:27.950> fun<00:01:28.159> but<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.060> wind<00:01:29.270> was<00:01:29.420> probably

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
was pretty fun but the wind was probably

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.450 
was pretty fun but the wind was probably
the<00:01:29.810> biggest<00:01:29.960> thing<00:01:30.140> a<00:01:30.350> strong<00:01:30.590> west<00:01:30.860> wind<00:01:31.130> and

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
the biggest thing a strong west wind and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.100 
the biggest thing a strong west wind and
that<00:01:31.940> really<00:01:32.210> kind<00:01:32.330> of<00:01:32.450> cut<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:32.690> whole<00:01:32.930> group

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
that really kind of cut the whole group

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.620 
that really kind of cut the whole group
to<00:01:33.350> ribbons<00:01:34.039> and<00:01:34.369> by<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:34.820> second<00:01:35.479> checkpoint

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
to ribbons and by the second checkpoint

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.529 
to ribbons and by the second checkpoint
I<00:01:35.899> think<00:01:36.080> it<00:01:36.170> was<00:01:36.259> just<00:01:36.410> three<00:01:36.679> of<00:01:36.710> us<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.280> then

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
I think it was just three of us and then

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.560 
I think it was just three of us and then
flat<00:01:38.539> tires<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:39.020> I<00:01:39.320> think<00:01:39.530> probably<00:01:39.759> not<00:01:40.759> map

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
flat tires and I think probably not map

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.370 
flat tires and I think probably not map
reading<00:01:41.780> skills<00:01:41.920> might<00:01:42.920> have<00:01:43.330> put<00:01:44.330> paid<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:44.600> a

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
reading skills might have put paid to a

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.160 
reading skills might have put paid to a
couple<00:01:45.740> of<00:01:45.800> guys<00:01:45.920> I<00:01:46.070> was<00:01:46.190> riding<00:01:46.429> with<00:01:46.490> so<00:01:47.170> but

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.330

miles of edmond i think it was

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
definitely what everybody says about

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.850 
definitely what everybody says about
Kansas<00:02:11.780> last<00:02:11.989> year<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:12.319> think<00:02:12.560> we<00:02:12.650> got<00:02:12.830> lucky

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
Kansas last year I think we got lucky

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.610 
Kansas last year I think we got lucky
with<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.370> conditions<00:02:13.879> and<00:02:14.239> you<00:02:14.810> know<00:02:14.959> it<00:02:15.440> was

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
with the conditions and you know it was

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.559 
with the conditions and you know it was
still<00:02:15.980> but<00:02:16.370> this<00:02:16.549> year<00:02:16.819> is<00:02:17.000> just<00:02:17.030> everywhere

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
still but this year is just everywhere

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.860 
still but this year is just everywhere
you<00:02:17.870> turn<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.440> win<00:02:18.620> in<00:02:18.799> your<00:02:18.920> face<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:20.720> know

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
you turn to win in your face you know

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.530 
you turn to win in your face you know
bending<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.739> trees<00:02:22.129> and<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.549> plants<00:02:22.610> over

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
bending the trees and the plants over

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.570 
bending the trees and the plants over
and<00:02:23.840> there<00:02:24.349> was<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.500> lot<00:02:24.799> harder<00:02:25.069> than<00:02:25.310> last

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
and there was a lot harder than last

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.759 
and there was a lot harder than last
year<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.209> I<00:02:26.420> also<00:02:26.569> took<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.959> wrong<00:02:27.140> turn<00:02:27.200> so<00:02:27.709> I

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769
