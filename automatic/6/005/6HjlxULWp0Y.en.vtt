doesn't<00:02:16.530> want<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.250> burn<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:17.700> it's<00:02:17.819> going<00:02:17.940> to

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
doesn't want to burn so it's going to

chamber which is going to change your
volume<00:02:21.930> volumetric<00:02:22.440> efficiency<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.850> tell

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
volume volumetric efficiency so you tell

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.510 
volume volumetric efficiency so you tell
me<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.300> side<00:02:24.510> effects<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.959> sour<00:02:25.260> gas<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:26.160> rough

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
me the side effects of sour gas is rough

anything<00:02:30.480> more<00:02:30.720> like<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:30.990> should<00:02:31.110> be<00:02:31.170> looking

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
anything more like you should be looking

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.559 
anything more like you should be looking
for<00:02:31.410> well<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.250> actually<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.970> can<00:02:33.150> smell<00:02:33.390> it

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
for well you actually you can smell it

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.899 
for well you actually you can smell it
sometimes<00:02:34.560> that's<00:02:34.770> where<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.129> sour<00:02:35.549> comes

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
sometimes that's where the sour comes

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.429 
sometimes that's where the sour comes
from<00:02:36.090> sometimes<00:02:36.480> as<00:02:36.659> it's<00:02:36.840> burning<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.290> fuel

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
from sometimes as it's burning the fuel

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.110 
from sometimes as it's burning the fuel
it<00:02:37.650> smells<00:02:38.010> funny<00:02:38.310> which<00:02:39.239> is<00:02:39.569> and

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
it smells funny which is and

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.910 
it smells funny which is and
and<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.569> other<00:02:40.720> thing<00:02:40.810> would<00:02:41.140> be<00:02:41.349> really<00:02:41.590> poor

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
and the other thing would be really poor

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.000 
and the other thing would be really poor
emissions<00:02:42.840> if<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:43.989> had<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.379> and<00:02:44.590> then<00:02:44.709> say

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
emissions if you had that and then say

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.830

you're<00:02:45.220> in<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:45.670> an<00:02:45.790> entertainment<00:02:46.180> state<00:02:46.629> like

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
you're in in an entertainment state like

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.449 
you're in in an entertainment state like
California<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.739> you<00:02:47.799> took<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.010> down<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.250> have

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
California and you took it down to have

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.100 
California and you took it down to have
it<00:02:48.580> smogged<00:02:48.849> and<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.420> wouldn't<00:02:49.569> pass<00:02:49.810> that

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
it smogged and it wouldn't pass that

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.740 
it smogged and it wouldn't pass that
might<00:02:50.650> be<00:02:50.769> it<00:02:50.890> right<00:02:51.069> there<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:52.209> now<00:02:52.390> how<00:02:52.599> do<00:02:52.659> I

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
might be it right there so now how do I

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.710 
might be it right there so now how do I
fight<00:02:53.200> sour<00:02:53.590> gas<00:02:54.840> not<00:02:55.840> have<00:02:56.110> gasoline<00:02:56.349> in<00:02:56.799> it

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
fight sour gas not have gasoline in it

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.180

in there that fights that so you got
three<00:03:42.879> things<00:03:43.150> you<00:03:43.239> got<00:03:43.390> fueled<00:03:43.750> stability

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
three things you got fueled stability

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.830 
three things you got fueled stability
you<00:03:44.829> got<00:03:44.980> detergency<00:03:45.489> and<00:03:45.880> you've<00:03:46.630> got

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
you got detergency and you've got

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.629 
you got detergency and you've got
corrosion<00:03:47.319> inhibition<00:03:47.709> so<00:03:48.370> you<00:03:48.459> have<00:03:48.579> the

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
corrosion inhibition so you have the

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.339 
corrosion inhibition so you have the
whole<00:03:48.790> package<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.299> this<00:03:49.450> one<00:03:49.690> item<00:03:50.169> here

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
whole package and this one item here

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.490 
whole package and this one item here
right<00:03:50.680> ok<00:03:51.579> so<00:03:51.639> now<00:03:51.910> that's<00:03:52.720> one<00:03:52.959> way<00:03:53.139> to<00:03:53.169> fight

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
right ok so now that's one way to fight

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.080 
right ok so now that's one way to fight
it<00:03:53.650> but<00:03:53.829> what<00:03:54.010> about<00:03:54.220> if<00:03:54.340> it<00:03:54.489> catches<00:03:54.700> me<00:03:54.970> off

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
it but what about if it catches me off

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.670 
it but what about if it catches me off
guard<00:03:55.120> I<00:03:55.599> didn't<00:03:55.959> even<00:03:56.019> think<00:03:56.200> about<00:03:56.349> putting

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
guard I didn't even think about putting

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.349 
guard I didn't even think about putting
anything<00:03:57.010> in<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.430> when<00:03:57.730> I<00:03:57.760> went<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.000> store<00:03:58.209> my
