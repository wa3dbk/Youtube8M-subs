 hello friends, I am diana monzer and 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.910

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.680
 I am right now in Israel 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.150
 specifically in the area of megido 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.940
 As you can see, it's something 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.560
 awesome and it's super pretty so 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.970
 many more registered to speak to them 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.860
 about some marvel characters 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.039
 but I wonder if they know 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.210
 really this great editorial so 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.030
 let's take advantage because this year

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.630
 about the 10 curiosities that maybe 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.630
 you did not know about marvel comics 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.379
 originally it was founded with the name 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.690
 of network circle comics then went on to do 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.780
 back comics and time after timely 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.579
 comics and there is no lack in 1961 that is called 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.530
 a marvel marvel is one of the hallmarks 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.179
 Most important in the world 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.729

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.049
 I command in 2012 to marvel and disney and 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.479
 claimed that rights and property 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:00.049
 of the characters were absolutely from 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:01.629
 the 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:03.739
 finally disney won the demand 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.780
 assuring that stanley had given him 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.880
 the rights of his characters and makes 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.890
 long the name of spider-man 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.140
 is separated with a script because more 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.000
 resented was almost going to differentiate from 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.979
 the heroes of saying like superman and 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.380

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.750
 together originally the color of 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.220
 character in hole was gray but because of 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.869
 that the green print was 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.149
 much simpler its color changed 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.369
 also initially the doctor banner 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.409
 it only became a monster 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.200
 during the night the popular character 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.390
 then it was created as a parody to 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.789
