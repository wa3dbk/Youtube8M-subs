00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:13.429
 today we are going to prepare sheets of 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:14.900
 chocolate with veined wood effect and 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.420
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.650
 they are chocolate to melt white and 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.340
 chocolate to melt black and here 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.320
 We have dark chocolate and white 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:31.450
 The materials that we will need are 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.850
 a batting cue and acetate sheet 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.070
 the cue to hit we can find 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.530
 in any specialized center of 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.170
 paint and the acetate sheet in 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.300
 any stationery 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:49.220
 we have the batting cue and the blade 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.620
 of acetate to begin with let's put 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.480
 melt white chocolate in a bain marie 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.760
 and once it is melted we remove it 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.710
 Now I'm going to take a rug from 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.379
 silicone so that the acetate sheet 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.540
 do not slide so we put the sheet 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.970
 of acetate on the table and we are going to 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.180
 put on the top end chocolate 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.520
 cast we must put enough amount 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.399
 so then do not stay without middle 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.410
 veined now we take a spatula and 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.180
 we scatter a little chocolate towards 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.229
 down to make it easier for us 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.600
 distribute it now we take the cue with the 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.220
 circular shape up we passed the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.990
 another end about the chocolate and 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.479
 we go down following the shape of the taco 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.240
 exerting a bit of pressure that is 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.610
 as if it were a seesaw now 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.950
 with the help of a knife or spatula what 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.840
 we are going to lift very carefully for 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.580
 do not touch the chocolate and we will leave it 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.580
 stand in the fridge 10 minutes 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.670
 now let's put to melt the 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.520
 chocolate in the bain- marie and once 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.649
 cast it we remove it we take the 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.299
 black chocolate must be as 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.110
 cold possible so as not to melt the 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.180
 white chocolate 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.430
 but at the same time he must be 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.840
 liquid to cover the entire sheet 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:13.210
 in a uniform way we must put a 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.210
 pretty generous amount of chocolate 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:22.330
 and now with the help of a spatula we are going 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:32.530
 to spread it we must cover it completely 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:34.750
 all the foil the chocolate foil does not 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.520
 must stay very fine because if you do not 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.630
 it will break us but it should not 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.630
 stay very thick 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.400
 once we have it covered the 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.840
 let's let it sit in the fridge 10 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.840
 Minutitos so that it hardens 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.769
 once we have it hardened we will 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.599
 remove the acetate sheet with care 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:18.980
 so we got up from a little corner and 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:21.200
 as you see, it comes out very easily 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.269

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.580
