are this can be done on pretty much any
operating<00:00:10.860> system<00:00:10.950> all<00:00:11.700> you<00:00:11.820> need<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.059> an

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
operating system all you need is an

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.320 
operating system all you need is an
internet<00:00:12.750> browser<00:00:13.040> flash<00:00:14.040> installed

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
internet browser flash installed

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.599 
internet browser flash installed
shockwave<00:00:15.330> installed<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.560> computer<00:00:17.400> which

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
shockwave installed and a computer which

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.480 
shockwave installed and a computer which
is<00:00:17.640> fast<00:00:18.150> enough<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.630> run<00:00:18.660> flash<00:00:19.320> games<00:00:19.619> some

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
is fast enough to run flash games some

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.720 
is fast enough to run flash games some
in<00:00:20.730> 3d<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:22.820> it<00:00:23.820> takes<00:00:25.250> to<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> fairly

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
in 3d so it takes to have the fairly

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.730 
in 3d so it takes to have the fairly
fast<00:00:26.939> computer<00:00:27.300> I've<00:00:27.480> got<00:00:27.689> I've<00:00:28.080> got<00:00:28.140> 12<00:00:28.500> games

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
fast computer I've got I've got 12 games

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.200 
fast computer I've got I've got 12 games
that<00:00:28.949> are<00:00:29.010> loaded<00:00:29.250> up<00:00:29.340> at<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.550> moment<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.029> it

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
that are loaded up at the moment and it

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.370 
that are loaded up at the moment and it
you<00:00:30.330> can<00:00:30.480> see<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.720> taking<00:00:30.960> thirty-five

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
you can see it's taking thirty-five

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.470 
you can see it's taking thirty-five
percent<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.830> my<00:00:31.980> cpu<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.790> for<00:00:33.120> four<00:00:33.300> hundred

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
percent of my cpu and for four hundred

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.360 
percent of my cpu and for four hundred
and<00:00:33.809> fifty<00:00:34.170> megabytes<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.739> more<00:00:34.860> round<00:00:35.100> just

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
and fifty megabytes and more round just

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.459 
and fifty megabytes and more round just
to<00:00:35.460> show<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.730> these<00:00:36.030> flash<00:00:36.329> games<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.899> some<00:00:37.440> of

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
to show you these flash games so some of

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.660 
to show you these flash games so some of
them<00:00:37.649> are<00:00:37.770> quite<00:00:37.860> memory<00:00:38.510> intensive<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:40.670> let's

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
them are quite memory intensive so let's

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.810 
them are quite memory intensive so let's
begin<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.180> haven't<00:00:42.719> included<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:44.190> games<00:00:44.520> here

kind<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.430> slightly<00:03:08.730> struggling<00:03:09.239> with<00:03:09.360> some<00:03:09.510> of

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
kind of slightly struggling with some of

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.240 
kind of slightly struggling with some of
these<00:03:09.660> games<00:03:09.959> as<00:03:10.290> I've<00:03:10.560> got<00:03:10.739> them<00:03:10.890> all<00:03:11.070> running

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
these games as I've got them all running

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.949 
these games as I've got them all running
at<00:03:11.459> once<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:12.090> obviously<00:03:12.360> they<00:03:12.600> take<00:03:12.810> up

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
at once and obviously they take up

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.500 
at once and obviously they take up
memory<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.620> next<00:03:14.160> one<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.519> mortal<00:03:14.940> kombat<00:03:15.299> or

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
one prince of persia this is game over i

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.840 
one prince of persia this is game over i
just<00:06:27.180> left<00:06:27.270> it<00:06:27.419> running<00:06:27.630> this<00:06:27.780> way<00:06:27.960> so<00:06:28.820> this<00:06:29.820> is

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 
just left it running this way so this is

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.490 
just left it running this way so this is
the<00:06:30.060> principle<00:06:30.330> going<00:06:30.810> not<00:06:31.050> sure<00:06:31.080> if<00:06:31.289> this<00:06:31.350> is

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
the principle going not sure if this is

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.689 
the principle going not sure if this is
anything<00:06:31.680> like<00:06:31.830> the<00:06:32.070> original<00:06:32.430> again<00:06:32.669> I
