00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.170
 for next Sunday's game 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.090
 trainer erwin has against fc dordrecht 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.820
 in terms of players a 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.320
 wider choice than in recent weeks 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.700
 the selection is gradually becoming 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.420
 again a bit wider than the good one goes 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.910
 turn yes 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.300
 of the lane there you get fitter 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.970
 brunettes we reach after the field is 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.499
 becoming fitter the only one still big 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.849
 doubt whether there are two major doubts 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:29.949
 antonia lion 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.290
 For how is it now not 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.789
 good enough and you just looked 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.980
 not exactly did he see unfortunately they were 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.149
 not on the field so let's see if 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.199
 it will work out tomorrow 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.629
 and otherwise it gets tricky for it 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.090
 Tweaking Johan Kappelhof is after a very 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.590
 difficult period due to private circumstances 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.390
 joined again last Monday 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.039
 The group also him look've 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.420
 life and 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.679
 had something to process and that the 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.149
 natural goes from one to 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:55.000
 another day so to him again briefly 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.829
 completely free we go we go for a moment 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.690
 see how this goes on weekend new 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.620
 Way will definitely play against FC 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.839
 dordrecht 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.039
 and he will love to score because 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.989
 the last few weeks he leaves beautiful 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.939
 samples of football, however, do not see that 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.979
 be closed with the goal being 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.619
 adopted by my 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.549
 who pushes himself away how far is the 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.549
 13th help 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.510
 beautiful solo that I won 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.890
 thought also that goes in because that bellows and 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.480
 also for the chickens so then I thought 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.520
 what can i get a sense of it 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.410
 right tone even though I run away and 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.450
 in then still my disappointed read the ball 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.490
 against the paul also come against ado the hague 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.050
 marie just succeeded last sunday 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.020
 not in for a nice action 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.410
 successfully complete that on the slalom 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.200
 and nut chips 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.750
 previously our week an empty goal it us 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.520
 missed performance but here that actually 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.140
 also yes you are just in that phase 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.670
 then just have my balls together 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.840
 rock and hard work just to be there 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.100
 to go through it 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.960
 and that chance they will come there the Sunday 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.010
 yes, yes, of course, but then 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.960
 we also go looking for them 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.940
 try to make mistakes from the start 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.740
 let make and yourself 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.280
 yes try with a lot of pressure 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.110
 to play 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.940
 that seems logical to me 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.140
 your feeling for the jug started 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.850
 I think we should just think of it 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.160
 dordrecht is to last but we have 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.390
 what last set won from gladys die 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.070
 come with your best confidence go 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.680
 in a suspected show right from 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.390
 not in that so has nothing to get 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.230
 immediately sit on top but I think it 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.340
 well 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.500
 how do you expect them to play 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.660
 they will go back down 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.190
 I think they have PSV items anyway 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.560
 well done then 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.239
 game so pretty good so I think they do 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.769
 go back say with us only that too 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.120
 some of the pressure we will put 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.920
 they are still seen at PSV 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.720
 indeed quite back again 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.430
 we have been at go last week 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.630
 seen they were also rub in the beginning 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.350
 throw caution in the second half 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.209
 all brakes off 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.650
 so I don't know exactly what we can do 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.030
 what we expect 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.030
 of course with different scenarios
