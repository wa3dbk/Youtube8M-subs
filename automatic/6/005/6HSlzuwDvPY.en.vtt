00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
like a whole whole world of difference

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.650 
like a whole whole world of difference
anyway<00:03:49.030> let's<00:03:49.269> get<00:03:49.389> on<00:03:49.450> to<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:49.750> articulation

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
anyway let's get on to the articulation

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.470 
anyway let's get on to the articulation
first<00:03:52.660> off<00:03:52.989> we<00:03:53.260> have<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:54.099> scatter<00:03:54.669> shot<00:03:55.030> which

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
first off we have the scatter shot which

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.750 
first off we have the scatter shot which
hat<00:03:56.290> is<00:03:56.319> on<00:03:56.470> a<00:03:56.680> ball-joint<00:03:56.980> but<00:03:57.430> then<00:03:57.549> it<00:03:57.639> also

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
hat is on a ball-joint but then it also

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.479 
hat is on a ball-joint but then it also
has<00:03:58.060> a<00:03:58.120> ratchet<00:03:58.870> so<00:03:59.319> I<00:03:59.500> mean<00:03:59.950> it<00:04:00.040> can<00:04:00.160> move<00:04:00.280> from

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
has a ratchet so I mean it can move from

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.009 
has a ratchet so I mean it can move from
like<00:04:00.669> left<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.090> right<00:04:01.269> it's<00:04:01.599> I<00:04:01.810> mean<00:04:01.989> it's

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
like left to right it's I mean it's

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.080 
like left to right it's I mean it's
loose<00:04:02.530> but<00:04:02.889> like<00:04:03.040> if<00:04:03.489> you<00:04:03.669> put<00:04:03.819> it<00:04:03.940> in<00:04:04.000> this

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
loose but like if you put it in this

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.330

down like so it's easy to move but I
don't<00:04:08.709> like<00:04:08.889> plop<00:04:09.430> down<00:04:09.639> it<00:04:09.849> feel<00:04:10.000> like<00:04:10.090> if<00:04:10.569> you

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
don't like plop down it feel like if you

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.330 
don't like plop down it feel like if you
aim<00:04:10.870> it<00:04:11.019> up<00:04:11.109> it's<00:04:11.349> not<00:04:11.500> going<00:04:11.709> to<00:04:11.769> go<00:04:11.859> up<00:04:12.040> and

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
aim it up it's not going to go up and

aim it up it's not going to go up and
fall<00:04:12.609> down<00:04:13.709> so<00:04:14.709> he<00:04:14.859> has<00:04:14.950> like<00:04:15.040> sort<00:04:15.310> of<00:04:15.340> an

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
fall down so he has like sort of an

fall down so he has like sort of an
elbow<00:04:15.730> joint<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:16.359> then<00:04:16.870> he<00:04:16.959> has<00:04:17.229> up<00:04:18.099> here<00:04:18.430> he

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
elbow joint and then he has up here he

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.670 
elbow joint and then he has up here he
has<00:04:18.639> like<00:04:18.760> a<00:04:18.789> ratchet<00:04:19.269> joint<00:04:19.570> and<00:04:19.750> then<00:04:19.840> a<00:04:19.900> ball

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
has like a ratchet joint and then a ball

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.040 
has like a ratchet joint and then a ball
joint<00:04:20.979> so<00:04:21.190> he<00:04:21.760> can<00:04:21.940> like<00:04:22.120> move<00:04:22.390> his<00:04:22.599> arm<00:04:22.810> down

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
joint so he can like move his arm down

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.150 
joint so he can like move his arm down
and<00:04:23.110> then<00:04:23.530> like<00:04:23.680> out

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
and then like out

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.180 
and then like out
so<00:04:24.790> in<00:04:25.600> his<00:04:25.960> head<00:04:26.260> not<00:04:26.560> too<00:04:26.800> much<00:04:26.950> articulation

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
so in his head not too much articulation

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.820 
so in his head not too much articulation
just<00:04:27.790> a<00:04:28.090> ratcheting<00:04:28.960> joint<00:04:29.200> that<00:04:29.350> makes<00:04:29.590> his

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
just a ratcheting joint that makes his

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.080 
just a ratcheting joint that makes his
head<00:04:30.040> go<00:04:30.280> down<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.750> up<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:32.400> then<00:04:33.400> his<00:04:33.610> arms

these<00:04:34.660> little<00:04:34.960> arms<00:04:35.200> I<00:04:35.290> think<00:04:35.320> of<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.650> most

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
these little arms I think of the most

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.130

articulation<00:04:36.580> they<00:04:37.240> have<00:04:37.360> a<00:04:37.390> ball<00:04:37.690> joint<00:04:37.990> here

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
articulation they have a ball joint here

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.380 
articulation they have a ball joint here
I<00:04:38.740> don't<00:04:39.340> know<00:04:39.490> if<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:39.640> can<00:04:39.760> see<00:04:39.970> I<00:04:40.000> have<00:04:40.300> a

another light turned on the back so he's

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.410 
another light turned on the back so he's
a<00:04:43.150> ball<00:04:43.450> joint<00:04:43.630> here<00:04:44.050> a<00:04:44.220> ratchet<00:04:45.220> and<00:04:45.430> no<00:04:46.000> pivot
