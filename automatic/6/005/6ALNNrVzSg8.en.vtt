applications are generally deleted
instead<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.210> deleting<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.810> thought<00:00:30.960> I'd

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
instead of deleting it I thought I'd

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.840 
instead of deleting it I thought I'd
bring<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.529> YouTube<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.099> give<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.730> away

talk<00:01:23.400> about<00:01:23.520> first<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.450> two<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> cubes

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
talk about first is the two of the cubes

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.399 
talk about first is the two of the cubes
on<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.680> front<00:01:26.220> panel<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.240> main<00:01:28.110> cube

on the front panel of the main cube

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.170 
on the front panel of the main cube
itself<00:01:28.799> right<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.729> mess<00:01:29.909> about<00:01:30.030> with

let<00:01:34.170> me<00:01:34.229> turn<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.590> main<00:01:34.740> lights<00:01:35.070> off<00:01:35.630> and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
let me turn the main lights off and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.980 
let me turn the main lights off and
remove<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.380> red<00:01:38.000> texture<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.210> replace<00:01:39.810> it

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
remove this red texture and replace it

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.260 
remove this red texture and replace it
with<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.140> green<00:01:40.380> texture<00:01:40.860> now<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.610> rendered

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
with a green texture now if I rendered

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.600 
with a green texture now if I rendered
this<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.600> now<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:43.079> itself<00:01:43.500> because<00:01:44.310> I've<00:01:44.430> got

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
this out now in itself because I've got

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.120 
this out now in itself because I've got
two<00:01:44.820> cubes<00:01:45.270> here<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:46.079> green<00:01:46.380> texture<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.070> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
two cubes here the green texture is a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.370 
two cubes here the green texture is a
neon<00:01:47.790> texture<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.840> know<00:01:48.960> inner

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
neon texture but the you know inner

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.310 
neon texture but the you know inner
texture<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.070> black<00:01:50.520> reflective<00:01:51.479> texture<00:01:51.899> so

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
texture is a black reflective texture so

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.770 
texture is a black reflective texture so
prevents<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.979> light<00:01:53.189> shining<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.509> front

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
prevents the light shining on the front

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.240 
prevents the light shining on the front
wall<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.320> I'll<00:01:55.500> demonstrate<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:56.070> for<00:01:56.130> you

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
wall and I'll demonstrate that for you

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.109 
wall and I'll demonstrate that for you
now<00:01:57.979> so<00:01:58.979> as<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.189> can<00:01:59.280> see<00:01:59.520> with<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.790> rendered

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
now so as you can see with that rendered

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.580 
now so as you can see with that rendered
out<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.659> didn't<00:02:00.869> get<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.049> see<00:02:01.200> much<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
out you didn't get to see much on the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.649 
out you didn't get to see much on the
front<00:02:01.799> wall<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.670> lights<00:02:02.850> quite<00:02:03.180> dull<00:02:03.450> on

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659

the side wall and in the room in the
light<00:02:05.759> studio<00:02:06.210> itself<00:02:06.630> if<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.259> turned<00:02:07.649> that

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
light studio itself if I turned that

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.960 
light studio itself if I turned that
inner<00:02:08.399> texture<00:02:08.819> off<00:02:10.099> as<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.310> can<00:02:11.340> see<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.879> get

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
inner texture off as you can see you get

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.740 
inner texture off as you can see you get
a<00:02:12.030> totally<00:02:12.390> different<00:02:12.690> feel<00:02:12.900> and

a lighted studio that you could use in

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.240 
a lighted studio that you could use in
itself<00:02:16.120> well<00:02:16.720> I'm<00:02:16.810> gonna<00:02:16.930> talk<00:02:17.200> now<00:02:17.560> about<00:02:17.830> the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
itself well I'm gonna talk now about the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.130 
itself well I'm gonna talk now about the
light<00:02:18.700> spheres<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.420> what<00:02:19.600> you<00:02:19.690> can<00:02:19.870> do<00:02:20.020> with

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
light spheres and what you can do with

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.940 
light spheres and what you can do with
the<00:02:20.230> lights<00:02:20.440> Fierce

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
creative the text itself the thirteenth

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.780 
creative the text itself the thirteenth
design<00:03:07.989> on<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.230> front<00:03:08.500> wall<00:03:08.709> I've<00:03:08.950> grouped

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
design on the front wall I've grouped

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.530 
design on the front wall I've grouped
together

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
together

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.990 
together
however<00:03:11.170> they<00:03:11.620> are<00:03:11.800> two<00:03:12.340> separate<00:03:12.760> entities

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
however they are two separate entities

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.020 
however they are two separate entities
so<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:13.600> need<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.860> edit<00:03:15.130> them<00:03:15.459> separately

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
so you need to edit them separately

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.390 
so you need to edit them separately
likewise<00:03:16.840> with<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:17.080> beat<00:03:17.350> creative<00:03:17.920> again

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
likewise with the beat creative again

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.699

that's<00:03:18.810> separate<00:03:19.810> on<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.049> wall<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:20.560> can

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
that's separate on the wall and you can

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.070 
that's separate on the wall and you can
turn<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:21.489> off<00:03:21.580> if<00:03:21.640> you<00:03:21.820> like<00:03:21.910> or<00:03:22.510> if<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:22.900> like

turn it off if you like or if you like

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.110 
turn it off if you like or if you like
it<00:03:23.290> there<00:03:23.500> or<00:03:23.709> just<00:03:23.769> keyframe<00:03:24.549> it<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:24.850> move<00:03:25.000> it

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
it there or just keyframe it and move it

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.640 
it there or just keyframe it and move it
about<00:03:25.209> move<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.930> wherever<00:03:26.080> you<00:03:26.380> want<00:03:26.410> to

about move it to wherever you want to

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.740 
about move it to wherever you want to
move<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.220> you<00:03:27.820> can<00:03:27.970> do<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.209> same<00:03:28.390> sort<00:03:28.450> of
