00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
talking about its characteristics what

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.480 
talking about its characteristics what
champions<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:22.529> good<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:22.890> how<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.250> affects

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
champions it's good on how it affects

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.220 
champions it's good on how it affects
the<00:00:23.609> game<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.000> stuff<00:00:24.210> like<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.720> where

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
the game and stuff like that and where

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.540 
the game and stuff like that and where
appropriate<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.680> will<00:00:25.769> also<00:00:25.859> be<00:00:26.039> comparing<00:00:26.460> it

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
appropriate I will also be comparing it

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.099 
appropriate I will also be comparing it
to<00:00:26.580> spirit<00:00:27.090> stone<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.449> reason<00:00:27.660> for<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:27.869> is

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
to spirit stone the reason for this is

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.200 
to spirit stone the reason for this is
because<00:00:28.140> spirit<00:00:28.769> stone<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> familiar<00:00:29.670> item

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
because spirit stone is a familiar item

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.640 
because spirit stone is a familiar item
which<00:00:30.660> means<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:30.960> when<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.109> compare<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.500> to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
which means that when I compare it to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.110 
which means that when I compare it to
that<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:32.219> guys<00:00:32.369> should<00:00:32.550> know<00:00:32.640> I'm<00:00:32.790> talking

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
that you guys should know I'm talking

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.150 
that you guys should know I'm talking
about<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.480> secondly<00:00:34.230> both<00:00:34.500> those<00:00:34.680> items<00:00:34.890> are

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
about and secondly both those items are

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.040 
about and secondly both those items are
kind<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.460> similar<00:00:35.640> they<00:00:35.940> feel<00:00:36.149> similar<00:00:36.719> needs

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
kind of similar they feel similar needs

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.229 
kind of similar they feel similar needs
so<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.890> makes<00:00:38.040> sense<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.460> draw<00:00:38.760> parallels

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
so it makes sense to draw parallels

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.700 
so it makes sense to draw parallels
between<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.600> two<00:00:39.840> however<00:00:40.440> just<00:00:40.469> because

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
between the two however just because

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.290 
between the two however just because
they<00:00:41.070> are<00:00:41.160> similar<00:00:41.489> items<00:00:41.820> does<00:00:42.000> not<00:00:42.120> mean

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
they are similar items does not mean

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.180 
they are similar items does not mean
that<00:00:42.329> they<00:00:42.570> are<00:00:42.629> necessarily<00:00:43.200> competitors

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
that they are necessarily competitors

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.040 
that they are necessarily competitors
which<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.700> two<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.030> buy<00:00:45.300> will<00:00:45.570> always

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
which of the two you buy will always

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.410 
which of the two you buy will always
depend<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.739> which<00:00:47.160> jungle<00:00:47.640> item<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.180> want<00:00:48.360> to

what<00:03:12.450> I've<00:03:12.540> done<00:03:12.660> here<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.960> a<00:03:13.080> demonstration

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
what I've done here is a demonstration

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.490 
what I've done here is a demonstration
of<00:03:14.160> two<00:03:14.700> clears<00:03:15.060> one<00:03:15.690> with<00:03:15.870> quill<00:03:16.080> quote<00:03:16.320> and

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
of two clears one with quill quote and

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.350 
of two clears one with quill quote and
one<00:03:17.010> with<00:03:17.190> spirit<00:03:17.489> stone<00:03:17.670> both<00:03:17.880> these<00:03:18.060> clears

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
one with spirit stone both these clears

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.880 
one with spirit stone both these clears
are<00:03:18.510> very<00:03:18.630> identical<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.380> I've<00:03:19.440> tried<00:03:19.650> to

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
are very identical and I've tried to

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.740 
are very identical and I've tried to
replicate<00:03:20.190> what<00:03:20.640> they<00:03:20.760> would<00:03:20.880> most<00:03:21.120> likely<00:03:21.360> be

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
replicate what they would most likely be

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.560 
replicate what they would most likely be
like<00:03:21.959> in<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.560> real<00:03:22.800> game<00:03:23.070> IE<00:03:23.400> you're<00:03:23.940> at<00:03:24.030> level<00:03:24.300> 4

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
like in a real game IE you're at level 4

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.000 
like in a real game IE you're at level 4
which<00:03:24.989> is<00:03:25.110> around<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.440> time<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.830> would<00:03:25.920> be

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
which is around the time you would be

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.070 
which is around the time you would be
picking<00:03:26.340> up<00:03:26.459> those<00:03:26.670> items<00:03:26.970> using<00:03:27.660> malc<00:03:27.930> light

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
picking up those items using malc light

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.990 
picking up those items using malc light
as<00:03:28.230> an<00:03:28.350> example<00:03:28.709> from<00:03:28.860> these<00:03:29.130> runs<00:03:29.400> we<00:03:29.610> can<00:03:29.760> see

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
as an example from these runs we can see

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.340 
as an example from these runs we can see
that's<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.420> jungle<00:03:30.780> difference<00:03:31.110> between

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
that's the jungle difference between

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.130 
that's the jungle difference between
these<00:03:31.470> two<00:03:31.530> items<00:03:31.800> is<00:03:32.280> very<00:03:32.610> minor<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.900> regen

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
these two items is very minor the regen

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.050 
these two items is very minor the regen
bonus<00:03:34.440> from<00:03:34.530> cuoco<00:03:34.770> is<00:03:35.100> comparable<00:03:35.520> to<00:03:35.610> spirit

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
bonus from cuoco is comparable to spirit

thorns<00:03:38.430> passive<00:03:38.730> is<00:03:38.880> decent<00:03:39.270> too<00:03:39.360> however

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
thorns passive is decent too however

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.540 
thorns passive is decent too however
because<00:03:40.560> champions<00:03:40.830> like<00:03:40.920> Malachi<00:03:41.310> would

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
because champions like Malachi would

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.310 
because champions like Malachi would
usually<00:03:41.790> struggle<00:03:42.269> with<00:03:42.540> single<00:03:42.900> target

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
usually struggle with single target

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.320 
usually struggle with single target
clearing<00:03:43.709> cuoco<00:03:44.100> actually<00:03:44.489> compensates<00:03:45.000> very

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
clearing cuoco actually compensates very

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330 
clearing cuoco actually compensates very
nicely<00:03:45.630> for<00:03:45.989> this<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.680> percentage<00:03:46.920> health

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
nicely for this the percentage health

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.890 
nicely for this the percentage health
damage<00:03:47.550> is<00:03:47.850> quite<00:03:48.030> powerful<00:03:48.360> against

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
damage is quite powerful against

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.600 
damage is quite powerful against
monsters<00:03:49.230> with<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.500> lot<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.800> health<00:03:50.010> are<00:03:50.459> you

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
monsters with a lot of health are you

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.190 
monsters with a lot of health are you
those<00:03:50.760> big<00:03:51.000> monsters<00:03:51.300> in<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.510> camp<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:51.959> the

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
those big monsters in the camp and the

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.140 
those big monsters in the camp and the
buffs<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.190> really<00:03:53.430> helps<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.760> take<00:03:54.000> them

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
buffs so it really helps to take them

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.880 
buffs so it really helps to take them
down<00:03:54.230> spirit<00:03:55.230> stone<00:03:55.410> would<00:03:55.500> increase<00:03:55.769> your

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
down spirit stone would increase your

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.680 
down spirit stone would increase your
damage<00:03:56.040> by<00:03:56.340> percentage<00:03:56.940> which<00:03:57.150> like<00:03:57.360> I<00:03:57.450> say

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
damage by percentage which like I say

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.540 
damage by percentage which like I say
isn't<00:03:58.080> that<00:03:58.140> useful<00:03:58.350> when<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:58.830> don't<00:03:59.070> deal<00:03:59.519> a

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
isn't that useful when you don't deal a

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.640 
isn't that useful when you don't deal a
lot<00:03:59.910> of<00:04:00.060> damage<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.390> an<00:04:00.690> individual<00:04:01.200> target

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
lot of damage to an individual target

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.620 
lot of damage to an individual target
now<00:04:02.310> with<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.550> fact<00:04:02.730> that<00:04:02.820> these<00:04:02.970> two<00:04:03.269> clears

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
now with the fact that these two clears

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.570 
now with the fact that these two clears
are<00:04:03.840> comparable<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:05.010> fact<00:04:05.220> that<00:04:05.310> cruel

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
are comparable and the fact that cruel

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.000 
are comparable and the fact that cruel
crow<00:04:05.760> also<00:04:06.120> gives<00:04:06.360> you<00:04:06.480> combat<00:04:07.080> stats<00:04:07.470> as<00:04:07.709> well

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
crow also gives you combat stats as well

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.800 
crow also gives you combat stats as well
surely<00:04:08.790> this<00:04:08.880> means<00:04:09.120> that<00:04:09.209> cruel<00:04:09.480> chrome<00:04:09.660> is

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
surely this means that cruel chrome is

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.199 
surely this means that cruel chrome is
so<00:04:10.110> much<00:04:10.350> better<00:04:10.590> than<00:04:10.769> spirits<00:04:11.370> done<00:04:11.550> well

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
so much better than spirits done well

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.390 
so much better than spirits done well
for<00:04:12.480> Malachi<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.290> answers<00:04:13.590> yet<00:04:13.860> that's<00:04:14.100> true

for Malachi the answers yet that's true

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
but for other champions it's not quite

the<00:04:16.350> case<00:04:16.500> for<00:04:17.400> those<00:04:17.489> champions<00:04:17.910> you<00:04:18.000> have

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
the case for those champions you have

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.390 
the case for those champions you have
more<00:04:18.510> damage<00:04:18.989> in<00:04:19.200> their<00:04:19.380> arsenal<00:04:19.590> that<00:04:20.310> will

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
more damage in their arsenal that will

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.979 
more damage in their arsenal that will
be<00:04:20.489> getting<00:04:20.790> more<00:04:21.030> benefit<00:04:21.479> from<00:04:21.600> spirit

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
be getting more benefit from spirit

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.300 
be getting more benefit from spirit
stones<00:04:22.260> so<00:04:22.470> there<00:04:22.650> clears<00:04:22.979> would<00:04:23.160> look

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
stones so there clears would look

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.500 
stones so there clears would look

slightly different from the one that

you're seeing now with Mal KY plus is

these ten junglers will struggle ever so

these ten junglers will struggle ever so
slightly<00:04:48.900> just<00:04:49.230> because<00:04:49.650> they<00:04:49.770> still<00:04:50.070> fall

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
slightly just because they still fall

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.310 
slightly just because they still fall

jungles that don't quite match up just
yet<00:04:54.389> however<00:04:54.990> it's<00:04:55.169> definitely<00:04:55.650> a<00:04:55.680> step<00:04:55.889> in

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950

the<00:04:56.100> right<00:04:56.310> direction<00:04:56.370> and<00:04:56.910> if<00:04:57.060> these

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
the right direction and if these

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.000 
the right direction and if these
