00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
because like I said before the Phantom's

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.770 
because like I said before the Phantom's
can<00:01:32.280> take<00:01:32.490> away<00:01:32.729> your<00:01:32.909> last<00:01:33.119> perk<00:01:33.450> whenever

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
can take away your last perk whenever

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.870 
can take away your last perk whenever
they<00:01:33.900> teleport<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.470> what<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.490> want<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.759> do

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
then is I hacked PhD to get rid of it

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.530 
then is I hacked PhD to get rid of it
and<00:01:38.369> then<00:01:38.520> I'm<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:38.640> going<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.970> buy<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.210> back

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
and then I'm just going to buy it back

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.140 
and then I'm just going to buy it back
and<00:01:39.840> have<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.259> put<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.890> fourth<00:01:41.189> slot<00:01:41.520> so

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
and have it be put in the fourth slot so

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.569 
and have it be put in the fourth slot so
that<00:01:42.329> way<00:01:42.570> if<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.200> get<00:01:43.409> taken<00:01:43.770> by<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.950> by<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
Phantom's they'll take away PhD flopper

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.889 
Phantom's they'll take away PhD flopper
and<00:01:46.950> not<00:01:47.490> any<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.970> other<00:01:48.119> important<00:01:48.720> ones

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
4000 points that way I you know I only

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.819 
4000 points that way I you know I only
have<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.610> buy<00:01:56.759> back<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.270> cheap<00:01:57.509> one<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.020> check

have to buy back the cheap one and check
it<00:01:58.979> out<00:01:59.070> finally<00:01:59.759> finally<00:02:00.540> after<00:02:01.170> playing

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
it out finally finally after playing

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.859

since<00:02:02.040> Tuesday<00:02:02.579> morning<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.630> finally

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
since Tuesday morning I have finally

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.499 
since Tuesday morning I have finally
gotten<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.320> wave<00:02:04.560> gun<00:02:04.829> as<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.579> friday<00:02:06.060> morning

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
gotten the wave gun as a friday morning

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.419 
gotten the wave gun as a friday morning
so<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.719> took<00:02:06.810> me<00:02:06.960> almost<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.320> week<00:02:07.500> right<00:02:07.770> I

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
so it took me almost a week right I

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.100 
so it took me almost a week right I
guess<00:02:09.060> that's<00:02:09.270> not<00:02:09.360> really<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.720> week<00:02:09.929> but

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
guess that's not really a week but

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.199 
guess that's not really a week but
anyway<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:11.280> actually<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> really<00:02:11.849> really<00:02:12.090> fun

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209

then when you press the left button on

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.070 
then when you press the left button on
the<00:02:18.770> d-pad<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.610> turns<00:02:19.910> into<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.390> wave<00:02:20.570> gun<00:02:20.840> by

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
the d-pad it turns into the wave gun by

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.200 
the d-pad it turns into the wave gun by
putting<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.500> two<00:02:21.650> pieces<00:02:21.860> together<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.610> it's

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
putting the two pieces together and it's

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.060 
putting the two pieces together and it's
pretty<00:02:23.330> neat<00:02:23.540> it's<00:02:23.990> you<00:02:24.380> know<00:02:24.500> you've<00:02:24.830> heard

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
said and actually too when you shoot

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.050 
said and actually too when you shoot
them<00:02:44.690> with<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:45.080> wave<00:02:45.260> gun<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.830> they<00:02:46.460> puff<00:02:46.880> up

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
them with the wave gun and they puff up

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.060 
them with the wave gun and they puff up
and<00:02:47.210> then<00:02:47.360> explode<00:02:47.750> you'll<00:02:47.930> hear<00:02:48.080> a<00:02:48.110> ding<00:02:48.560> kind

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
and then explode you'll hear a ding kind

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.710 
and then explode you'll hear a ding kind
of<00:02:49.220> like<00:02:49.340> when<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.700> microwave<00:02:50.210> is<00:02:50.390> finished

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
of like when the microwave is finished

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.720 
of like when the microwave is finished
cooking<00:02:50.900> your<00:02:51.200> food<00:02:51.410> so<00:02:51.980> obviously<00:02:52.370> there<00:02:52.610> is

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
cooking your food so obviously there is

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.830 
cooking your food so obviously there is
definitely<00:02:53.060> a<00:02:53.120> correlation<00:02:53.390> between

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
definitely a correlation between

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.520 
definitely a correlation between
microwaves<00:02:54.740> and<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.340> wave<00:02:55.490> gun<00:02:56.080> but<00:02:57.080> yeah<00:02:57.230> I

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
microwaves and the wave gun but yeah I

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.590 
microwaves and the wave gun but yeah I
gotta<00:02:57.920> say<00:02:58.130> it's<00:02:58.250> not<00:02:58.400> my<00:02:58.550> favorite<00:02:58.850> Wonder

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
things a lot more complicated um but

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.570
