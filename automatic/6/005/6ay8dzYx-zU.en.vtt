00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
 hello everyone i hope you 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.520
 well come to me today I you 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.679
 will find my video which will be how will 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.630
 would put so without glue so m 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:18.390
 so either you have more like me 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:21.060
 either be safe did not want to use it 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.150
 is that you know when you have 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.580
 do times and bread they get 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.140
 they have 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.410
 they are already stuck when you 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.360
 put this is a direct buddy clip so 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.489
 this is it after you have no 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.320
 so sticks instead of buying 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.390
 finally you buy it without you 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.620
 do what I'm going to show you so 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:46.220
 for that you will need a top coat 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.750
 of a varnish of your oven and therefore 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.260
 vaud do so I chose already but 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.570
 must fall 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.580
 after if you have polish on them 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.100
 varnish on the fingers how I was going 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.920
 quickly but here it is not serious 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.589
 do not care 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:12.640
 it's not bad why there so I'm going 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:17.180
 install it so I start with fram 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:22.790
 first and then ag then take the 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:26.060
 last I chose the way there and 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.010
 so after waiting I opened up so here 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.440
 not ready I start to take him there 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.320
 never on a double game but just a 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.440
 layer and I do not care if a 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.510
 perfect departure we follow with him alone 1 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.490
 cases when we touch a lot and then 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:47.780
 after I'm going to come and ask my fake 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:49.570
 nails and I'm going to press for 20 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.680
 seconds 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:57.050
 ok so here after that we take the rates of 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.720
 side by side 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.050
 so me it's one of gino de gino 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.640
 short support blah blah and after ben I 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.110
 just come to master over world so that 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.789
 not at all give a shiny side 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.290
 away from them because it's 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:20.930
 plastic and that's it just so that 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:23.659
 my fingernail do not leave in bulk i 'm going 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.069
 say because I'm not going to say what 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.959
 I was going to say and we made passes and 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.970
 a little bit in the skin so call 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.709
 for daddy to everywhere not spoil your 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.709
 skin but m 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:42.000
 Well, here we go and suddenly we leave 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:46.630
 to dry and then we continue after 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.250
 gold did the same on all the others 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.510
 Lots 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.670
 so here I have made one against this 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.960
 I like said sorry there is noise 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.600
 so what I like has actually clarified 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.940
 is that when we are the nail polish 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.770
 but that on the edge of langlois go 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.320
 not do the discipline in the 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:10.540
 fish down to the corner Oulle 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.410
 while a nail module 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.980
 one puts a timber in fact as the 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:23.560
 this is i 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:26.710
 we are not there high is not good 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.030
 sign so in fact I said that we do not 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:34.020
 is not there but we're upwards 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:39.580
 and suddenly after that would be better for 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:45.070
 for m nail believe that in fact the 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:48.580
 varnish it will exceed the low one feels 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:52.870
 did that so I finished all the 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.330
 nails then here 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.650
 and on the rack and montblanc done I 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.700
 added a little so I did not do 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:04.600
 especially clothes 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:09.060
 so I added payet tea for 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.060
 give a little brighter side 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:18.920
 so wait 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:22.340
 or so that's so it's over 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:26.360
 tutorial nail finally here and it flies 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.730
 sticks really well as if it's like 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.750
 if it was at the normal school at the hold at 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.850
 background so that's it finished I'm you 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.810
 see you soon for a next video 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.810
 ciao
