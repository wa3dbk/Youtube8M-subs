into<00:01:40.079> hardline<00:01:40.650> pretty<00:01:40.920> much<00:01:41.100> straight<00:01:41.460> away

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
into hardline pretty much straight away

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.240 
into hardline pretty much straight away
so<00:01:41.850> not<00:01:42.780> only<00:01:42.899> has<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.320> beta<00:01:43.590> helped<00:01:44.009> improve

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
so not only has this beta helped improve

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.249 
so not only has this beta helped improve
the<00:01:44.490> final<00:01:44.850> game<00:01:45.030> as<00:01:45.240> best<00:01:45.479> as<00:01:45.630> possible<00:01:45.689> but

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the final game as best as possible but

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.039 
the final game as best as possible but
also<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.799> CTE<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:47.640> Battlefield<00:01:48.090> 4<00:01:48.420> now<00:01:48.840> so

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
also the CTE for Battlefield 4 now so

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.929 
also the CTE for Battlefield 4 now so
far<00:01:49.290> during<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.710> beta<00:01:49.890> we<00:01:50.189> do<00:01:50.399> still<00:01:50.670> only

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
far during the beta we do still only

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.030 
far during the beta we do still only
have<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.299> two<00:01:51.329> game<00:01:51.750> modes<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.619> single

have the two game modes and the single

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.280 
have the two game modes and the single
map<00:01:53.310> now<00:01:53.490> as<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.820> make<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.119> video<00:01:54.329> today<00:01:54.689> we

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
map now as I make this video today we

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.109 
map now as I make this video today we
are<00:01:55.470> going<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.710> be<00:01:55.799> getting<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.070> patch<00:01:56.310> later<00:01:56.790> on

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
are going to be getting a patch later on

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.690 
are going to be getting a patch later on
now<00:01:57.299> hopefully<00:01:57.899> we<00:01:58.350> may<00:01:58.530> see<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.829> second<00:01:59.549> map

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
now hopefully we may see a second map

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.670 
now hopefully we may see a second map
brought<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.600> pretty<00:02:00.869> big<00:02:01.140> patch<00:02:01.409> it

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.590 
brought in in this pretty big patch it
is<00:02:01.770> something<00:02:02.040> we've<00:02:02.250> seen<00:02:02.280> before<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:03.060> course

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
is something we've seen before of course

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.749 
is something we've seen before of course
in<00:02:03.719> battlefield<00:02:04.200> 4<00:02:04.259> unfortunately<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.549> did

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
in battlefield 4 unfortunately we did

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.609 
in battlefield 4 unfortunately we did
only<00:02:06.000> get<00:02:06.299> siege<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.540> Shanghai<00:02:07.079> but<00:02:07.590> a

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
only get siege of Shanghai but a

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.770 
only get siege of Shanghai but a
battlefield<00:02:07.950> 3<00:02:08.340> we<00:02:08.520> saw<00:02:08.670> operation<00:02:09.270> metro<00:02:09.599> and

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
battlefield 3 we saw operation metro and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.740 
battlefield 3 we saw operation metro and
eventually<00:02:10.229> on<00:02:10.410> PC<00:02:10.890> also<00:02:11.670> caspian<00:02:12.180> border<00:02:12.209> so

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
eventually on PC also caspian border so

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.430 
eventually on PC also caspian border so
the<00:02:13.140> mom

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
the mom

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.570 
the mom
out<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.710> get<00:02:13.800> chance<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.100> play<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.550> be

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
out so you get chance to play and be

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.850 
out so you get chance to play and be
exposed<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.420> more<00:02:15.810> glitches<00:02:16.050> errors<00:02:16.680> and

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
exposed to the more glitches errors and

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.710 
exposed to the more glitches errors and
sometimes<00:02:17.220> balance<00:02:17.610> issues<00:02:17.910> we<00:02:18.120> can<00:02:18.300> test<00:02:18.510> out

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
sometimes balance issues we can test out

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.600 
sometimes balance issues we can test out
and<00:02:18.960> hopefully<00:02:19.320> fix<00:02:19.800> before<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.220> game<00:02:20.430> is

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
and hopefully fix before the game is

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.090 
and hopefully fix before the game is
released<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.240> that's<00:02:21.660> my<00:02:21.840> excuse<00:02:22.170> anyway<00:02:22.590> for

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
released so that's my excuse anyway for

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.680 
released so that's my excuse anyway for
the<00:02:23.130> developers<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.760> give<00:02:23.880> us<00:02:24.000> more<00:02:24.210> maps<00:02:24.510> to

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
the developers to give us more maps to

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.300 
the developers to give us more maps to
play<00:02:24.900> on<00:02:25.080> when<00:02:25.410> we<00:02:25.500> flew<00:02:25.680> across<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.160> San

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
play on when we flew across to San

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.160 
play on when we flew across to San
Francisco<00:02:26.580> we<00:02:27.090> got<00:02:27.300> chance<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.720> play<00:02:27.930> maybe

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
Francisco we got chance to play maybe

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.320 
Francisco we got chance to play maybe
four<00:02:28.590> or<00:02:28.620> five<00:02:29.100> different<00:02:29.340> maps<00:02:29.790> including

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
four or five different maps including

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.910 
four or five different maps including
high<00:02:30.480> tension<00:02:30.930> but<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.410> course<00:02:31.590> because<00:02:31.890> of

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
high tension but of course because of

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.100 
high tension but of course because of

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.440 
NDA I can't give you any details about
those<00:02:34.410> maps<00:02:34.680> what<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.280> can<00:02:35.550> tell<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:36.030> there

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
those maps what I can tell you is there

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.210 
those maps what I can tell you is there
are<00:02:36.600> some<00:02:36.810> definite<00:02:37.230> cool<00:02:37.470> maps<00:02:37.710> on<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.100> way

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
are some definite cool maps on the way

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.980 
are some definite cool maps on the way
some<00:02:38.490> of<00:02:38.580> which<00:02:38.760> as<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.150> said<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.450> would<00:02:39.750> love<00:02:39.930> to

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
some of which as I said I would love to

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.380 
some of which as I said I would love to
see<00:02:40.320> incorporated<00:02:41.040> into<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.400> beta<00:02:41.580> now<00:02:42.270> as

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
see incorporated into the beta now as

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.090 
see incorporated into the beta now as
you<00:02:42.480> can<00:02:42.600> see<00:02:42.660> at<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.170> moment<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.560> am<00:02:43.770> playing

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
you can see at the moment I am playing

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.220 
you can see at the moment I am playing
the<00:02:44.220> game<00:02:44.400> mode<00:02:44.610> heist<00:02:44.940> now<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.720> two<00:02:45.990> game

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
the game mode heist now the two game

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.990 
the game mode heist now the two game
modes<00:02:46.260> available<00:02:46.560> in<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.070> beta<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.610> definitely

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
modes available in the beta I definitely

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.430 
modes available in the beta I definitely
think<00:02:48.270> blood<00:02:48.510> money<00:02:48.750> works<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.290> lot<00:02:49.380> better

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
think blood money works a lot better

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.100 
think blood money works a lot better
especially<00:02:50.120> for<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:51.240> map<00:02:51.600> now<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:51.960> isn't

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
especially for this map now that isn't

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.410 
especially for this map now that isn't
to<00:02:52.260> say<00:02:52.290> i<00:02:52.650> don't<00:02:52.830> enjoy<00:02:53.310> heist<00:02:53.760> i<00:02:54.030> have<00:02:54.240> her

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
to say i don't enjoy heist i have her

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.450 
to say i don't enjoy heist i have her
chance<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.810> point<00:02:55.080> on<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.200> different<00:02:55.710> map<00:02:55.860> i<00:02:56.070> do

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
chance to point on a different map i do

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.580 
chance to point on a different map i do
think<00:02:56.820> it<00:02:57.030> works<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:57.390> lot<00:02:57.510> better<00:02:57.570> that<00:02:57.960> map<00:02:58.200> the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
think it works a lot better that map the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.560 
think it works a lot better that map the
one<00:02:58.770> you<00:02:58.920> have<00:02:59.130> seen<00:02:59.430> from<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.940> leaked<00:03:00.150> reveal

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
one you have seen from the leaked reveal

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.720 
one you have seen from the leaked reveal
trailer<00:03:01.020> inside<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.010> bank<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.520> means

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
trailer inside the bank and that means

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.130 
trailer inside the bank and that means
the<00:03:02.880> criminal<00:03:03.300> who<00:03:03.480> are<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.720> attacking<00:03:03.990> team

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
the criminal who are the attacking team

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.230 
the criminal who are the attacking team
but<00:03:04.530> kind<00:03:05.070> of<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.190> defending<00:03:05.670> team<00:03:05.850> in<00:03:06.090> this

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
but kind of the defending team in this

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.940 
but kind of the defending team in this
case<00:03:06.450> because<00:03:06.660> they<00:03:06.900> start<00:03:07.200> inside<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.800> bank

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
case because they start inside the bank

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.710 
case because they start inside the bank
and<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.580> police<00:03:08.820> come<00:03:09.060> from<00:03:09.210> the<00:03:09.300> outside

they can lock down the bank try and

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.600 
they can lock down the bank try and

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
vaults and as you can see it normally

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.479 
vaults and as you can see it normally
just<00:03:24.780> turns<00:03:25.050> into<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.290> bloodbath<00:03:25.560> taking<00:03:26.220> place

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
just turns into a bloodbath taking place

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.130 
just turns into a bloodbath taking place
inside<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.940> work<00:03:27.239> site<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:27.810> seems<00:03:28.020> to

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
inside the work site and this seems to

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.440 
inside the work site and this seems to
happen<00:03:28.170> in<00:03:28.530> practically<00:03:29.280> every<00:03:29.459> heist<00:03:29.940> game<00:03:30.270> I

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
happen in practically every heist game I

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.840 
happen in practically every heist game I
join<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.290> police<00:03:31.440> team<00:03:31.770> rushed<00:03:32.100> down<00:03:32.310> pushed

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
join the police team rushed down pushed

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.190 
join the police team rushed down pushed
the<00:03:32.940> criminals<00:03:33.330> off<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.690> bridge<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.050> they

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
the criminals off the bridge and they

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.540 
the criminals off the bridge and they
just<00:03:34.350> turns<00:03:34.590> into<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.830> big<00:03:35.040> game<00:03:35.220> of<00:03:35.370> team

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
just turns into a big game of team

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.490 
just turns into a big game of team
deathmatch<00:03:35.970> taking<00:03:36.690> place<00:03:36.959> inside<00:03:37.230> the

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
deathmatch taking place inside the

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.680 
deathmatch taking place inside the
worksite<00:03:38.100> so<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.370> either<00:03:38.580> think<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.270> criminals

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
worksite so I either think the criminals

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.120 
worksite so I either think the criminals
need<00:03:39.840> more<00:03:40.080> time<00:03:40.320> to<00:03:40.530> get<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.860> vault

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
need more time to get to the vault

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.710 
need more time to get to the vault
before<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.459> police<00:03:41.640> arrive<00:03:42.030> or<00:03:42.330> they<00:03:42.690> just

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
before the police arrive or they just

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.930 
before the police arrive or they just
need<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.140> wider<00:03:43.500> spawn<00:03:43.950> point<00:03:44.250> allowing<00:03:44.820> them

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
need a wider spawn point allowing them

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.640 
need a wider spawn point allowing them
to<00:03:45.030> outflank<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.720> police<00:03:45.989> and<00:03:46.170> get<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.620> the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
to outflank the police and get to the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.500 
to outflank the police and get to the
vaults<00:03:46.980> in<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.130> different<00:03:47.459> direction<00:03:47.580> so<00:03:48.390> there

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
vaults in a different direction so there

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.390 
vaults in a different direction so there
definitely<00:03:48.600> are<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.989> few<00:03:49.410> things<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.890> would<00:03:50.190> like

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
definitely are a few things I would like

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.280 
definitely are a few things I would like
to<00:03:50.430> see<00:03:50.700> improved<00:03:50.880> for<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.600> heist<00:03:51.780> game<00:03:52.080> mode

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
to see improved for the heist game mode

haven't seen since battlefield 3 it was
very<00:04:05.880> sought<00:04:06.360> after<00:04:06.480> in<00:04:06.810> battlefield<00:04:07.230> 4<00:04:07.350> but

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
very sought after in battlefield 4 but

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.470 
very sought after in battlefield 4 but
of<00:04:07.739> course<00:04:07.980> we<00:04:08.340> have<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.519> modern<00:04:08.940> predecessor

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
of course we have the modern predecessor

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.050 
of course we have the modern predecessor
the<00:04:09.720> ak-12<00:04:10.170> still<00:04:10.739> a<00:04:10.769> very<00:04:11.160> popular<00:04:11.820> and<00:04:11.970> very

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
the ak-12 still a very popular and very

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.630 
the ak-12 still a very popular and very
useful<00:04:12.780> weapon<00:04:12.959> but<00:04:13.830> of<00:04:13.920> course<00:04:14.130> in<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.430> game

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
useful weapon but of course in a game

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.789 
useful weapon but of course in a game
with<00:04:14.970> criminals<00:04:15.480> or<00:04:15.690> terrorists<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.410> couldn't

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
with criminals or terrorists I couldn't

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.920 
with criminals or terrorists I couldn't
think<00:04:16.950> of<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.190> more<00:04:17.220> iconic<00:04:17.549> or<00:04:18.120> classic<00:04:18.570> weapon

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
think of a more iconic or classic weapon

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.229 
think of a more iconic or classic weapon
than<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.530> Kalashnikov<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.430> be<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.850> criminals

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
than the Kalashnikov to be the criminals

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.090 
than the Kalashnikov to be the criminals
main<00:04:21.539> tool<00:04:21.870> so<00:04:22.080> of<00:04:22.169> course<00:04:22.380> having<00:04:22.919> this

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
main tool so of course having this

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.890 
main tool so of course having this
weapon<00:04:23.460> back<00:04:23.700> in<00:04:23.940> battlefield<00:04:24.479> in<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.690> criminal

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
weapon back in battlefield in a criminal

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.060 
weapon back in battlefield in a criminal
based<00:04:25.289> game<00:04:25.560> definitely<00:04:26.310> does<00:04:26.490> make<00:04:26.700> a<00:04:26.729> lot

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
based game definitely does make a lot

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.130 
based game definitely does make a lot
sense<00:04:27.340> but<00:04:27.970> there<00:04:28.120> are<00:04:28.240> some<00:04:28.420> new<00:04:28.600> features<00:04:28.870> to

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
sense but there are some new features to

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.930 
sense but there are some new features to
this<00:04:29.410> weapon<00:04:29.830> of<00:04:29.950> course<00:04:30.190> in<00:04:30.370> battlefield<00:04:30.850> 4

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
this weapon of course in battlefield 4

really do recommend using this weapon
it's<00:05:14.770> nothing<00:05:15.160> like<00:05:15.280> you've<00:05:15.310> seen<00:05:15.730> in

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
it's nothing like you've seen in

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.910 
it's nothing like you've seen in
battlefield<00:05:16.480> previously<00:05:17.050> now<00:05:17.200> if<00:05:17.500> you<00:05:17.800> are

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
battlefield previously now if you are

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.230 
battlefield previously now if you are
going<00:05:18.100> to<00:05:18.160> use<00:05:18.220> it<00:05:18.430> I<00:05:18.580> highly<00:05:19.120> recommend

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
going to use it I highly recommend

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.240 
going to use it I highly recommend
taking<00:05:19.780> the<00:05:20.080> extended<00:05:20.530> magazine<00:05:20.950> because

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
taking the extended magazine because

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.980 
taking the extended magazine because
those<00:05:21.610> extra<00:05:21.940> rounds<00:05:22.270> do<00:05:22.390> make<00:05:22.570> a<00:05:22.600> massive

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
those extra rounds do make a massive

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.570 
those extra rounds do make a massive
difference<00:05:23.170> but<00:05:24.010> if<00:05:24.100> you<00:05:24.160> are<00:05:24.280> going<00:05:24.430> to<00:05:24.520> be

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
difference but if you are going to be

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.400 
difference but if you are going to be
very<00:05:24.850> aggressive<00:05:25.210> get<00:05:25.600> very<00:05:25.840> close<00:05:26.080> to<00:05:26.320> the

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
very aggressive get very close to the

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.830 
very aggressive get very close to the
enemies<00:05:26.740> this<00:05:27.160> thing<00:05:27.430> packs<00:05:27.820> a<00:05:28.030> massive<00:05:28.510> punch

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
enemies this thing packs a massive punch

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.750 
enemies this thing packs a massive punch
now<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:29.290> isn't<00:05:29.590> the<00:05:29.740> most<00:05:29.860> effective<00:05:30.520> weapon

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
now it isn't the most effective weapon

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.700 
now it isn't the most effective weapon
at<00:05:31.030> range<00:05:31.270> because<00:05:31.690> of<00:05:31.810> those<00:05:31.900> extra<00:05:32.230> rounds

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
at range because of those extra rounds

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.230 
at range because of those extra rounds
you<00:05:32.890> can<00:05:32.920> afford<00:05:33.400> to<00:05:33.460> actually<00:05:33.820> just<00:05:33.970> burn

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
you can afford to actually just burn

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.420 
you can afford to actually just burn
some<00:05:34.510> ammo<00:05:34.690> towards<00:05:35.230> the<00:05:35.320> enemy<00:05:35.620> maybe<00:05:36.160> miss

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
some ammo towards the enemy maybe miss

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.130 
some ammo towards the enemy maybe miss
two<00:05:36.640> or<00:05:36.670> three<00:05:36.940> of<00:05:37.030> those<00:05:37.090> shots<00:05:37.390> but<00:05:37.870> because

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
two or three of those shots but because

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.780 
two or three of those shots but because
of<00:05:38.170> that<00:05:38.290> extended<00:05:38.740> magazine<00:05:39.130> you<00:05:39.460> can<00:05:39.640> beat

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
of that extended magazine you can beat

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.210 
of that extended magazine you can beat
the<00:05:39.940> enemy<00:05:40.030> by<00:05:40.420> just<00:05:40.750> sheer<00:05:41.170> firepower<00:05:41.530> alone

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
the enemy by just sheer firepower alone

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.160 
the enemy by just sheer firepower alone
now<00:05:42.850> on<00:05:43.000> top<00:05:43.120> of<00:05:43.180> that<00:05:43.360> at<00:05:43.510> very<00:05:43.540> close<00:05:44.050> range

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
now on top of that at very close range

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.200 
now on top of that at very close range
the<00:05:44.560> high<00:05:44.740> rate<00:05:44.980> of<00:05:45.010> fire<00:05:45.160> and<00:05:45.640> very<00:05:45.970> high

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
the high rate of fire and very high

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.420 
the high rate of fire and very high
damage<00:05:46.510> makes<00:05:47.140> this<00:05:47.260> think<00:05:47.500> pack<00:05:47.740> a<00:05:47.950> serious

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
damage makes this think pack a serious

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.520 
damage makes this think pack a serious
punch<00:05:48.670> as<00:05:49.000> you<00:05:49.390> saw<00:05:49.600> previously<00:05:49.930> in<00:05:50.260> the<00:05:50.320> video

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
punch as you saw previously in the video

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.710 
punch as you saw previously in the video
I<00:05:50.740> actually<00:05:50.890> took<00:05:51.220> out<00:05:51.400> six<00:05:51.700> guys<00:05:51.880> in<00:05:51.940> one<00:05:52.480> go

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
I actually took out six guys in one go

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.660 
I actually took out six guys in one go
just<00:05:53.260> because<00:05:53.560> of<00:05:53.740> the<00:05:53.770> extended<00:05:54.160> magazine

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
just because of the extended magazine

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.580 
just because of the extended magazine
and<00:05:54.850> the<00:05:55.180> high<00:05:55.360> rate<00:05:55.780> of<00:05:55.810> damage<00:05:56.260> and<00:05:56.380> high

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
and the high rate of damage and high

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.680 
and the high rate of damage and high
rate<00:05:56.800> of<00:05:56.830> fire<00:05:56.980> so<00:05:57.520> this<00:05:57.700> weapon<00:05:58.090> for<00:05:58.270> me<00:05:58.450> if

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
rate of fire so this weapon for me if

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.390 
rate of fire so this weapon for me if
you<00:05:59.020> are<00:05:59.170> very<00:05:59.440> aggressive<00:05:59.680> you<00:06:00.010> like<00:06:00.160> getting

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
you are very aggressive you like getting

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.060 
you are very aggressive you like getting
very<00:06:00.640> close<00:06:00.820> range<00:06:01.210> is<00:06:01.480> very<00:06:01.750> very<00:06:02.380> effective

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
very close range is very very effective

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.040 
very close range is very very effective
so<00:06:03.280> I<00:06:03.310> do<00:06:03.430> highly<00:06:03.820> recommend<00:06:04.000> checking<00:06:04.480> it<00:06:04.900> out

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
so I do highly recommend checking it out

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.780 
so I do highly recommend checking it out
