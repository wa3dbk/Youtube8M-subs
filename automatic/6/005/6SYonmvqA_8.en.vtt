00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 since the first of may, there are in germany 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.470
 a new scoring system and that's one 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.590
 a bit shortened that means 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.300
 So phone on the tax id but that will 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.049
 now really expensive and also with points 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.509
 punished 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.609
 I offer you a universal one now 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.109
 bluetooth headset on with bluetooth 3.0 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.520
 that means there already 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.289
 voice control with it 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.300
 and with this bluetooth tiny 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.500
 call with your mobile phone or 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.349
 of course with a smartphone 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.630
 now quite comfortable and without disturbing 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.430
 cable so what when driving the know 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.960
 she herself is not the mobile phone on the ear 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.880
 only disturb but also extreme 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.630
 dangerous because of the reaction times 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.239
 are getting longer and longer 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.640
 let hands on the tax and lead 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.930
 Please your phone calls as well 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.789
 relaxed and safe here 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.500
 but also with many others 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.210
 opportunities , they would be great 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.020
 practical free do not speak anymore 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.059
 want to miss 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.739
 They always have their hands free when they are 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.870
 for example, in business 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.850
 phone calls to work on your notebook 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.100
 files through his or just notes 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.050
 want to do and thanks simple one 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.370
 touch operation and that's the giant 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.470
 advantage of this device over the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.060
 multifunction buttons control yours 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.820
 conversation just very easy per 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.799
 keypress conversations accept or 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.119
 reject brands for example too 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.820

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.530

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.470

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.880
 comfort her time possible even spoke 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.920
 I was already saying that 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.229
 masters this tiny little one 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.540
 Communication talent is also the variable 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.700
 ergonomic straps and I think so 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.250
 very pleasant to wear while long 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.740
 doing so for a long time painless 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.180
 use no matter on the left or on the right 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.640
 ear because you can use this little iron 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.590
 just take a snap and thanks to the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.170
 transparent highly flexible plastic 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.360
 note of the river at all and nothing 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.670

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.350

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.460
 we also deliver them further 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.049
 namely the same with and 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.729
 of course, currently works 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.430
 with practically all but really 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.320
 Virtually all bluetooth enabled 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.280
 smartphones phones our touch to 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.119
 example with which one also calls 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.210

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.950
 pcs or pda s so if it is from now 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.340
 sure to be at the wheel was a 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.250
 great gift for novice drivers 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.780
 and search 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.880
 then that is certainly a great 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.470
 thing because then you can safely in the 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.940
 road traffic and not otherwise 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.830
 be on the road and where I also like 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.390
 I have such a headset in my ear 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.250
 When shopping then they have the whole 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.530
 bags full then the phone rings and 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.060
 normally then turn off like that 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.500
 forget everything you order 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.660
