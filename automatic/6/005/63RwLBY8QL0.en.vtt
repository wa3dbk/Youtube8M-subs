00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.590
 hi to all from giuseppe boy 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:16.560
 we are here with a product that matches 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.300
 as easily visible even from the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.950
 mark on the side 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.539
 we have a fujitsu celsius also at 920 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.200
 we have a workstation in the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.570
 family of the fujitsu brand the caen 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.600
 Symptoms in question is a kind of 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.290
 remote control equipped with a comfortable box for 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.860
 transport 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.059
 as you can see the final part opens a 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.950
 this point we cannot proceed 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.680
 to the extraction of our pen 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.000
 however, as you can see in size 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.730
 compact 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.329
 the whole can be recharged for 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.220
 example via usb micro usb 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.040
 naturally a connection 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.020
 widely spread and use the 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.750
 account to recharge the devices 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.729
 the particularity of this solution a 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.670
 obviously the fact of being able to 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.000
 then work as a laser device 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.649
 usable for example presentations 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.649
 as you can see I have a luminous dot 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.880
 let's imagine using a darkness 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.840
 complete see as the luminous dot 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.799
 it becomes better visible in this 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.079
 so then we can go to use 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.719
 the system inside for example of 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.359
 a multimedia presentation we can 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.490
 go then to use it all with 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:48.330
 decided to comfort at the time for 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.470
 example let's go for a presentation 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.860
 shareholders ahead of the cable that 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.140
 wants the quarterly report used 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.240
 then the scenario you prefer 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.400
 however in short this is the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.110
 main intended use in 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.330
 then when you manage four 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.790
 buttons you have the top button that 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.010
 allows you to use pulsating laser 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.430
 lower that allows you to bring to 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.480
 black screen then with the button 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.640
 lower substance turn off 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.500
 temporarily the right screen 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.750
 left for that page 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.470
 pages at the time though 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.630
 obviously go and use this 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.820
 remote control that works via bluetooth 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.680
 therefore also in this case compatible 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.200
 with a very large slice of squares of 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.030
 you go to use it 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.650
 in multi-media mode and at two 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.930
 essentially mode of operation 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.720
 the presentation mode the mode 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.310
 multi media in multi medial mode 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.650
 you can go and play 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.510
 pause garrison a song a movie 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.790
 so you use it like a 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.800
 remote control neither more nor less and it is 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.570
 genius from this point of view has 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.180
 indeed with the button up you can 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.510
 manage the play pause button on vi 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.330
 I remember that it is precisely the upper one 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.310
 falls in love with making you a morning zoom like this 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.750
 maybe we can understand each other even better 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.480
 as you can see we have four buttons 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.100
 button on a right button left 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.590
 day in this way then with the 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.780
 geometric button in this topic 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.489
 stop your reproduction with the 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.370
 button just pause play 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.720
 so it is also quite intuitive from 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.489
 this point of view is with the button 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.470
 right touches clear against ours 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.930
 arms when obviously 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.850
 applies to the arms or otherwise applies to 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.250
 the movie then 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.700
 where you have a media clip 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.040
 I have an mp3 maybe you're listening to 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.750
 similar behavior 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.780
 having said that there is not much else to do 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.100
 add on this product on this 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.200
 present this bluetooth remote control of 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:58.620
 kensigton because in practice and brilliant 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:03.970
 and compact and equipped with its convenience 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:08.230
 transport system as you see indeed 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.510
 at the end we have a strict method 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.060
 of protection for example in the moment in 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.610
 which we are going to insert this present 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.190
 inside a bag during a 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.900
 then travel is also protected and 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.220
 personally the fact of being able to do it 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.660
 precisely tv use both as for the command 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.370
 during presentations how 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.200
 multimedia remote control 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.210
 I find it brilliant you have to be 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.100
 sincere said this I don't think 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.060
 frankly there is more to evidence from 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.430
 it works 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.680
 there are no particular defects and obvious 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.630
 that being based on the bluetooth la 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.700
 scope is roughly that of the product 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.310
 and therefore you have about ten meters 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.200
 of maneuvering space 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.000
 being that it generally comes 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.340
 used precisely for presentations 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.550
 or to drive the tracks while 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.890
 do a little party in the 37 magnificences 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.900
 on the bed on the sofa in the armchair e 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.660
 just listen to the music track 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.750
 or you look at the musical chitina or the 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.610
 Holiday rental is supposed to be 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.640
 your position and the position of the 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.290
 remote control than the laptop either 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.880
 however in the range of that ten 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.390
 famous of m said this i believe is everything 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.120
 works well 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.920
 there are no particular smudges in the 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.910
 working with so much of 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.740
 hat 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.990
 having said this then to those looking for a del 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.060
 compact and universally operated 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.070
 compatible as it lives 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.140
 through bluetooth advice 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.850
 absolutely this kenton does well 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.250
 his work without any particular defects 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.020
 having said that so it's all thank you 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.910
 attention also compliments 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.130
 this other product 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.800
 really interesting now so that's it 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.960
