00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 When speed is slow, use FULLFOOT. 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.720
 When it gets faster, I use bounds. 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.080
 It is movement like kicking the ground. 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:34.100
 When you get faster, you step on with your toes. 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.500
 full foot 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.900
 Fast succession moves the ankle. 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.480
 When slowly playing, the knees will move. When playing fast, the knee does not move. 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.400
 Let's be able to play smoothly at all speeds. 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.240
 Let's practice switching speed. 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:22.360
 With both feet.
