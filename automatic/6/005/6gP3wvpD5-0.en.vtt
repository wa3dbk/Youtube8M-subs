when you first get it because hey it's

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.620 
when you first get it because hey it's
built<00:03:49.099> in<00:03:49.310> but<00:03:50.030> it's<00:03:50.150> not<00:03:50.209> something<00:03:50.540> that's

got a lot of long-term scope and that

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.789 
got a lot of long-term scope and that
difference<00:03:53.569> between<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.959> quality<00:03:54.200> of<00:03:54.590> the

difference between the quality of the
lenses<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.549> ability<00:03:56.209> even<00:03:56.630> to<00:03:57.049> modify

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
lenses and the ability even to modify

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
focus on lenses

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.900 
focus on lenses
