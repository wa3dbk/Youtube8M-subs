00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.050
 I put it here for you will not know 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.440

 how our goal is improvements is 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.000
 Updates are there, blah 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.289
 so I brought this toy today 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.390
 Do not drop the doll here. 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.550
 The guys are the next I came here to 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.230
 talk a little bit about yourself 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.059
 good on your playstation 3 controller 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.160
 If someone asks I do not have 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.070
 playstation 3 if someone asks already 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.140
 psn account I do not have 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.310
 I only use the computer and android phone 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:16.130
 to play just what happens 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:20.909
 I had seen many many forums 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.439
 talking to connecting a ps3 controller on the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.280
 cell phone 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.549
 the original crap control no 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:38.670
 op is the cutest law lets you see if 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:40.560
 I can show you, I'm good, I came back. 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.350
 here the grass is not much 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.930
 Difficult but I know I'll show it to you. 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:53.820
 you talk a little about the cover and 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:58.049
 look that this detail this relief more 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:02.250
 easy to catch sliding control 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.439
 as usual it is very well and is pretty cool 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.320
 comfortable on hand with this capital 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:11.840
 so that 's the way I'm going to say a little bit of 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.840
 control and then also the flight 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.060
 camera then I will not be able to make a 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.670
 tutorial on how to configure it for 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.940
 to use on android but next coming 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:29.319
 a lot of good things out there, I 'm going to leave 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.900
 for you some tips on the channel there 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.299
 have a lot of news mainly that 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.310
 I already configured this one from here. 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.069
 we succeeded in setting up this 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:44.830
 control in later I even thought of 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:47.530
 sell is ipea since 90 17 worked 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.970
 very well in some games like that in 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.590
 games I could set up 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.360
 worked perfectly 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.160
 ball show mainly works on 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.950
 average finder as we already talked about but this 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.720
 There is nothing to be left out. 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.239
 and if you can see that some things 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:10.030
 when the control is not original 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:12.790
 here do not see how ps and even ones that come 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:22.209
 like the ps that may be fake here 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:24.819
 Back to tell you both here for what? 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.400
 I know in the original it has a sensor 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:43.169
 movements, it was kind of like the 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:46.169
 reset us it is not it does not work 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.169
 like this 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:17.349
 I played a little on ps3 but I can talk 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:19.510
 that down here the triggers my serve 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.769
 was the one that I found the most incarnate 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.790
 to play 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:27.600
 I already tested the 193 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:32.240
 We switched on and it worked and I use it. 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:36.870
 of these triggers here sensational 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.390
 much more time here on the fair camera 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.030
 collaborates for anyone who wants to know how to use 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:45.380
 motorola razr camera than the camera that 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:49.620
 I was left 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.810
 assemble the team in the loader 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.830
 you can load with the path of the 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.840
 democracy 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.680
 the coaxial cable to study here usb and this 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.530
 tip 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.460
 if you have a playstation 3 beauty no 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.560
 have this problem 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:12.230
 so the control is very functional 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.230
 anticipating you will basically use the 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.710
 first set the control and entered 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.180
 in the game and set me up quietly 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.350
 I'll see if I can get a camera in this 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.120
 weekend to do some 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.600
 tutorials is for you to explain how 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.540
 configure each of them to configure 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.900
 every game won gives some more tips there 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:39.060
 I wanted to advance this that for those who have 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.240
 I do not know if it will work with everyone there. 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.410
 original right who have seen what works 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.860
 perfectly 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:51.480
 I did not have problems, I was very happy. 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:54.000
 when I discovered discovering giving and what 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:06:01.500
 able to give a good result with 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:08.790
 this control that is not original for 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:13.070
 collaborate in control 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:17.160
 I already brought this one a few days from now. 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:21.540
 week worked very well and very light 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.880
 in compensation this control here than 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.890
 is a little heavier but has a 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.620
 perfect fit in the hand 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.900
 if you play very well with him 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.450
 so I have no problem playing 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.520
 with him it 's very good and so I 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.889
 I got the camera, I'll bring it. I'll be there. 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.819
