00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
as high as you want it now I know you

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.929 
as high as you want it now I know you
guys<00:02:03.570> can't<00:02:03.840> see<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.229> let<00:02:04.590> me<00:02:04.710> just<00:02:05.189> spam<00:02:05.759> out

guys can't see so let me just spam out

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.710 
guys can't see so let me just spam out
some<00:02:06.149> torches<00:02:06.509> here<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.500> as<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:09.000> can<00:02:09.270> see<00:02:09.509> we

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
some torches here so as you can see we

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.670 
some torches here so as you can see we
have<00:02:09.750> one<00:02:10.140> level<00:02:10.500> down<00:02:10.649> there<00:02:10.890> 1<00:02:11.520> 2<00:02:11.970> 3<00:02:12.239> 4<00:02:12.569> up

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
have one level down there 1 2 3 4 up

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.949 
have one level down there 1 2 3 4 up
now<00:02:13.799> moms<00:02:14.069> need<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:15.000> spawn<00:02:15.329> but<00:02:15.599> I<00:02:15.659> thought

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
now moms need to to spawn but I thought

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.259 
now moms need to to spawn but I thought
it's<00:02:16.409> better<00:02:16.680> if<00:02:16.920> they<00:02:17.099> have<00:02:17.189> three<00:02:17.430> because

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
it's better if they have three because

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.880 
it's better if they have three because
that<00:02:18.420> doesn't<00:02:18.629> like<00:02:18.900> mess<00:02:19.469> with<00:02:19.650> anything

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
that doesn't like mess with anything

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.890 
that doesn't like mess with anything
else<00:02:20.189> and<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.670> makes<00:02:20.909> it<00:02:21.060> like<00:02:21.180> easier<00:02:21.629> to<00:02:21.780> move

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
else and it makes it like easier to move

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.640 
else and it makes it like easier to move
around<00:02:22.019> while<00:02:22.379> building<00:02:23.480> but<00:02:24.480> um<00:02:24.659> you<00:02:25.439> want<00:02:25.590> to

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
around while building but um you want to

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.360 
around while building but um you want to
have<00:02:25.859> these<00:02:26.189> ducts<00:02:26.609> on<00:02:26.909> the<00:02:27.090> sides<00:02:28.129> one<00:02:29.129> lower

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
have these ducts on the sides one lower

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.569 
have these ducts on the sides one lower
and<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.870> count<00:02:31.079> eight<00:02:31.349> from<00:02:31.889> the<00:02:32.099> side<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.519> you

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
and you count eight from the side so you

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.640 
and you count eight from the side so you
can<00:02:32.670> one<00:02:33.060> two<00:02:33.269> three<00:02:33.599> four<00:02:33.900> five<00:02:34.170> six<00:02:34.230> seven

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
can one two three four five six seven

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.770 
can one two three four five six seven
eight<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.219> as<00:02:35.969> you<00:02:36.180> can<00:02:36.299> see<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:36.599> water

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
eight and as you can see the water

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.649 
eight and as you can see the water
diverges<00:02:37.590> here<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.189> goes<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:39.000> way<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.359> that

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
diverges here and goes that way and that

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.140 
diverges here and goes that way and that
way<00:02:39.689> so<00:02:40.349> no<00:02:40.469> matter<00:02:40.620> where<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:40.950> fall<00:02:41.310> in<00:02:41.489> I'm

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
way so no matter where I fall in I'm

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.640 
way so no matter where I fall in I'm
actually<00:02:42.329> going<00:02:42.569> to<00:02:42.659> go<00:02:42.689> to<00:02:42.840> one<00:02:43.170> side<00:02:43.469> or<00:02:43.500> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
actually going to go to one side or the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.429 
actually going to go to one side or the
other<00:02:43.849> eventually<00:02:44.849> I<00:02:45.030> mean<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.689> course<00:02:46.049> mobs

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
other eventually I mean of course mobs

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.039 
other eventually I mean of course mobs
will<00:02:46.799> move<00:02:47.040> by<00:02:47.189> themselves<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.909> I'm<00:02:48.419> standing

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
will move by themselves and I'm standing

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.409 
will move by themselves and I'm standing
here<00:02:49.109> alone<00:02:49.319> and<00:02:49.530> nothing's<00:02:50.189> moving<00:02:50.430> me<00:02:50.669> but

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:51.419 
here alone and nothing's moving me but

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:52.610 
here alone and nothing's moving me but
eventually<00:02:51.780> they'll<00:02:52.139> move<00:02:52.319> out<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.590> way

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
eventually they'll move out of the way

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.890 
eventually they'll move out of the way
and<00:02:52.889> they'll<00:02:53.579> go<00:02:53.609> down<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.209> this<00:02:54.329> drop<00:02:54.659> right

and they'll go down to this drop right

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.849 
and they'll go down to this drop right
over<00:02:55.109> here<00:02:55.319> now<00:02:56.220> this<00:02:56.340> drop<00:02:56.700> takes<00:02:57.689> us<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:58.169> have

most of them all anyways I mean

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.830 
most of them all anyways I mean
eventually<00:03:59.549> they'll<00:04:00.150> all<00:04:00.299> falling<00:04:00.689> and

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
eventually they'll all falling and

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.069 
eventually they'll all falling and
they'll<00:04:01.319> move<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.650> either<00:04:01.799> side<00:04:02.159> now<00:04:03.079> when

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
they'll move to either side now when

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.020 
they'll move to either side now when
they<00:04:04.199> do<00:04:04.259> they'll<00:04:05.159> get<00:04:05.310> killed<00:04:05.579> by<00:04:05.699> this<00:04:05.759> lava

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
they do they'll get killed by this lava

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.020 
they do they'll get killed by this lava
spiders<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:07.079> spiders<00:04:07.949> can't<00:04:08.280> go<00:04:08.430> behind<00:04:08.819> it

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
spiders to spiders can't go behind it

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.479 
spiders to spiders can't go behind it
because<00:04:09.299> of<00:04:09.599> that<00:04:09.750> if<00:04:10.500> they<00:04:10.680> couldn't<00:04:11.069> they

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
because of that if they couldn't they

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:17.289 
because of that if they couldn't they
die<00:04:13.189> so<00:04:14.189> let's<00:04:14.370> see<00:04:14.519> damn<00:04:14.729> it<00:04:14.879> come<00:04:15.209> on<00:04:15.889> come<00:04:16.889> on

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
die so let's see damn it come on come on

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.629 
die so let's see damn it come on come on
now<00:04:18.299> when<00:04:18.989> they<00:04:19.079> die<00:04:19.289> on<00:04:19.440> either<00:04:19.590> side<00:04:19.919> they

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
now when they die on either side they

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.180 
now when they die on either side they
die<00:04:20.849> and<00:04:21.299> their<00:04:21.570> loot<00:04:21.779> drops<00:04:22.079> down<00:04:22.260> here<00:04:22.320> now

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
die and their loot drops down here now

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.740 
die and their loot drops down here now
where<00:04:23.370> does<00:04:23.460> that<00:04:23.639> loot<00:04:23.789> go<00:04:23.969> justice

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
where does that loot go justice

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.740 
where does that loot go justice
identical<00:04:25.320> on<00:04:25.440> all<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.650> side<00:04:25.860> see

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
identical on all the side see

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.600 
identical on all the side see
from<00:04:26.840> right<00:04:27.020> there<00:04:27.200> that's<00:04:28.160> from<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.490> other

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
from right there that's from the other

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.700 
from right there that's from the other
side<00:04:28.820> of<00:04:28.880> that<00:04:29.120> now<00:04:29.840> why<00:04:30.020> do<00:04:30.080> I<00:04:30.200> have<00:04:30.350> this<00:04:30.470> year

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
side of that now why do I have this year

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.800 
side of that now why do I have this year
so<00:04:30.920> if<00:04:30.980> mom's<00:04:31.190> any<00:04:31.460> mobs<00:04:31.730> get<00:04:32.000> through<00:04:32.270> they

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
so if mom's any mobs get through they

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.860 
so if mom's any mobs get through they
can't<00:04:33.110> fall<00:04:33.440> down<00:04:33.470> and<00:04:33.920> then<00:04:34.130> they<00:04:34.250> drown<00:04:34.580> now

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
can't fall down and then they drown now

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.170 
can't fall down and then they drown now
again<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:36.440> system<00:04:37.100> diverges<00:04:37.610> here<00:04:37.820> so<00:04:38.030> let's

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
again the system diverges here so let's

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.270 
again the system diverges here so let's
go<00:04:38.330> down<00:04:38.510> just<00:04:38.690> one<00:04:38.900> of<00:04:39.020> these<00:04:39.140> pathways<00:04:39.380> and

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
go down just one of these pathways and

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.710 
go down just one of these pathways and
actually<00:04:40.610> this<00:04:40.670> was<00:04:40.850> really<00:04:41.060> hard<00:04:41.300> to<00:04:41.360> make<00:04:41.600> so

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
actually this was really hard to make so

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.020 
actually this was really hard to make so
that<00:04:41.780> it<00:04:41.960> actually<00:04:42.110> works<00:04:42.530> but<00:04:43.250> um<00:04:43.400> with<00:04:43.940> the

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
that it actually works but um with the

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.420 
that it actually works but um with the
water<00:04:44.270> physics<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:44.900> everything<00:04:45.230> but<00:04:45.470> I<00:04:45.740> look

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
water physics and everything but I look

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.010 
water physics and everything but I look
cool<00:04:46.730> you<00:04:47.120> didn't<00:04:47.330> mind<00:04:47.450> the<00:04:47.600> quote<00:04:47.780> okay

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
cool you didn't mind the quote okay

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.410 
cool you didn't mind the quote okay
whatever<00:04:48.260> um<00:04:48.640> so<00:04:49.640> you<00:04:49.730> just<00:04:49.850> want<00:04:50.030> to<00:04:50.090> have<00:04:50.300> the

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
whatever um so you just want to have the

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.330 
whatever um so you just want to have the
water<00:04:50.570> drop<00:04:51.020> because<00:04:51.260> water<00:04:51.560> goes<00:04:51.830> seven

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
water drop because water goes seven

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.670 
water drop because water goes seven
blocks<00:04:52.750> now<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.810> water<00:04:54.080> comes<00:04:54.320> through<00:04:54.410> this

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
blocks now the water comes through this

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.140 
blocks now the water comes through this
was<00:04:54.890> the<00:04:55.010> hardest<00:04:55.130> part<00:04:55.490> actually<00:04:55.700> because

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
was the hardest part actually because

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.450 
was the hardest part actually because
most<00:04:56.780> people<00:04:57.080> have<00:04:57.110> it<00:04:57.470> only<00:04:57.680> going<00:04:58.010> into<00:04:58.220> one

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
most people have it only going into one

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.730 
most people have it only going into one
spot<00:04:59.120> but<00:04:59.690> that<00:04:59.810> was<00:04:59.900> impossible<00:05:00.020> with<00:05:00.590> my

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
spot but that was impossible with my

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.210 
spot but that was impossible with my
design<00:05:01.570> so<00:05:02.570> what<00:05:02.690> I<00:05:02.720> did<00:05:02.810> was<00:05:03.200> I<00:05:03.830> had<00:05:03.919> a<00:05:03.980> bunch

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
design so what I did was I had a bunch

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.220 
design so what I did was I had a bunch
of<00:05:04.400> like<00:05:04.610> trouble<00:05:05.150> making<00:05:05.510> this<00:05:05.660> but

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
of like trouble making this but

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.340 
of like trouble making this but
basically<00:05:06.640> let's<00:05:07.640> see<00:05:07.880> writing<00:05:08.120> it<00:05:08.390> what<00:05:09.230> you

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
basically let's see writing it what you

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.420 
basically let's see writing it what you
want<00:05:09.530> to<00:05:09.590> do<00:05:09.710> is<00:05:09.800> you<00:05:09.830> want<00:05:09.919> to<00:05:10.100> have<00:05:10.190> ladders

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
want to do is you want to have ladders

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.610 
want to do is you want to have ladders
on<00:05:10.880> the<00:05:10.970> sides<00:05:11.210> so<00:05:11.600> when<00:05:11.750> it<00:05:11.870> falls<00:05:12.080> down<00:05:12.230> it

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
on the sides so when it falls down it

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.380 
on the sides so when it falls down it
goes<00:05:13.040> into<00:05:13.250> this<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:13.700> no<00:05:13.850> matter<00:05:14.000> where<00:05:14.270> you

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
goes into this and no matter where you

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.600 
goes into this and no matter where you
are<00:05:14.600> it'll<00:05:15.470> move<00:05:15.710> backwards<00:05:16.250> because

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
are it'll move backwards because

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.140 
are it'll move backwards because
underneath<00:05:16.850> here<00:05:17.919> there's<00:05:18.919> actually<00:05:19.310> a<00:05:19.340> space

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
underneath here there's actually a space

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.870 
underneath here there's actually a space
down<00:05:20.540> there<00:05:20.570> that<00:05:21.560> um<00:05:21.800> that<00:05:22.370> provides<00:05:22.700> the

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
down there that um that provides the

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.610 
down there that um that provides the
water<00:05:23.120> going<00:05:23.690> so<00:05:23.990> that's<00:05:24.169> where<00:05:24.350> the<00:05:24.440> source

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
water going so that's where the source

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.950 
water going so that's where the source
box<00:05:24.800> art<00:05:25.040> if<00:05:25.190> those<00:05:25.460> were<00:05:25.640> here<00:05:26.120> they<00:05:26.780> would

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
box art if those were here they would

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.810 
box art if those were here they would
actually<00:05:27.050> make<00:05:27.530> make<00:05:27.980> them<00:05:28.190> just<00:05:28.340> stop<00:05:28.610> and

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
actually make make them just stop and

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.130 
actually make make them just stop and
all<00:05:28.910> the<00:05:29.030> loot<00:05:29.180> that<00:05:29.360> felt<00:05:29.600> right<00:05:29.750> here<00:05:29.990> we'll

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
all the loot that felt right here we'll

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.010 
all the loot that felt right here we'll
just<00:05:30.350> stay<00:05:30.530> still<00:05:30.860> now<00:05:31.760> of<00:05:32.210> course<00:05:32.270> all<00:05:32.720> the

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
just stay still now of course all the

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.930 
just stay still now of course all the
sloop<00:05:33.229> comes<00:05:33.470> down<00:05:33.740> here<00:05:34.070> that's<00:05:34.490> my<00:05:34.640> actually

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
sloop comes down here that's my actually

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.630 
sloop comes down here that's my actually
my<00:05:35.060> maintenance<00:05:35.540> walkway<00:05:36.410> I<00:05:36.590> have<00:05:37.100> a<00:05:37.160> quick

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
my maintenance walkway I have a quick

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.430 
my maintenance walkway I have a quick
chef<00:05:37.910> just<00:05:38.300> to<00:05:38.419> check<00:05:38.630> whether<00:05:38.840> stuffs<00:05:39.200> coming

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
chef just to check whether stuffs coming

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.090 
chef just to check whether stuffs coming
and<00:05:39.970> it<00:05:40.970> all<00:05:41.090> comes<00:05:41.330> back<00:05:41.479> down<00:05:41.840> here<00:05:43.030> where<00:05:44.030> as

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
and it all comes back down here where as

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.560 
and it all comes back down here where as
