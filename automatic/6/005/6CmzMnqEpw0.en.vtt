00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
recording so perform the actions you

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:49.750 
recording so perform the actions you
want<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.609> record<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.150> hear<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.540> result

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.729 

so<00:02:50.450> there<00:02:50.659> are<00:02:50.690> three<00:02:51.019> things<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.319> can<00:02:51.530> change

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739

in<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.010> command<00:02:52.340> line<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.819> bid<00:02:53.360> rate<00:02:53.599> the

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
in the command line the bid rate the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.649 
in the command line the bid rate the
time<00:02:54.319> limit<00:02:54.709> and<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.250> file<00:02:55.459> name<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.450> bit

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
time limit and the file name the bit

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.119 
time limit and the file name the bit
rate<00:02:56.870> I'm<00:02:57.049> not<00:02:57.230> sure<00:02:57.409> what<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.680> limit<00:02:57.980> is<00:02:58.069> but

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
rate I'm not sure what the limit is but

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.089 
rate I'm not sure what the limit is but
higher<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:59.030> better<00:02:59.209> the<00:03:00.080> downside<00:03:00.560> obviously

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
higher the better the downside obviously

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.589 
higher the better the downside obviously
is<00:03:01.220> that<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.610> higher<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:02.060> bit<00:03:02.209> rate<00:03:02.420> the

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
is that the higher the bit rate the

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.380 
is that the higher the bit rate the
bigger<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.110> file<00:03:03.319> size<00:03:03.620> I've<00:03:04.489> tried<00:03:04.819> 24

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
bigger the file size I've tried 24

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.839 
bigger the file size I've tried 24
megabits<00:03:05.840> or<00:03:06.049> 24<00:03:06.799> million<00:03:07.099> and<00:03:07.489> it<00:03:07.670> looked

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
megabits or 24 million and it looked

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.420 
megabits or 24 million and it looked
beautiful<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:09.200> can't<00:03:09.500> probably<00:03:09.769> go<00:03:10.190> higher

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430
