00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:02.910
 on foot 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.910
 rub presenting 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.570

 Chkalov and station and this opens up new 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.140
 opportunities for games 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.550
 even such a genre as a platform in its own way 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.570
 evolve 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.700
 we don't just control ourselves when 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.050
 using no buttons we can 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.920
 truly communicate with this in between 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.920
 officials 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.150
 the game is like a layer of puff cake 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.850
 cream 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.070
 the first layer you touch 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.230
 items and opens a new 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.870
 puzzle and interact with 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.540
 the environment 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.490
 manipulating different things you 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.070
 help the hero move between 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.660
 platforms and it looks very 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.660
 naturally 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.280
 secondly the possibilities for 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.760
 create your own level imagine 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.300
 you are not just available full 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.720
 toolkit and publish you big 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.330
 console but it became even more convenient 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.350
 you can do everything yourself 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.020
 number of mini-games sharpened by 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.380

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.610
 so we are waiting for fans of mass 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.650
 new creations made specially 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.920
 for kids 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.960
 speaking of communication between the two platforms 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.390
 previously opened costumes and stickers 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.410
 big planet prayer for third search 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.050
 the grid can be transferred to 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.910
 portable version and vice versa 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.130

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.970

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.599
 because pocket versions look great 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.970
 even on the Chechen weaker platform 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.350

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.749
 touching the screen with your fingertips 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.459
