00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.290
 our story is made of dreams and 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.010
 challenges 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:15.610
 and that is precisely how we are 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.279
 fulfilling one more union and society 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.500
 that from this moment we will have 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.110
 with the extraordinary group of 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.190
 engineer carlos slim is reason for great 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.680
 emotion and a lot of commitment for us 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.960
 because it's about the equipment that without 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.800
 be together have shared the same 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.990
 philosophy of work passion and values 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.480
 that benefit and make our 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.360
 dear mexico 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.309
 but we must also clarify that with 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.220
 this alliance is not intended for any 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.550
 way to close the doors to anyone at 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.860
 otherwise the technological openness that 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.230
 opens now increases the platforms of 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.080
 dissemination and leave open all 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.860
 possible windows that wish to join 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.170
 this union 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.660
 today I inform you that we did 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.330
 I call it a strategic alliance with 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.070
 several media groups 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.500
 who will participate in the 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.410
 transmissions I inform you that for 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.570
 US rights will be the chain 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.850
 Telemundo informed them that for 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.130
 pay television or television 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.580
 restricted will be transmitting 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.550
 foxsports and that for internet will be 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:33.770
 transmitting mediotiempo.com 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:36.040
 certainly besides 1tb inside in 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.990
 Internet 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.160
 the channel that today is called vibe sports 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.740
 but we're going to change his name 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.080
 within esta also transmit 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.900
 matches then this opens a fan 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.640
 of possibilities for the hobby is like this 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.840
 as elías ayub explained the diversity 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.940
 that is allowed in terms of 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.410
 Mexican soccer broadcasts 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.180
 in this way jesús martínez explained 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.780
 how group negotiation was achieved 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.600
 so it really happened very fast 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.200
 the company negotiation was record 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.200
 Really 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.900
 since he did me favor and companion of 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.670
 make an appointment with the engineer with 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.840
 danny the first date and then we had 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.349
 the engineer arturo and danny 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.540
 and it really does not mean that you can 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.049
 word 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.329
 of word and we live number went from 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:28.569
 word and vision towards where we had 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:31.150
 what do we want for football 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.930
 for mexico believe in what it was like and 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.930
 we shook hands 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.340
 from the city of mexico to newspaper 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.340
