right there buddy gets disarmed with in

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.560 
right there buddy gets disarmed with in
like<00:01:03.079> one<00:01:03.289> second<00:01:05.350> switches<00:01:06.350> a<00:01:07.330> back<00:01:08.330> to<00:01:08.479> the

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
like one second switches a back to the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.940 
like one second switches a back to the
robot<00:01:08.750> yeah<00:01:09.200> right<00:01:09.380> after<00:01:09.440> their<00:01:09.800> he's

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
robot yeah right after their he's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.289 
robot yeah right after their he's
switching<00:01:10.130> back<00:01:10.370> the<00:01:10.460> rug<00:01:10.610> I<00:01:10.700> get<00:01:10.850> blinded

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
switching back the rug I get blinded

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.060 
switching back the rug I get blinded
there's<00:01:11.960> really<00:01:12.080> no<00:01:12.260> reason<00:01:12.409> for<00:01:12.740> me<00:01:12.770> to<00:01:12.830> drink

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
there's really no reason for me to drink

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.590 
there's really no reason for me to drink
it<00:01:13.280> because<00:01:13.430> Ray's<00:01:13.729> like<00:01:13.909> almost<00:01:14.120> full<00:01:14.390> health

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
it because Ray's like almost full health

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.940 
it because Ray's like almost full health
so<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:17.720> priest<00:01:17.840> even<00:01:18.110> cancels<00:01:18.470> his<00:01:18.530> mana<00:01:18.770> burn

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
so the priest even cancels his mana burn

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.530 
so the priest even cancels his mana burn
on<00:01:19.130> me<00:01:19.280> because<00:01:19.460> I'm<00:01:19.670> blinded<00:01:20.000> right<00:01:20.150> there<00:01:20.300> so

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
on me because I'm blinded right there so

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.320 
on me because I'm blinded right there so
not<00:01:21.170> really<00:01:21.320> any<00:01:21.920> reason<00:01:22.010> though<00:01:22.370> waste<00:01:23.120> a

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
not really any reason though waste a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.990 
not really any reason though waste a
trinket<00:01:23.930> I<00:01:24.340> pop<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.370> different<00:01:25.910> illumination

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
trinket I pop a different illumination

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.180 
trinket I pop a different illumination
which<00:01:26.420> cuts<00:01:26.630> my<00:01:26.810> healing<00:01:27.050> costs<00:01:27.800> in<00:01:28.040> half

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
which cuts my healing costs in half

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.620 
which cuts my healing costs in half
right<00:01:28.490> there<00:01:28.670> to<00:01:28.760> get<00:01:28.850> a<00:01:28.910> holy<00:01:29.090> light<00:01:29.300> I

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
right there to get a holy light I

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.510 
right there to get a holy light I
thought<00:01:30.620> it<00:01:30.770> already<00:01:30.890> would<00:01:31.100> be<00:01:31.190> taking<00:01:31.400> more

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
thought it already would be taking more

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.590 
thought it already would be taking more
damage<00:01:31.790> but<00:01:31.940> it<00:01:31.970> always<00:01:32.120> just<00:01:32.300> soon<00:01:32.450> they're

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
damage but it always just soon they're

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.750 
damage but it always just soon they're
trying<00:01:32.780> ready<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:32.990> restyle<00:01:33.290> and<00:01:33.670> believe<00:01:34.670> he

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
trying ready to restyle and believe he

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.890 
trying ready to restyle and believe he
is<00:01:34.910> going<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.150> get<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:35.390> even<00:01:35.660> though<00:01:35.810> it

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
is going to get it even though it

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.310 
is going to get it even though it
consecrated<00:01:37.720> nevermind<00:01:38.720> he<00:01:38.930> walked<00:01:39.110> in<00:01:39.260> the
