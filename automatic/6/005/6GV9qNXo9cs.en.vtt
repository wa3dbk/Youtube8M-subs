00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.270
 good afternoon with you photoshop and 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.210
 today we bring to your attention 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.890
 the legendary rogov iwata eclipse g6 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.810
 we tried several times to take a review 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.430
 This background cake is unfortunately so 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.279
 quickly make out what did not work 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.840
 finally got my hands this airbrush 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.009
 kurkovy type despite the fact that he 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.110
 look like a gun 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.559
 it 's still a kind of hybrid between 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.960
 a gun and an airbrush from his airbrush 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.450
 Perhaps different is what he has 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.090
 jet regulator accordingly you can 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.649
 set a round spot and can do 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.200
 oval spot as usual 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.449
 paint pistol his 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.920
 his turn is distinguished by the fact that he 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.690
 has a very low air flow 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.910
 draw your attention it will be connected 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.920
 compressor flow rate performance 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.140
 whom hardly barely reach 20 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.270
 liters per minute, respectively, all that 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.680
 start at 20 liters is most 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.880
 his hellish compressors may well 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.560
 pull up this type of machine 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.549
 this airbrush enters already drew 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.770
 attention plastic box 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:20.780
 two tanks of 100 milliliters of plastic 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.630
 and accordingly the airbrush itself 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.570
 on the airbrush head is installed protective 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.400
 cap because it is bright enough 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.380
 a needle sticks out of it and she 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.850
 afraid of mechanical damage you 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.250
 you can see it later 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.380
 show all this airbrush is equipped with three 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.970
 regulator and 1 regulator is the regulator 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.070
 pressure mounted on the handle like on 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.840
 conventional paint spray guns second 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.650
 the regulator is the regulator of the torch which 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.870
 lets you ask 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.000
 or respectively round jet shape 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.690
 or flat and directly ticket 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.300
 filing materials in the new version of this 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.790
 airbrush somewhat changed mount 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.380
 tank earlier barrels poked from below what was 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.190
 not quite comfortable and now accordingly 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.590
 convenient fastening threaded allows 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.750
 fix the tank in any plane 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.580
 to work on any surface 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.410
 either on flat or on horizontal in 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.890
 including even on a vertical 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.930
 here's the way if necessary also 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.920
 in addition to this, I may have Robert 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.959
 be purchased metal tank it 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.610
 it is advisable to purchase in that case 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.920
 if you plan on using an airbrush 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.600
 let's say for some varnished works 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.480
 for working with varnish and with some 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.370
 materials like candy which 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.530
 can somehow stain 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.380
 polyethylene of which is made ordinary 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.730
 the barrel is a metal tank with a lid 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.540
 the capacity was one hundred and thirty milliliters 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.540
 in the same way it fastens on 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.870
 item number in his pisi 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.120
 61 here in this way you get with 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.980
 using an inexpensive compressor and 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.540
 accordingly this sleeve and getting 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.980
 planted an instrument allowing you 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.780
 block some minor work 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.930
 Naturally the machine can not do this 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.459
 but a telephone or some small 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.350
 surface varnish enough 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.660
 quality may well also be new 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.950
 rubric is equipped with an adapter 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.989
 Comes complete before it was gone 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.660
 I had to buy separately now 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.070
 respectively on each airbrush in 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.989
 set in this box fit 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.300
 adapter on 1 8 which allows 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.980
 connect to the usual flank from your 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.380
 airbrush that you use more often you 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.510
 working with the usual hieroglyph and 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.160
 a compressor with a residence of more than 20 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.200
 liters per minute you may well just 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.270
 twist the connectors one by one of 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.880
 users 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.980
 also airbrush there are two from marriage this is g3 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.390
 and g5 regret now show within 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.240
 This review we can not say that we 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.310
 we will shoot separate reviews on them 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.930
 or just show you later 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.040
 these are younger brothers 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.260
 one of them g-300 has gateway 03 and 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.900
 respectively the upper tank mounting and 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.550
 gravity feed and g 5 just as well 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.380
 has a gravitational top tank 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.130
 feed and arc respectively 0 5 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.790
 millimeters we hooked up the airbrush 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.910
 Compressor let's see how this 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.910
 works 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.080
 one of the very big plus photographer 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.340
 is the fact that it is very simple 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.380
 made very well 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.570
 such details are very high quality 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.220
 all the grooves are made and because of this 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.240
 all adjustments can be made 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.240
 one finger on the look 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.270
 on a lot of equipment 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.470
 produced by China or some 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.419
 alternative korean manufacturers 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.130
 it is basically impossible because 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.380
 the fit of the parts is not very correct 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.150
 grooves are usually quite rough 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.800
 but his in this respect distinguished and 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.020
 did a very good very high quality 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.729
 typewriter if you work with some 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.800
 large-scale projects let's say with 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.570
 walls if you work with body art and 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.620
 with any jobs that are required 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.960
 some fills 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.300
 some big transitions are essentially 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.740
 affairs indispensable machine is one of 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.030
 best airbrush in which in this 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.280
 case you can buy yourself 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.229
 not only does he work with most 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.090
 compressors can sell to everything 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.139
 allows you a very large allows 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.360
 you do a lot of freedom 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.010
 action besides it can serve 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.180
 also good blocking 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.250
 it can replace equipment 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.050
 small paint managed if you 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.300
 something lacetti at home or let's say in 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.340
 the garage if you need to varnish some 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.229
 small detail or let's paint and 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.960
 uniform correctly candy or in 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:49.180
 some exclusive color probably 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.949
 worth adding what is this machine not 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.570
 cheap by today's standards but it is real 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:54.570
 its money is more than worth 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.240
 reply 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.930
 but
