00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.009
 yes again the way in mozart liked 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.750
 So I thought it was really nice I know 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.130
 yes even dancers dance with it and 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.530
 That's why we wanted to take a look 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.600
 and nice until now if you look at the 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.140
 second half that was so far 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.570
 most beautiful I drive the scenes on 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.040

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.130

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.049

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.150

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.760
 Feel good the foster mother 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.519
 after I know how the beginnings 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.660
 they started at tv jahn 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:11.200
 and there are, in part, many 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.220
 Show deposits from the ground or tons 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.690
 gymnastics out of the horse 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.690
 so excellent for me 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.460
 how did you like the breaking news 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.440

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.610
 performance an incredible mood 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.530
 the spread the guys 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.420
 until the last minute was the whole 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.730
 the audience has always been fascinated 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.320
 again clapped and the group are 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.880
 really really the embassy for 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.930
 Schweinfurt in Germany and 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.930
 hopefully far beyond 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:50.630
 Everything and you like best 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.630

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.080

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:46.090
 how was the imagination babies yes 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.780

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.910

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.200
 day where you get angry but I think 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.320
 the audience did not notice it 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.960
 and as I said better than expected and 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.200
 I'm looking forward to the next two 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.200
 days
