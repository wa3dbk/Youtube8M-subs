redesigned for the 2010 year it was the
GX<00:00:29.660> 470<00:00:30.440> which<00:00:30.920> means<00:00:31.250> it<00:00:31.400> was<00:00:31.520> a<00:00:31.550> 4.7<00:00:32.360> liter

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.160 
GX 470 which means it was a 4.7 liter
engine<00:00:33.050> but<00:00:33.739> for<00:00:34.219> the<00:00:34.309> 2010<00:00:34.940> it's<00:00:35.239> now<00:00:35.420> the<00:00:35.450> 460

which is a 4.6 liter engine even though

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.270 
which is a 4.6 liter engine even though
we<00:00:38.570> dropped<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:38.930> leader<00:00:39.110> size<00:00:39.380> we<00:00:39.950> actually

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
we dropped the leader size we actually

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.400 
we dropped the leader size we actually
increase<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:40.910> horsepower<00:00:41.090> so<00:00:41.840> it's<00:00:42.230> now<00:00:42.380> a

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
increase the horsepower so it's now a

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.810 
increase the horsepower so it's now a
301<00:00:43.070> horsepower<00:00:43.250> versus<00:00:43.880> the<00:00:44.060> the<00:00:44.680> 268<00:00:45.820> guys

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
didn't cut it down what we did is we

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.950 
didn't cut it down what we did is we
actually<00:01:00.500> give<00:01:00.800> it<00:01:00.950> two<00:01:01.070> more<00:01:01.370> for<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.329> 2010

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
actually give it two more for the 2010

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.389 
actually give it two more for the 2010
redesigned<00:01:03.530> we<00:01:03.860> gave<00:01:04.040> it<00:01:04.070> a<00:01:04.250> better

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
redesigned we gave it a better

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.730 
redesigned we gave it a better
suspension<00:01:04.790> more<00:01:05.329> horsepower<00:01:05.810> better<00:01:06.409> fuel

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
suspension more horsepower better fuel

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.520 
suspension more horsepower better fuel
economy<00:01:07.060> we<00:01:08.060> gave<00:01:08.240> it<00:01:08.270> us<00:01:08.450> another<00:01:08.930> extra<00:01:09.290> gear

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
economy we gave it us another extra gear

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.020 
economy we gave it us another extra gear
so<00:01:09.770> it's<00:01:09.890> now<00:01:10.010> a<00:01:10.040> six-speed<00:01:10.640> versus<00:01:11.000> a

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
so it's now a six-speed versus a

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.080 
so it's now a six-speed versus a
five-speed<00:01:11.630> so<00:01:12.260> we<00:01:12.409> did<00:01:12.650> a<00:01:12.680> lot<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.490> it<00:01:13.700> in

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
five-speed so we did a lot to it in

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.580 
five-speed so we did a lot to it in
order<00:01:14.299> to<00:01:14.510> make<00:01:14.659> it<00:01:14.780> much<00:01:14.960> more<00:01:15.229> accessible

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590

the<00:01:58.310> LFA<00:01:58.790> is<00:01:58.850> our<00:01:59.150> answer<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.570> getting<00:01:59.960> into

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
the LFA is our answer to getting into

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.560 
the LFA is our answer to getting into
that<00:02:00.350> market<00:02:00.619> that's<00:02:01.310> producing<00:02:01.700> 552

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
that market that's producing 552

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.679 
that market that's producing 552
horsepower<00:02:03.100> so<00:02:04.100> dis<00:02:04.400> dancer<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.210> like<00:02:05.420> calm

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
horsepower so dis dancer to like calm

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.740 
horsepower so dis dancer to like calm
and<00:02:06.049> so<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:06.770> dodge<00:02:07.070> had<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.369> viper<00:02:07.720> before<00:02:08.720> I

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
and so to the dodge had a viper before I

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.110 
and so to the dodge had a viper before I
had<00:02:08.959> a<00:02:08.989> Mustang<00:02:09.619> and

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
had a Mustang and

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.630 
had a Mustang and
touch<00:02:11.239> it<00:02:11.569> also<00:02:12.290> had<00:02:12.470> charge<00:02:12.980> included<00:02:13.489> so

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
touch it also had charge included so

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.280 
touch it also had charge included so
forth<00:02:13.879> so<00:02:14.000> this<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.239> like<00:02:14.420> even<00:02:15.019> though<00:02:15.080> it's<00:02:15.230> a

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
forth so this is like even though it's a

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.080 
forth so this is like even though it's a
sports<00:02:15.590> car<00:02:15.799> but<00:02:15.950> not<00:02:16.069> exactly<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.519> muscle<00:02:16.909> car

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
sports car but not exactly a muscle car

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.600 
sports car but not exactly a muscle car
so<00:02:17.629> how<00:02:17.780> fast<00:02:18.110> does<00:02:18.319> this<00:02:18.560> thing<00:02:18.620> go<00:02:18.830> probably

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
so how fast does this thing go probably

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.570 
so how fast does this thing go probably
like<00:02:19.760> zero<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.540> 60<00:02:20.959> 0<00:02:21.379> to<00:02:21.470> 60<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:21.920> does<00:02:22.129> it<00:02:22.340> in

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
like zero to 60 0 to 60 it does it in

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.830 
like zero to 60 0 to 60 it does it in
3.6<00:02:23.299> seconds<00:02:23.780> so<00:02:24.470> we're<00:02:24.799> actually<00:02:25.840> taking

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
3.6 seconds so we're actually taking

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.780 
3.6 seconds so we're actually taking
another<00:02:27.200> step<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:28.069> know<00:02:28.190> those<00:02:28.400> are<00:02:28.519> great

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
another step you know those are great

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.460 
another step you know those are great
manufacturers<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:29.629> mentioned<00:02:30.049> but<00:02:30.290> the

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
manufacturers that you mentioned but the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.460 
manufacturers that you mentioned but the
LFA<00:02:31.010> you're<00:02:31.489> talking<00:02:31.970> super<00:02:32.720> high-end<00:02:33.079> luxury

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
LFA you're talking super high-end luxury

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.289 
LFA you're talking super high-end luxury
super<00:02:33.799> high-end<00:02:34.159> performance<00:02:34.250> so<00:02:35.060> you're

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
super high-end performance so you're

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.660 
super high-end performance so you're
actually<00:02:35.450> in<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.870> market<00:02:36.260> with<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:37.010> Ferraris

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
actually in the market with the Ferraris

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.809 
actually in the market with the Ferraris
with<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.720> Lamborghinis<00:02:39.409> you<00:02:40.129> know<00:02:40.220> you<00:02:40.670> are

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
with the Lamborghinis you know you are

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.150 
with the Lamborghinis you know you are
very<00:02:40.849> high<00:02:41.569> in<00:02:41.810> as<00:02:42.170> far<00:02:42.680> as<00:02:42.739> for<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:42.950> super

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
very high in as far as for the super

very high in as far as for the super
sports<00:02:43.400> vehicles<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:43.879> again<00:02:44.180> this<00:02:44.299> is<00:02:44.450> what

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
sports vehicles and again this is what

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.770 
sports vehicles and again this is what
our<00:02:44.660> answer<00:02:45.079> is<00:02:45.170> with<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.410> LFA<00:02:45.829> so<00:02:46.549> the

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
our answer is with the LFA so the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.869 
our answer is with the LFA so the
vehicle<00:02:47.780> tops<00:02:47.959> out<00:02:48.109> at<00:02:48.140> 202<00:02:48.680> miles<00:02:48.859> an<00:02:49.040> hour<00:02:49.129> so

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
vehicle tops out at 202 miles an hour so

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.030 
vehicle tops out at 202 miles an hour so
you<00:02:49.910> say<00:02:50.239> this<00:02:50.269> will<00:02:50.599> be<00:02:50.750> production<00:02:51.739> at<00:02:51.920> the

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
you say this will be production at the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.890 
you say this will be production at the
end<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.310> this<00:02:52.489> year<00:02:52.760> correct<00:02:53.060> December<00:02:53.810> of
