00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.889 

just<00:00:04.670> do<00:00:04.790> some<00:00:04.970> three<00:00:05.180> step<00:00:05.390> drops<00:00:05.720> right

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:05.899 
just do some three step drops right

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:07.389 
just do some three step drops right
quick<00:00:06.109> so<00:00:06.290> we<00:00:06.410> can<00:00:06.439> kind<00:00:06.799> of<00:00:06.920> get<00:00:07.040> used<00:00:07.069> to

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:07.399 
quick so we can kind of get used to

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:10.600 
quick so we can kind of get used to
seeing<00:00:07.759> what<00:00:07.910> you<00:00:07.970> doing<00:00:09.160> okay<00:00:10.160> as<00:00:10.309> soon<00:00:10.490> as

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
seeing what you doing okay as soon as

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.580 
seeing what you doing okay as soon as
you<00:00:10.730> see<00:00:10.879> that<00:00:10.910> then<00:00:11.539> you<00:00:11.780> can<00:00:11.960> get<00:00:12.230> your<00:00:12.410> feet

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
you see that then you can get your feet

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.289 
you see that then you can get your feet
to<00:00:12.799> what<00:00:13.130> you're<00:00:13.250> getting<00:00:13.490> ready<00:00:13.639> to<00:00:13.759> break<00:00:13.969> if

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:14.299 
to what you're getting ready to break if

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.510 
to what you're getting ready to break if
it's<00:00:14.570> a<00:00:14.630> three<00:00:14.839> step<00:00:15.019> drop<00:00:15.080> he's<00:00:15.500> gonna<00:00:15.710> do<00:00:15.860> one

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
it's a three step drop he's gonna do one

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.710 
it's a three step drop he's gonna do one
or<00:00:16.640> two<00:00:16.669> things<00:00:16.759> slant<00:00:17.750> hitch<00:00:18.740> or<00:00:19.189> quick<00:00:19.490> out

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
or two things slant hitch or quick out

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.229 
or two things slant hitch or quick out
so<00:00:20.720> once<00:00:21.439> you<00:00:22.399> figure<00:00:22.730> out<00:00:22.759> the<00:00:22.880> quarterback

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:23.239 
so once you figure out the quarterback

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.089 
so once you figure out the quarterback
doing<00:00:23.450> a<00:00:23.480> three-step<00:00:23.869> bound<00:00:24.320> get<00:00:24.890> your<00:00:25.040> eyes

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
doing a three-step bound get your eyes

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.130 
doing a three-step bound get your eyes
back<00:00:25.130> then<00:00:26.000> you<00:00:26.090> can<00:00:26.239> break<00:00:26.419> either<00:00:26.599> way<00:00:26.809> from

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
back then you can break either way from

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.440 
back then you can break either way from
that<00:00:27.349> point<00:00:27.559> so<00:00:27.649> our<00:00:27.800> reaction<00:00:27.950> but<00:00:28.849> it's<00:00:29.270> just

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
that point so our reaction but it's just

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.580 
that point so our reaction but it's just
by<00:00:29.570> being<00:00:29.809> patient<00:00:30.320> and<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:31.689> star<00:00:32.689> on<00:00:33.079> the

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
by being patient and the star on the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.040 
by being patient and the star on the
three-step<00:00:33.980> drop<00:00:34.480> okay<00:00:35.480> will<00:00:35.839> demonstrate

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
three-step drop okay will demonstrate

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.139 
three-step drop okay will demonstrate
something<00:00:36.500> right<00:00:36.649> quick<00:00:39.670> so<00:00:40.670> you<00:00:40.730> just<00:00:40.820> you

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
something right quick so you just you

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.200 
something right quick so you just you
basically<00:00:41.449> just<00:00:41.570> sitting<00:00:42.079> until<00:00:42.789> he<00:00:43.789> set<00:00:44.059> up

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
basically just sitting until he set up

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:51.250 
basically just sitting until he set up
to<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.629> quarterback<00:00:44.899> set<00:00:45.199> up<00:00:49.809> why<00:00:50.809> me<00:00:51.019> you<00:00:51.050> are

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
to the quarterback set up why me you are

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.000 
to the quarterback set up why me you are
you<00:00:51.379> in<00:00:51.499> a<00:00:51.530> ready<00:00:51.980> position<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:52.820> for<00:00:53.600> me<00:00:54.010> it's

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
you in a ready position and for me it's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.529 
you in a ready position and for me it's
more<00:00:55.219> upright<00:00:55.489> because<00:00:57.429> I'm<00:00:58.429> just<00:00:58.730> my<00:00:59.210> legs<00:00:59.390> a

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
more upright because I'm just my legs a

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.059 
more upright because I'm just my legs a
little<00:00:59.659> shorter<00:01:00.079> so<00:01:00.199> I<00:01:00.230> can<00:01:00.649> move<00:01:00.800> without

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:01.069 
little shorter so I can move without

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:04.930 
little shorter so I can move without
getting<00:01:01.760> low<00:01:01.940> you<00:01:02.239> know<00:01:02.359> um<00:01:03.519> but<00:01:04.519> just<00:01:04.820> just

being<00:01:05.180> ready<00:01:05.479> to<00:01:05.630> go<00:01:05.780> positions<00:01:06.380> how<00:01:06.590> high

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
being ready to go positions how high

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.500 
being ready to go positions how high
would<00:01:06.979> that<00:01:07.310> feel<00:01:07.610> for<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:07.970> know<00:01:08.270> rather

out and we just get a receive you got to

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.870 
out and we just get a receive you got to
do<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.470> full<00:01:21.650> speed<00:01:21.740> but<00:01:21.980> just<00:01:22.190> you<00:01:22.760> know

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.460 
do it full speed but just you know
simulate<00:01:23.300> you<00:01:23.420> running<00:01:23.690> an<00:01:23.780> out<00:01:23.870> pattern<00:01:23.900> and

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
simulate you running an out pattern and

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.680 
simulate you running an out pattern and
I<00:01:25.010> kind<00:01:25.280> of<00:01:25.340> walk<00:01:25.490> through<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:25.910> for<00:01:26.150> us<00:01:26.300> the

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
I kind of walk through this for us the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.620 
I kind of walk through this for us the
three-step<00:01:27.140> drop<00:01:27.400> you<00:01:28.400> go<00:01:28.700> by<00:01:28.820> 10<00:01:29.060> yo<00:01:29.210> us<00:01:29.420> and

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
three-step drop you go by 10 yo us and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.450 
three-step drop you go by 10 yo us and
then

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
then

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:39.810 
then
so<00:01:32.610> DOMA

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.969 

we<00:01:39.940> never<00:01:40.390> crosses<00:01:40.900> over<00:01:41.050> though<00:01:41.290> even<00:01:41.860> when

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
we never crosses over though even when

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.980 
we never crosses over though even when
you<00:01:42.070> break<00:01:42.280> in<00:01:42.400> that<00:01:42.490> city<00:01:42.909> breaks<00:01:43.210> everything

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
you break in that city breaks everything

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.580 
you break in that city breaks everything

when you cross over y'all bow and I'm

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.480 
when you cross over y'all bow and I'm
saying<00:01:53.130> your<00:01:53.250> basket<00:01:53.790> gets<00:01:54.480> a<00:01:55.280> shrunken<00:01:56.280> in

keep you a strong base and not the

keep you a strong base and not the
crossover<00:02:04.530> that's<00:02:04.980> that's<00:02:05.190> basically<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
crossover that's that's basically the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.300 
crossover that's that's basically the
key<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.420> I'm<00:02:06.930> what's<00:02:07.620> the<00:02:07.710> proper<00:02:07.980> way<00:02:08.010> like

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
key and I'm what's the proper way like

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.219 
key and I'm what's the proper way like
breaking<00:02:08.790> don't<00:02:09.180> know<00:02:09.330> some<00:02:09.510> people<00:02:09.720> do<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> tea

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
breaking don't know some people do a tea
