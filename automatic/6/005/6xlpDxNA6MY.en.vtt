00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
isn't it exactly it's what we used to

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.400 
isn't it exactly it's what we used to
inject<00:01:54.880> back<00:01:55.090> in<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.300> 80s<00:01:55.570> and<00:01:55.630> early<00:01:55.690> 90s<00:01:55.840> so

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
inject back in the 80s and early 90s so

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.320 
inject back in the 80s and early 90s so
the<00:01:56.530> idea<00:01:56.800> behind<00:01:56.950> this<00:01:57.400> is<00:01:57.640> that<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:58.000> skin

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
the idea behind this is that the skin

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.180 
the idea behind this is that the skin
our<00:01:58.510> skin<00:01:58.540> is<00:01:58.960> composed<00:01:59.440> of<00:01:59.590> collagen<00:01:59.979> as<00:02:00.100> we

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
our skin is composed of collagen as we

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.609 
our skin is composed of collagen as we
get<00:02:00.340> older<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.700> collagen<00:02:01.090> degrades<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:02.290> gets

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
get older the collagen degrades it gets

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.460 
get older the collagen degrades it gets
softer<00:02:03.190> it<00:02:03.340> gets<00:02:03.369> looser<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:05.110> idea<00:02:05.320> behind

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
softer it gets looser the idea behind

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.740 
softer it gets looser the idea behind
this<00:02:05.770> is<00:02:05.830> infusing<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.790> skin<00:02:07.030> with<00:02:07.180> collagen

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
this is infusing the skin with collagen

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.650 
this is infusing the skin with collagen
to<00:02:08.259> see<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.470> tighter<00:02:08.890> result<00:02:09.340> loosen<00:02:09.970> loosen

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
to see a tighter result loosen loosen

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.180 
to see a tighter result loosen loosen
get<00:02:10.989> rid<00:02:11.110> of<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.260> wrinkles<00:02:11.620> get<00:02:11.950> rid<00:02:12.070> of<00:02:12.130> the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
get rid of the wrinkles get rid of the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.070 
get rid of the wrinkles get rid of the
loose<00:02:12.310> skin<00:02:12.489> tighten<00:02:13.390> everything<00:02:13.720> out<00:02:13.870> I

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
loose skin tighten everything out I

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.640 
loose skin tighten everything out I
think<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:15.790> product<00:02:16.090> like<00:02:16.390> this<00:02:16.420> possibly<00:02:17.380> if<00:02:17.500> it

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
think a product like this possibly if it

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.400 
think a product like this possibly if it
works<00:02:17.890> if<00:02:18.850> collagen<00:02:19.510> is<00:02:19.630> being<00:02:19.870> absorbed

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
works if collagen is being absorbed

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.460 
works if collagen is being absorbed
through<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.100> upper<00:02:21.430> layer<00:02:21.580> of<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.790> skin<00:02:22.470> how

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
through the upper layer of the skin how

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.020 
through the upper layer of the skin how
long<00:02:23.709> do<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.010> think<00:02:24.070> that<00:02:24.580> would<00:02:24.700> actually

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
long do you think that would actually

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.190 
long do you think that would actually
last<00:02:25.209> are<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.480> talking<00:02:25.690> about<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.840> couple<00:02:26.140> of

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
last are you talking about a couple of

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.479 
last are you talking about a couple of
hours<00:02:26.350> or<00:02:26.680> could<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:26.950> at<00:02:27.010> least<00:02:27.100> get<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.280> full

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
hours or could you at least get a full

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.460 
hours or could you at least get a full
day<00:02:27.670> out<00:02:27.880> of<00:02:27.910> it<00:02:28.060> it's<00:02:28.630> this<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.080> definitely

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470
