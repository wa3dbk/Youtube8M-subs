you've<00:00:07.560> probably<00:00:07.919> heard<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.519> lot<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.760> talk

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
you've probably heard a lot of talk

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.900 
you've probably heard a lot of talk
about<00:00:09.389> control<00:00:10.019> ground<00:00:10.380> feed<00:00:10.710> actions<00:00:11.160> versus

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
about control ground feed actions versus

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.270 
about control ground feed actions versus
push<00:00:12.210> feed<00:00:12.450> actions<00:00:12.929> what's<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.889> difference

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
push feed actions what's the difference

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.700 
push feed actions what's the difference
and<00:00:14.429> does<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.969> matter

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
and does it matter

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.200 
and does it matter
push<00:00:16.710> feed<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.160> controlled<00:00:17.550> feed<00:00:17.760> actions

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
push feed and controlled feed actions

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.179 
push feed and controlled feed actions
are<00:00:18.330> referring<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.930> how<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.199> action<00:00:19.980> or<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
are referring to how the action or the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.150 
are referring to how the action or the
functional<00:00:20.760> part<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:22.020> bold<00:00:22.289> action<00:00:22.740> rifle

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
functional part of a bold action rifle

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.310 
functional part of a bold action rifle
feeds<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.970> ammunition<00:00:24.539> into<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.930> chamber

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
feeds the ammunition into the chamber

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.269 
feeds the ammunition into the chamber
now<00:00:25.800> remove<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.550> push<00:00:27.150> feed<00:00:27.420> bolt<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.279> see

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
now remove a push feed bolt and you see

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.769 
now remove a push feed bolt and you see
that<00:00:29.519> there's<00:00:29.730> nothing<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.480> can<00:00:30.630> really

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
that there's nothing that can really

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.990 
that there's nothing that can really
hold<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.710> cartridge<00:00:32.070> against<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.610> face<00:00:32.790> of

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
hold the cartridge against the face of

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.500 
hold the cartridge against the face of
the<00:00:33.090> bolt<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:34.190> extractor<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.370> back<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.030> here

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the bolt the extractor is back in here

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.660 
the bolt the extractor is back in here
and<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:37.140> doesn't<00:00:37.500> grab<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.250> rim<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
and it doesn't grab the rim of the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.940 
and it doesn't grab the rim of the
cartridge<00:00:39.059> until<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.480> forced<00:00:40.170> when<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.829> goes

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
cartridge until it's forced when it goes

cartridge until it's forced when it goes
into<00:00:41.129> chamber<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.700> snap<00:00:41.969> over<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.480> now<00:00:43.079> it's

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
into chamber to snap over it now it's

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.869 
into chamber to snap over it now it's
being<00:00:43.500> held<00:00:43.680> by<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.890> hook<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:44.460> at<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> same

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
being held by the hook but at the same

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.000 
being held by the hook but at the same
time<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.690> being<00:00:45.960> pushed<00:00:46.350> off<00:00:46.590> by<00:00:46.860> that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
time it's being pushed off by that

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.100 
time it's being pushed off by that
plunger<00:00:47.579> ejector<00:00:48.180> there's<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.600> spring<00:00:48.989> in

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
plunger ejector there's a spring in

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.110 
plunger ejector there's a spring in
there<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.860> little<00:00:50.100> plunger<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.610> always

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
there and that little plunger is always

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.319 
there and that little plunger is always
pushing<00:00:51.829> against<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.890> back<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
pushing against the back of the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.240 
pushing against the back of the
cartridge<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.140> as<00:00:55.260> soon<00:00:55.440> as<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.710> pull<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.100> out

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
cartridge so as soon as you pull it out

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.959 
cartridge so as soon as you pull it out
of<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> chamber<00:00:56.629> it<00:00:57.629> gets<00:00:57.930> ejected<00:00:58.109> and

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
of the chamber it gets ejected and

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.279 
of the chamber it gets ejected and
that's<00:00:59.969> why<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:00.329> called<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.600> push<00:01:00.930> feed

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
that's why it's called a push feed

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.319 
that's why it's called a push feed
rather<00:01:01.590> than<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.219> controlled<00:01:02.640> round<00:01:02.910> feed<00:01:03.149> you

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
rather than a controlled round feed you

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.990 
rather than a controlled round feed you
just<00:01:03.660> can't<00:01:03.930> keep<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.290> held<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.739> there<00:01:05.000> what's

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
just can't keep it held on there what's

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.660 
just can't keep it held on there what's
the<00:01:06.119> problem<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.810> well<00:01:07.500> there<00:01:08.130> may<00:01:08.400> or

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the problem with that well there may or

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.570 
the problem with that well there may or
may<00:01:08.939> not<00:01:08.970> be<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> problem<00:01:09.720> let's<00:01:10.380> compare<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.830> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
may not be a problem let's compare it to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.700 
may not be a problem let's compare it to
the<00:01:11.700> controlled<00:01:12.150> round<00:01:12.420> feed<00:01:12.720> when<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.439> pushes

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
the controlled round feed when it pushes

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.310 
the controlled round feed when it pushes
the<00:01:14.040> cartridge<00:01:14.430> out<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.000> magazine<00:01:15.810> it

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
the cartridge out of the magazine it

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.560 
the cartridge out of the magazine it
pops<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.460> gets<00:01:17.729> underneath<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.270> big

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
pops up and gets underneath that big

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.690 
pops up and gets underneath that big
hook<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.259> that's<00:01:19.710> what<00:01:19.950> holds<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.369> against

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
hook and that's what holds it against

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460 
hook and that's what holds it against
the<00:01:20.790> face<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.299> bolt<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.990> now<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.200> have

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the face of the bolt so now you have

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.679 
the face of the bolt so now you have
control<00:01:22.740> feed<00:01:23.460> that's<00:01:23.759> not<00:01:24.090> going<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.479> fall

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
control feed that's not going to fall

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.719 
control feed that's not going to fall
off<00:01:24.960> because<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.439> big<00:01:25.619> claw<00:01:25.920> extractor<00:01:25.979> hangs

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
off because the big claw extractor hangs

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.700 
off because the big claw extractor hangs
on<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.210> pushes<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.170> into<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> chamber

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
on to it pushes it into the chamber

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.010 
on to it pushes it into the chamber
pulls<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.640> back<00:01:29.670> out<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.840> ejected

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
pulls it back out and it's ejected

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.130 
pulls it back out and it's ejected
through<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:32.100> slot<00:01:32.579> by<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> standing<00:01:33.900> little

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
through this slot by a standing little

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.020 
through this slot by a standing little
ejector<00:01:34.590> way<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.009> back<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.460> rifle<00:01:35.880> and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
ejector way in the back of the rifle and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.870 
ejector way in the back of the rifle and
that<00:01:36.060> knocks<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.659> off<00:01:37.400> how<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.640> going<00:01:38.790> to

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
that knocks it off how is that going to

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.420 
that knocks it off how is that going to
be<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> problem<00:01:39.299> either<00:01:39.630> way<00:01:39.960> well<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:41.009> think<00:01:41.130> I

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
be a problem either way well I think I

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.780 
be a problem either way well I think I
can<00:01:41.640> show<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:42.649> there<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.950> potential<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.670> a

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
can show you there is potential in a

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.670 
can show you there is potential in a
push<00:01:45.030> feed<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.140> come<00:01:46.380> all<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.649> way

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
push feed for you to come all the way

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.950 
push feed for you to come all the way
forward<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.579> your<00:01:47.790> excitement<00:01:48.240> imagine

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
forward and in your excitement imagine

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.480 
forward and in your excitement imagine
that<00:01:49.110> somebody<00:01:49.380> gets<00:01:49.649> excited<00:01:50.189> when<00:01:50.340> they're

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
that somebody gets excited when they're

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.819 
that somebody gets excited when they're
hunting<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.329> might<00:01:51.750> not<00:01:51.990> close<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.649> action

you want to

make sure you're always going to bring
that<00:02:15.660> cartridge<00:02:16.660> out<00:02:16.810> even<00:02:17.470> if<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.680> don't

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
that cartridge out even if you don't

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.640 
that cartridge out even if you don't
close<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.430> bolt<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:19.660> controlled<00:02:20.110> round<00:02:20.350> feet

close the bolt the controlled round feet

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.920 
close the bolt the controlled round feet
will<00:02:20.770> do<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.070> now<00:02:21.640> when<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:21.940> come<00:02:22.180> forward<00:02:22.480> I've

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
will do it now when I come forward I've

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.860 
will do it now when I come forward I've
got<00:02:23.290> an<00:02:23.440> empty<00:02:23.710> chamber<00:02:24.240> so<00:02:25.240> that's<00:02:25.450> one<00:02:25.780> of

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
got an empty chamber so that's one of

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.720 
got an empty chamber so that's one of
the<00:02:25.960> big<00:02:26.110> arguments<00:02:26.470> against<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.250> push<00:02:27.460> feed

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
the big arguments against the push feed

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.120 
the big arguments against the push feed
another<00:02:28.630> argument<00:02:28.930> against<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.710> is<00:02:29.800> that<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
another argument against it is that the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.640 
another argument against it is that the
push<00:02:30.400> feed<00:02:30.750> supposedly<00:02:31.750> can<00:02:32.200> let<00:02:32.410> that

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
push feed supposedly can let that

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.980 
push feed supposedly can let that
cartridge<00:02:33.040> fall<00:02:33.490> out<00:02:33.790> because<00:02:34.330> it's<00:02:34.540> loose<00:02:34.750> in

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
cartridge fall out because it's loose in

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.660 
cartridge fall out because it's loose in
there<00:02:35.140> when<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:35.380> push<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.620> but<00:02:36.160> I've<00:02:36.370> never

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
there when you push it but I've never

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.850 
there when you push it but I've never
had<00:02:36.880> it<00:02:37.030> happen<00:02:37.390> as<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:37.630> can<00:02:37.780> see<00:02:37.990> here<00:02:38.380> I'm

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
had it happen as you can see here I'm

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.490 
had it happen as you can see here I'm
not<00:02:39.420> controlling<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:40.690> don't<00:02:40.930> have<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.170> hold

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
not controlling it I don't have a hold

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.530 
not controlling it I don't have a hold
of<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:41.770> yet<00:02:42.100> it's<00:02:42.250> not<00:02:42.430> falling<00:02:42.940> out<00:02:43.090> because

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
of it yet it's not falling out because

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.240 
of it yet it's not falling out because
there's<00:02:43.900> enough<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.470> cartridge<00:02:44.890> up<00:02:45.040> in

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
there's enough of the cartridge up in

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.250 
there's enough of the cartridge up in
the<00:02:45.340> chamber<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:46.480> it's<00:02:46.660> probably<00:02:47.110> not<00:02:47.200> just

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
the chamber that it's probably not just

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.080 
the chamber that it's probably not just
going<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.650> fall<00:02:48.010> out<00:02:48.040> even<00:02:48.700> though<00:02:48.790> it's<00:02:48.940> not

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
going to fall out even though it's not

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.750 
going to fall out even though it's not
held<00:02:49.450> by<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.720> bolt<00:02:50.020> face<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:51.280> let's<00:02:51.489> try<00:02:51.730> that

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
held by the bolt face so let's try that

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.290 
held by the bolt face so let's try that
again

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
again

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.830 
again
upside<00:02:52.840> down<00:02:52.870> push<00:02:53.770> slowly<00:02:54.130> forward<00:02:54.730> if<00:02:55.600> there

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
upside down push slowly forward if there

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.420 
upside down push slowly forward if there
was<00:02:55.959> ever<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.320> chance<00:02:56.410> of<00:02:56.860> gravity<00:02:57.220> was<00:02:57.280> going

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
was ever a chance of gravity was going

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.710 
was ever a chance of gravity was going
to<00:02:57.489> pull<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:57.820> thing<00:02:58.060> out<00:02:58.209> it<00:02:58.510> would<00:02:58.630> have

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
to pull that thing out it would have

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.630 
to pull that thing out it would have
happened<00:02:58.870> there<00:02:59.320> and<00:02:59.470> how<00:02:59.860> many<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.250> us<00:03:00.370> have<00:03:00.610> a

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
happened there and how many of us have a

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.070 
happened there and how many of us have a
hunt<00:03:00.970> with<00:03:01.090> their<00:03:01.209> rifles<00:03:01.540> upside<00:03:01.900> down

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
hunt with their rifles upside down

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.330 
hunt with their rifles upside down
anyway<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:03.310> I<00:03:03.340> kind<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:03.880> discount<00:03:04.390> that<00:03:04.660> one

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
anyway so I kind of discount that one

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.520 
anyway so I kind of discount that one
normal<00:03:06.340> usage<00:03:06.459> just<00:03:07.209> like<00:03:07.390> that<00:03:07.660> as<00:03:07.900> long<00:03:08.380> as

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
normal usage just like that as long as

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.960 
normal usage just like that as long as
you<00:03:08.620> come<00:03:08.830> all<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.100> way<00:03:09.130> down<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:09.700> close<00:03:09.940> that

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
you come all the way down and close that

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.000 
you come all the way down and close that
bolt<00:03:10.390> bring<00:03:10.690> it<00:03:10.780> back<00:03:10.930> up<00:03:11.140> it's<00:03:11.650> going<00:03:11.890> to

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
bolt bring it back up it's going to

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.850 
bolt bring it back up it's going to
extract<00:03:12.640> that<00:03:12.880> cartridge<00:03:13.270> so<00:03:14.140> what's<00:03:14.709> it

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
extract that cartridge so what's it

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.010 
extract that cartridge so what's it
going<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.190> be<00:03:15.310> push<00:03:15.820> feed<00:03:16.030> action<00:03:16.420> control

ground feed action is there a

ground feed action is there a
significant<00:03:19.090> difference<00:03:19.390> well<00:03:19.959> you<00:03:20.200> get<00:03:20.380> to

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
significant difference well you get to

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.259 
significant difference well you get to
decide<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:21.040> old-timers<00:03:21.580> like<00:03:21.610> to<00:03:21.850> think<00:03:22.090> that

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
decide the old-timers like to think that

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.270 
decide the old-timers like to think that
the<00:03:22.420> safety<00:03:22.930> lies<00:03:23.350> with<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.739> controlled

the safety lies with the controlled

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
round feed but you can't get that Jam

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.630
