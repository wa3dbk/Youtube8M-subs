is replace the original suspension

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.160 
is replace the original suspension
system<00:02:07.200> which<00:02:07.319> is<00:02:07.439> just<00:02:07.469> like<00:02:07.829> some<00:02:08.069> rope<00:02:08.489> tape

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
system which is just like some rope tape

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.490 
system which is just like some rope tape
it<00:02:10.170> was<00:02:10.289> fiddly<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.660> just<00:02:12.660> time-consuming<00:02:13.230> to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
it was fiddly and just time-consuming to

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.680 
it was fiddly and just time-consuming to
set<00:02:13.739> up<00:02:13.860> properly<00:02:14.220> owing<00:02:14.519> these<00:02:14.819> things<00:02:15.060> far

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
set up properly owing these things far

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.420 
set up properly owing these things far
more<00:02:15.720> adjustable<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:16.590> stronger<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.220> lighter

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
more adjustable and stronger and lighter

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.229 
more adjustable and stronger and lighter
I<00:02:17.640> think<00:02:18.019> so<00:02:19.019> what<00:02:19.140> I've<00:02:19.260> got<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.849> this<00:02:20.849> is<00:02:21.000> just

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
I think so what I've got is this is just

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.170 
I think so what I've got is this is just
some<00:02:21.420> webbing<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.530> was<00:02:22.769> I<00:02:23.220> think<00:02:23.849> I<00:02:23.910> just<00:02:23.940> got

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
already had a loop Sony one in so I'll

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.920 
already had a loop Sony one in so I'll
just<00:02:32.819> put<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:33.000> climbing<00:02:33.329> carabiner<00:02:33.720> through

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930

there<00:02:35.209> I've<00:02:36.209> got<00:02:36.269> another<00:02:36.540> carabiner<00:02:37.019> there

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
there I've got another carabiner there

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.750 
there I've got another carabiner there
this<00:02:37.500> carabiner<00:02:37.860> it's<00:02:37.980> not<00:02:38.069> really<00:02:38.250> necessary

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
this carabiner it's not really necessary

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.559 
this carabiner it's not really necessary
I<00:02:38.849> just<00:02:40.069> added<00:02:41.069> security<00:02:41.489> I<00:02:41.670> suppose<00:02:41.940> before<00:02:42.540> I

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
I just added security I suppose before I

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.130 
I just added security I suppose before I
just<00:02:42.750> had<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.930> young<00:02:44.540> think<00:02:45.540> they<00:02:45.629> call<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> male

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
just had a young think they call a male

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.599 
just had a young think they call a male
and<00:02:46.290> spark<00:02:46.590> or<00:02:46.769> something<00:02:47.069> I<00:02:47.190> can't<00:02:47.489> remember

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
and spark or something I can't remember

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.140 
and spark or something I can't remember
what<00:02:47.819> it<00:02:47.910> is<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.720> was<00:02:48.870> just<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.140> like<00:02:49.379> a<00:02:50.150> steep

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
what it is it was just a like a steep

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.640 
what it is it was just a like a steep
cord<00:02:51.420> bit<00:02:51.569> of<00:02:51.660> el-amin<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.079> tube<00:02:52.319> across

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
cord bit of el-amin and tube across

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.940 
cord bit of el-amin and tube across
there<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.040> just<00:02:53.069> talk<00:02:53.370> first

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
there and you just talk first

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.080 
there and you just talk first
there<00:02:55.950> will<00:02:56.040> be<00:02:56.069> slinging<00:02:56.340> over<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:56.640> top<00:02:56.819> I

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
there will be slinging over the top I

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.140 
there will be slinging over the top I
thought<00:02:57.750> this<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.760> basically<00:02:59.760> any<00:03:00.030> way

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
thought this this is basically any way

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.490 
thought this this is basically any way
it<00:03:00.599> might<00:03:00.720> be<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.900> little<00:03:01.019> bit<00:03:01.170> earlier<00:03:01.470> but

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
it might be a little bit earlier but

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.000 
it might be a little bit earlier but
it's<00:03:01.950> not<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.220> bad<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:03.380> down<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.829> end

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
it's not that bad and down to the end

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.300 
it's not that bad and down to the end

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
where the these things pass through the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.220 
where the these things pass through the
end<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.579> hammock<00:03:08.959> makes<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.079> nice<00:03:10.200> and
