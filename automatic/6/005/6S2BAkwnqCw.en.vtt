00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.800
 lesson this lesson is called good is 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.900
 a song called whatsapp and 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.270
 from the group for non blondes is 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.340
 quite easy to play and good 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.010
 surely we will have heard it but 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.859
 we did not know what it was called and it was in my 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.199
 case as I knew that song and good 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.260
 we start with the first chords 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.660
 chord 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.239
 well I do not know well what's called the agreed 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:46.100
 but let's put our first finger 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:48.590
 this the index on the fourth string 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.039
 the next middle finger on the 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.530
 third string and this the ring in the 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.930
 second rope everyone will go in the 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.239
 second fret all all in the second 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.489
 fret and this is going to be our first 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.360
 according to the way we are going to play 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.360
 the songs 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.730
 it's always going to be down up and down 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.730
 above 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.410
 and after doing this 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.630
 let's let go of the finger the finger that 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.630
 I was on the second fret 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.040
 and it's going to sound like this 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.130
 all right 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.130
 and 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.090
 ah 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.370
 after that the next I agreed that 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:59.490
 let's do let's put our finger 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:02.280
 on the second fret of the fifth string 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:07.290
 We will put the ring finger in the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.360
 fourth fret of the fourth string and the 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.690
 little finger we're going to put it in the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.930
 third string of the fourth fret and the 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:21.380
 rude middle finger we will put 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.380
 on the third fret of the second string 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.780
 this change changes the shape a little 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.780
 where we're going to play because it's going to be 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.540
 I'm going to play one more time 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.090
 so we went over what we had 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.239
 remember the first chord is the fourth 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:02.030
 rope second rope second rope 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.030
 all in the third on the second fret 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.000
 let's go 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.490
 and then this chord 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.990
 the first finger on the second fret 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:20.800
 fifth rope the middle finger the 10 in the 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:24.630
 second string of the third fret finger 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.630
 cancel fourth fret 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.359
 fourth fret and fourth string and finger 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.359
 little finger fourth fret third string 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.340
 and already after we do that we're going to 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.340
 release this finger 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.200
 always always in this song when 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.870
 let's make the chords at the end of that 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.570
 chord let's pick up a finger for 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.820
 example in this case that we raise the 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.820
 cancel in the other we raise the index 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.800
 yes 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.900
 the next agreement that we are going to touch 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.410
 it's this ring finger we're going to put it in 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:16.400
 the third fret second string the middle 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:20.840
 second fret first string and the 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:24.580
 index and second fret third string 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.580
 second fret third string 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.419
 and the same form is the same 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.419
 touch 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:48.150
 down up down down up down 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.150
 so we went over what we had 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.569
 now let's lift the middle finger 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.610
 and well after that, what are we going 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:21.939
 do is return to the same agreed where 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.939
 we were 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:32.449
 but now it's going to be this like this one the 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:34.639
 strumming as we had done in the 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:37.039
 seconds in the second and third agreed 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.380
 because in the first nothing the first time 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:42.759
 that we play this chords anything below 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.759
 up up down 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.120
 the 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.470
 Look 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.400
 and we returned 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.220
 i 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.169
 I want 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.070
 all right 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.440
 and well it 's practically the whole song 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.210
 on the acoustic guitar I hope that you 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.600

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:43.200
