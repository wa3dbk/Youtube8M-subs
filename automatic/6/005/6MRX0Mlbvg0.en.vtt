00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
for it will make dealing with Guardians

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.920 
for it will make dealing with Guardians
a<00:00:50.640> little<00:00:50.789> bit<00:00:50.879> easier<00:00:51.149> but<00:00:51.300> then<00:00:51.420> again<00:00:51.510> it's

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
a little bit easier but then again it's

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.450 
a little bit easier but then again it's
pretty<00:00:52.230> good<00:00:52.590> at<00:00:52.800> getting<00:00:53.070> shots<00:00:53.280> for<00:00:53.399> the

pretty good at getting shots for the
mail<00:00:53.579> slot<00:00:53.760> as<00:00:54.329> far<00:00:54.539> as<00:00:54.629> shooting<00:00:54.719> through

cover<00:00:55.170> goes<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.739> think<00:00:56.100> they're<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> better

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
cover goes I think they're a better

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.189 
cover goes I think they're a better
weapons<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:56.910> weapon<00:00:57.180> doesn't<00:00:57.329> do<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.079> much

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
weapons this weapon doesn't do so much

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.689 
weapons this weapon doesn't do so much
damage<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> lot<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.190> damage<00:00:59.370> will

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
damage that a lot of that damage will

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.369 
damage that a lot of that damage will
actually<00:01:00.030> pierce<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> cover<00:01:00.600> because<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
actually pierce the cover because of the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.310 
actually pierce the cover because of the
way<00:01:01.469> percentages<00:01:01.980> work<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:03.260> certainly<00:01:04.260> you

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
way percentages work and certainly you

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.929 
way percentages work and certainly you
can<00:01:04.470> use<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.799> melee<00:01:05.040> stoner<00:01:05.250> if<00:01:05.430> you're<00:01:05.549> into

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
can use a melee stoner if you're into

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.789 
can use a melee stoner if you're into
mailing<00:01:06.390> but<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.900> think<00:01:07.229> bread<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.530> butter<00:01:07.650> for

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
mailing but I think bread and butter for

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.590 
mailing but I think bread and butter for
most<00:01:07.950> people<00:01:08.220> will<00:01:08.369> be<00:01:08.520> high<00:01:08.909> caliber<00:01:09.330> barrel

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
most people will be high caliber barrel

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.270 
most people will be high caliber barrel
plus<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> scope<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.890> don't<00:01:11.040> want<00:01:11.189> to

plus a scope and if you don't want to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.010 
plus a scope and if you don't want to
use<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.490> at<00:01:11.580> very<00:01:11.760> long<00:01:11.939> ranges<00:01:12.330> then<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:12.930> go

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
use it at very long ranges then just go

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.280 
use it at very long ranges then just go
with<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> magazine<00:01:13.470> upgrade<00:01:14.960> alright<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.140> here

with a magazine upgrade alright so here
we<00:01:16.409> go<00:01:19.759> my<00:01:20.759> fingers<00:01:21.119> are<00:01:21.270> off<00:01:21.390> there<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.020> go<00:01:22.140> so

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
we go my fingers are off there we go so

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.310 
we go my fingers are off there we go so
as<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.189> can<00:01:23.310> see<00:01:23.460> only<00:01:23.610> 12<00:01:23.939> shots<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.450> the

as you can see only 12 shots in the
chamber<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.250> definitely<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:26.909> benefit<00:01:27.210> from<00:01:27.270> a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
chamber so definitely can benefit from a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.300 
chamber so definitely can benefit from a
magazine<00:01:27.590> it's<00:01:28.590> really<00:01:28.740> up<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.950> player

little bit as you can see it's a lot

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.770 
little bit as you can see it's a lot
easier<00:02:15.350> at<00:02:15.620> this<00:02:15.800> range<00:02:16.360> but<00:02:17.360> I<00:02:17.420> don't<00:02:17.600> want<00:02:17.720> to

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
easier at this range but I don't want to

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.090 
easier at this range but I don't want to
waste<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.020> many<00:02:18.170> shots<00:02:18.380> on<00:02:18.500> these<00:02:18.590> guys<00:02:18.770> so<00:02:18.950> I'm

waste so many shots on these guys so I'm
gonna<00:02:19.190> just<00:02:19.480> deal<00:02:20.480> with<00:02:20.510> them<00:02:20.780> with<00:02:20.990> powers

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.690 

damage<00:02:38.600> mod<00:02:38.900> really<00:02:39.740> helps<00:02:40.010> conserve<00:02:40.370> ammo

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
damage mod really helps conserve ammo

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:54.570 
damage mod really helps conserve ammo
just<00:02:40.940> because<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.209> do<00:02:41.330> more<00:02:41.510> damage

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.420 

and<00:02:55.150> go<00:02:55.870> for<00:02:56.020> headshots<00:02:56.200> as<00:02:56.560> much<00:02:56.860> as<00:02:57.070> humanly

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
and go for headshots as much as humanly

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.180 
and go for headshots as much as humanly
possible<00:03:00.210> wish<00:03:01.210> I<00:03:01.300> had<00:03:01.420> more<00:03:01.570> ammo<00:03:02.070> need<00:03:03.070> to

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
possible wish I had more ammo need to

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.130 
possible wish I had more ammo need to
conserve<00:03:03.520> it<00:03:03.670> for<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.300> Centurion<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.840> compare

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
conserve it for the Centurion to compare

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.500 
conserve it for the Centurion to compare
shields

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:23.470 

I<00:03:13.519> need<00:03:14.519> to<00:03:14.640> move<00:03:14.760> up<00:03:15.030> this<00:03:15.209> world<00:03:15.980> kinda<00:03:16.980> sucks

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.960

but what can you do I guess it's hoping

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.550 
but what can you do I guess it's hoping
that<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.239> other<00:03:27.360> guy<00:03:27.510> would<00:03:27.629> drop<00:03:27.750> ammo

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
that that other guy would drop ammo

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.729 
that that other guy would drop ammo
not<00:03:29.190> so<00:03:29.489> lucky<00:03:30.530> that<00:03:31.530> is<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.709> grenade<00:03:33.739> grenades

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
not so lucky that is a grenade grenades

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.110 
not so lucky that is a grenade grenades
