it's located in the registry from here
as<00:01:24.369> well<00:01:24.550> and<00:01:24.819> then<00:01:25.240> go<00:01:25.509> back<00:01:25.750> and<00:01:26.020> delete<00:01:26.259> the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
the top you're going to find that's

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.389 
the top you're going to find that's
where<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.880> keylogger<00:01:52.539> spyware<00:01:53.470> trojans<00:01:54.220> are

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
where the keylogger spyware trojans are

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:55.949 
where the keylogger spyware trojans are
always<00:01:54.670> running<00:01:54.880> there<00:01:55.209> right<00:01:55.569> and<00:01:55.780> they'll

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
always running there right and they'll

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:59.130 
always running there right and they'll
be<00:01:56.110> listed<00:01:56.319> there<00:01:56.530> right<00:01:57.399> so<00:01:57.970> that's<00:01:58.810> where

you would go and you would kill the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.430 
you would go and you would kill the
process<00:02:01.179> by<00:02:01.390> right-clicking<00:02:02.020> on<00:02:02.259> one<00:02:02.410> of

I'm pretty familiar with what's running
in<00:02:15.130> here<00:02:15.310> because<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.670> go<00:02:15.849> in<00:02:15.940> there<00:02:16.060> quite

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
in here because I go in there quite

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.630 
in here because I go in there quite
often<00:02:16.569> to<00:02:16.900> check<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.319> see<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:18.040> I<00:02:18.069> know<00:02:18.219> what<00:02:18.519> to

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
often to check and see so I know what to

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.240 
often to check and see so I know what to
look<00:02:18.670> for<00:02:19.090> but<00:02:19.689> if<00:02:20.019> you're<00:02:20.739> not<00:02:20.829> sure<00:02:20.890> there's

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
look for but if you're not sure there's

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.440 
look for but if you're not sure there's
always<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.519> description<00:02:22.000> too

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
always a description too

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.850 
always a description too
on<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.860> on<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.190> side<00:02:24.430> sometimes<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:26.650> can

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
on the on the side sometimes you can

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.860 
on the on the side sometimes you can
tell<00:02:27.130> that<00:02:27.340> there's<00:02:27.550> no<00:02:27.730> description<00:02:28.180> right

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
tell that there's no description right

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.420 
tell that there's no description right
or<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.349> can<00:02:29.470> tell<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:29.890> filename<00:02:30.310> is

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
or you can tell that the filename is

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.550 
or you can tell that the filename is
kind<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.670> funny<00:02:30.940> right<00:02:31.599> and<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.410> doesn't

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
kind of funny right and and it doesn't

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.979 
kind of funny right and and it doesn't
make<00:02:32.770> sense<00:02:33.000> now<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.060> other<00:02:34.270> thing<00:02:34.540> is<00:02:34.750> that

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
make sense now the other thing is that

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.920 
make sense now the other thing is that
you<00:02:35.319> want<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.560> do<00:02:35.739> is<00:02:35.980> go<00:02:36.819> into<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.239> registry

you want to do is go into the registry

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.460 
you want to do is go into the registry
itself<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.680> delete<00:02:39.750> whatever<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:41.050> file

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
that is starting up every single time is

and one of the places you can go to to

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.550 
and one of the places you can go to to
see<00:02:49.900> if<00:02:50.140> it's<00:02:50.560> in<00:02:50.739> there<00:02:50.830> already<00:02:51.459> is<00:02:51.730> in<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.560> H

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.780 
see if it's in there already is in the H
key<00:02:54.010> current<00:02:54.430> user<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.030> then<00:02:55.720> under<00:02:56.019> that

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
key current user and then under that

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.820 
key current user and then under that
expand<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.180> go<00:02:58.330> down<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.510> software<00:02:59.470> and

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
expand that and go down to software and

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.410 
expand that and go down to software and
then<00:03:00.100> expand<00:03:00.610> that<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.000> then<00:03:01.120> go<00:03:01.269> under

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
then expand that and then go under

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.770 
then expand that and then go under
Microsoft<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.530> then<00:03:03.040> under<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:03.780> expand

that and go into current version and
then<00:03:10.480> run<00:03:10.870> so<00:03:11.440> under<00:03:11.709> run<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.730> would<00:03:12.880> have

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
then run so under run you would have

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.210 
then run so under run you would have
tons<00:03:13.269> of<00:03:13.450> things<00:03:13.510> there<00:03:13.959> under<00:03:14.440> that<00:03:14.470> on<00:03:14.830> the

right-hand side so I have here under run

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.380 
right-hand side so I have here under run
once<00:03:17.830> for<00:03:18.130> example<00:03:18.220> there's<00:03:18.790> one<00:03:18.850> thing<00:03:19.180> here

registry you can always do a search and

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.710 
registry you can always do a search and

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
and after it finds it then delete it

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.539

right<00:03:52.329> so<00:03:52.870> that<00:03:53.019> way<00:03:53.140> it<00:03:53.260> doesn't<00:03:53.440> them<00:03:53.769> look

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
right so that way it doesn't them look

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.610 
right so that way it doesn't them look
for<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:54.850> next<00:03:55.090> time<00:03:55.180> when<00:03:55.329> you<00:03:55.420> restart<00:03:55.840> then

for it next time when you restart then
the<00:03:56.739> next<00:03:56.980> thing<00:03:57.070> of<00:03:57.220> course<00:03:57.400> is<00:03:57.670> to<00:03:57.700> find<00:03:58.150> the

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
the next thing of course is to find the

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.539 
the next thing of course is to find the
actual<00:03:58.450> files<00:03:59.079> on<00:03:59.410> your<00:03:59.530> computer<00:03:59.980> so<00:04:00.190> go<00:04:00.340> into

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
actual files on your computer so go into

found right or accessed so one of the
places<00:04:13.660> that<00:04:13.840> I<00:04:13.989> usually<00:04:14.260> go<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.120> is<00:04:16.120> the

places that I usually go to is the
windows<00:04:17.919> system32<00:04:18.820> folder<00:04:19.200> so<00:04:20.200> let's<00:04:20.530> just

yesterday and it could be a trojan it
could<00:04:24.610> be<00:04:24.700> something<00:04:25.090> that<00:04:25.300> you<00:04:25.600> installed

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
could be something that you installed

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.740 
could be something that you installed
and<00:04:26.500> if<00:04:27.340> you<00:04:27.430> go<00:04:27.550> into<00:04:27.700> system<00:04:28.360> 32<00:04:28.479> folder

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
and if you go into system 32 folder

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.659 
and if you go into system 32 folder
sometimes<00:04:29.650> you'll<00:04:29.860> you'll<00:04:30.160> you'll<00:04:30.190> be<00:04:30.610> able

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
which dll's or Exe files

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.450 
which dll's or Exe files
are<00:04:35.979> running<00:04:36.659> and<00:04:37.659> have<00:04:38.219> yesterday's<00:04:39.219> date

are running and have yesterday's date

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.520 
are running and have yesterday's date
when<00:04:39.759> I<00:04:39.789> first<00:04:40.150> install<00:04:40.569> that<00:04:40.749> program<00:04:41.199> or<00:04:41.349> did

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
when I first install that program or did

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.459 
when I first install that program or did
this<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:42.069> it's<00:04:43.060> coincidental<00:04:43.930> that<00:04:43.960> I<00:04:44.139> have

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:44.469 
this and it's coincidental that I have

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:46.350 
this and it's coincidental that I have
here<00:04:44.830> this<00:04:44.979> file<00:04:45.249> now<00:04:45.460> running<00:04:45.849> at<00:04:45.969> the<00:04:46.090> exact

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
here this file now running at the exact

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.379 
here this file now running at the exact
same<00:04:46.599> time<00:04:46.900> when<00:04:47.229> the<00:04:47.349> problem<00:04:47.710> happens<00:04:48.129> so

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
same time when the problem happens so

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.269 
same time when the problem happens so
usually<00:04:49.389> I<00:04:49.599> go<00:04:50.080> through<00:04:50.379> a<00:04:50.439> lot<00:04:50.710> of<00:04:50.740> problem

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:51.279 
usually I go through a lot of problem

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:54.469 
usually I go through a lot of problem
determination<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:52.120> figure<00:04:52.479> out<00:04:52.629> what<00:04:53.620> is

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
determination to figure out what is

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.510 
determination to figure out what is
related<00:04:55.479> and<00:04:55.659> what<00:04:56.319> could<00:04:56.590> be<00:04:56.830> safely<00:04:57.249> removed

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
related and what could be safely removed

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.760 
related and what could be safely removed
so<00:04:58.029> it's<00:04:58.180> not<00:04:58.330> easy<00:04:58.629> necessarily<00:04:59.319> to<00:04:59.469> figure

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
so it's not easy necessarily to figure

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.050 
so it's not easy necessarily to figure
these<00:04:59.889> things<00:04:59.949> out<00:05:00.370> that's<00:05:00.639> why<00:05:00.759> we<00:05:00.909> got

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
these things out that's why we got

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.450 
these things out that's why we got
antivirus<00:05:01.689> programs<00:05:02.199> and<00:05:02.860> all<00:05:02.979> these<00:05:03.189> other

tools<00:05:03.819> to<00:05:04.060> try<00:05:04.210> to<00:05:04.270> figure<00:05:04.599> these<00:05:04.719> things<00:05:04.779> out

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
tools to try to figure these things out

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.760 
tools to try to figure these things out
for<00:05:05.439> us<00:05:05.620> right<00:05:05.889> and<00:05:06.039> and<00:05:06.189> look<00:05:06.789> for<00:05:07.029> these

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
for us right and and look for these

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.830 
for us right and and look for these
associations<00:05:08.770> and<00:05:09.250> remove<00:05:09.580> them<00:05:09.819> for<00:05:10.120> us<00:05:10.240> but

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
associations and remove them for us but

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.510
