00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.460
 So we find ourselves here in Kreuzau 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.470
 beat his little Eifel too 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.690
 cologne dÃ¼ren aachen 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.030
 the tournament so much is that 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.290
 for eleven years 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.430
 that is what has been regulated 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.739
 official judge is like one 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.250
 sport association is here we have in 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:49.340
 principle quite standard folder something like that 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.340
 fixed questions, answers or games 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.620
 apa 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.980
 Reply to the rider or the 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.330
 In the end, the rider will be that one 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.580
 Of course, the horse is under control 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.070
 should have what you can should is 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.020
 always around you can jump up to 60 cm 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.330
 That means you should cross already 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.510
 inka palettes make smaller jumps 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.510
 can 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.810
 The riders ride by get for 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.609
 each obstacle is a mark and the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.810
 highest score is after the winner 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.479
 for a mistake 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.070
 against the 0.5 are deducted the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.140
 give various obstacles 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.640
 different points and every done 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.770
 obstacle is then as a point 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.270
 added together is an error on the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.759
 Obstacle there are no more points to 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.380
 finish the most points in front 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.380
 in connection with the fastest time 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.110
 what many freetime riders do is make it 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.730
 Let's just say we're training that 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.290
 all year our riding lessons take 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.210
 peter's watch prepare a conversation 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.640
 grounds that are tests here the 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.430
 just to have fun that's very 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.620
 interesting tasks like very nice 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.210
 are decorated and I guess it 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.860
 make the tournament ladder fun times 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.830
 just to say we do something 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.840
 is fun and you can laugh and 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.480
 Freetime riders in turn say well 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.220
 should prepare soon and for us and us 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.050
 Take something with us and sometimes 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.450
 look what our drives then makes 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.610
 are partly completely surprised that 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.410
 feld makes everything without doing theater 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.390
 and others are complete 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.270
 surprised how terrible he goes 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.730
 is and does not do everything and me 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.630
 but everyone thinks that's fun 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.190
 and make you happy 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.210
 I believe that many already 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.210
 events need 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.700
 in level 1 it was very easy too 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.230
 no rage thought beginner it is 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.090
 very simple it was a lot on 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.080
 the harmony between horse and rider 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.480
 respected and also very much on it 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.240
 pay attention to the help given as the 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.670
 is that very easy or if you are 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.120
 are like boxes of hand and in 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.000
 Level 2 is because the requirements something 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.190
 we were taller in level 2 then 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.810
 consistently placed and it has in the 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.340
 end effect then again for the vice 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.990
 handed circular master of the adult 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.150
 Everything depends on the fact that 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.850
 harmony between horse and rider and 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.380
 also the ease of the horse 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.530
 comes across and that it does not work yes 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.510
 but always that should come over that that 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.490
 a unit is and that is all 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.800
 loose from the hand I say now 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:41.420
 I was the extreme then 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.020
 Tournament rider has meanwhile 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.910
 my horse did not let up anymore 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.920
 the fitteste is I like that 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.390
 weekend totally awesome here the people 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.489
 are all very nice 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.510
 it is followed as effort with the 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:59.470
 Decoration also in the course and it does 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.470
 just mega fun
