00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
why that bulb keeps popping because it's

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.420 
why that bulb keeps popping because it's
the<00:01:30.180> second<00:01:30.570> one<00:01:30.660> of<00:01:30.810> killed<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.830> that<00:01:32.190> one's

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
that one was an expensive one so that

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.030 
that one was an expensive one so that
when<00:01:38.540> this<00:01:39.540> one's<00:01:39.840> don't<00:01:40.110> pop<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:40.710> these<00:01:40.860> ones

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
little bit of work to do so i'll

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.190 
little bit of work to do so i'll
probably<00:02:43.530> torch<00:02:44.099> it<00:02:44.340> down<00:02:45.090> burn<00:02:45.420> off<00:02:45.629> all<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
probably torch it down burn off all the

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.690 
probably torch it down burn off all the
friggin<00:02:46.440> pool<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.129> stuff<00:02:47.250> like<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:47.549> and

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
friggin pool and stuff like that and

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.970 
friggin pool and stuff like that and
then<00:02:47.970> i'll<00:02:48.090> try<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.389> solder<00:02:48.659> it<00:02:48.959> I've<00:02:49.680> done<00:02:49.829> it

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
then i'll try to solder it I've done it

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.710 
then i'll try to solder it I've done it
before<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.639> can<00:02:50.879> be<00:02:51.090> done<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:54.150> i'll<00:02:54.299> get<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.599> it

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
before it can be done so i'll get to it

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.690 
before it can be done so i'll get to it
and<00:02:56.480> finished<00:02:57.500> but<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.739> is<00:02:58.950> for<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.400> one

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
and finished but it it is for that one

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.819 
and finished but it it is for that one
it<00:02:59.730> was<00:02:59.879> being<00:03:00.209> difficult<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:00.900> just<00:03:01.139> scraped

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
it was being difficult so I just scraped

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.270 
it was being difficult so I just scraped
away<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.189> stuff<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:03.209> little<00:03:03.569> fins<00:03:03.840> I

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
away the stuff the little fins I

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.379 
away the stuff the little fins I
squished<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.459> together<00:03:05.790> because<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.239> was<00:03:06.329> a

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
squished it together because it was a

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.729 
squished it together because it was a
pretty<00:03:06.540> pic<00:03:06.780> freaking<00:03:07.260> hole<00:03:07.470> like<00:03:09.260> my<00:03:10.260> pic<00:03:10.530> I

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
pretty pic freaking hole like my pic I

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.479 
pretty pic freaking hole like my pic I
could<00:03:10.920> fit<00:03:11.099> my<00:03:11.250> pic<00:03:11.519> in<00:03:11.879> it<00:03:12.569> easily<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.829> just

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
could fit my pic in it easily so I just

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.020 
could fit my pic in it easily so I just
squished<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:15.560> whole<00:03:16.560> together<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.340> soldered

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
squished the whole together and soldered

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.689 
squished the whole together and soldered
it<00:03:18.180> up<00:03:18.329> that<00:03:19.049> one's<00:03:19.290> done<00:03:19.530> too<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.250> that

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
little holes fixed now I have to find a

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
little holes fixed now I have to find a
way<00:03:29.069> to<00:03:29.190> pressure<00:03:29.459> test<00:03:29.790> this<00:03:30.060> and

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
way to pressure test this and

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.910 
way to pressure test this and
yeah<00:03:32.780> good<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.770> go<00:03:35.470> whoo<00:03:36.470> ah<00:03:37.540> dang<00:03:38.920> power

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
yeah good to go whoo ah dang power

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.250 
yeah good to go whoo ah dang power
steering<00:03:40.400> fluids<00:03:40.730> boiling<00:03:41.150> over<00:03:41.300> again<00:03:41.690> it

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
steering fluids boiling over again it

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.140 
steering fluids boiling over again it
was<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:42.620> keeps<00:03:42.830> getting<00:03:43.010> low<00:03:43.310> so<00:03:43.340> I<00:03:43.580> top<00:03:43.819> it<00:03:43.849> up

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
was it keeps getting low so I top it up

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.660 
was it keeps getting low so I top it up
and<00:03:44.330> then<00:03:44.420> it<00:03:44.510> freaking<00:03:45.069> shoots<00:03:46.069> at<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.430> top

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
and then it freaking shoots at the top

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
and then it freaking shoots at the top
dang<00:03:47.800> anyways<00:03:48.800> I<00:03:49.130> patched<00:03:49.640> the<00:03:50.000> rad<00:03:50.209> and<00:03:50.569> its

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
dang anyways I patched the rad and its

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.410 
dang anyways I patched the rad and its
hold<00:03:50.989> implying<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:51.800> just<00:03:52.310> got<00:03:53.000> her<00:03:53.120> up<00:03:53.269> to

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
hold implying I just got her up to

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.990 
hold implying I just got her up to
running<00:03:53.630> temperature<00:03:54.310> nice<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:55.519> toasty

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
running temperature nice and toasty

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.490 
running temperature nice and toasty
could<00:03:56.150> almost<00:03:56.269> cook<00:03:56.569> a<00:03:56.660> marshmallow<00:03:57.050> on<00:03:57.200> it

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
could almost cook a marshmallow on it

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.059 
could almost cook a marshmallow on it
and<00:03:58.510> those<00:03:59.510> little<00:03:59.720> patches<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:00.739> did<00:04:00.920> or

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
and those little patches I did or

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.720 
and those little patches I did or

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
holding so ya don't quite need a new rad

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.440 
holding so ya don't quite need a new rad
yet<00:04:06.340> so<00:04:07.340> now<00:04:07.610> I<00:04:09.280> gotta<00:04:10.280> put<00:04:10.519> a<00:04:10.549> muffling<00:04:11.030> it<00:04:11.209> or

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
yet so now I gotta put a muffling it or

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.140 
yet so now I gotta put a muffling it or
on<00:04:11.600> it<00:04:11.780> just<00:04:12.350> a<00:04:12.410> little<00:04:12.560> tip<00:04:12.860> found<00:04:13.640> this<00:04:13.880> guy

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
on it just a little tip found this guy

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.740 
on it just a little tip found this guy
just<00:04:14.630> stole<00:04:14.959> her<00:04:15.200> on<00:04:15.380> there<00:04:15.709> while<00:04:16.540> while<00:04:17.540> she

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
just stole her on there while while she

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.690 
just stole her on there while while she
was<00:04:17.870> running<00:04:18.049> it<00:04:18.380> reduces<00:04:18.859> it<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.100> lot<00:04:19.340> so<00:04:19.669> I

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
was running it reduces it a lot so I

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.990 
was running it reduces it a lot so I
ground<00:04:20.060> out<00:04:20.359> to<00:04:21.400> spot<00:04:22.400> where<00:04:22.520> I<00:04:22.550> need<00:04:22.700> to<00:04:22.790> weld

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
ground out to spot where I need to weld

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.469 
ground out to spot where I need to weld
and<00:04:23.510> it's<00:04:23.690> just<00:04:23.900> going<00:04:24.080> to<00:04:24.639> fit<00:04:25.639> on<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:26.180> old

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
and it's just going to fit on the old

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.340 
and it's just going to fit on the old
friggin<00:04:27.080> exhaust<00:04:27.889> hanger<00:04:28.100> like<00:04:28.430> that<00:04:29.350> Megan

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
friggin exhaust hanger like that Megan

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.920 
friggin exhaust hanger like that Megan
right<00:04:30.760> so<00:04:31.760> that'll<00:04:32.000> be<00:04:32.120> that'll<00:04:32.570> be<00:04:32.750> pretty

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
right so that'll be that'll be pretty

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.469 
right so that'll be that'll be pretty
good<00:04:33.200> and<00:04:33.650> then<00:04:35.950> yeah<00:04:36.950> then<00:04:37.460> it'll<00:04:38.060> be<00:04:38.090> quiet

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
good and then yeah then it'll be quiet

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.779 
good and then yeah then it'll be quiet
again<00:04:39.669> but<00:04:40.669> I<00:04:40.760> can<00:04:42.280> you<00:04:43.280> know<00:04:43.400> maybe<00:04:43.610> do

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
again but I can you know maybe do

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.580 
again but I can you know maybe do
highway<00:04:44.180> speeds<00:04:44.539> and<00:04:44.810> not<00:04:44.990> go<00:04:45.200> deaf<00:04:45.610> yeah<00:04:47.590> hit

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
highway speeds and not go deaf yeah hit

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.670 
highway speeds and not go deaf yeah hit
the<00:04:48.620> springs<00:04:49.370> worked<00:04:49.700> really<00:04:50.030> good<00:04:50.680> they

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
the springs worked really good they

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.330 
the springs worked really good they
didn't<00:04:52.010> rubber<00:04:52.280> nothing<00:04:52.970> so<00:04:54.039> yeah<00:04:55.039> I<00:04:55.220> think

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
didn't rubber nothing so yeah I think

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.420 
didn't rubber nothing so yeah I think
she's<00:04:56.330> got<00:04:56.479> a<00:04:56.539> bit<00:04:56.750> of<00:04:56.870> a<00:04:57.020> backwards<00:04:57.919> lean<00:04:58.160> to

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
she's got a bit of a backwards lean to

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.100 
she's got a bit of a backwards lean to
her<00:04:58.580> like<00:04:58.789> the<00:04:58.940> back<00:04:59.090> springs<00:04:59.450> of<00:04:59.630> sagging<00:05:00.020> a

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
her like the back springs of sagging a

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.050 
her like the back springs of sagging a
bit<00:05:00.880> maybe<00:05:01.880> maybe<00:05:02.780> not<00:05:02.900> I<00:05:03.610> don't<00:05:04.610> know<00:05:04.700> I<00:05:04.880> guess

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
bit maybe maybe not I don't know I guess

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.490 
bit maybe maybe not I don't know I guess
it<00:05:05.300> looks<00:05:05.330> level<00:05:05.750> now<00:05:05.870> but<00:05:06.080> when<00:05:06.200> I<00:05:06.260> had<00:05:06.380> it

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
it looks level now but when I had it

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.020 
it looks level now but when I had it
parked<00:05:06.650> over<00:05:06.979> in<00:05:07.070> the<00:05:07.160> driveway<00:05:07.400> there<00:05:07.580> it<00:05:07.940> was

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
parked over in the driveway there it was

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.710 
parked over in the driveway there it was
pretty<00:05:08.620> pretty<00:05:09.620> wobbly<00:05:09.919> and<00:05:10.910> tilted<00:05:11.570> to<00:05:11.690> the

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
pretty pretty wobbly and tilted to the

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.790 
pretty pretty wobbly and tilted to the
back<00:05:11.990> but<00:05:12.320> that<00:05:12.560> might<00:05:13.370> just<00:05:13.400> be<00:05:13.669> because<00:05:14.800> it

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
back but that might just be because it

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.290 
back but that might just be because it
was<00:05:15.919> maybe<00:05:16.100> at<00:05:16.310> a<00:05:16.370> downslope<00:05:16.820> or<00:05:17.030> something

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
was maybe at a downslope or something

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.930 
was maybe at a downslope or something
but<00:05:18.010> hey<00:05:19.010> whatever

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
but hey whatever

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.230 
but hey whatever
cool<00:05:21.940> I'm<00:05:22.150> glad<00:05:22.300> that<00:05:22.389> rad<00:05:22.900> fix<00:05:23.320> words<00:05:25.139> yeah

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
cool I'm glad that rad fix words yeah

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.120 
cool I'm glad that rad fix words yeah
well<00:05:28.240> I<00:05:28.270> got<00:05:28.509> the<00:05:28.539> exhaust<00:05:28.960> tip<00:05:29.320> all<00:05:29.500> welded<00:05:30.009> on

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
well I got the exhaust tip all welded on

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.050 
well I got the exhaust tip all welded on
and<00:05:30.370> it<00:05:30.460> is<00:05:30.580> so<00:05:30.850> much<00:05:31.030> more<00:05:31.090> quiet<00:05:31.539> now<00:05:31.900> rig<00:05:33.060> so

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
and it is so much more quiet now rig so

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.480 
and it is so much more quiet now rig so
much<00:05:34.710> only<00:05:35.710> thing<00:05:35.949> I'm<00:05:36.039> worried<00:05:36.280> about<00:05:36.340> is

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
much only thing I'm worried about is

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.879 
much only thing I'm worried about is
that<00:05:36.699> might<00:05:37.169> might<00:05:38.169> be<00:05:38.320> a<00:05:38.350> little<00:05:38.530> bit<00:05:38.740> too

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
that might might be a little bit too

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.790 
that might might be a little bit too
much<00:05:39.009> weight<00:05:39.750> because<00:05:40.750> it's<00:05:41.110> only<00:05:41.410> held<00:05:41.620> on

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
much weight because it's only held on

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.270 
much weight because it's only held on
with<00:05:42.039> the<00:05:42.280> exhaust<00:05:42.840> flanges<00:05:43.840> and<00:05:44.080> then<00:05:44.620> that

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
with the exhaust flanges and then that

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.090 
with the exhaust flanges and then that
back<00:05:45.580> mount<00:05:45.910> thing<00:05:46.180> there<00:05:46.470> so<00:05:47.470> I'm<00:05:47.650> hoping

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
back mount thing there so I'm hoping

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.189 
back mount thing there so I'm hoping
it's<00:05:48.280> not<00:05:48.400> too<00:05:48.490> much<00:05:48.820> but<00:05:49.330> I<00:05:50.460> guess<00:05:51.460> you'll<00:05:51.639> see

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
it's not too much but I guess you'll see

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:56.909 
it's not too much but I guess you'll see
another<00:05:53.199> thing<00:05:53.530> I<00:05:53.650> want<00:05:53.800> to<00:05:53.830> do<00:05:54.009> is<00:05:54.039> maybe<00:05:55.919> some

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
another thing I want to do is maybe some

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:04.260 
another thing I want to do is maybe some

leaking<00:06:04.570> from<00:06:06.479> looks<00:06:07.479> like<00:06:07.599> it's<00:06:07.750> leaking<00:06:07.990> at

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
leaking from looks like it's leaking at

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.939 
leaking from looks like it's leaking at
the<00:06:08.169> top<00:06:09.300> good<00:06:10.300> but<00:06:12.270> yeah<00:06:13.270> so<00:06:13.960> that's<00:06:14.740> leaking

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:14.949 
the top good but yeah so that's leaking

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:22.430 
the top good but yeah so that's leaking
everywhere<00:06:15.310> damn<00:06:15.970> it<00:06:16.680> what<00:06:17.680> is<00:06:17.860> leaking
