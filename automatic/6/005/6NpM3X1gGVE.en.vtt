00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.809
 Well, as I said, Voltaire did not take care of the details of 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.609
 of a vehicle of this vehicle 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.669
 percent for the present 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.599
 prada 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:19.460
 to put them 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.519
 it's a very high cost 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.739
 they're details 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:26.449
 what should they 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.300
 to take into account as the north handles 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.789
 in a vehicle as it is 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.750
 p high 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.180
 so spacious are needed 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.970
 this for that boer war of something else from him air conditioning 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:39.900
 is that 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.720
 That's where we live 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.170
 the last 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.399
 conduits 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.449
 ventilation 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.030
 and here back already 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.680
 there's nothing ventilation 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.760
 as you can see 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.750
 as without signs as 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.780
 with ten passengers 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.270
 what is this vehicle 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.200
 there is no trunk 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.540
 in sight the Uruguayan 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.500
 which is a problem because you should go 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.350
 put them in the suitcases 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.860
 under the seats 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.690
 under the seats 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.710
 and good thing else is that besides aquino body I put in the bank speakers 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.770
 adapted 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.170
 on the floor 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.610
 it is the case of conflicts 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.530
 when the soil 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.539
 why 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:30.450
 the cardboard panel can not stand 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.040
 a lucida 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.050
 luis war the trunk to see how it is 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.050
 reduced 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.149
 I feel one more person because in the other version of Europe in Spanish 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.680
 nine passengers 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.050
 and it does not reduce so much the current 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.050
 let's crash 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.020
 I do not love school very much 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.390
 that will simply have new suitcases which you have to put suitcases 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.390
 concentration 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.570
 another inconvenience of 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.099
 lauro banes that needed only fit two people 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.859
 of very thin complexion 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.639
 as you can see it is not very 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.829
 ample space because 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.829
 the problem is not in the middle 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.779
 in safety increments 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:37.349
 they are fixed 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.399
 you can not download 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.829
 but menchov fixed 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.079
 just a hook to buy something 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.079
 a network 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:53.249
 very basic very basic vehicle 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:56.439
 and in volkswagen they do not explain 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.729
 none of that as well as verification 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:02.709
 who buy these vehicles only give you 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.469
 zero hologram 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.629
 not so double zero transport +0 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.949
 only and there to go to the verificentros 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:12.779
 to the north 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:15.779
 the north from the city of mexico 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:18.829
 they are German vehicles 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.179
 who spend 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:24.059
 percent 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:26.539
 that spends a lot of intelligence 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.089
 sun spending 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:31.459
 very large in holding 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.739
 since they are paid 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.769
 percent other thing that just telling them we want to know is only the driver 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.569
 the companion 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.139
 or the copilot 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.519
 does not have an airbag 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.730
 the passengers 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.179
 without a vehicle 

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:51.389
 family 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.579
 or passenger is neglected 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.669
 that security must have 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.019
 in vehicles 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.859
 of this type 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:05.019
 to verify you have to lose a full day to go if you write 

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:09.239
 acsur gaps in other 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.479
 in another place far from 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:15.949
 from the verificentros that regularly is so few took care of these 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.499
 this palapa bet and they are the only ones 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:20.229
 verificentros that what 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.569
 verify these vehicles says 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:25.930
 they are only 4 5 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.289
 Peric and centers that 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:28.490
 that verify 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.930
 another one of the things about this euro go is that the lights are very poor 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.509
 that I mean with that to add lights very 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.680
 bad at night and there is not a 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.730
 visibility 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.930
 zero visibility 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.949
 which leaves this vehicle are adopted some vehicle and cougars fog lights 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.699
 Xenon type 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.180
 to be able to see better at night 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.069
 lack 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.069
 in case some accident can see 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.759
 well those are the 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.759
 the drawbacks of December when they say 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.400
 and that 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.460
 if you are going to buy a euro go 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.339
 t5 polk your brave 

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:12.379
 think about it two months 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:14.749
 another thing that I forgot to tell you 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:17.990
 these vehicles you have to leave the apprehended 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.460
 yes you travel that a very long journey 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.110
 the pins that we're on at idle at least about 3 the five 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.999
 minutes 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.949
 this 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:29.639
 and then 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.259
 powerful polock pay it 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:33.849
 he because it's very simple p 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.089
 these vehicles that lower the pressure 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:38.779
 entel 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:41.830
 Turbo works pressure what you need to cool down 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.400
 if you turn off the vehicle immediately 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.870
 crazy occasion more 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.610
 is that the turbo decomposes 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.610
 why this one who was born in mexico and many vehicles 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:55.680
 that have broken down they say because you do not 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.330
 the agencies 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.729
 of volkswagen 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.759
 they do not give you the instructions or in the manuals 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:04.189
 from the same truck 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:07.279
 they give you the recommendation to leave the vehicle 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:08.650
 switched on 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.869
 Five minutes after each trip 

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:13.680
 that's 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.819
 it is something that is due 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:18.160
 d to do 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.999
 because if not 

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:22.090
 You will have to buy a tour there 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.259
 it costs more or less about six thousand pesos on the outside 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:28.259
 because the agency is river in 10 thousand pesos 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:29.819
 then 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:32.009
 it is a recommendation 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.009
 they sinned neutral and they let slow down about five minutes 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:40.539
 then think twice before ibm club volkswaguen 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.339
 t5 eurovan 

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:46.199
 and good b also the jetas 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:49.619
 all vehicles say they bring new ones with two problems use 

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:53.439
 only 0 percent vehicle that you have to 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.369
 leave it on 

00:06:56.369 --> 00:06:58.539
 then you have to think well 

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:01.180
 here a vehicle 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.960
 of this type
