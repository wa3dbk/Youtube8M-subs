fueling station here I can pull this out
there's<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:17.989> little<00:03:18.200> more<00:03:18.349> locking<00:03:19.040> mechanism

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
there's a little more locking mechanism

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.640 
there's a little more locking mechanism
on<00:03:19.849> the<00:03:19.939> top<00:03:20.120> here<00:03:20.390> you<00:03:20.569> have<00:03:21.049> to<00:03:21.170> lift<00:03:21.349> this<00:03:21.590> up

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
on the top here you have to lift this up

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.089 
on the top here you have to lift this up
and<00:03:22.180> then<00:03:23.180> you<00:03:23.299> can<00:03:23.510> slide<00:03:23.810> this<00:03:24.079> all<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:24.980> way

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
and then you can slide this all the way

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.080 
and then you can slide this all the way
out<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:26.319> see<00:03:27.319> the<00:03:27.470> octane<00:03:27.890> thing<00:03:28.760> on<00:03:28.940> this

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
out and see the octane thing on this

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.410 
out and see the octane thing on this
side<00:03:29.890> on<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.069> side<00:03:31.370> you've<00:03:32.000> got<00:03:32.030> like<00:03:32.390> a

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
side on the side you've got like a

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.589 
side on the side you've got like a
little<00:03:32.629> fuel<00:03:33.079> pump<00:03:33.349> here<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:34.670> you<00:03:35.450> can

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
little fuel pump here and you can

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:44.280 
little fuel pump here and you can
actually<00:03:35.900> pull<00:03:36.349> that<00:03:36.379> out

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.960 

and<00:03:45.030> these<00:03:46.030> black<00:03:46.390> pieces<00:03:46.629> on<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.959> side<00:03:47.970> fold

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
and these black pieces on the side fold

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.440 
and these black pieces on the side fold
down<00:03:49.269> if<00:03:50.170> you<00:03:50.379> fold<00:03:50.620> all<00:03:50.799> four<00:03:50.829> around<00:03:51.450> it'll

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
down if you fold all four around it'll

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.860 
down if you fold all four around it'll
actually<00:03:52.569> set<00:03:53.110> up<00:03:53.140> like<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:57.750> then<00:03:58.750> you

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
actually set up like that and then you

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.430 
actually set up like that and then you
can<00:03:58.989> just<00:03:59.200> slide<00:03:59.980> it<00:04:00.340> right<00:04:00.370> back<00:04:00.549> in<00:04:00.909> there

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
can just slide it right back in there

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.440 
can just slide it right back in there
and<00:04:02.440> you<00:04:03.280> have<00:04:03.310> to<00:04:03.459> line<00:04:03.790> it<00:04:03.819> up<00:04:04.060> just<00:04:04.299> right

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
and you have to line it up just right

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.539 
and you have to line it up just right
and<00:04:05.079> then<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.560> close<00:04:05.769> that<00:04:05.799> back<00:04:06.159> down<00:04:06.370> to

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
and then you close that back down to

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.850 
and then you close that back down to
lock<00:04:06.730> it<00:04:06.849> back<00:04:06.970> into<00:04:07.120> place<00:04:07.269> and<00:04:07.659> you<00:04:08.620> can't

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
lock it back into place and you can't

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.020 
lock it back into place and you can't
move<00:04:09.010> that<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:10.690> this<00:04:11.379> is<00:04:11.500> your<00:04:11.680> control<00:04:12.609> right

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
move that and this is your control right

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.229 
move that and this is your control right
here<00:04:13.650> all<00:04:14.650> this<00:04:14.920> is<00:04:15.099> just<00:04:15.129> decoration<00:04:16.000> this

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
here all this is just decoration this

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.719 
here all this is just decoration this
doesn't<00:04:16.600> do<00:04:16.660> anything<00:04:17.250> this<00:04:18.250> little<00:04:18.549> green

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
doesn't do anything this little green

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.849 
doesn't do anything this little green
light<00:04:19.030> here<00:04:19.299> shows<00:04:19.600> that<00:04:19.900> I<00:04:20.169> have<00:04:20.560> it<00:04:20.680> plugged

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
light here shows that I have it plugged

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:28.520 
light here shows that I have it plugged
in<00:04:23.160> and<00:04:24.449> this<00:04:25.449> is<00:04:25.630> your<00:04:26.280> big<00:04:27.280> control<00:04:27.729> here

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
in and this is your big control here

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.990 
in and this is your big control here
turn<00:04:29.530> it<00:04:29.560> this<00:04:29.800> way<00:04:29.860> to<00:04:30.100> move<00:04:30.520> forward<00:04:31.410> and

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
turn it this way to move forward and

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.400 
turn it this way to move forward and
then<00:04:34.000> you<00:04:34.210> can<00:04:34.449> turn<00:04:34.630> it<00:04:34.750> this<00:04:34.900> way<00:04:34.960> to<00:04:35.199> move

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
then you can turn it this way to move

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.250 
then you can turn it this way to move
back<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.970> further<00:04:40.389> you<00:04:40.630> turn<00:04:40.870> it<00:04:41.050> one<00:04:41.229> way

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
back and the further you turn it one way

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.140 
back and the further you turn it one way
or<00:04:41.410> the<00:04:41.590> other<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.919> faster<00:04:42.340> it<00:04:42.430> goes<00:04:42.460> of

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
or the other the faster it goes of

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:50.450 
or the other the faster it goes of
course<00:04:44.130> move<00:04:45.130> that<00:04:45.310> out<00:04:45.340> of<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.550> way<00:04:48.780> and

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
course move that out of the way and

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.129 
course move that out of the way and
these<00:04:51.460> sections<00:04:52.000> come<00:04:52.180> off<00:04:52.360> like<00:04:52.630> this<00:04:52.870> and

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
these sections come off like this and

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.460 
these sections come off like this and
see<00:04:53.949> that<00:04:54.130> little<00:04:54.220> hole<00:04:54.669> there<00:04:55.139> that's<00:04:56.139> where

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
see that little hole there that's where

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.060 
see that little hole there that's where

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.270 

and<00:06:16.400> the<00:06:17.400> sections<00:06:18.409> actually<00:06:19.409> connect<00:06:20.009> by<00:06:20.250> a

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280
