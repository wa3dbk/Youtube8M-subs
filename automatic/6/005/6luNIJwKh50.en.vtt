00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.670 
don't know what this is I would compare
this<00:00:51.980> to<00:00:52.310> when<00:00:53.090> a<00:00:53.450> grenade<00:00:53.840> goes<00:00:54.260> off<00:00:54.440> in<00:00:54.650> your

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
this to when a grenade goes off in your

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.310 
this to when a grenade goes off in your
ear<00:00:54.980> and<00:00:55.160> it's<00:00:55.970> a<00:00:56.120> deafening<00:00:56.570> sound<00:00:56.870> and<00:00:57.230> that

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
ear and it's a deafening sound and that

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.750 
ear and it's a deafening sound and that
could<00:00:57.470> have<00:00:57.559> something<00:00:57.770> to<00:00:57.950> do<00:00:58.190> with<00:00:58.640> the

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
could have something to do with the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.250 
could have something to do with the
post-traumatic<00:00:59.180> stress<00:00:59.690> disorder<00:00:59.900> that

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
post-traumatic stress disorder that

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.930 
post-traumatic stress disorder that
we're<00:01:00.410> talking<00:01:00.559> about<00:01:00.890> earlier<00:01:00.920> with<00:01:01.760> all

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
we're talking about earlier with all

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.299 
we're talking about earlier with all
these<00:01:02.059> x-rays<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:02.989> brain<00:01:03.530> scans<00:01:03.949> going

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
these x-rays and brain scans going

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.570 
these x-rays and brain scans going
across<00:01:04.550> the<00:01:04.850> screen<00:01:05.089> now<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.950> one<00:01:07.190> thing<00:01:07.520> that

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
across the screen now the one thing that

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.240 
across the screen now the one thing that
stood<00:01:07.970> out<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:08.210> me<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.690> the<00:01:09.440> coolest<00:01:09.950> thing

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
stood out to me and the coolest thing

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.030 
stood out to me and the coolest thing
about<00:01:10.460> this<00:01:10.970> one<00:01:11.180> I<00:01:11.210> think<00:01:11.390> is<00:01:11.780> that<00:01:12.410> if<00:01:12.649> you<00:01:12.800> go

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
about this one I think is that if you go

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.480 
about this one I think is that if you go
into<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.580> video<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.060> you<00:01:14.479> go<00:01:14.690> to<00:01:15.190> 224<00:01:16.190> so<00:01:16.430> two

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
into the video and you go to 224 so two

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.969 
into the video and you go to 224 so two
seconds<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:17.090> 24<00:01:17.420> milliseconds<00:01:18.080> we<00:01:18.590> are<00:01:18.800> gonna

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
seconds and 24 milliseconds we are gonna

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.219 
seconds and 24 milliseconds we are gonna
see<00:01:19.280> here<00:01:19.580> that<00:01:19.759> you<00:01:20.240> can<00:01:20.420> actually<00:01:20.720> see<00:01:20.990> a

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
see here that you can actually see a

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.260 
see here that you can actually see a
zombie<00:01:21.590> face<00:01:22.040> now<00:01:22.340> I<00:01:22.520> don't<00:01:22.850> know<00:01:22.970> about<00:01:23.119> you

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
zombie face now I don't know about you

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.480 
zombie face now I don't know about you
guys<00:01:23.630> but<00:01:23.690> this<00:01:24.590> definitely<00:01:25.009> definitely

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
guys but this definitely definitely

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.180 
guys but this definitely definitely
looks<00:01:25.910> like<00:01:26.119> a<00:01:26.240> zombie<00:01:26.300> head<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.200> me<00:01:27.380> I've

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
looks like a zombie head to me I've

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.770 
looks like a zombie head to me I've
watched<00:01:28.729> every<00:01:28.910> episode<00:01:29.119> of<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.660> walking

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
watched every episode of the walking

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.620 
watched every episode of the walking
dead<00:01:30.259> I've<00:01:30.800> been<00:01:31.040> playing<00:01:31.250> zombies<00:01:31.820> since<00:01:32.390> way

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
dead I've been playing zombies since way

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.020 
dead I've been playing zombies since way
back<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.170> let<00:01:33.350> me<00:01:33.440> tell<00:01:33.680> you<00:01:33.830> this<00:01:34.399> is<00:01:34.640> looking

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
back and let me tell you this is looking

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.450 
back and let me tell you this is looking
like<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.360> zombie<00:01:35.899> and<00:01:36.110> I<00:01:36.590> think<00:01:36.649> this<00:01:37.039> is<00:01:37.100> the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
like a zombie and I think this is the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.520 
like a zombie and I think this is the
initial<00:01:37.789> hint<00:01:38.330> that<00:01:38.570> they<00:01:38.720> were<00:01:38.780> going<00:01:39.050> for<00:01:39.170> in

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
initial hint that they were going for in

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.969 
initial hint that they were going for in
this<00:01:40.070> video<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:41.180> I<00:01:41.450> think<00:01:41.840> that<00:01:42.440> this<00:01:42.619> means

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
this video so I think that this means

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.820 
this video so I think that this means
that<00:01:43.270> next<00:01:44.270> call<00:01:44.600> of<00:01:44.630> duty<00:01:44.750> black<00:01:45.140> ops<00:01:45.440> sorry

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
that next call of duty black ops sorry

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.469 
that next call of duty black ops sorry
world<00:01:46.130> up<00:01:46.280> worth<00:01:46.430> to<00:01:46.760> whatever<00:01:47.119> it's<00:01:47.270> going<00:01:47.360> to

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
world up worth to whatever it's going to

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.649 
world up worth to whatever it's going to
be<00:01:47.570> zombies<00:01:48.409> is<00:01:48.619> confirmed<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.700> I<00:01:50.450> think

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
be zombies is confirmed and I think

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.899 
be zombies is confirmed and I think
that's<00:01:51.080> what<00:01:51.380> we<00:01:51.500> have<00:01:51.650> to<00:01:51.799> expect<00:01:52.250> but

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
that's what we have to expect but

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.730 
that's what we have to expect but
they're<00:01:53.330> they're<00:01:53.750> obviously<00:01:54.200> trying<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.530> hint

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
they're they're obviously trying to hint

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.520 
they're they're obviously trying to hint
it<00:01:54.890> in<00:01:55.040> here<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:55.880> again<00:01:56.270> here<00:01:56.780> is<00:01:56.960> this<00:01:57.229> same

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
it in here so again here is this same

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.190 
it in here so again here is this same
scene<00:01:57.979> of<00:01:58.250> this<00:01:58.460> soldier<00:01:58.970> walking<00:01:59.570> away<00:01:59.900> with

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
scene of this soldier walking away with

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.500 
scene of this soldier walking away with
his<00:02:00.350> troops<00:02:00.650> and<00:02:01.010> this<00:02:01.549> is<00:02:01.700> reoccurring<00:02:02.000> this

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
his troops and this is reoccurring this

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.660 
his troops and this is reoccurring this
has<00:02:02.659> got<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.869> be<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.680> third<00:02:03.979> or<00:02:04.220> fourth<00:02:04.580> time

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
has got to be the third or fourth time

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.640 
has got to be the third or fourth time
that<00:02:04.880> we've<00:02:05.270> actually<00:02:05.510> seen<00:02:05.930> this<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:06.380> this

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
that we've actually seen this so this

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.949 
that we've actually seen this so this
must<00:02:06.920> have<00:02:07.159> some<00:02:07.400> relevance<00:02:07.580> and<00:02:08.060> this<00:02:08.660> must

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
must have some relevance and this must

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.830 
must have some relevance and this must
be<00:02:09.110> somewhat<00:02:09.890> important<00:02:10.459> if<00:02:11.090> we<00:02:11.299> keep<00:02:11.480> seeing

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
be somewhat important if we keep seeing

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.080 
be somewhat important if we keep seeing
it<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.320> keeps<00:02:12.530> keeps<00:02:13.130> showing<00:02:13.519> up<00:02:13.640> so

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
it and it keeps keeps showing up so

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.400 
it and it keeps keeps showing up so
obviously<00:02:14.840> they're<00:02:15.019> trying<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.260> hit

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
obviously they're trying to hit

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.140 
obviously they're trying to hit
something<00:02:15.799> here<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.130> we'll<00:02:16.700> see<00:02:16.880> where<00:02:17.030> that

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
something here and we'll see where that

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.140 
something here and we'll see where that
leads<00:02:17.180> us<00:02:17.570> in<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.140> future<00:02:18.350> but<00:02:19.190> that's<00:02:19.850> enough

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
leads us in the future but that's enough

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.729 
leads us in the future but that's enough
for<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.660> first<00:02:20.870> video<00:02:21.049> that's<00:02:21.350> all<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.530> thought

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
for the first video that's all I thought

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.860 
for the first video that's all I thought
was<00:02:21.860> important<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.459> let's<00:02:23.180> move<00:02:23.329> on<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.690> the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
was important and let's move on to the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.560 
was important and let's move on to the
second<00:02:24.380> which<00:02:24.860> is<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.370> six<00:02:25.760> snapchat<00:02:26.360> video

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
second which is the six snapchat video

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.630 
second which is the six snapchat video
here<00:02:27.140> we<00:02:27.260> go

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.760 

so<00:02:31.640> here<00:02:31.970> we<00:02:32.120> go<00:02:32.150> again<00:02:32.510> with<00:02:33.020> these<00:02:33.320> crows

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
so here we go again with these crows

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.620 
so here we go again with these crows
these<00:02:34.130> birds<00:02:34.460> we<00:02:34.880> just<00:02:35.090> keep<00:02:35.210> seeing<00:02:35.480> them

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
these birds we just keep seeing them

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.240 
these birds we just keep seeing them
everywhere<00:02:35.900> they<00:02:36.050> don't<00:02:36.770> really<00:02:36.980> have<00:02:37.100> any

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
everywhere they don't really have any

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.650 
everywhere they don't really have any
relevance<00:02:37.520> to<00:02:37.730> us<00:02:37.910> yet<00:02:38.120> we<00:02:38.240> don't<00:02:38.390> know<00:02:38.540> what

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
relevance to us yet we don't know what

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.540 
relevance to us yet we don't know what
they<00:02:38.810> mean<00:02:39.020> I<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.590> mean<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.160> haven't<00:02:40.430> seen

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
they mean I I mean I haven't seen

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.040 
they mean I I mean I haven't seen
anything<00:02:40.820> on<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.720> doesn't<00:02:41.960> really

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
anything on it and it doesn't really

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.410 
anything on it and it doesn't really
make<00:02:42.200> any<00:02:42.260> sense<00:02:42.650> but<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.490> main<00:02:43.790> focus<00:02:43.820> for

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
make any sense but the main focus for

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.080 
make any sense but the main focus for
this<00:02:44.750> video<00:02:45.110> is<00:02:45.350> going<00:02:45.740> to<00:02:46.070> be<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.550> wolf<00:02:46.790> now<00:02:47.060> I

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
this video is going to be the wolf now I

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.060 
this video is going to be the wolf now I
haven't<00:02:47.570> seen<00:02:47.720> anyone<00:02:48.020> do<00:02:48.290> this<00:02:48.320> as<00:02:48.620> well<00:02:48.650> and

haven't seen anyone do this as well and
I<00:02:49.460> believe<00:02:49.520> this<00:02:50.180> is<00:02:50.360> going<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.810> be<00:02:50.990> the<00:02:51.710> call

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
I believe this is going to be the call

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.420 
I believe this is going to be the call

not important russian soviet killing

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.080 
not important russian soviet killing
children<00:03:26.570> so<00:03:27.110> this<00:03:27.290> is<00:03:27.500> some<00:03:27.680> serious<00:03:28.090> serious

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090

children so this is some serious serious
stuff<00:03:29.660> and<00:03:29.960> i<00:03:30.440> think<00:03:30.950> that<00:03:31.100> would<00:03:31.220> just<00:03:31.250> be<00:03:31.460> the

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
stuff and i think that would just be the

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.910 
stuff and i think that would just be the
coolest<00:03:32.000> thing<00:03:32.330> ever<00:03:32.510> if<00:03:32.840> they<00:03:33.410> threw<00:03:33.740> this

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
coolest thing ever if they threw this

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.040 
coolest thing ever if they threw this
their<00:03:34.250> version<00:03:34.700> of<00:03:34.880> wolves<00:03:35.330> and<00:03:35.450> dogs<00:03:35.630> in

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
their version of wolves and dogs in

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.650 
their version of wolves and dogs in
World<00:03:36.410> War<00:03:36.500> two<00:03:36.680> into<00:03:37.310> this<00:03:37.460> and<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:38.450> would

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
World War two into this and it would

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.630 
World War two into this and it would
really<00:03:39.050> create<00:03:39.530> some<00:03:39.800> hype<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:40.280> that<00:03:40.460> would

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
really create some hype and that would

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.460 
really create some hype and that would
be<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:41.090> would<00:03:41.450> be<00:03:41.660> really<00:03:41.840> cool<00:03:41.930> that<00:03:42.380> would
