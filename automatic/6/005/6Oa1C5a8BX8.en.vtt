and<00:00:40.590> white<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.430> according<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.210> Michael

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
three primary colors you can actually

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.979

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.740

color<00:00:49.350> primer<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.010> for<00:00:50.190> example<00:00:50.730> with<00:00:51.570> our

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
color primer so for example with our

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.470 
color primer so for example with our
yellow<00:00:52.020> here<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.649> warm<00:00:53.039> yellow<00:00:53.309> will<00:00:53.969> have<00:00:54.149> more

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
yellow here a warm yellow will have more

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.319 
yellow here a warm yellow will have more
red<00:00:54.840> pigment<00:00:55.800> Emma<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.430> cool<00:00:56.670> yellow<00:00:56.940> will

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
red pigment Emma and a cool yellow will

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.590 
red pigment Emma and a cool yellow will
have<00:00:57.510> more<00:00:57.930> blue<00:00:58.199> pigment<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.789> now

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
have more blue pigment in it in it now

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.540

in<00:01:00.780> airbrushing<00:01:01.469> you'll<00:01:01.620> also<00:01:01.890> come<00:01:02.340> across

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
in airbrushing you'll also come across

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.050 
in airbrushing you'll also come across
two<00:01:03.300> different<00:01:03.690> types<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.199> paints

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060
