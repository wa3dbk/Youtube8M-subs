00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.230
 Dobermans often appear on the streets 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.940
 Now they understand that they are mistaken because 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.410
 what especially this shield gives it 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.119

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.280
 black dog children's videos 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.960
 if on the steering wheel is very difficult to remember 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.180
 labels say easier wears what we 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.760
 handle all the legs on altogether 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.530
 translated from Arabic, this name began 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.870
 mono 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:49.530
 but a big diamond broke black hi 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.820
 circle yaroslavl cold before but what am i 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.640
 still would say that they 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.610
 really reproduce as it were 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.640
 similar to the evil ones in fact 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.640
 what they type is they are German 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.210
 films about the war that perform the role 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.930
 such things and and delaying dogs 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.820
 terrible dogs 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.060
 that's how i'm not really ok thanks 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.940
 dive well really hardly any 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.180
 dog breed did not apply only 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:25.090
 rumors and incorrect rumors as 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:27.430
 doberman not people at all very much 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.310
 they talk about these dogs alone 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.220
 admire others 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.320
 afraid to force certain reasons 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.250
 but indifferent, this dog does not leave 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.840
 no one and in general I want to say that here 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.729
 some kind of negative such opinion in 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.140
 mostly spread by people who are about 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.360
 these dogs generally have no 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.810
 representations are not stronger but yours 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.160
 the dog is not at all small 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.280
 I think the size of the gate was good 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.470
 i'm so yes but she has her temper 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.420
 him that is not white temple 9 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.390
 It seems to me among the 100 of what the links 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:06.700
 good to do away because making ear in the winter 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:09.340
 many walks guns thin turns 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.480
 and very often it happens in general with us 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.510
 home g2 doberman and three children and how 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.950
 very calm at home very 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.650
 cheerful here two dobermans 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.630
 three children up to this space here 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.220
 enough for children to mine Dobermans 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.250
 so that they have a stable psyche because 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.970
 you know so again that is all the same it 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.220
 for dog for not space for 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.280
 good courtyard rooms after all outside 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.410
 Be sure to remember the 3 Dobermans alive 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.050
 artery show in the four-room but you 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.540
 know our apartments 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.670
 people are already big that's it 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.450
 Basically they are friendly and they can 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.820
 calmly communicate with the child and of course 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.340
 Other allowed animals if someone 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.200
 someone else and start there we have in 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.190
 german and who live out of cats with 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.890
 bird menu 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.840
 everything is all right all right dogs 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.450
 importantly should have a normal 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.160
 adequate psyche and then everything will be 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.230
 ok i think that depends on 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.240
 how master is configured how will he be 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.010
 brought up by a visa I can because of them 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.190
 you can really do very 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.840
 vicious that dogs are like children for sure 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.210
 sketches the image of his master and 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.520
 his master's behavior and his are good at 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.960
 relationship from the world but still there are rocks 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.210
 as they say rottweiler is one of these 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.080
 rocks which for the most part recognize 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.700
 these dogs are not the same owner 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.130
 their hunting dogs stupidly garnet 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.980
 master confide they also recognize 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.080
 one host eyebrow indus in general yes it is 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.540
 the dog is more likely one owner that is, he 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.180
 and she performs the rest on him in 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.459
 Mexico attention x 40 influence well you 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.580
 you know here it is not for doberman 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.200
 now you donâ€™t need to agree 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.209
 need a little bit wrong it need 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.890
 interest 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.980
 here he needs to set the task to solve 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.200
 smart and he likes to solve problems himself 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.520
 no swords special approach run any 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.870
 the dog needs a special approach 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.770
 because all breed is different and 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.300
 were derived for different purposes this is for 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.930
 what purpose was the breed of them we 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.310
 read 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.709
 that the Germans brought them in Prussia to 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.060
 Cossacks of our fear and dry pack 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.350
 meme surprisingly there is such a counter 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.020
 vacantly wrote newspapers 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.020
 but the Cossacks were already scared when the breed 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.820
 it was already formed at all the breed was 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.940
 established at the end of the nineteenth century they 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.230
 and without created two carries yes yes and 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.300
 founder of the breed Friedrich Louis Doberman 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.680
 he was a tax collector already lived 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.400
 small provincial town 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.169
 about aldo and 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.270
 how grandson by nature 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.639
 often had a large amount of money with him 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:48.660
 and here he thought about creating a dog 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:52.389
 that could until drop it is not insulting that 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.520
 certainly the main goal was originally 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:58.389
 Now create just such a dog to 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.039
 she's terrified of some kind of nose wound up with 400 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.520
 dog breeds that exist in the world 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.620
 at all 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.610
 Doberman is the only breed that 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.820
 created specifically for the purpose of protection 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.660
 man they are but here you live in the house she 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.880
 fine 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.130
 Guards know naturally dog 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.860
 necessary needs study not too 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.810
 annoying let him need 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.240
 naturally in learning mana and train 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.840
 we train to protect necessarily and 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.600
 we train 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.360
 different protection options for home security 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.550
 host security protection with an example I 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.580
 the dog is being studied separately by the child 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.800
 protection usually resources than before 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:36.009
 states to make a dog in any situation 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.479
 and ragged walks plays unexpectedly 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.639
 she is ready at any moment 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.620
 interrupt all your business and start 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.570
 guard the owner ie on any 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.889
 unexpected so he is naturally guard 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:52.770
 their housing and so for doubt and their 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.770
 it's hard to feed such big ones 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:59.740
 well of course i think what is the point of feeding 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.870
 his cereal is not present therefore dry food is very 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.270
 convenient and for the owner no difficulties 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.520
 don't provide quietly fed times 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.889
 a day and everything means a black diamond 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.710
 Janowski is not so disgusting between 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:14.020
 than too large though i thought that how 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:17.349
 Of course the females of this large seen on 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.750
 small but it is small so graceful 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:20.530
 know about a man why do they stop their tails 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.460
 and 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:26.470
 many already water why is it done well you 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.300
 you know how not we created the breed not 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.759
 we wrote the standard 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.349
 it is considered that it follows the standard he 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:34.180
 so necessary even now double 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:36.190
 standard can not stop no tails 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.919
 not really that is it already now at will 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.289
 yes yes but it was very nice 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.949
 to meet us all the same for myself 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:45.370
 have opened 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:47.470
 that very strong lick not fit and 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.090
 benevolent were covered and they are not 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.090
 we were in the studio to thank you 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:54.129
