Jojo<00:01:10.650> Mayer<00:01:10.799> based<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.369> as<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:12.229> know<00:01:13.400> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
Jojo Mayer based this on as you know and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.030 
Jojo Mayer based this on as you know and
so<00:01:15.299> anyway<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:16.350> can<00:01:16.380> see<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> hammering<00:01:16.950> on

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
so anyway you can see the hammering on

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.810 
so anyway you can see the hammering on
here<00:01:17.250> as<00:01:17.369> well<00:01:17.750> it's<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:19.170> ax<00:01:19.920> obviously<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.640> is

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
here as well it's a ax obviously this is

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.969 
here as well it's a ax obviously this is
not<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.299> hand<00:01:21.509> hammered<00:01:21.810> cymbal<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.860> keeps

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
not the hand hammered cymbal so it keeps

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.740 
not the hand hammered cymbal so it keeps
the<00:01:23.130> price<00:01:23.369> down<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> lot<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.270> mean<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.540> was

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the price down a lot I mean this was

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.240 
the price down a lot I mean this was
ridiculously<00:01:25.439> cheap<00:01:25.680> compared<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.100> what<00:01:26.220> I

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
ridiculously cheap compared to what I

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.640 
ridiculously cheap compared to what I
thought<00:01:26.430> about<00:01:26.610> getting<00:01:27.090> us<00:01:27.380> looking<00:01:28.380> at<00:01:28.500> it

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
thought about getting us looking at it

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.980 
thought about getting us looking at it
last<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.280> end<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.520> 2010<00:01:30.240> when<00:01:30.450> all<00:01:30.810> the

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.520 
different sticker types obviously isn't
a<00:05:39.040> hand-hammered<00:05:39.370> symbol<00:05:40.080> but<00:05:41.080> they<00:05:41.380> are

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
a hand-hammered symbol but they are

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.010 
a hand-hammered symbol but they are

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
still very individual each one obviously

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.960 
still very individual each one obviously
because<00:05:44.350> there's<00:05:44.620> such<00:05:44.770> hard<00:05:45.400> symbols<00:05:45.850> to
