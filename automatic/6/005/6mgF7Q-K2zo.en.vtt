00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.730
 Bernardo 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:13.939
 we'll see how it works 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.949
 360 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.869
 movement 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.349
 as well as books 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:24.749
 remember the joystick 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:27.749
 and it's not in Moscow 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.170
 this book 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.390
 two lanes are necessary from them 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.010
 someone can open 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.010
 any support us 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.730
 let's get a look 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.730
 for example kaladze format 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.770
 now see 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.770
 how to open in buffalo 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.470
 that is, ordinary 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.090
 as we see it happens the other way around 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.380
 good evening 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.380
 threw in parliament 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.240
 author of the article 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.280
 Now let's see how 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.179
 this reader 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.509
 there will be handed over to parliament 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.509
 like that very place of all 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:17.649
 what it looks like 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:21.009
 on the pages 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.009
 is impossible 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:29.539
 can increase 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.849
 asmus chart 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.659
 volume of purchases 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.819
 it happens faster than 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:05.669
 a little worse 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.829
 not seen yet 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.929
 but shot 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:15.319
 are opening up 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.319
 machine text 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:32.039
 fish card reader 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:34.769
 built-in gps 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.049
 was automatically turn over 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.049
 Images 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:43.339
 reading still 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:44.409
 Gongadze case 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.499
 pretty fast just like 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:48.909
 possibly 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.559
 still not capable 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:54.019
 some 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.019
 find in archives 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:01.779
 tons of journalists about development 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:04.779
 speed almost fires got older 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:06.619
 percent 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:09.619
 with 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.049
 staff of such files 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.109
 as for graphics 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.109
 several 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.849
 photos can be folded 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.300
 attempt to return the bank 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.180
 can make a badge 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.449
 per ton 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.309
 quite convenient barrier 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:48.309
 on which almost all the features 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:58.449
 quite clear 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.449
 pages with a leopard 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:06.919
 but so far the ship on which are indicated 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.159
 of works 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:13.159
 what did you manage to do 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.080
 Winnipeg chip 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.930
 stallone andrew could 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.740
 so it looks pretty 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.039
 not necessary 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.949
 price will be reduced 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.949
 at first 

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:03.619
 competitors 

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:06.409
 not only one 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:09.529
 surprise someone 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:11.439
 maybe vice premier 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:14.439
 three reads 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:30.039
 not forgotten 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:33.039
 but need 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:36.039
 but in Kiev 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:37.710
 applications 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.439
 how would you play 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:42.439
 all of us 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.840
 can be overclocked
