00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.326
 Welcome to the intensive course of the Druid Balance. 

00:00:10.694 --> 00:00:13.176
 In this video we will explain briefly 

00:00:13.336 --> 00:00:17.642
 what you have to do to play with the level 90 Balance druid. 

00:00:19.355 --> 00:00:22.959
 This branch has a unique resource called Balance energy. 

00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:27.119
 In combat, the balance beam will change automatically 

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:30.119
 from the mole, on the left, to the solar, on the right. 

00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:34.531
 The farther to the left you are, the greater the damage of the lunar spells 

00:00:34.691 --> 00:00:37.784
 and the more to the right, the greater the solar. 

00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:41.177
 Always start moving towards the lunar side 

00:00:41.337 --> 00:00:44.443
 and it stops in the middle when you are out of combat. 

00:00:45.535 --> 00:00:48.280
 Before fighting, transform yourself into moonkin 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.223
 and activate Mark of the wild. 

00:00:50.607 --> 00:00:54.620
 Then, launch Starfire, which will be your main spell 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.292
 with the balance beam in the moon phase. 

00:00:57.503 --> 00:01:01.831
 When it reaches Moon Summit, it will double the damage of Moonfire 

00:01:01.991 --> 00:01:04.155
 spell that inflicts damage over time. 

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:07.279
 Launch Moonfire as soon as you can. 

00:01:07.887 --> 00:01:10.387
 When entering the solar phase balance beam 

00:01:10.547 --> 00:01:12.807
 use Wrath instead of Starfire. 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.255
 You will see that Moonfire replaces Solar Fire in the action bar. 

00:01:17.648 --> 00:01:21.451
 Solar Fire damage also doubles during Solar Summit 

00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:23.739
 so do not throw it until then. 

00:01:25.416 --> 00:01:27.194
 Although that is the basic rotation 

00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:29.700
 Pay attention to another important spell: 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.360
 Surge of stars, as it inflicts a lot of damage 

00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:35.199
 And, in addition, when you throw it you will increase the damage 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:39.351
 of the 2 stellar fires and 3 following anger 

00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:41.811
 according to the phase of the balance beam. 

00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:46.195
 Try to launch Wave of stars just before a lunar or solar summit 

00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:49.079
 when Starfire and Anger inflict more damage. 

00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:52.784
 You can have up to 3 loads of stars surge. 

00:01:53.043 --> 00:01:57.407
 In addition, Moonfire and Sunfire can activate Shooting Stars 

00:01:57.695 --> 00:02:00.343
 which restarts a load automatically. 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.551
 If you get 3 charges, launch Wave of stars immediately 

00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:06.595
 although it is not the best moment. 

00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:10.551
 There is much to learn to master the druid 

00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:14.827
 but we hope we have helped you a little to move in the right direction. 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:19.130
 When you have an idea, you should study carefully 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.143
 the book of spells, talents and glyphs 

00:02:22.487 --> 00:02:25.367
 to see what we have not mentioned here. 

00:02:25.672 --> 00:02:28.538
 Thank you very much and see you in Draenor!
