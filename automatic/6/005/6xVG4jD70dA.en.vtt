the reason why is Dumanis the most
innovative<00:00:25.470> country<00:00:25.949> for<00:00:26.250> motorcycle<00:00:26.910> and

the motorcycle industry and I think it's

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.040 
the motorcycle industry and I think it's
the<00:00:29.400> best<00:00:29.519> place<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:30.509> come<00:00:30.689> with<00:00:30.869> new

the<00:01:28.050> noise<00:01:28.229> emission<00:01:28.830> because<00:01:29.390> in<00:01:30.390> very<00:01:30.720> let's

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the noise emission because in very let's

development process for both concerts is
a<00:01:45.880> tricky<00:01:46.270> one<00:01:46.420> because<00:01:46.570> especially<00:01:47.020> in<00:01:47.590> the

imagine<00:02:26.380> this<00:02:26.830> engine<00:02:27.250> is<00:02:27.520> on<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.820> peak

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
imagine this engine is on a peak

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.880 
imagine this engine is on a peak
performance<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:29.080> already<00:02:29.410> on<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.680> level

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
performance is already on the level

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.720 
performance is already on the level
about<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.640> 25<00:02:31.270> CC<00:02:31.720> two-stroke<00:02:32.260> engine<00:02:32.890> or<00:02:33.040> 50

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
about a 25 CC two-stroke engine or 50

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.050 
about a 25 CC two-stroke engine or 50
four-stroke<00:02:34.120> engines<00:02:34.450> up<00:02:34.630> it's<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:35.050> lot

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.710 

it<00:02:41.060> would<00:02:41.210> be<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.390> transmission<00:02:42.110> if<00:02:42.200> we

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
it would be a transmission if we

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.710 
it would be a transmission if we
filter<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.590> one<00:02:43.860> necessary<00:02:44.370> for<00:02:44.940> this

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
filter is one necessary for this

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.100 
filter is one necessary for this
application<00:02:45.930> definitely<00:02:46.890> we<00:02:47.100> don't<00:02:47.250> need<00:02:47.370> a

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
application definitely we don't need a

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.810 
application definitely we don't need a
transmission<00:02:49.110> whether<00:02:49.980> it's<00:02:50.610> that

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
transmission whether it's that

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.200 
transmission whether it's that
technically<00:02:51.510> possible<00:02:52.080> maybe<00:02:52.880> there<00:02:53.880> will<00:02:54.000> be

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
technically possible maybe there will be

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.900 
technically possible maybe there will be
different<00:02:54.860> variations<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.010> models<00:02:56.400> with<00:02:56.880> a

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
different variations and models with a

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.030 
different variations and models with a
electrode<00:02:57.840> lab<00:02:58.020> but<00:02:58.650> for<00:02:58.860> this<00:02:58.980> one

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
electrode lab but for this one

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.600 
electrode lab but for this one
definitely<00:02:59.490> will<00:02:59.970> need<00:03:00.270> one<00:03:00.510> it's<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.650> constant

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
definitely will need one it's a constant

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.630 
definitely will need one it's a constant
development<00:03:02.790> on<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.960> project<00:03:04.490> there<00:03:05.490> is<00:03:05.580> a

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
development on the project there is a

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.380 
development on the project there is a
huge<00:03:06.270> progress<00:03:06.920> almost<00:03:07.920> every<00:03:08.280> month<00:03:08.490> in<00:03:08.760> the

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
huge progress almost every month in the

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.840 
huge progress almost every month in the
battery<00:03:09.720> technology<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:10.800> as<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.520> can<00:03:11.640> see<00:03:11.820> a

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
battery technology so as you can see a

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.090 
battery technology so as you can see a
year<00:03:12.180> we<00:03:12.390> saved<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.870> certain<00:03:13.290> place<00:03:13.500> for<00:03:14.040> the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
year we saved a certain place for the

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.910 
year we saved a certain place for the
battery<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:15.080> this<00:03:16.080> place<00:03:16.320> will<00:03:16.530> always<00:03:16.650> be

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
battery and this place will always be

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.460 
battery and this place will always be
the<00:03:16.980> place<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.550> guess<00:03:17.970> in<00:03:18.330> two<00:03:18.480> years<00:03:18.660> time<00:03:18.900> with

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
the place I guess in two years time with

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.500 
the place I guess in two years time with
the<00:03:19.590> same<00:03:19.800> space<00:03:20.220> we<00:03:20.490> get<00:03:20.670> out<00:03:20.820> with<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.240> more

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
the same space we get out with a more

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.380 
the same space we get out with a more
power<00:03:21.750> from<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.350> battery<00:03:22.440> or<00:03:23.150> longer<00:03:24.150> range

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
power from the battery or longer range

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.490 
power from the battery or longer range
so<00:03:25.080> this<00:03:25.680> is<00:03:25.830> 1<00:03:26.070> this<00:03:26.610> is<00:03:27.360> one<00:03:27.540> issue<00:03:27.780> on<00:03:28.380> the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
so this is 1 this is one issue on the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.699 
so this is 1 this is one issue on the
other<00:03:28.620> hand<00:03:28.740> are<00:03:29.130> also<00:03:30.709> technical

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
other hand are also technical

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.100 
other hand are also technical
development<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.400> elec<00:03:32.640> rain<00:03:32.880> chances<00:03:33.270> maybe

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
development in elec rain chances maybe

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.180 
development in elec rain chances maybe
that<00:03:34.320> most<00:03:34.740> speeding

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
that most speeding

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.990 
that most speeding
fastest<00:03:37.120> development<00:03:38.010> in<00:03:39.010> a<00:03:39.460> moment<00:03:39.760> because

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
fastest development in a moment because

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.150 
fastest development in a moment because
it's<00:03:40.150> driven<00:03:40.420> by<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:41.110> whole<00:03:41.350> automotive

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
it's driven by the whole automotive

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.320 
it's driven by the whole automotive
industry<00:03:42.910> so<00:03:43.770> what's<00:03:44.770> coming<00:03:45.070> there<00:03:45.340> I<00:03:45.550> think

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
industry so what's coming there I think
