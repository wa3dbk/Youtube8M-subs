 Hello, guys, how are you? 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:23.280
 but I bring you a new video tutorial 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.470
 what is this tutorial is going to be extensive 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.770
 for windows 8 for the new 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.110
 microsoft platform after the 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.920
 joke tutorial is going to be how to put the 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.110
 icons the icons so that they are not 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.560
 stay like these 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.260
 but nothing more with enabling 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.350
 and to be able to with the rapier tension of 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.900
 wind we 're going to start on this already 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.440
 leave the files in the description 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.720
 and the by means of not working and good 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.660
 they will decompress and myths 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.270
 these are the icons to be able to rent 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.000
 the unzip them 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.480
 here everyone can see is coming out 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.840
 a new folder and here it is and 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.600
 we discover get off here there's another one that 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.340
 it's called little they decompress it 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.190
 it weighs nothing so well then let's go 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.830
 start let's say you want 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.540
 help something in the start bar that is the 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.190
 of this metro 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.320
 let's say they want to put the cici 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.720
 cleaner or anything that you 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.000
 want then let's put it with 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.690
 this front and clay is that I put it 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.140
 Yes Yes 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.140
 line 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.440
 the tic learning is for the name 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.200
 appear below the icons like this 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.509
 sky de firefox and all that if you want to 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.200
 they can remove it for high the pit lane 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.700
 so you do not have anything else to be 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.520
 the icon 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.490
 it is aesthetically after we look for the 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.020
 pipe farc program that this is going to be 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.689
 where 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.899
 where are you going to open the program let's say 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:08.080
 that I'm going to open the kid and I'm going 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.929
 to deliver to the start bar we look for the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.660
 file in program files or where 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.480
 do not have installed that we have it here 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.209
 we give to open and they will pay 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.540
 this after this we will seek 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.519
 tiple here here are these are the 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.310
 icons all icons can search 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.769
 I'm going to find it on its own, yes, here 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.230
 the party is going to open and ok 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.810
 after this from tyc the image go to 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.030
 copy this and they will paste it down 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.970
 although optional if they are not 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.630
 see boy that they have left so I do not know 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.020
 see them wrong 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.330
 they stay here they do not stick and with here that does not 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.800
 matter because the image of has 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.580
 background colors 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.010
 then they chose nothing more serious 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.830
 they chose only the bottomless icon 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.870
 that they would not serve 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.940
 and they should not use but in this 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.180
 there are the icons so I do not know 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.310
 even so this does not matter so much 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.220
 well then follow the type text color 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.120
 that this is the color of the text below 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.360
 each one besides seeing all I have it 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.950
 I choose white blank and after 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.820
 who have done all this are going to give 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.520
 tyler the creator click and they will 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:29.630
 leave ethics very inclusive because 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:33.310
 leganÃ©s and when I give xxi and as 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:37.430
 you can see the start appears here with the 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.709
 new icon as I already have it the 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.440
 facebook and so it's easy to be able to put 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.780
 all your applications here does not exist no 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.590
 I have it there are not so many and with the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:53.170
 congresses but they are enough for 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.170
 they are enough for well-known programs 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:01.379
 are and candles that are either the author or the 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:05.260
 google chrome product skyline 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:08.069
 seacleaner in photoshop and several more in 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.069
 9 makers 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:18.950
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.950
