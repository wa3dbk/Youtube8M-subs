they're<00:00:36.420> very<00:00:36.750> much<00:00:37.250> dry<00:00:38.250> they're<00:00:38.610> almost

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
you'll know what kind of the texture I'm

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.860 
you'll know what kind of the texture I'm
talking<00:01:01.590> about<00:01:02.329> obviously<00:01:03.329> my<00:01:03.449> second

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
talking about obviously my second

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.350 
talking about obviously my second
question<00:01:04.260> was<00:01:04.500> how<00:01:04.979> well<00:01:05.339> do<00:01:05.700> these<00:01:05.850> paints

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
question was how well do these paints

question was how well do these paints
dry<00:01:06.510> brush<00:01:07.760> since<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.030> new<00:01:09.119> silver<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.659> called

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
dry brush since the new silver is called

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.289 
dry brush since the new silver is called
nekron<00:01:10.350> compound<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.310> figure<00:01:11.820> they're<00:01:12.000> no

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
nekron compound I figure they're no

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.300 
nekron compound I figure they're no
better<00:01:12.450> modeled<00:01:12.869> test<00:01:13.110> out<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.830> Necron

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
better modeled test out and a Necron

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.230 
better modeled test out and a Necron
death<00:01:14.610> mark<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.310> opened<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> bottle<00:01:18.090> of

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
death mark so I opened up the bottle of

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.990 
death mark so I opened up the bottle of
Necron<00:01:18.659> compound<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.590> put<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.369> brush<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.820> as

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
Necron compound and put the brush in as

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.730 
Necron compound and put the brush in as
you<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.420> see<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.810> brush<00:01:22.020> basically<00:01:22.530> just

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
you can see the brush basically just

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.359 
you can see the brush basically just
kind<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.820> bounces<00:01:24.240> against<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> top<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.020> it

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
kind of bounces against the top of it

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.429 
kind of bounces against the top of it
and<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:27.060> really<00:01:27.119> chock<00:01:27.780> full<00:01:27.810> of

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
and it is just really chock full of

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.030 
and it is just really chock full of
pigment<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:30.049> fact<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.259> by<00:01:31.380> touching<00:01:31.680> my

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
pigment in fact just by touching my

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.130 
pigment in fact just by touching my
brush<00:01:32.280> against<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.729> paint<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.240> filled<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
brush against the paint it filled the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.780 
brush against the paint it filled the
brush<00:01:34.380> full<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.710> pigments<00:01:35.070> why<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.340> had<00:01:35.759> to

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
brush full of pigments why it had to

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.880 
brush full of pigments why it had to
literally<00:01:36.240> brush<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> lot<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.229> off<00:01:37.380> against

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
literally brush a lot of it off against

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.910 
literally brush a lot of it off against
a<00:01:37.950> paper<00:01:38.130> towel<00:01:39.229> however<00:01:40.229> once<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.650> started

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
a paper towel however once I started

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.429 
a paper towel however once I started
using<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.280> against<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.909> model<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.110> turned<00:01:43.350> out

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
using it against the model it turned out

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.819 
using it against the model it turned out
really<00:01:43.770> really<00:01:43.860> nicely<00:01:44.420> in<00:01:45.420> fact<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.079> might

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
really really nicely in fact I might

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.889 
really really nicely in fact I might
have<00:01:46.979> actually<00:01:47.100> used<00:01:47.700> too<00:01:47.970> much<00:01:48.119> pigment<00:01:48.450> when

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
have actually used too much pigment when

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.100 
have actually used too much pigment when
I<00:01:48.930> used<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.619> dry<00:01:49.829> brush<00:01:50.689> which<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.810> kind<00:01:52.049> of

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
I used the dry brush which I kind of

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.270 
I used the dry brush which I kind of
found<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.470> easy<00:01:52.649> with<00:01:52.860> these<00:01:52.979> new<00:01:53.130> pigments

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
found to be easy with these new pigments

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.670 
found to be easy with these new pigments
however<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:57.030> necron<00:01:57.360> compound<00:01:57.869> went<00:01:58.259> very

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
however the necron compound went very

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.999 
however the necron compound went very
easily<00:01:59.360> dry<00:02:00.360> brushed<00:02:00.630> over<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.259> entire<00:02:01.560> model

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
easily dry brushed over the entire model

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.160 
easily dry brushed over the entire model
it's<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.969> very<00:02:03.180> nice<00:02:03.390> bright<00:02:04.200> silver<00:02:04.680> color<00:02:04.890> and

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
it's a very nice bright silver color and

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.850 
it's a very nice bright silver color and
provided<00:02:07.190> some<00:02:08.690> like<00:02:09.690> detail<00:02:10.110> over<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.410> edges

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
provided some like detail over the edges

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:19.180 
provided some like detail over the edges
of<00:02:11.099> all<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.520> parts<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.300> neck<00:02:12.420> round<00:02:12.599> model

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.560 

and<00:02:20.190> here's<00:02:20.730> what<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:20.940> looked<00:02:21.120> like<00:02:21.300> when<00:02:21.510> it

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
and here's what it looked like when it

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.070 
and here's what it looked like when it
was<00:02:21.780> basically<00:02:22.880> just<00:02:23.880> finishing<00:02:24.480> up<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.990> you

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
was basically just finishing up and you

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.660 
was basically just finishing up and you
can<00:02:25.200> see<00:02:25.350> it's<00:02:25.470> much<00:02:25.740> lighter<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.280> has<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.430> lot

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
can see it's much lighter and has a lot

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.570 
can see it's much lighter and has a lot
more<00:02:26.700> edge<00:02:27.030> detail<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:28.140> all<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.890> metallic

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
more edge detail on all the metallic

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.480 
more edge detail on all the metallic
areas<00:02:29.940> thanks<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.630> this<00:02:30.720> new<00:02:30.780> dry<00:02:31.650> paint<00:02:34.430> so<00:02:35.430> to

test the new gold dry brush I use this
halberd<00:02:38.760> from<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.120> previous<00:02:39.600> reviews<00:02:40.430> as<00:02:42.380> you

halberd from the previous reviews as you

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.170 
halberd from the previous reviews as you
can<00:02:43.530> see<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:44.010> new<00:02:44.280> Griffin<00:02:44.640> gold<00:02:44.880> went<00:02:45.120> on

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
can see the new Griffin gold went on

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.480 
can see the new Griffin gold went on
very<00:02:45.810> easily<00:02:45.900> for<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.290> dry<00:02:46.500> brush<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:46.950> since

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
very easily for a dry brush and since

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.190 
very easily for a dry brush and since
it's<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.640> really<00:02:47.850> old<00:02:48.060> gold<00:02:48.540> color<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.080> really

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
it's a really old gold color it really

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.310 
it's a really old gold color it really
dulled<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.240> the<00:02:51.240> gold<00:02:51.510> down<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.110> made<00:02:52.230> it

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
dulled the the gold down and made it

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.700 
dulled the the gold down and made it
look<00:02:52.500> really<00:02:52.860> as<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.190> said<00:02:53.430> old<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:54.710> pretty

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
look really as I said old and pretty

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.560 
look really as I said old and pretty
dull<00:02:55.950> here's<00:02:56.790> what<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.030> looked<00:02:57.210> like<00:02:57.390> when

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
dull here's what it looked like when

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.540 
dull here's what it looked like when
after<00:02:57.930> just<00:02:58.230> doing<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.560> very<00:02:58.770> quick<00:02:58.860> dry<00:02:59.310> brush

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
after just doing a very quick dry brush

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.490 
after just doing a very quick dry brush
once<00:02:59.910> again<00:03:00.210> I<00:03:00.240> might<00:03:00.510> have<00:03:00.630> used<00:03:00.870> too<00:03:01.350> much

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
once again I might have used too much

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.390 
once again I might have used too much
pigment<00:03:02.010> which<00:03:03.500> knowing<00:03:04.500> this<00:03:04.680> using<00:03:05.130> next

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
pigment which knowing this using next

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.940 
pigment which knowing this using next
time<00:03:05.550> I<00:03:05.580> will<00:03:05.910> probably<00:03:06.540> make<00:03:07.440> sure<00:03:07.620> wipe<00:03:07.800> off

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
time I will probably make sure wipe off

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.550 
time I will probably make sure wipe off
as<00:03:08.100> much<00:03:08.220> as<00:03:08.280> possible

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
as much as possible

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.840 
as much as possible
finally<00:03:10.560> see<00:03:10.800> how<00:03:10.890> all<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.160> white<00:03:11.340> works<00:03:11.610> I

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
finally see how all the white works I

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.120 
finally see how all the white works I
figured<00:03:12.270> no<00:03:12.480> better<00:03:12.780> model<00:03:13.320> than<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> black

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
figured no better model than a black

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.690 
figured no better model than a black
primed<00:03:15.170> Tiernan<00:03:16.170> model<00:03:16.530> which<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.770> had<00:03:16.980> lying

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
primed Tiernan model which I had lying

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.590 
primed Tiernan model which I had lying
around<00:03:19.220> so<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.250> tried<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.820> see<00:03:20.970> how<00:03:21.180> what

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
around so I tried to see how what

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.870 
around so I tried to see how what
coverage<00:03:22.050> I<00:03:22.170> could<00:03:22.350> get<00:03:22.530> over<00:03:22.890> a<00:03:23.130> black<00:03:23.490> prime

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
coverage I could get over a black prime

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.370 
coverage I could get over a black prime
model<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.390> as<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.570> can<00:03:24.660> see<00:03:24.720> here<00:03:25.140> actually

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
model and as you can see here actually

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.730 
model and as you can see here actually
it<00:03:25.830> works<00:03:26.100> really<00:03:26.460> well<00:03:27.260> just<00:03:28.260> by<00:03:28.410> just

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
it works really well just by just

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.530 
it works really well just by just
dabbing<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.370> brush<00:03:29.550> a<00:03:29.580> little<00:03:29.700> bit<00:03:29.940> into<00:03:30.390> the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
dabbing the brush a little bit into the

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.530 
dabbing the brush a little bit into the
white<00:03:30.750> paint<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:32.430> dry<00:03:32.610> brushing<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.090> he

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
white paint and dry brushing it he

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.300 
white paint and dry brushing it he
actually<00:03:33.810> gave<00:03:33.900> great<00:03:34.350> coverage<00:03:34.740> and<00:03:34.980> brought

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
actually gave great coverage and brought

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.390 
actually gave great coverage and brought
out<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.460> lot<00:03:35.520> of<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.000> edge<00:03:36.150> details<00:03:36.780> on<00:03:37.200> all<00:03:38.040> of

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
out a lot of the edge details on all of

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:47.600 
out a lot of the edge details on all of
the<00:03:39.080> dry<00:03:40.080> brush<00:03:40.260> parts<00:03:45.590> so<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.650> summarize<00:03:47.160> I

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
the dry brush parts so to summarize I

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.220 
the dry brush parts so to summarize I
found<00:03:48.240> these<00:03:48.390> paints<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.900> be<00:03:48.990> very

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
found these paints to be very

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.690 
found these paints to be very
interesting<00:03:51.740> basically<00:03:52.740> these<00:03:53.070> paints<00:03:53.580> are

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
interesting basically these paints are

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.970 
interesting basically these paints are
just<00:03:53.910> packed<00:03:54.180> with<00:03:54.330> pigments<00:03:55.020> and<00:03:55.230> they

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
just packed with pigments and they

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.100 
just packed with pigments and they
actually<00:03:56.220> do<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.340> pretty<00:03:56.640> good<00:03:56.760> job<00:03:56.970> of<00:03:57.510> using

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
actually do a pretty good job of using

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
actually do a pretty good job of using
them<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:58.980> dry<00:03:59.220> brush<00:04:00.020> and<00:04:01.020> I<00:04:01.680> figured<00:04:01.980> these

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
them to dry brush and I figured these

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.680 
them to dry brush and I figured these
paints<00:04:02.520> will<00:04:02.670> only<00:04:02.820> be<00:04:03.060> used<00:04:03.300> for<00:04:03.390> dry

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
paints will only be used for dry

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.080 
paints will only be used for dry
brushing<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:04.290> not<00:04:04.470> much<00:04:04.710> else<00:04:05.010> since<00:04:05.640> it'd<00:04:05.910> be

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
brushing and not much else since it'd be

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.170 
brushing and not much else since it'd be
hard<00:04:06.360> to<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:08.040> water<00:04:08.280> them<00:04:08.550> down<00:04:08.760> in<00:04:09.030> their

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
hard to to water them down in their

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.500 
hard to to water them down in their
current<00:04:09.480> state<00:04:10.580> plus<00:04:11.580> they<00:04:11.760> come<00:04:11.940> in<00:04:12.090> a<00:04:12.120> bow<00:04:12.330> I

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
current state plus they come in a bow I

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.480 
current state plus they come in a bow I
think<00:04:12.690> 15<00:04:13.140> different<00:04:13.500> colors<00:04:13.800> which<00:04:14.040> is<00:04:14.070> cool

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
think 15 different colors which is cool

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.980 
think 15 different colors which is cool
and<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.910> variety<00:04:15.420> of<00:04:15.450> different<00:04:15.690> colors

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
and a variety of different colors

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.070 
and a variety of different colors
metallics<00:04:16.730> you<00:04:17.730> pastels

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
metallics you pastels

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.159 
metallics you pastels
purples<00:04:19.560> so<00:04:20.190> I<00:04:20.220> think<00:04:20.310> it's<00:04:20.459> pretty<00:04:20.640> cool<00:04:21.169> my

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
purples so I think it's pretty cool my

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.380 
purples so I think it's pretty cool my
biggest<00:04:22.740> concern<00:04:23.280> though<00:04:23.580> was<00:04:24.000> actually

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
biggest concern though was actually

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.390 
biggest concern though was actually
having<00:04:24.510> too<00:04:24.930> much<00:04:25.200> pigment

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
having too much pigment

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.640 
having too much pigment
my<00:04:26.520> brush<00:04:26.820> at<00:04:27.210> a<00:04:27.240> time<00:04:27.600> so<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:28.139> definitely

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
my brush at a time so I definitely

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.530 
my brush at a time so I definitely
recommend<00:04:28.860> other<00:04:29.130> people<00:04:29.400> be<00:04:29.639> very<00:04:29.910> careful

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
recommend other people be very careful

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.110 
recommend other people be very careful
and<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:31.229> get<00:04:31.350> off<00:04:31.470> as<00:04:31.620> much<00:04:31.770> as<00:04:32.160> possible<00:04:32.550> off

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
and to get off as much as possible off

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.700 
and to get off as much as possible off
your<00:04:33.600> brush<00:04:33.810> before<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.229> start<00:04:34.440> dry<00:04:34.620> brush

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
your brush before you start dry brush
