00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:38.506
I  just take the bike after four days without

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.620
It's just incredible

00:00:44.256 --> 00:00:47.096
In four days it's crazy it quickly loses its bearings

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.900
we take them anyway very quickly but it's all the same weird

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:57.360
in the first meters is WOW!
I wanted to do a wheelie in the first meters and ...

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.180
it reminded me immediately to order. I said no no wait a few km before making a wheelie

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.900
The head of the guy :D

00:01:27.844 --> 00:01:30.364
he thought, "but who is this crazy guy"

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.020
Oh fuck !

00:01:58.544 --> 00:02:00.544
I got flashed by a radar!

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.880
I spend every morning here yet

00:02:09.828 --> 00:02:11.828
it has a serious problem against

00:02:20.552 --> 00:02:22.552
did not you notice your car has a problem?

00:02:26.588 --> 00:02:34.608
okay this time I had gone to the left rather than the right that's why I've been flashed

00:02:34.913 --> 00:02:41.433
I got flashed in front of the bike so i don't give a shit because i don't have plate number in front of my bike (in France)

00:03:00.293 --> 00:03:02.293
The maturity is ageless

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:18.880
you have a guy next to me who is without equipment (he has 30-40 years old)

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:26.320
Simple shoes, simple pant, no gloves...

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.340
And on the other side there is one guy named "Kikaninac" (you can check his amazing YouTube channel)

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.720
He has 17 years old and he has fully equipment. Crazy isn't it ?

00:03:42.948 --> 00:03:51.088
There is also young people with scooters who have equipement.Respect to them.

00:03:56.862 --> 00:03:58.862
WHY, JUST WHY ?

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.820
I just wanted to say that maturity is ageless.

00:04:10.941 --> 00:04:15.821
Of course there is young people who don't have equipment at all but...

00:04:18.062 --> 00:04:20.062
What are you doing here ???

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.480
It might be tempting to double but here comes a car! I was sure of it !

00:04:40.706 --> 00:04:50.566
It there's just one rule: do not double in the intersections. It's stupid and maybe you already connnaissez but it can save your life ...

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:17.100
Here there is no risk except if the car put a huge swerve but I doubt ...

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.700
I'll tell you a little story that I had yesterday.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.840
I was at the bar quietly as non biker

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:48.400
I see three bikes with three stupid drivers who were going very fast and did wheelies in town.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.880
I sat on the board right there.

00:06:01.675 --> 00:06:26.395
And then of a sudden the guy returns to wheeling front of me and he literally loses its pot sliding several meters ... I was laughing.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:41.900
The guy had to feel so stupid. The karma is a rather violent way it was rather funny: D

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.260
He was there with his shirt to want to repair hand the hot exhaust ...

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:10.680
It annoys me when you leave the room for someone and it does not move ...

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.460
Dat filtering !

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.200
TEASING  NEXTVIDEO

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.960
FUCK FUCK FUCK
