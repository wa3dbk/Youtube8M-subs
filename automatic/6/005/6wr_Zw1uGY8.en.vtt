00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
this is a one-to-one model so this is

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.770 
this is a one-to-one model so this is
the<00:02:44.049> in<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.440> right<00:02:44.620> scale<00:02:45.099> it<00:02:45.880> belongs<00:02:46.540> to

the in the right scale it belongs to

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.319 
the in the right scale it belongs to
Switzerland<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:48.459> we<00:02:48.610> had<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.940> do<00:02:49.090> something

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
Switzerland so we had to do something

Switzerland so we had to do something
about<00:02:49.569> this<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.200> can't<00:02:50.410> have<00:02:50.440> Swiss<00:02:50.769> junk

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
about this you can't have Swiss junk

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.160 
about this you can't have Swiss junk
just<00:02:51.280> floating<00:02:51.700> around<00:02:51.760> in<00:02:51.940> space<00:02:52.060> no<00:02:52.450> that's

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.930 
six months we have a huge change in
speed<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.109> that's<00:03:59.859> how<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.310> mission<00:04:00.700> will<00:04:00.819> be

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
speed and that's how the mission will be

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.780 
speed and that's how the mission will be
done

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
done

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.190 
done
once<00:04:03.790> propelled<00:04:04.240> into<00:04:04.570> the<00:04:04.660> correct<00:04:04.930> orbit

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
once propelled into the correct orbit

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.260 
once propelled into the correct orbit
the<00:04:05.710> next<00:04:05.980> challenge<00:04:06.310> is<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.460> grab<00:04:06.820> the<00:04:07.060> space

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
the next challenge is to grab the space

the next challenge is to grab the space
junk<00:04:07.570> an<00:04:07.720> object<00:04:08.440> tumbling<00:04:08.920> around

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
junk an object tumbling around

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.340 
junk an object tumbling around
uncontrollably<00:04:09.940> without<00:04:10.630> creating<00:04:11.200> more

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
uncontrollably without creating more

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.650 
uncontrollably without creating more
debris<00:04:11.620> our<00:04:12.040> idea<00:04:12.970> is<00:04:13.210> to<00:04:13.240> use<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.480> very

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
debris our idea is to use a very

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.030 
debris our idea is to use a very
compliant<00:04:14.110> system<00:04:14.530> can<00:04:14.680> I<00:04:14.740> think<00:04:14.800> of<00:04:14.920> an

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
compliant system can I think of an

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.770 
compliant system can I think of an
octopus<00:04:15.430> arm<00:04:15.610> an<00:04:15.760> octopus<00:04:16.090> arm<00:04:16.240> is<00:04:16.360> very<00:04:16.450> soft

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
octopus arm an octopus arm is very soft

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.840 
octopus arm an octopus arm is very soft
but<00:04:17.410> it<00:04:17.530> can<00:04:17.650> grab<00:04:17.860> any<00:04:18.100> strange<00:04:18.430> shape<00:04:18.670> and

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
but it can grab any strange shape and

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.610 
but it can grab any strange shape and
wrap<00:04:18.970> around<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.420> and<00:04:19.510> hold<00:04:19.660> it<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:19.930> we'll

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
wrap around it and hold it and we'll

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.800 
wrap around it and hold it and we'll
have<00:04:20.739> a<00:04:20.770> grabber<00:04:21.070> that<00:04:21.370> looks<00:04:21.550> in<00:04:21.850> a<00:04:21.910> very<00:04:22.090> that

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
have a grabber that looks in a very that

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.670 
have a grabber that looks in a very that
the<00:04:22.900> real<00:04:23.020> one<00:04:23.170> will<00:04:23.290> be<00:04:23.380> more<00:04:23.500> sophisticated

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
the real one will be more sophisticated

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.080 
the real one will be more sophisticated
but<00:04:24.250> looks<00:04:24.400> like<00:04:24.520> this<00:04:24.670> so<00:04:24.760> it's<00:04:24.850> basically

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
but looks like this so it's basically

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.080 
but looks like this so it's basically
very<00:04:25.300> very<00:04:25.480> soft<00:04:26.190> elastomer<00:04:27.190> I'll<00:04:27.730> turn<00:04:27.940> it<00:04:28.030> on

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
very very soft elastomer I'll turn it on

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.610 
very very soft elastomer I'll turn it on
in<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.270> minute<00:04:28.360> you<00:04:28.540> can<00:04:28.660> see<00:04:28.780> how<00:04:28.900> how<00:04:29.080> soft<00:04:29.350> is

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
in a minute you can see how how soft is

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.170 
in a minute you can see how how soft is
and<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.190> idea<00:04:30.370> is<00:04:30.430> this<00:04:30.520> will<00:04:30.580> be<00:04:30.790> rolled<00:04:31.030> up

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
and the idea is this will be rolled up

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.360 
and the idea is this will be rolled up
so<00:04:32.050> it<00:04:32.140> doesn't<00:04:32.350> take<00:04:32.410> a<00:04:32.470> much<00:04:32.620> room<00:04:32.830> you<00:04:33.250> get

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
so it doesn't take a much room you get

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.950 
so it doesn't take a much room you get
in<00:04:33.430> to<00:04:33.550> spend<00:04:33.730> we'll<00:04:33.940> have<00:04:34.030> ten<00:04:34.210> of<00:04:34.300> these<00:04:34.390> in<00:04:34.690> a

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
in to spend we'll have ten of these in a

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.900 
in to spend we'll have ten of these in a
series<00:04:35.290> get<00:04:35.800> into<00:04:35.950> space<00:04:36.100> you<00:04:36.250> unroll<00:04:36.520> it<00:04:36.580> and

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
series get into space you unroll it and

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.000 
series get into space you unroll it and
then<00:04:37.450> these<00:04:37.840> things<00:04:38.110> can<00:04:38.260> open<00:04:38.590> when<00:04:38.770> you<00:04:38.860> turn

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
then these things can open when you turn

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.740 
then these things can open when you turn
a<00:04:39.040> voltage<00:04:39.370> on<00:04:39.490> you're<00:04:40.000> able<00:04:40.240> to<00:04:40.300> open<00:04:40.630> this

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
a voltage on you're able to open this

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.210 
a voltage on you're able to open this
and<00:04:41.020> you<00:04:41.200> turn<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:41.440> voltage<00:04:41.530> off<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.100> it

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
and you turn the voltage off and it

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.820 
and you turn the voltage off and it
wraps<00:04:42.490> around<00:04:42.640> and<00:04:43.060> it<00:04:43.240> holds<00:04:43.480> the<00:04:44.380> satellite

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
wraps around and it holds the satellite

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.440 
wraps around and it holds the satellite
is<00:04:45.100> this<00:04:45.340> gonna<00:04:45.460> be<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:45.670> little<00:04:45.940> bit<00:04:46.030> like<00:04:46.210> those

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
is this gonna be a little bit like those

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.240 
is this gonna be a little bit like those
games<00:04:46.810> where<00:04:47.170> you're<00:04:47.260> trying<00:04:47.500> to<00:04:47.650> pick<00:04:48.010> up<00:04:48.040> a

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
stuffed toy on the arcade and drop it

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.780 
stuffed toy on the arcade and drop it
somewhere<00:04:51.750> is<00:04:52.750> it<00:04:52.870> gonna<00:04:52.990> be<00:04:53.080> like<00:04:53.290> that

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
somewhere is it gonna be like that

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.010 
somewhere is it gonna be like that
essentially<00:04:54.790> yes<00:04:55.000> those<00:04:55.210> games<00:04:55.510> those<00:04:55.810> games

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
gone up and grabbed a piece of space

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.360 
gone up and grabbed a piece of space
chunk<00:05:10.630> and<00:05:10.960> gotten<00:05:11.290> rid<00:05:11.380> of<00:05:11.500> it<00:05:11.620> to<00:05:12.040> my
