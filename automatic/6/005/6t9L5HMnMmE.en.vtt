quick moment to introduce you to a new
feature<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.550> we're<00:00:17.700> rolling<00:00:17.940> out<00:00:18.030> in<00:00:18.120> our

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
feature that we're rolling out in our

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.850 
feature that we're rolling out in our
next<00:00:18.330> firmware<00:00:18.750> builds<00:00:19.050> this<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.619> called

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
next firmware builds this is called

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.010 
next firmware builds this is called
independent<00:00:20.190> display<00:00:20.880> LUT<00:00:21.210> now<00:00:21.660> basically

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
independent display LUT now basically

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.990 
independent display LUT now basically
what<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.170> does<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.770> allows<00:00:22.950> me<00:00:23.190> to<00:00:23.400> send<00:00:23.670> a

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
what that does is it allows me to send a

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.850 
what that does is it allows me to send a
different<00:00:24.240> lookup<00:00:24.630> table<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.380> each<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.740> my

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
different lookup table to each of my

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.220 
different lookup table to each of my
monitor<00:00:26.220> paths<00:00:26.490> simultaneously<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:28.050> for

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
monitor paths simultaneously so for

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.030 
monitor paths simultaneously so for
instance<00:00:28.620> I<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:29.220> send<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:30.110> graded<00:00:31.110> image<00:00:31.560> close

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
instance I can send a graded image close

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.250 
instance I can send a graded image close

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.709 
simultaneously sending a nice flat image
out<00:00:40.019> of<00:00:40.170> my<00:00:40.260> HDMI<00:00:40.949> port<00:00:41.339> which<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:42.300> could<00:00:42.510> be

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
out of my HDMI port which I could be

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.509 
out of my HDMI port which I could be
sending<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.379> an<00:00:43.469> external<00:00:43.859> recorder<00:00:44.039> let's

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
sending to an external recorder let's

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.759 
sending to an external recorder let's
say<00:00:44.699> of<00:00:45.449> course<00:00:45.749> I<00:00:45.929> could<00:00:46.140> do<00:00:46.260> either<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.530> those

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
say of course I could do either of those

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.729 
say of course I could do either of those
two<00:00:46.829> my<00:00:47.100> LCD<00:00:47.519> and<00:00:47.670> EVF<00:00:48.089> at<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> same<00:00:48.600> time<00:00:48.870> now

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
two my LCD and EVF at the same time now

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.950 
two my LCD and EVF at the same time now
that<00:00:49.920> flat<00:00:50.280> image<00:00:50.670> sending<00:00:51.089> out<00:00:51.239> could<00:00:51.569> be<00:00:51.600> of

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
that flat image sending out could be of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.689 
that flat image sending out could be of
course<00:00:52.230> read<00:00:52.530> log<00:00:52.710> film<00:00:53.039> but<00:00:53.339> what<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.550> can

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
course read log film but what you can

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.450 
course read log film but what you can
now<00:00:53.819> do<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.390> apply<00:00:54.809> an<00:00:55.019> asus<00:00:55.469> compatible<00:00:56.039> proxy

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
now do is apply an asus compatible proxy

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.669 
now do is apply an asus compatible proxy
as<00:00:56.550> well<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.059> if<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.749> do<00:00:57.899> send<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> Asus

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
as well and if you do send the Asus

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.130 
as well and if you do send the Asus
proxy<00:00:59.129> out<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.609> your<00:00:59.789> monitor<00:01:00.120> paths<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.960> art
