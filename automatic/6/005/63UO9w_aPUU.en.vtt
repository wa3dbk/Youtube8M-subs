00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.189
 imagine a classic situation 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.500
 unexpectedly appeared girlfriends or 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.890
 mother in law went for a cup of tea 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.300
 and treats only of a bar of chocolate 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.730
 because you want to surprise guests with something 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.990
 chic we will cook something not 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.869
 chocolate cupcakes 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.730
 boxing center 30 in okay this is very 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.100
 popular dish in all restaurants for 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.740
 this we need 120 grams 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.430
 unsalted butter we and board on 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.070
 water bath is placed in a bowl and there 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.350
 same put 170 grams of black chocolate so 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.559
 how this cupcake has chocolate flavor 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.479
 it is very important to choose the right chocolate 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.069
 warmed our butter and chocolate and 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:46.920
 while we will deal with you so that we 

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:48.780
 prepare the molds I will grease 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.729
 butter and you will sprinkle 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.489
 cocoa powder we usually lubricate 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:56.010
 molds flour but for logo cakes 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.679
 use ko-ko-ko-ko explain why 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.809
 because when we flip our cupcake 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.670
 back sides when we get it 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.569
 from the oven it will be ready if we 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.030
 sprinkle flour 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:08.580
 then he will be taken mini beautiful 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.390
 so I use here necessarily 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.340
 cocoa powder 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.470
 that is, the whole mold should be 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.930
 sprinkled cocoa from all sides and stenochka 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.840
 also so that the cupcake does not bother to exclude 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.190
 you are such a theory that chocolate we can 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.470
 consume and feel quite 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.290
 rich taste in the late afternoon since 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.300
 in our language are the receptors 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.250
 who are able to fully perceive 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.070
 taste of chocolate in the late afternoon 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.530
 now we take squirrels we put it in 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:40.740
 one capacity and yolk to another we are yolk 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.700
 combine with powdered sugar and here 65 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.220
 grams of powdered sugar and the usual hand 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.720
 use a mixer, beat them until smooth 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.720
 mass should be outdoors 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.950
 need to clear the yolks of the corolla and 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.830
 let's start beating 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.600
 proteins protein without sugar whip protein 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.130
 first whip without sugar and then put 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:19.250
 there one tablespoon of sugar is 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:21.020
 it takes some time squirrel we beat 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.550
 up here is such a thick foam so that 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.360
 he is tight 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:30.640
 lay in a spoon put here one dining room 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.640
 spoon of sugar and continue to beat 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.109
 what's important to know about chocolate when we 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.909
 drown in a water bath 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.040
 First you need to choose the right 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.230
 chocolate must be smooth chocolate 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.090
 make sure the shiny structure 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.209
 to the container that you put the chocolate 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.120
 she was clean even fat free I'd 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.859
 said it can make a lemon slice 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.530
 it is very important that moisture does not get here 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.879
 otherwise chocolate will crumple up and come in 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.920
 worthlessness cannot do anything out of it 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.950
 cook pretty quickly 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.750
 melted butter with chocolate 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.819
 It turned out as I understand very tasty 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.659
 homogeneous mass yes we need 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:27.510
 mixer again charter will add yolk right 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.819
 to warm up a lot of course whipped yolks 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.129
 powdered sugar send chocolate with 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.109
 butter can and pour very 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:37.370
 it's all connected it will be just 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.370
 much faster with a mixer 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.960
 as for proteins, we gently 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.270
 we enter the spoon in no case need 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.480
 use a mixer and still we need 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.190
 add here a little vanilla yes we are 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.100
 add here pure vanilla so 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.320
 it's about half a teaspoon 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.250
 we introduce here the protein mass neatly 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.400
 stirring so our cupcakes are good 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.220
 climbed 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.500
 it needs to be done very gently check 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.870
 so that there are no white lumps left 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.060
 otherwise the cupcake will not bake if you want 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.400
 cook cupcakes a little later or 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.740
 even tomorrow you can cover this 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.390
 capacity food film and send to 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.860
 fridge is the only thing that time 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.960
 baking you save it by one two 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.920
 minutes but we want to cook the body 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.230
 Likey quickly and today so we their 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.080

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.210
 will rise remember that they will not 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.960
 ran off in the oven you need to leave 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.820
 one quarter to the top but here 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.450
 such molds will be baked 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.790
 five minutes listen so fast and Mukimov 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.690

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.250
 whose advantage is not only his 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.930
 exquisite taste but also opportunity 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.270
 cook it very quickly 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.460
 our oven has heated up since time 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.650
 baking is limited and we'll get 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.590
 they need to be monitored at the same time 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.480
 so that all the cupcakes fit in the center 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.650

 that they need one or two minutes to rest 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:52.120
 because if we get them right away they 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:54.789
 our cupcakes can fall apart a little bit 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.710
