00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Translation: 

00:00:15.317 --> 00:00:16.368
 What is this? 

00:00:16.493 --> 00:00:19.411
 This is where you take the test in Julliard. This is the ceiling. 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.538
 I thought, if you look at it every night, 

00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:23.826
 ... when you're there, it's not scary. 

00:00:27.848 --> 00:00:29.463
 I told you you weren't local. 

00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:31.721
 Yeah, it's not local, Kim. 

00:00:31.918 --> 00:00:33.210
 Sometimes you meet someone. 

00:00:33.235 --> 00:00:35.576
 They are people who need to be in your life from the very beginning. 

00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:38.157
 This person was Adam. 

00:00:38.407 --> 00:00:40.615
 No one in Portland knew the band, 

00:00:40.823 --> 00:00:42.366
 ... someone who knew him. 

00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:43.268
 Who knows me? 

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:44.502
 Not much. 

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:46.912
 He shouldn't be afraid to hang out with these. They are people like us. 

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:48.549
 Exactly. 

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:49.691
 The man came! 

00:00:49.857 --> 00:00:51.524
 Be careful, please. The symphony building ... 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:52.793
 ... I heard there was an overly secluded place. 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.409
 Why do I get the feeling that this feeling is about to ruin my whole life? 

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:02.379
 You can't hide in the rehearsal room forever. 

00:01:02.504 --> 00:01:03.622
 It's too late. 

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:05.207
 I'il take you. 

00:01:06.923 --> 00:01:08.705
 At one time while your life is an ordinary thing .. 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.203
 isn't it amazing that it has become something else? 

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:12.756
 Like mine... 

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.300
 Like Adam and Mia who couldn't get the cello out of his head. 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.598
 And just like that ... 

00:01:24.386 --> 00:01:26.228
 Mom! Father! 

00:01:26.963 --> 00:01:27.729
 Father! 

00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:29.635
 I'm dead? 

00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:33.068
 It's a secret, baby. All of you are dying, too. 

00:01:33.576 --> 00:01:36.113
 If you're in any fight, you have to go down. 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.830
 Adapted from a highly acclaimed novel. 

00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:42.858
 When she wakes up, she'il be lonely. 

00:01:43.108 --> 00:01:44.183
 If he wakes up. 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.500
 If I could change this moment ... 

00:01:51.408 --> 00:01:52.629
 What should I do? 

00:01:53.296 --> 00:01:55.132
 Sometimes you make choices ... 

00:01:55.332 --> 00:01:57.432
 ... sometimes the choices make you the person you are. 

00:01:57.656 --> 00:01:59.051
 If he waits for me ... 

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:00.637
 Do you like me more like this? 

00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:03.807
 You're still the same to me. You were the person I loved yesterday, 

00:02:04.015 --> 00:02:06.101
 ... the one I love tomorrow. 

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:07.476
 If I wake up ... 

00:02:07.477 --> 00:02:09.079
 You still have a family, Mia. 

00:02:09.104 --> 00:02:10.504
 I can't lose him. 

00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:12.858
 Why me? 

00:02:14.058 --> 00:02:16.757
 Life is a big mess. 

00:02:17.946 --> 00:02:19.534
 This is his good side. 

00:02:22.045 --> 00:02:23.038
 I'm still here ... 

00:02:23.063 --> 00:02:24.697
 ... and I'm madly in love with you. 

00:02:25.328 --> 00:02:26.913
 Please, stay alive. 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.537
