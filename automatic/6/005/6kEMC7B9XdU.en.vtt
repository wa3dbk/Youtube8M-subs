opening<00:02:23.959> them<00:02:24.110> up<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:25.130> that<00:02:25.160> they<00:02:25.340> match<00:02:25.549> so

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
opening them up so that they match so

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:27.910 
opening them up so that they match so
that<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.510> have<00:02:26.690> like<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:26.900> mirror<00:02:27.380> effect<00:02:27.680> like

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
that you have like a mirror effect like

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.100 
that you have like a mirror effect like
about<00:02:28.160> butterfly<00:02:28.790> effect<00:02:29.150> but<00:02:29.720> it's<00:02:29.870> called<00:02:30.019> a

about butterfly effect but it's called a

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
about butterfly effect but it's called a
book<00:02:30.290> match<00:02:30.470> because<00:02:30.620> you're<00:02:30.799> basically

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
book match because you're basically

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.580 
book match because you're basically
opening<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.790> book<00:02:31.970> as<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:32.840> go<00:02:32.989> along<00:02:33.110> the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
opening a book as you go along the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.280 
opening a book as you go along the
craftsman<00:02:34.250> aligns<00:02:34.700> each<00:02:35.000> slice<00:02:35.360> of<00:02:35.599> veneer<00:02:36.049> so

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
craftsman aligns each slice of veneer so

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.460 
craftsman aligns each slice of veneer so
the<00:02:36.380> grain<00:02:36.709> matches<00:02:37.040> perfectly<00:02:38.170> if<00:02:39.170> anything

the grain matches perfectly if anything

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.980 
the grain matches perfectly if anything
is<00:02:39.739> slightly<00:02:40.040> out<00:02:40.720> we<00:02:41.720> will<00:02:41.870> overlap<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:42.470> so

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
is slightly out we will overlap it so

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.980 
is slightly out we will overlap it so
and<00:02:44.110> then<00:02:44.200> we<00:02:44.290> will<00:02:44.440> cut<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:45.120> using<00:02:46.120> scalpel

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
and then we will cut it using scalpel

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.400 
and then we will cut it using scalpel
and<00:02:47.320> a<00:02:47.440> straight<00:02:47.710> edge<00:02:49.110> now<00:02:50.110> as<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.260> can<00:02:50.350> see

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
and a straight edge now as you can see
