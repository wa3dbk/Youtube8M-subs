00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello people and welcome back to 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.799
 another episode let's play no me 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.019
 I'm getting to another episode 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.559
 gta4 mod conceptions 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.809
 yes I had the last one after all 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.180
 two times auto presentations themselves 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.369
 This time I have selected one for 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:28.230
 vote approved and won 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:34.440
 has the nissan skyline gt-r gt-r r34 2 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.690
 almost 2 furious film does not know yes 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.910
 few data to the normal variant the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.200
 should be a little bit different 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.920
 already in the nitro injection on the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.750
 passenger seat 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.600
 the normal version has one 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:53.250
 four- wheel drive 6 1 6 cylinder twinturbo 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:57.410
 motor 280 ps 0 to 100 in 5 7 seconds 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.230
 and 250 km h top speed 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.550
 that should be quite different 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.540
 most likely double each one 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.160
 no idea 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.700
 Anyway, we look at each other ten times 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.610
 closer to here we see the 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:17.710
 engine with a bit and nice 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:21.810
 texture because I have too much easy to 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:25.180
 once then you have it everywhere in front 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.870
 then sponsor the blinkers this 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:36.520
 light three technically there then in here 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:38.050
 very much outfit brakes figure me 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.780
 I have not seen the movie I have only 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.350
 a lot of seeing was definitely all 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.310
 funny racing seats and everything sees everything 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.920
 very nice 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.400
 a little monochrome textures off and on 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:56.290
 to have it here again 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.880
 whole sponsors so the whole line in 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.450
 This car fan installed this car 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:07.300
 the teaching luggage space were then because here 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.679
 again directly the hacker becomes and 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.010
 side indicators and then here again 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.790
 Dimitrov injection good to look good 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:21.130
 to see or brakes 5 julian fan and 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.470
 ok, okay, then I would say 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.220
 we drive a bit with the car 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.920
 I actually like it a lot 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.709
 I think he's just under 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.080
 usually blue light i know that 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:39.920
 I completely 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:43.630
 that's why we have 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.630
 there is just a little bit of fabric 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.069
 definitely the car pretty fast 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.890
 200 even on it 206 I think so 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.310
 the speed record I am 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.930
 By the way, again without a steering wheel there I am 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.230
 the game 19 had something in one 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.900
 why has even florida 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.540
 has placed the license plate and then has to 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.140
 one has since I see except the files 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.380
 for the steering wheel also deleted then I have to 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.880
 then get me again 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:28.900
 Why was I finally able to do a lot ? 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:30.850
 better 220 now the stunt private 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:38.610
 maybe I'll get to 230 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:41.200
 not one can definitely see completely 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.480
 ok, out now is not a super chic 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.480
 car but 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.260
 from the manufacturer I will 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.870
 probably also another thing 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.769
 show the fact that is pretty 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.870
 many battlefield 3 conversions so 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:07.129
 Battlefield 3 brought a lot 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:12.670
 models and yes there it is now here 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:12.670
 right then drive back nice long 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:22.290
 not against it but the rear with 210 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:30.990
 I took my time draws to continue 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:35.770
 when I know that the world is the 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:37.750
 belt car is noticed on cracks goes 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.039
 in itself relatively quickly broken okay 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.410
 now it did not break but mine 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:44.110
 as I just got through the traffic 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:49.289
 be driven what then quite 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.289
 quickly broken because this wrestled 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:03.070
 So already there is quite decent 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:04.930
 I actually fixed it again 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.470
 because always the other ramp there 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.470
 behind 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:23.740
 bremen speed up do that with 260 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:26.389
 well here against her so very much 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:30.439
 gross damage model here is in one 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:32.960
 against 100 not so much the of 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:35.720
 me was the car it comes again as 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:41.990
 last we accelerate once briefly 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:50.810
 the crash sgg the engine and already 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:53.260
 Burns then fixed what again so yes 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:56.650
 It will be as always in the description 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.650
 I would be 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:05.479
 similar in the description I please 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:07.490
 again to make suggestions 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:09.530
 will be in the week after next 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.990
 used so I always think so 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.460
 do 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.009
 Mondays on Wednesdays and Fridays and it 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.909
 there is always a video coming on Mondays 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:21.919
 car wednesday are weapons video and am 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:23.780
 friday comes a script motto or a 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.009
 Another motto is the taxi bug 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.120
 but because I do a little business 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.300
 installed but I do not think so 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.300
 bad 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.470
 yes and that means every two weeks 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:39.190
 come first wish of you 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.479
 So one for a family car 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.449
 selected the car and then next 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:45.819
 week again in the description 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:48.789
 exactly description along and then hope 

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:53.580
 I that you liked it and say, 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:53.580
 bye until next time
