and I hope this will work I don't know

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.160

if<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:32.650> can<00:01:32.800> spawn<00:01:33.040> so<00:01:33.970> many<00:01:34.150> of<00:01:34.330> them<00:01:34.540> at<00:01:35.050> the

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
if you can spawn so many of them at the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.500 
if you can spawn so many of them at the
same<00:01:35.200> time<00:01:35.530> I<00:01:35.800> just<00:01:36.310> need<00:01:36.730> to<00:01:36.760> be<00:01:36.970> careful<00:01:37.090> so

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
same time I just need to be careful so

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.230 
same time I just need to be careful so
I'm<00:01:37.570> not<00:01:38.110> losing<00:01:38.680> 10<00:01:39.400> and<00:01:39.760> down<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:40.030> ground

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.370 
because you might be spawn I think
that's<00:01:42.190> possible<00:01:42.750> should<00:01:43.750> actual<00:01:44.050> not<00:01:44.230> that

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
that's possible should actual not that
