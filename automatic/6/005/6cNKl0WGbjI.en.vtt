up<00:00:55.729> number<00:00:56.000> five<00:00:56.179> very<00:00:56.989> robust<00:00:57.500> bit<00:00:57.679> of<00:00:57.769> gear

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.700 

as<00:01:04.490> you<00:01:04.700> can<00:01:04.850> see<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.210> pedals<00:01:05.720> pushed<00:01:06.290> over<00:01:06.590> to

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
as you can see the pedals pushed over to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.810 
as you can see the pedals pushed over to
port<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:07.220> that's<00:01:07.340> because<00:01:07.610> it's<00:01:07.730> been

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
port and that's because it's been

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.420 
port and that's because it's been
twisted<00:01:08.270> by<00:01:08.300> the<00:01:08.450> wooden<00:01:09.020> vein<00:01:09.260> at<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.650> top<00:01:09.830> so

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
twisted by the wooden vein at the top so

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.490 
twisted by the wooden vein at the top so
basically<00:01:10.790> wind<00:01:10.970> blows<00:01:11.180> on<00:01:11.420> this<00:01:11.600> white<00:01:12.230> board

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
basically wind blows on this white board

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.170 
basically wind blows on this white board
that<00:01:12.680> you<00:01:12.770> can<00:01:12.800> see<00:01:13.070> here<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:13.550> that<00:01:13.790> movements

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
that you can see here and that movements

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.120 
that you can see here and that movements
transmitted<00:01:14.720> down<00:01:14.840> that<00:01:15.020> rod<00:01:15.230> and<00:01:15.830> onto<00:01:16.040> the

panel<00:01:16.370> which<00:01:16.520> twists<00:01:16.970> it<00:01:17.120> the<00:01:17.600> water<00:01:17.810> flow

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
panel which twists it the water flow

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.680 
panel which twists it the water flow
then<00:01:18.830> goes<00:01:19.250> past<00:01:19.550> the<00:01:19.700> pedal<00:01:20.030> forcing<00:01:20.600> it<00:01:20.660> to

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
then goes past the pedal forcing it to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.940 
then goes past the pedal forcing it to

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
wind comes around by 10 degrees then

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.650 
wind comes around by 10 degrees then
your<00:01:37.460> boat<00:01:37.610> will<00:01:37.700> come<00:01:37.850> around<00:01:38.000> by<00:01:38.180> 10<00:01:38.360> degrees

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
your boat will come around by 10 degrees
