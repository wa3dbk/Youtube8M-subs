00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
acceptable to us so I asked to speak

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.130 
acceptable to us so I asked to speak
with<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> supervisor<00:01:59.430> and<00:02:00.149> while<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.780> had<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
with a supervisor and while I had the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.660 
with a supervisor and while I had the
supervisor<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.829> phone<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.070> took<00:02:02.430> her

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
supervisor on the phone I took her

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.440 
supervisor on the phone I took her
through<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.270> same<00:02:03.659> process<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:05.119> guess<00:02:06.119> what

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
through this same process and guess what

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.440 
through this same process and guess what
they<00:02:07.489> they<00:02:08.489> showed<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:09.479> price

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
they they showed this price

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.420 
they they showed this price
again<00:02:11.640> for<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:13.150> cabin<00:02:13.900> for<00:02:14.110> four<00:02:14.410> so<00:02:15.130> they

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
again for a cabin for four so they

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.300 
again for a cabin for four so they
didn't<00:02:15.819> just<00:02:15.880> sell<00:02:16.450> out<00:02:16.720> this<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.800> clearly<00:02:18.160> a

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
didn't just sell out this is clearly a

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.620 
didn't just sell out this is clearly a
bait<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.000> switch<00:02:19.620> tactic
