00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:10.310
 good today I have here this juice that 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.310
 it really is not a cube it's a cylinder 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:17.260
 a kind of barrel barrel 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.260
 it is old 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:25.470
 I did not have it from many dreams really 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.470
 little has to do with the puzzles 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.040
 these we call as call cubes 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.160
 rubik since 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.560
 and that the pieces are spinning they turn it on 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.740
 the usual senses of the fingers 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:45.460
 three axes of space here the movement 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:47.890
 It consists of three three axes 3 layers 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.899
 that rotate within each of the 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.670
 layers so say some 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:57.320
 Sliding pieces 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:00.050
 then they are all free - a 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.270
 which is used to move them to 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.519
 mix it and to get the solution 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:12.590
 well then 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:14.719
 there are a lot of 336 rows with colors and 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.040
 the theme of the puzzle is you can put the 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:20.920
 sides 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.550
 the white is the one that is missing 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.410
 so 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.890
 this does not have any ministry of 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.890
 solution 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.430
 without any complications this puzzle 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.500
 you see now he's in the position of 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:45.530
 resolved 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:48.630
 1 2 3 4 5 with white 6 and the pieces 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.390
 of discouragement worse 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.880
 good the complication of this puzzle 6-0 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.140
 it can be solved intuitively 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.990
 and another author has no other reason to be 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.180
 that a question of 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.689
 of not throwing this cube I had it when 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.599
 it was small it was young and many 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.060
 that of these many puzzles in 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.500
 this time many puzzles with success 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.500
 from the rubik's cube 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.960
 Well, you can see it 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.170
 He came with some balls inside 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.050
 for 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.580
 so that we will go so horizontally so 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.560
 I gently remove them or because I do not 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.400
 I liked quite a lot 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.400
 windows chips 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.980
 these that slide in if you see a little 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.980
 a conviction 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:48.160
 OK 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:52.700
 to above also has no 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.720
 it has a mystery but good left 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.720
 it's curious 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.400
 It's old and I hope 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.500
 that you like and it's good for the 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.500
 collection come thank you
