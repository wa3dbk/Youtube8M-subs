00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:02.320
 and what is the impression that after 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.660
 of death 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.130
 in his estimation I have already spoken about death but 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.489
 very much so that communication 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:11.479
 calls and wondered what it is 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:13.779
 such that after death 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:15.119
 death 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.859
 on the one hand, this is some kind of such program 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:18.890
 in honor of 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.839
 whereby 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:22.569
 people as it was 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:24.800
 but generally develop live 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.339
 from the fact that there is no 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.339
 but when a person dies 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.149
 here is also a program that everything is very 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.600
 interconnected if passed away 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.960
 human 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.960
 this is exactly the life of the circumstances 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.840
 in this period of life, thinking about life 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.050
 something like that 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.350
 and therefore the same 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.440
 when a person dies paid this 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.650
 open there 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.020
 so he got there 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.000
 in fact, this is not just hit 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.090
 therefore need 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.370
 but this program has proved what to say 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.370
 the truth 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.730
 helpfulness 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.760
 you yourself may notice how once 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.220
 you have such a situation 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.990
 lost some close 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.400
 room and watch 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.420
 how they immediately go the way how the arrows translated 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.450
 it's not quite like that 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.910
 whereas programs are man in many ways 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.540
 match up 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.700
 for the year here 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.830
 new bodies 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.420
 usual further develop your soul 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.850
 Nothing more 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.850
 no remembers anything 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.590
 otherwise, no 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.750
 in fact 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.140
 You see, I think that you have the result 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.650
 each 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.470
 if you pay attention to it yes and 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.370
 in general, everything that I will tell you 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.890
 do you have any 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.970
 all the same there is all you can build 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.730
 speaking voter 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.340
 think more 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.290
 on matinees spinning 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.750
 here I am alive 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.920
 they know all over 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.869
 present day 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.949
 and people start 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.489
 and everything is spinning like 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.849
 new ones appeared 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.759
 something happened happened 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.299
 I did not pay attention to this hop 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:19.939
 pass they don't know have 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.029
 now they are again 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:22.049
 hares husband 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.819
 vice versa 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:24.969
 with kindness 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.829
 also now there are some people 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.629
 who treat me well thoughts 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.199
 have changed they are already starting he is not 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:32.129
 doubt though that you are nothing 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.529
 Does that he decided not to do 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.809
 they also appear leaving that between 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:38.299
 yourself think so 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:39.579
 there is someone here 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.379
 and one thing is very funny that 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.789
 so big and in my head a mess 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.429
 that they themselves and all of them 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:50.409
 this is the same thing as I was shooting 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.599
 the affairs of the hour man is twinning 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.299
 yesterday was a friend tomorrow 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.659
 stallone apparatus 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.790
 but here is no less diabetes and could not 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.500
 thin pillars relate though too 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.559
 did nothing and also show 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.089
 in fact it has him there in something 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:04.779
 life septum because she doesn't 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:05.339
 got up 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:07.519
 but time passes, he again stones exchange 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.349
 serve from 3 to osago and began to doubt 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.949
 then again runs again runs away 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:13.229
 axel debates 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:15.779
 and it happens even everywhere 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.209
 note 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.669
 and now we say park 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:22.449
 direction r my books how 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.109
 people who read my books people 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.979
 sort of read a book about God Alexander there 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.190
 thank you so much there is interesting 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.979
 saw there 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.829
 garlic and generally related to my life 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.249
 so on and so forth troops 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:36.379
 in his opinion 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:37.729
 Vologda Sasha 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:38.999
 I'm so you 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:41.149
 yesterday vases for a fight 

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:42.999
 seizure again the time is wrong and on top 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:44.749
 do not respond to surplus 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:46.039
 between the European Union 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:47.899
 process time there month 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:50.419
 on the development index i was wrong there then 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.600
 that's how I take my words back 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.319
 and again did not answer him 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.189
 because I didn't answer him again 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:58.279
 when you are not with me now as in the end 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:03:59.069
 bad 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.130
 dozens of people including buildings 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.019
 so here is the attitude of girls and everything 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.919
 the institute says something I donâ€™t like 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:10.089
 then something else that the examples of hiding the account 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:11.679
 since May all the pipes 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:14.419
 not waiting for the information why should I dig no 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:16.559
 everyone wants to define me like that 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:17.669
 me on dogs 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.180
 say I'm bad or good 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.639
 in fact I just sit down and eat 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.659
 and here is how you start everything 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.300
 also determined all around 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.020
 primate we now take what 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.090
 popular dish I do not know salad salad vinaigrette 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.310
 someone said that to him 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.270
 I like it bad someone said something 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.480
 that he did not see these good books as he was 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.770
 so this salad remained 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.610
 April 22nd shelf lighthouse and motivation and this 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.289
 the trend continued god 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:46.990
 speaking years ago 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.069
 no people will say it 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:50.659
 terrible someone says 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.550
 beautiful something else 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.539
 the truth is such a cube 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:58.460
 the more even if said about it 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.339
 much higher than this figure 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:03.339
 the bid will be there dad dad melt 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.550
 is this a normal time i 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.449
 by the way was also 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.050
 whether people were on it 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.279
 will be in prayer 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:12.169
 so there is a development there should 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.639
 be 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.199
 nor do they just have to control themselves 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.199
 so of course other departments 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.889
 and some feelings 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.340
 such things come from a cold I will say this 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.699
 I was not expecting 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.770
 what's so popular what is it 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.180
 madly 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.850
 about this talked about capacity 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.089
 found basic knowledge 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:41.089
 different numbers to different people 

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:43.150
 kill me 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.409
 almost poems lyrics 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:47.710
 this aggressive is the opposite 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.560
 I, too, so the world turns around 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.490
 me 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.589
 then first 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:53.509
 But there they did not admit 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:55.300
 composed 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.449
 a fan then they write that 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:01.240
 from the fact that I'm on the tech tech golden as 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.020
 He also lived with us his life 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.490
 own business 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.330
 well that's why it's all 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.590
 need to build your life think about yourself and 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.999
 develops 

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:11.270
 be interested in everything
