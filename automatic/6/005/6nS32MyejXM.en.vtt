00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.699
 we will begin to study technology with a fighting stance 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.040
 well-studied stance success in 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.410
 further work in the fighting stance need 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.390
 feel comfortable is the main thing legs 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.379
 placed slightly wider than shoulders and slightly 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.960
 bent at the knees 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.470
 the toe of the back foot is angled 45 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.589
 degrees 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.480
 front foot toe about 60 center 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:50.260
 gravity is distributed evenly on both 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.989
 legs and torso deployed at an angle 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.659
 about 45 degrees hands are relaxed and 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.550
 bent at the elbows covering the tank front 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.460
 arm just below the back head slightly 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.440
 tilted forward covering your throat having mastered 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.629
 start to work it out 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.149
 for all movements the center of gravity 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.039
 move parallel to the floor move 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.440
 gently keeping your feet off the floor 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.000
 front of the sole movement 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.940
 are particularly important in 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.860
 group battle I want to immediately note that 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.869
 racks we need to study and 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.479
 practicing techniques of strikes and various 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.399
 fighting techniques in the same position as a fighterâ€™s body 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.940
 moment of impact of principle is not 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.590
 It has 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.810
 the main thing is to be able to 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.630
 deliver effective hits and defend 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.789
 so all racks are conditional here yet 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.770
 it is important to understand that during the battle 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.810
 at the initiative interception stage 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.610
 immediately stand in the street 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.229
 can not be so how are you in advance 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.069
 warn your opponent 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.630
 intent expecting an attack follows 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.369
 stand free without tension and 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.590
 carefully observe the potential 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:55.060
 adversary in more detail about this we 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.220
 tell in the second movie pay 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.239
 focus on footwork when turning on 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.239
 180 degrees
