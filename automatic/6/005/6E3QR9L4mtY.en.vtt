mainly because I'll lose them knowing my

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.910 
mainly because I'll lose them knowing my
look<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.940> but<00:02:45.900> they<00:02:46.019> do<00:02:46.080> have<00:02:46.350> some<00:02:46.530> decent

the damage there in the core some nice
detail<00:02:55.230> on<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.500> wings<00:02:55.680> as<00:02:55.890> well<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:57.209> while

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
detail on the wings as well and while

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.150 
detail on the wings as well and while
we're<00:02:57.690> on<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.870> subject<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.500> wings<00:02:58.680> there

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
we're on the subject of the wings there

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.729 
we're on the subject of the wings there
can<00:02:59.430> be<00:02:59.459> positioned<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.720> because<00:03:01.620> obviously

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
can be positioned and because obviously

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.180 
can be positioned and because obviously
as<00:03:02.010> we<00:03:02.130> all<00:03:02.160> know<00:03:02.959> vulture<00:03:03.959> droids<00:03:04.080> not<00:03:05.010> only

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
as we all know vulture droids not only

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.890 
as we all know vulture droids not only
operate<00:03:05.519> as<00:03:05.640> fighters<00:03:06.120> but<00:03:06.510> they<00:03:06.569> also

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
operate as fighters but they also

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.380 
operate as fighters but they also
operate<00:03:07.200> as<00:03:07.560> walkers<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.670> basically<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.269> you

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
operate as walkers and basically it you

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.259 
operate as walkers and basically it you
just<00:03:09.630> pull<00:03:09.840> out<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.290> wings<00:03:11.130> on<00:03:11.790> either<00:03:11.940> side

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
just pull out the wings on either side

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.390 
just pull out the wings on either side
like<00:03:12.750> so<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:15.739> then<00:03:16.739> you<00:03:16.860> can<00:03:17.069> proceed<00:03:17.250> to

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
like so and then you can proceed to

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.840 
like so and then you can proceed to
swivel<00:03:17.730> them<00:03:17.910> around<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.930> close<00:03:19.140> them<00:03:19.380> and

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
swivel them around and close them and

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.479 
swivel them around and close them and
put<00:03:20.850> them<00:03:20.940> basically<00:03:21.450> in<00:03:21.920> any<00:03:22.920> position<00:03:23.459> that

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
put them basically in any position that

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.599 
put them basically in any position that
you<00:03:23.640> want<00:03:25.640> which<00:03:26.640> is<00:03:26.790> quite<00:03:27.060> cool<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:28.609> paired

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
you want which is quite cool and paired

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.240 
you want which is quite cool and paired
with<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.090> pop-up<00:03:30.420> head<00:03:30.769> this<00:03:31.769> really<00:03:32.100> does

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
with the pop-up head this really does

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.330 
with the pop-up head this really does
like<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:32.549> core<00:03:32.880> vehicle<00:03:33.299> in<00:03:33.840> walking<00:03:34.380> mode<00:03:34.620> and

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
like a core vehicle in walking mode and

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.819 
like a core vehicle in walking mode and
I<00:03:36.329> don't<00:03:36.390> currently<00:03:36.840> have<00:03:37.019> my<00:03:37.380> Clone<00:03:37.799> Wars

ultra dried out on display and but I

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.569 
ultra dried out on display and but I
might<00:03:40.380> display<00:03:40.739> both<00:03:40.890> of<00:03:41.100> them<00:03:41.250> now<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.400> I

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
might display both of them now that I

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.620 
might display both of them now that I
have<00:03:41.730> this<00:03:41.880> one<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:43.760> one<00:03:44.760> looks<00:03:45.000> cool<00:03:45.269> in
