00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.040
 that was released today guys but before 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.650
 to continue I want to comment as 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.600
 whenever there is heat here in my room 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.520
 I do not know if it's here any more but please 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.410
 comment if where are you 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.869
 really hot because heat does 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.609
 infernal so well in these guys not 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.949
 there are changes in themselves but more than anything 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.869
 books then repaired 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.540
 we'll start with this here it says that it 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.870
 repaired the baby in zombie babies and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.270
 who drinks it well because the baby is 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.460
 as a thing that prevents objects 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.950
 collisions in a game this I do not know very 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.140
 well how is it but good the following is 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.550
 that a potential skull was repaired in the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.489
 mobile on mobiles for an inheritance 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.440
 with the spawn eggs that this well to 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.809
 it never happened to me but well the following 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.030
 over here it says that the button was repaired 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.129
 of returning on the language screen is 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.410
 the next thing that was repaired then the 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.899
 player's position on the screen 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.060
 the skins good because this is that the 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.579
 ski screen is not in the part 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.680
 and you select your good skin as the 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.840
 character of your team disappeared a 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.759
 little down I do not know this very well how is 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.100
 but if they told me what happened to them like that 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.009
 that the following here says that 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.350
 so he crashed me when I know that 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.659
 when the medel reactor broke 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.369
 if it was active, not the next thing 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.500
 says that this repairs a skull in 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.939
 the rendering of some seven months 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.820
 world items but I do not know what it is but they are 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.429
 items are objects the next thing that 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.459
 says that the effect of 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.470
 sitting of the animals of the wolves in 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.840
 multiplayer the other here because it says 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.240
 that it was fixed that the game was left in 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.149
 the black screen that does not either 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.920
 it could happen so much but that repair does not 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.289
 next that says that the players do not 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.450
 they got damage by falling down here is to see 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.310
 says it was repaired that the inventory does not 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.110
 it closed to the wall then our 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.890
 guys about this we go now 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.310
 with the game 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.500
 seriously it's a horrible heat bordered 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.780
 I'm marrying well we're back 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.670
 around here and seriously I think I should 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.770
 consider playing near the micro 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.950
 microwave microwave refrigerator 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.690
 because I'm walking here but good 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.520
 is for the boys that we are 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.970
 with plane 7 and with respect to numbers 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.140
 skins because it was that our character 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.610
 Well, I was a bit down a bit 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.290
 up I do not know how this was but 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.120
 appears a little short but this was 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.950
 repaired so the following guys 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.870
 What I want to show you is that now 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.540
 the worlds leave our children is , 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.380
 well here that goes out then 0.11 point 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.400
 zero 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.989
 fabio 7 next door comes out 176 509 as this 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.300
 is the cidh of the world so here 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.160
 let's see this we give back we go to 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.950
 publisher of worlds and see that then here 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.010
 the cidh comes out not yes, it is 16 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.530
 130 202 we will get into this world and 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.239
 Well, this is fine, although I do not know if 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.400
 they will leave in themselves but I do not think 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.440
 so nothing boys so in this 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.080
 plane because you see our headquarters in the 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.299
 screen not good then with respect to 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.040
 more things this about the wolves I do not know very 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.460
 well how was it but my eggs from 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.490
 fact 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.470
 series because you saw that it's like 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.620
 that they left were not unknown I do not know 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.140
 what happened in my world but it will be a 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.610
 animation effect that with respect to 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.130
 the wolves I do not know well how is this but 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.440
 same winds still do not recognize me and 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.540
 This breaks my soul because they are my 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.340
 pets and we like it so nothing many 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.770
 it's all about this good 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.620
 Other things that I comment there see my 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:36.130
 animals returned my star had a 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.980
 vaquita that folk as you had friends 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.300
 and you do not even have a husband that 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.830
 I have done you favor so I was not 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.390
 boy with respect to that version and 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.910
 I told them that because I feel there is 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.650
 a little more of the I do not know if it's me I do not know 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.000
 if it 's minecraft I do not know seriously but I 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.320
 I feel there is a bit of lag 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.120
 so it is true that is what they have 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.740
 liked a very short video because then 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.720
 there is nothing more to say 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.280
 they were books repaired themselves then 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.410
 Well, they were telling me 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.600
 boys I do not know who it was but I 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.390
 they said 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.400
 with respect to moving pauner of 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.340
 lenderman then there is a small bus like that 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.830
 that we give here we will put the egg 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.220
 of the under man and pass it as point item 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.590
 monster monster droid and monsters place 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.600
 be point people and tend to laxe him 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.150
 Well, this is played, so 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.320
 let's hope they repair it so nothing 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.120
 that's all remember that the 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.770
 comments you can share a bus 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.810
 that you find and therefore another thing that 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.420
 guys is that with this book that the 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.000
 mods since the mods of 11 according to 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.010
 I praise this is still not repaired 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.930
 so here we see see the squid is 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.380
 there but some that fall see you there 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.780
 It was 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.310
 the baby squid then this bug 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.200
 this has not been repaired yet, this is what 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.480
 have liked you already know that you can leave 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.490
 you like com / favorite so until the 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.190
 next I love you very much magners nation 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.050
 they take care of me a kiss a hug and we 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.120
 we see in a next video let's see if not 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.270
 I forget nothing because then like 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.460
 I do not know why then I think that 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.600
 it's all to do with the wolves because I think 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.080
 that was about a multiplayer mode 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.090
 I do not know they did not sit well not like that 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.600
 so let's go fishing, be a 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.640
 all 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.370
 let's see let's go fishing and see if 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.290
 the thread is already connected to 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.190
 our character here we're going to see 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:19.380
 third person options and let's not see 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.350
 It seems that this bug has not yet 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.820
 repair because they do not stop this for god 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.110
 because they do not repair it so now I do 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.070
 I take care of boys 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.070
 goodbye
