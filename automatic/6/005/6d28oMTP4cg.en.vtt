late<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.149> I'm<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> little<00:00:40.079> nervous<00:00:40.200> about

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
late so I'm a little nervous about

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.180 
late so I'm a little nervous about
giving<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.360> before<00:00:42.899> dark<00:00:43.140> because<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.770> go<00:00:43.920> kind

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
giving in before dark because I go kind

00:00:44.190 --> 00:01:18.710 
giving in before dark because I go kind
of<00:00:44.280> slow<00:01:13.430> I<00:01:16.430> like<00:01:17.430> watching<00:01:17.670> my<00:01:17.970> friends<00:01:18.420> deal

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
of slow I like watching my friends deal

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.609 
of slow I like watching my friends deal
with<00:01:18.900> mails<00:01:19.200> wrong<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.880> really<00:01:20.880> think<00:01:21.320> maybe<00:01:22.320> my

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
with mails wrong I really think maybe my

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.219 
with mails wrong I really think maybe my
Gmail<00:01:23.009> drops<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> really<00:01:23.909> good<00:01:24.090> idea

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
Gmail drops is a really good idea

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.030 
Gmail drops is a really good idea
because<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:26.220> takes<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.580> lot<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.790> time<00:01:27.920> you<00:01:28.920> know

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
because it takes a lot of time you know

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.609 
because it takes a lot of time you know
send<00:01:29.460> something<00:01:29.820> ahead<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.479> everyone<00:01:31.350> talks

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
send something ahead like everyone talks

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.679 
send something ahead like everyone talks
about<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> bounce<00:01:32.220> box<00:01:32.610> being<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.119> great<00:01:33.329> idea

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
about a bounce box being a great idea

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.630 
about a bounce box being a great idea
and<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.290> probably<00:01:34.860> could<00:01:35.100> have<00:01:35.159> used<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.460> bounce

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
and I probably could have used a bounce

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.940 
and I probably could have used a bounce
box<00:01:36.000> because<00:01:36.420> after<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.500> know<00:01:37.590> I've<00:01:37.770> been

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
box because after you know I've been

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.010 
box because after you know I've been
struggling<00:01:38.310> with<00:01:38.549> editing<00:01:39.000> my<00:01:39.150> videos<00:01:39.570> and

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
struggling with editing my videos and

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.310 
struggling with editing my videos and
with<00:01:41.009> getting<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> volume<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.899> better

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
with getting the volume on this better

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.859 
with getting the volume on this better
I<00:01:43.500> ordered<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:47.119> microphone<00:01:48.119> an<00:01:48.450> external

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
I ordered a microphone an external

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.560 
I ordered a microphone an external
microphone<00:01:49.049> for<00:01:49.560> my<00:01:49.710> Garmin<00:01:50.579> VirB<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.299> it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
microphone for my Garmin VirB so it

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.920 
microphone for my Garmin VirB so it
should<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:51.930> here<00:01:52.140> soon<00:01:52.409> but<00:01:53.509> otherwise<00:01:54.509> it's

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
should be here soon but otherwise it's

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.749 
should be here soon but otherwise it's
still<00:01:55.229> kind<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:56.750> volume<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:58.140> sure<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.560> know

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
still kind of volume is sure you know

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.810 
still kind of volume is sure you know
but<00:01:59.759> I<00:02:00.259> just<00:02:01.259> think<00:02:02.219> like

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
but I just think like

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.630 
but I just think like
if<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:05.020> can<00:02:05.200> avoid<00:02:05.320> it<00:02:05.560> bounce<00:02:05.980> box<00:02:06.340> it's

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
if you can avoid it bounce box it's

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.670 
if you can avoid it bounce box it's
gonna<00:02:06.760> save<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.330> lot<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:07.870> time<00:02:08.320> on<00:02:08.500> your

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.340 
worry about that it ends up taking a lot
of<00:02:19.810> time<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:21.270> if<00:02:22.270> you<00:02:22.420> can<00:02:22.450> avoid<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.960> I

of time and if you can avoid it I

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.290 
of time and if you can avoid it I

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
personally would recommend it especially

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.260 
personally would recommend it especially
because<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:29.200> doesn't<00:02:29.530> seem<00:02:29.770> like<00:02:30.120> there<00:02:31.120> are

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
because it doesn't seem like there are

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:40.830 
because it doesn't seem like there are
very<00:02:31.300> many<00:02:31.630> places<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.500> far<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:39.510> see<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.600> sign
