00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 but not all the boys here we are 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.730
 finally returned with another package 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.919
 veny and today the boys are doing 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.650
 this pack opening because the came out 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.540
 motto di ronaldo is the motto well other 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.460
 but I don't remember there are two bikes 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.560
 and there are special packages here 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.690
 and what do you guys say now not 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.119
 you can no longer buy coins from the websites of 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.859
 credits so what I do I put 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.900
 crazy prices release the price 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.910
 unchanged from the fifa points in such a way 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.710
 to take the money and I do 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.779
 exit special packages with inside 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.880
 ronaldo moto and I do what I do good 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.380
 asshole I'm going to open the packages later 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.239
 the update they made there 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.460
 are more players on the market ie there 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.320
 they are like 200 thousand objects up for auction 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.149
 to the other yesterday it was 2 million and 200 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.860
 mila so just to make people understand 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.020
 my how much I know fucking heads we leave 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.239
 on the part of the old towards the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.030
 she who all hate seeing that 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.530
 they make shit updates and leave 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.910
 unchanged the most important things like 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.980
 for example the servers that always do 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.910
 shit instead focus more on 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.079
 make money 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.280
 let's make a point to this discussion 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.050
 because now we are going to have some 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.280
 of packages as there is little time left 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.010
 because they expire and so now 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.799
 let's go straight to this link 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.180
 few girls there are three packages from 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.840
 150 thousand and we are going to have the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.509
 first bacchetti and see a little what there is 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.049
 you can never give interesting or 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.049
 dessert 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:29.640
 but fuck you a motto a fucking motorcycle 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.130
 the first module of my life in lazard 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.300
 false that never fails or benzema 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.940
 fucking fucking is n't worth a fuck though 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.970
 because it was precisely saying the pi 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.460
 settled prices of the beautiful shit 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.990
 but it's a fucking motto but let's go to 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.400
 open the other two packages we have 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.680
 found a great so for now it goes 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.210
 well maybe they've increased luck 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.330
 in packages those since yesterday since 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.650
 have removed the possibility of shocking 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.810
 and now we are going to open the last one 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.580
 packet of these 100 of these 50 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.780
 mila and then we throw ourselves on those from 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.150
 25,000 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.479
 let's see what it will ever give you of 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.820
 interested or tevez in total disgust 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.490
 third we see it after we have finished 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.010
 the three 150 thousand packages now there 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.520
 they are 10 from 25,000 so let's go to 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.890
 spend another 250 thousand in packages e 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.300
 let's see if yesterday's will be able to give us 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.070
 something interesting given that for 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.790
 now all the motto is shit 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.230
 she has a little cazorla I always find it is 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.250
 a finger in the ass 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.380
 second package of 25,000 navas ue ci 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.930
 you also give alms yesterday but how much you are 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.930
 kind as we redeem subjective but 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.220
 what the fuck is going on or for 4 thousand 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.560
 assaulted bracket holds so that's it 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.060
 this is precisely what I was talking about before 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.700
 of the important errors that not 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.620
 modify but modify the crap 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.769
 apparently and the most important things 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.510
 not the fuck I was left yesterday 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.010
 Since then 4000 steps since a 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.690
 part I do not do anything I clean myself 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.920
 ass those coins 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.980
 but at least if I try apples of life that is 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.810
 from me I am forced to discard also 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.580
 4,000 credits because otherwise I ca n't 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.769
 go ahead in the package see the right 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.250
 Yesterday he looks disgusted 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.260
 Santa Claus came out and sneijder not 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.450
 aid and c was released again to Santa Claus 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.820
 that one was not enough that does everything 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.620
 the fucking crib even if dad 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.900
 christmas are not for example, but oh well 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.380
 five remaining packages we are opening 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:33.550
 the sixth 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:36.130
 let's look at some reforms or arango 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.200
 how much you want to be ugly but you're a 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.390
 fucking fit and there is even a gift 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.820
 that looks what leaves again 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.550
 meanwhile it grows again I put all of it and 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.140
 two the balls on the fire that then make me 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.520
 know you in the comments what you think 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.920
 of everything that's happening 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.720
 now about your opinions 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.360
 general about this game that I consider 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.100
 de merda because it is not one just lies in 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.600
 fact of losing or not the matches is 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.120
 also in the fact of being able to play there 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.590
 normally but apparently not not 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.070
 can just redeem this package 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.290
 nothing I hoped for while insulting them 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.510
 let me think again about their good 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.780
 faith but instead nothing and let's see a little 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.520
 fourth package left sandro is a 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.080
 another package as a gift but christ 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.660
 so I can't redeem you then 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.760
 flashed in the ass but but jesus 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.590
 Jackie Chan's sister succeeded there 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.300
 on the last three soy packets 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.580
 they are always the ones who bring better 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:32.170
 so i'm confident he finds me 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.970
