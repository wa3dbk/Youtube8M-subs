00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.190
 so hi to all today you have 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.899
 want to make you a little video 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.420
 to introduce you to my new replica 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.030
 who is there gallil or gall there 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.710
 s at or gall and that depends on how 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.759
 you say out of home ad 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.890
 like ryu 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.390
 as you see there the little 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.609
 label on the box that I'm showing 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.260
 immediately energy to catherine maxi 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.000
 here is pelissard numb bac 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.650
 here I am going to remove the box because 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.430
 I do not think it's this case anymore 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.500
 interesting for you that's what 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.050
 so we find in this box then 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.670
 a common instruction manual and 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.989
 all the replicas so who you 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.450
 explain what to do what he 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.020
 do not have to do with the replica 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:49.800
 good so it's still classic here and 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.180
 still there what he has but hey it's 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.710
 always very practical these manuals because 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.120
 that it's in English all in English 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.910
 when we tip trivalent times but 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.300
 it's super convenient so in this 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.750
 box 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:05.369
 what is so much like here 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.470
 we have a cleaning rod or karoubi 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.450
 remain stuck in your case no 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.880
 I'm still foursome that here soaked 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.990
 So the smell odors beens hand is the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:24.110
 classic a return you already have 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:26.729
 so here's normal here we have a charger 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.310
 of yesteryear the libya its place among the 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.979
 friends if not to the English base when you 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.729
 buy the replica at the end here you go 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.740
 a hatch so load to wheel for 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.439
 bring back the bi since at the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.930
 replica 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:48.390
 here the second load so that one 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.399
 without harm and so you have to fill it ben 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.170
 yes catoire mans with a goal told him 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.079
 bill odors so as positive a 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.939
 balance against twenty 130 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.460
 that one pretty much and the most 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.260
 interesting in this box 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.420
 the label 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.590
 no i'm kidding here that's it's a 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.600
 little label that explain to you 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.640
 two three things is what is 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.280
 really the most interesting is 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.520
 this stupid I'll go out of there 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.580
 suite therefore beaten especially a jogging 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.590
 you're here thank you so you have to weigh it 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.970
 4 kilos so that's its weight these 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.370
 practices have or no longer but it's up to 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.420
 say not bad for a replica 4 kg 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.900
 it's the weight of a real gallery 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.970
 just so here's the butt and 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.610
 so collapsible as you see there so 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.900
 there it measures 62 cm with the butt bend 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.270
 to unfold it just shoot 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.270
 like these ladakh where he has everything from 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.150
 larger suite it goes to 85 cm from 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.570
 butt of the butt at the end of the barrel so 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:52.280
 what to say about this replica so 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:54.530
 already rotten features and makes 1,3 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.870
 1.4 plays around 1.6 to score in 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.140
 max cazouls around and 2004 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.330
 jousse 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:06.470
 it runs between 380 and 390 fps with 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.630
 debit 2 0 beats bills 0 1 which are a 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.860
 little too light I find 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.989
 I have already done is that I am well 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.250
 used this replica you ever so 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.040
 on my flock of small traces of 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.800
 scratches one here it's not very good 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.230
 sign has served from just so 380 to 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:28.780
 390 fps me I advise more flow of 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:33.620
 0.23 or 0.25 g or at 0.23 cdh so think 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.760
 replica full metal apart from the handle and 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.330
 the maxon guy the drop 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.130
 otherwise everything is full metal here we have the 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.480
 shooting selector that is the same as on 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.390
 the a47 I have not if you noticed 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.310
 so semi automatic security 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.760
 automatic 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.709
 So here is a breech 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.040
 is not the opinion compete bohain them 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:58.910
 boxes of things well the brief flows here 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.850
 we find in the pub everything where you 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.530
 see well I think the grieg tube 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.570
 youtube the tube writes of course the tube 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.480
 blacks here soaring from tape because 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.890
 I like this August coach at celery homeland 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.530
 so it's a battery 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.390
 in stick which is to us here it is 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.840
 not very practical for the mastery on 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.890
 him the case I could have in there and that's 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.829
 so here is a battery that is not 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.620
 provided in in the box act there 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.150
 interpreter what is found 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:33.850
 also low just about all that side 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:37.130
 yeah that's pretty much the whole side we have 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.780
 a second his shooting but readers 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.640
 no use here is this one is 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.060
 dummy you can put on security 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.919
 automatic this middle of you want the 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.660
 trigger is sinking pocket it is 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.890
 dummy 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:55.880
 we find the fasteners seems like they 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:57.800
 are here and there we also see then 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.500
 I think you see relatively 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.419
 well no here it should do it 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.690
 the small scriptures israel military 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.980
 industries have put so the replica of 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.770
 at king guard ans has the license 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.150
 I put it so there is miss and after 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.320
 company to the real company that 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.620
 makes the real guys ball lille 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.470
 real 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.490
 so here it is a little a little 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.840
 detail that pushes a little bit more 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.070
 realism 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.840
 compared to others replicate on 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.669
 which yorkese iew i who is not the 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.200
 true society brief this just a little 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.260
 detail to push realism has like 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.560
 you 10 there we have some writings 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:33.440
 Here are some engravings 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.210
 excuse me if I sniffed did so I 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.940
 will show you with the charger what 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:43.520
 it gives good if you're not back it 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.570
 give it so it's me I think that 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.430
 it's immediately more beautiful with a 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:53.270
 charger for them it's not complicated there 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:58.729
 just pull the wand for the 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.360
 letter v what can I tell you 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:03.460
 else 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.460
 think about it all is good 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.870
 as I said just now 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.310
 battery is not included in the pack 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:17.380
 so throw it in the stride of 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:21.910
 so shoot there if we stage it you 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.910
 this is automatic 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:28.039
 yes the powerful building will be seen 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.650
 not well in the video obviously but 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.729
 good you tell him the battery and 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.700
 battery charger that are not 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:40.030
 therefore included the battery charger 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:43.159
 I had it then if he came out 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:45.380
 others he is there call mehdi 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:49.180
 envied one is besides here are loaded 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:51.229
 of conventional batteries are waiting so 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.750
 do not know exactly how much 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:57.289
 well worth it is by extremely expensive 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:07:00.080
 with a little pair of glasses here the 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:02.210
 battery that you all wrong when and 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.280
 take 35 euros for the whole country 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.780
 battery charger so it has a cost 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.380
 extra knowing that this 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:12.050
 galipeau I saw him on cybergun 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.490
 shops on the web at 400 480 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.610
 euros 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:19.190
 482 euros exactly so that's it's 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.890
 quite expensive but good finally that I 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.380
 him in armory or price of 430 euros 

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.159
 charger charged battery charger 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.890
 battery included 

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:29.450
 so it's not bad so that's it 

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:33.289
 had decided to buy it while waiting 

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:34.849
 if you ever want a video where I 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:35.900
 shows you how they fire ben say 

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:39.800
 me in the comments I will do 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:42.289
 this video and that's it I have not you 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:46.490
 show sighting systems needed 

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:47.690
 viewfinder so we have this viewfinder there so voila 

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.190
 I do not honestly like this month 

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.200
 what you say is what you think 

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.700
 hi which mm is in position 

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.450
 intermediate as in call of duty 

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.860
 black ops a single exercise that I use 

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.500
 personally I can not find a lot 

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.610
 so if you ever want this video 

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.050
 I show you how forbidden to 

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.090
 rings the comments meanwhile 

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.510
 I tell you, do you wear well at the 

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.110
