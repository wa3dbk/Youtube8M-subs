other<00:01:47.310> twin<00:01:47.579> blades<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.090> even<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.659> Sancerre

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
other twin blades and even the Sancerre

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.670 
other twin blades and even the Sancerre
spear<00:01:49.470> have<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.840> movesets<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.079> where<00:01:52.320> it's

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
spear have the movesets to where it's

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.160 
spear have the movesets to where it's
really<00:01:53.009> easy<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.310> parry<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.659> one<00:01:54.840> fight

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
really easy to parry and in one fight

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.260 
really easy to parry and in one fight
that<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.860> had<00:01:56.130> with<00:01:56.310> somebody<00:01:56.640> he<00:01:56.790> was<00:01:56.909> actually

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
that I had with somebody he was actually

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.130 
that I had with somebody he was actually
using<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.899> regular<00:01:58.170> twin<00:01:58.560> blade<00:01:58.909> I<00:01:59.909> felt<00:02:00.869> kind

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
using the regular twin blade I felt kind

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.840 
using the regular twin blade I felt kind
of<00:02:01.200> bad<00:02:01.259> because<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.979> was<00:02:02.009> actually<00:02:02.520> able<00:02:02.670> to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
of bad because I was actually able to

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.030 
of bad because I was actually able to
parry<00:02:03.210> him<00:02:03.479> three<00:02:03.810> times<00:02:04.020> because<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
parry him three times because the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.249 
parry him three times because the
two-handed<00:02:05.610> moveset<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.030> really<00:02:06.930> easy<00:02:07.110> to

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
two-handed moveset is really easy to

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.990 
two-handed moveset is really easy to
parry<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.920> that's<00:02:08.340> kind<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.640> something<00:02:08.849> that

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
parry and that's kind of something that

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.390 
parry and that's kind of something that
I<00:02:09.119> really<00:02:09.539> did<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:09.899> about<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.860> weapon<00:02:11.039> that

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
I really did like about this weapon that

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.370 
I really did like about this weapon that
it<00:02:12.030> opens<00:02:12.390> off<00:02:12.569> with<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> slash

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
it opens off with a slash

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.260 
it opens off with a slash
and<00:02:13.440> then<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.740> goes<00:02:13.920> into<00:02:14.220> where<00:02:14.850> he<00:02:15.000> starts

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
and then it goes into where he starts

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.150 
and then it goes into where he starts
twirling<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.810> blade<00:02:16.020> that's<00:02:16.830> kind<00:02:17.100> of

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
twirling the blade that's kind of

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.620 
twirling the blade that's kind of
something<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.610> really<00:02:17.910> did<00:02:18.060> like<00:02:18.240> because

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
something that I really did like because

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.510 
something that I really did like because
when<00:02:18.870> people<00:02:19.200> saw<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:19.740> was<00:02:19.950> using<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.310> twin

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
when people saw that I was using a twin

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.110 
when people saw that I was using a twin
blade<00:02:20.760> they<00:02:21.480> were<00:02:21.540> assuming<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:23.120> two-handed

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
blade they were assuming the two-handed

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.820 
blade they were assuming the two-handed
r1<00:02:24.480> match<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.980> can<00:02:26.820> tell<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.560> what<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.590> was

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
r1 match and I can tell that what I was

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.370 
r1 match and I can tell that what I was
doing<00:02:29.130> was<00:02:29.460> kind<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.910> unexpected<00:02:30.380> they're

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
doing was kind of unexpected they're

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.050 
doing was kind of unexpected they're
pairs<00:02:31.650> were<00:02:31.890> off<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.400> was<00:02:32.490> still<00:02:32.730> able<00:02:32.880> to

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
pairs were off and I was still able to

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.750 
pairs were off and I was still able to
pretty<00:02:33.330> much<00:02:33.420> land<00:02:33.930> my<00:02:34.800> hits<00:02:35.070> pretty<00:02:35.490> good

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
pretty much land my hits pretty good

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.310 
pretty much land my hits pretty good
without<00:02:35.910> really<00:02:36.540> having<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.900> worry<00:02:37.170> about

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
without really having to worry about

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.630 
without really having to worry about
getting<00:02:37.560> parried<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.250> was<00:02:38.370> kind<00:02:38.580> of

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
getting parried so that was kind of

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.250 
getting parried so that was kind of
something<00:02:38.820> that<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.150> thought<00:02:39.420> was<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.660> huge<00:02:39.960> Pro

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
something that I thought was a huge Pro

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.410 
something that I thought was a huge Pro
it<00:02:40.830> was<00:02:40.980> it's<00:02:41.190> something<00:02:41.370> really<00:02:41.760> subtle<00:02:42.270> but

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
it was it's something really subtle but

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.970 
it was it's something really subtle but
at<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.080> same<00:02:43.260> time<00:02:43.500> if<00:02:43.650> you're<00:02:43.800> fighting

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
at the same time if you're fighting

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.430 
at the same time if you're fighting
people<00:02:44.250> who<00:02:44.550> are<00:02:44.760> pretty<00:02:45.210> good<00:02:45.420> at<00:02:45.750> pairing

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
people who are pretty good at pairing

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.350 
people who are pretty good at pairing
the<00:02:46.620> twin<00:02:46.830> blades<00:02:47.100> or<00:02:47.400> just<00:02:47.820> parrying<00:02:48.240> in

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
the twin blades or just parrying in

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.030 
the twin blades or just parrying in
general<00:02:48.810> this<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.410> something<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.770> can

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
general this is something that can

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.950 
general this is something that can
definitely<00:02:50.220> throw<00:02:50.520> them<00:02:50.700> off<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.150> kind<00:02:51.870> of

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
definitely throw them off and kind of

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.140 
definitely throw them off and kind of
allow<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.590> actually<00:02:52.740> get<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.370> second<00:02:53.790> r1

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
allow you to actually get that second r1

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.760 
allow you to actually get that second r1
where<00:02:54.450> he<00:02:54.630> starts<00:02:54.900> twirling<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.380> blade<00:02:55.590> and

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
where he starts twirling the blade and

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.970 
where he starts twirling the blade and
get<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.550> actually<00:02:56.730> get<00:02:57.060> some<00:02:57.090> hits<00:02:57.420> in

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
get you and actually get some hits in

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.400 
get you and actually get some hits in
now<00:02:58.980> with<00:02:59.100> that<00:02:59.220> being<00:02:59.400> said<00:03:00.140> I'll<00:03:01.140> go<00:03:01.320> ahead

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
now with that being said I'll go ahead

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.500 
now with that being said I'll go ahead
and<00:03:01.620> go<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.950> con<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.400> that's<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:03.090> even

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
and go to the con and that's that even

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.750 
and go to the con and that's that even
though<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.870> was<00:03:04.020> fully<00:03:04.230> upgraded<00:03:04.800> for<00:03:04.950> me<00:03:05.070> when

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
though it was fully upgraded for me when

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.250 
though it was fully upgraded for me when
I<00:03:05.790> had<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.030> fight<00:03:06.330> with<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.630> one<00:03:06.780> guy<00:03:06.810> where

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
I had that fight with that one guy where

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.500 
I had that fight with that one guy where
I<00:03:07.290> was<00:03:07.470> landing<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:08.160> three<00:03:08.610> Perry's<00:03:08.940> on<00:03:09.090> him<00:03:09.330> I

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
I was landing the three Perry's on him I

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.500 
I was landing the three Perry's on him I
was<00:03:10.020> actually<00:03:10.200> really<00:03:10.760> upset<00:03:11.760> at<00:03:11.940> the

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
was actually really upset at the

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.530 
was actually really upset at the
critical<00:03:12.960> damage<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:13.440> was<00:03:13.560> doing<00:03:13.860> now

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
critical damage that I was doing now

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.150 
critical damage that I was doing now
that<00:03:15.540> could<00:03:15.690> probably<00:03:15.840> be<00:03:16.170> because<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:17.070> the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
that could probably be because of the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.950 
that could probably be because of the
fact<00:03:17.370> that<00:03:17.460> he<00:03:17.640> may<00:03:17.850> have<00:03:17.970> upgraded<00:03:18.510> his<00:03:18.600> armor

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
fact that he may have upgraded his armor

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.170 
fact that he may have upgraded his armor
but<00:03:19.470> at<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.680> same<00:03:19.860> time<00:03:20.160> being<00:03:20.610> able<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.000> do

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
but at the same time being able to do

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.480 
but at the same time being able to do
three<00:03:21.630> critical<00:03:22.110> hits<00:03:22.320> on<00:03:22.500> him<00:03:22.740> and<00:03:22.950> still<00:03:23.310> not

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
three critical hits on him and still not

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.280 
three critical hits on him and still not
being<00:03:23.760> able<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.060> kill<00:03:24.330> him<00:03:24.570> was<00:03:25.020> kind<00:03:25.230> of

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
being able to kill him was kind of

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.810 
being able to kill him was kind of
something<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:25.830> kind<00:03:26.160> of<00:03:26.250> just<00:03:26.490> turned<00:03:26.670> me

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
something that kind of just turned me

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.780 
something that kind of just turned me
off<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:26.970> lot<00:03:27.270> and<00:03:27.600> just<00:03:27.680> in<00:03:28.680> general<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.340> damage

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
off a lot and just in general the damage

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.660 
off a lot and just in general the damage
was<00:03:30.290> leaving<00:03:31.290> something<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.800> be<00:03:31.950> desired<00:03:32.340> so

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
was leaving something to be desired so

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.060 
was leaving something to be desired so
that's<00:03:32.910> kind<00:03:33.240> of<00:03:33.390> one<00:03:33.960> of<00:03:33.990> the<00:03:34.170> major<00:03:34.410> cons<00:03:34.800> in

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
that's kind of one of the major cons in

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.370 
that's kind of one of the major cons in
my<00:03:35.190> opinion<00:03:35.580> another<00:03:36.330> con<00:03:36.660> is<00:03:36.690> that<00:03:37.200> it's

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
my opinion another con is that it's

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.790 
my opinion another con is that it's
actually<00:03:37.500> pretty<00:03:37.800> heavy<00:03:38.070> for<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.340> twin<00:03:38.550> blade

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
actually pretty heavy for a twin blade

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.110 
actually pretty heavy for a twin blade
again<00:03:40.800> I<00:03:40.830> think<00:03:41.250> this<00:03:41.430> is<00:03:41.580> actually<00:03:41.730> one<00:03:42.090> of

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
again I think this is actually one of

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.240 
again I think this is actually one of
the<00:03:42.300> hardest<00:03:42.630> hitting<00:03:42.810> ones<00:03:43.080> it's<00:03:43.650> not<00:03:43.800> the

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
the hardest hitting ones it's not the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.890 
the hardest hitting ones it's not the
hardest<00:03:44.670> hitting<00:03:44.820> ones<00:03:45.090> but<00:03:45.480> it's<00:03:45.690> definitely

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
hardest hitting ones but it's definitely

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.220 
hardest hitting ones but it's definitely
up<00:03:46.290> there<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:47.120> with<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.270> being<00:03:48.450> said<00:03:48.870> it

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
up there and with that being said it

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.710 
up there and with that being said it
still<00:03:50.010> didn't<00:03:50.310> hit<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.490> whole<00:03:50.700> lot<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.150> not

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
still didn't hit a whole lot and not

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.630 
still didn't hit a whole lot and not
only<00:03:51.900> that<00:03:52.020> it<00:03:52.410> kind<00:03:52.770> of<00:03:52.830> just<00:03:53.070> weighs<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.340> whole

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
only that it kind of just weighs a whole

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.610 
only that it kind of just weighs a whole
lot<00:03:53.850> now<00:03:54.330> I<00:03:54.360> really<00:03:54.930> wanted<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.230> fool<00:03:55.500> around

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
lot now I really wanted to fool around

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.010 
lot now I really wanted to fool around
with<00:03:55.920> this<00:03:56.040> weapon<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.640> just<00:03:56.670> do<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.660> lot<00:03:57.870> of

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
with this weapon and just do a lot of

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.080 
with this weapon and just do a lot of
different<00:03:58.290> things<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.709> it<00:03:58.740> I<00:03:59.010> went<00:03:59.400> with<00:03:59.670> a<00:03:59.970> lot

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
different things to it I went with a lot

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.640 
different things to it I went with a lot
of<00:04:00.150> different<00:04:00.390> infusions<00:04:01.050> I<00:04:01.260> was<00:04:01.410> using

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
of different infusions I was using

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.800 
of different infusions I was using
one-handed<00:04:02.520> move<00:04:02.760> sets<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.270> was<00:04:03.390> using<00:04:03.570> the

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
one-handed move sets I was using the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.320 
one-handed move sets I was using the
two-handed<00:04:04.260> move<00:04:04.380> set<00:04:04.650> just<00:04:05.370> really<00:04:05.730> trying

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
two-handed move set just really trying

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.880 
two-handed move set just really trying
to<00:04:06.450> find<00:04:06.690> something<00:04:07.110> that<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.290> really<00:04:07.680> liked

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
to find something that I really liked

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.360 
to find something that I really liked
about<00:04:08.010> this<00:04:08.340> weapon<00:04:08.520> and<00:04:08.880> I'll<00:04:09.660> be<00:04:09.840> honest

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
about this weapon and I'll be honest

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.470 
about this weapon and I'll be honest
like<00:04:11.370> I<00:04:11.490> said<00:04:11.700> in<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:11.880> beginning<00:04:12.000> this<00:04:12.420> is

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
like I said in the beginning this is

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.650 
like I said in the beginning this is
really<00:04:12.990> not<00:04:13.410> my<00:04:13.709> weapon<00:04:14.130> that's<00:04:15.000> not<00:04:15.270> to<00:04:15.450> say

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
really not my weapon that's not to say

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.039 
really not my weapon that's not to say
that<00:04:15.690> people<00:04:16.620> besides<00:04:17.459> me<00:04:17.760> won't<00:04:18.570> like<00:04:18.780> it<00:04:18.810> as

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
that people besides me won't like it as

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.590 
that people besides me won't like it as
well<00:04:19.290> I<00:04:19.530> feel<00:04:20.370> like<00:04:20.549> that<00:04:20.700> there<00:04:20.880> is<00:04:21.030> potential

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
well I feel like that there is potential

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.240 
well I feel like that there is potential
for<00:04:22.020> people<00:04:22.169> who<00:04:22.410> are<00:04:22.530> actually<00:04:22.680> trying<00:04:22.919> to

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
for people who are actually trying to

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.180 
for people who are actually trying to
learn<00:04:23.400> something<00:04:23.790> else<00:04:24.120> me<00:04:24.780> just<00:04:25.050> in<00:04:25.200> general

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
learn something else me just in general

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.130 
learn something else me just in general
I'm<00:04:26.550> not<00:04:26.880> a<00:04:26.910> big<00:04:27.090> fan<00:04:27.270> of<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.540> twin<00:04:27.750> blades<00:04:27.990> at

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
I'm not a big fan of the twin blades at

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.800 
I'm not a big fan of the twin blades at
all<00:04:28.290> so<00:04:28.830> picking<00:04:29.790> up<00:04:30.030> something<00:04:30.360> like<00:04:30.390> this

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
all so picking up something like this

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.780 
all so picking up something like this
kind<00:04:31.590> of<00:04:31.680> just<00:04:31.860> didn't<00:04:32.130> transition<00:04:32.640> really

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
kind of just didn't transition really

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.030 
kind of just didn't transition really
well<00:04:33.260> but<00:04:34.260> for<00:04:34.380> people<00:04:34.650> who<00:04:34.740> are<00:04:34.860> actually

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
well but for people who are actually

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.620 
well but for people who are actually
used<00:04:35.430> to<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.670> twin<00:04:35.880> blades<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.330> actually

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
used to the twin blades and actually

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.420 
used to the twin blades and actually
like<00:04:36.810> using<00:04:37.080> them<00:04:37.350> this<00:04:37.860> is<00:04:38.010> something<00:04:38.310> that

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
like using them this is something that

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.450 
like using them this is something that
might<00:04:38.670> be<00:04:38.820> just<00:04:39.060> a<00:04:39.150> little<00:04:39.270> bit<00:04:39.480> out<00:04:39.660> there<00:04:39.690> and

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
might be just a little bit out there and

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.160 
might be just a little bit out there and
probably<00:04:41.460> even<00:04:41.610> worth<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:41.910> try<00:04:42.300> now<00:04:43.020> with

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
probably even worth the try now with

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.990 
probably even worth the try now with
that<00:04:43.260> being<00:04:43.470> said<00:04:43.800> there's<00:04:44.070> also<00:04:44.250> another<00:04:44.670> Pro

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
that being said there's also another Pro

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.820 
that being said there's also another Pro
that<00:04:45.390> I<00:04:45.420> kind<00:04:45.690> of<00:04:45.780> thought<00:04:45.930> of<00:04:45.960> just<00:04:46.470> right<00:04:46.680> now

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
that I kind of thought of just right now

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.460 
that I kind of thought of just right now
and<00:04:47.100> that's<00:04:47.790> that<00:04:48.450> the<00:04:48.630> moveset<00:04:49.050> actually

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
and that's that the moveset actually

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.340 
and that's that the moveset actually
does<00:04:49.770> have<00:04:49.950> a<00:04:50.010> little<00:04:50.190> bit<00:04:50.340> of<00:04:50.370> variety<00:04:50.610> to<00:04:51.000> it

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
does have a little bit of variety to it

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.900 
does have a little bit of variety to it
the<00:04:52.350> one<00:04:52.530> hand<00:04:52.770> it<00:04:52.950> can<00:04:53.190> do<00:04:53.340> some<00:04:53.550> thrusting

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
the one hand it can do some thrusting

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.110 
the one hand it can do some thrusting
attacks<00:04:54.240> the<00:04:54.870> two-handed<00:04:55.710> doesn't<00:04:56.490> have<00:04:56.640> the

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
attacks the two-handed doesn't have the

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.180 
attacks the two-handed doesn't have the
standard<00:04:57.480> twin<00:04:57.750> blade<00:04:57.990> move<00:04:58.200> set<00:04:58.470> it<00:04:58.860> starts

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
standard twin blade move set it starts

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.920 
standard twin blade move set it starts
off<00:04:59.340> with<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.670> slash<00:04:59.940> which<00:05:00.240> is<00:05:00.480> really<00:05:00.750> good

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
off with the slash which is really good

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.140 
off with the slash which is really good
because<00:05:01.220> even<00:05:02.220> if<00:05:02.310> you're<00:05:02.430> using<00:05:02.670> a<00:05:02.970> twin

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
because even if you're using a twin

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.900 
because even if you're using a twin
blade<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:03.510> you<00:05:03.600> only<00:05:03.720> just<00:05:04.020> hit<00:05:04.200> r1<00:05:04.590> once

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
blade and you only just hit r1 once

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.450 
blade and you only just hit r1 once
standing<00:05:05.910> there<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:06.480> twirling<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:07.020> blade

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
standing there and twirling the blade

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.340 
standing there and twirling the blade

one<00:05:20.250> thing<00:05:20.280> for<00:05:20.610> sure<00:05:20.670> when<00:05:21.030> I<00:05:21.060> was<00:05:21.240> doing

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
one thing for sure when I was doing

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.510 
one thing for sure when I was doing
these<00:05:21.690> battles<00:05:22.140> is<00:05:22.350> that<00:05:22.740> these<00:05:23.220> people

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
these battles is that these people

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.450 
these battles is that these people
weren't<00:05:23.640> really<00:05:23.820> ready<00:05:24.060> for<00:05:24.210> that<00:05:25.310> which<00:05:26.310> was

something<00:05:26.790> that<00:05:26.820> was<00:05:27.030> really<00:05:27.060> cool<00:05:27.420> being

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
something that was really cool being

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.930 
something that was really cool being
able<00:05:28.260> to<00:05:28.440> go<00:05:28.590> in<00:05:28.830> with<00:05:29.040> two-handed<00:05:29.550> r1

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940

switching<00:05:30.660> back<00:05:30.780> to<00:05:30.840> one-handed<00:05:31.530> and<00:05:31.620> then

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
switching back to one-handed and then

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.800 
switching back to one-handed and then
doing<00:05:31.980> a<00:05:32.190> thrusting<00:05:32.669> attack<00:05:33.000> was<00:05:33.510> actually

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
doing a thrusting attack was actually

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.750 
doing a thrusting attack was actually
kind<00:05:33.960> of<00:05:34.020> cool<00:05:34.080> and<00:05:34.440> like<00:05:34.680> I<00:05:34.770> said<00:05:34.980> that's<00:05:35.550> a

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
kind of cool and like I said that's a

kind of cool and like I said that's a
pretty<00:05:36.210> good<00:05:36.450> pro<00:05:36.750> for<00:05:36.960> me<00:05:37.080> and<00:05:37.290> I'm<00:05:37.740> all<00:05:37.919> about

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
having variety and the move set but it

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.550 
having variety and the move set but it
just<00:05:42.510> kind<00:05:42.690> of<00:05:42.750> goes<00:05:42.900> back<00:05:42.930> to<00:05:43.200> my<00:05:43.470> personal

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
just kind of goes back to my personal

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.710 
just kind of goes back to my personal
opinion<00:05:44.370> where<00:05:44.610> I<00:05:44.640> just<00:05:45.000> feel<00:05:45.150> like<00:05:45.360> that<00:05:45.570> this

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
opinion where I just feel like that this

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.930 
opinion where I just feel like that this
is<00:05:45.960> not<00:05:46.260> really<00:05:46.620> a<00:05:46.650> weapon<00:05:46.980> for<00:05:47.160> me<00:05:47.190> but<00:05:47.850> with

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
is not really a weapon for me but with

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.290 
is not really a weapon for me but with
that<00:05:48.090> being<00:05:48.300> said<00:05:48.660> I<00:05:48.960> feel<00:05:49.650> like<00:05:49.680> if<00:05:49.950> I

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
that being said I feel like if I

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.240 
that being said I feel like if I
dedicated<00:05:51.300> a<00:05:51.419> lot<00:05:51.750> of<00:05:51.780> time<00:05:51.900> to<00:05:52.260> it<00:05:52.440> there

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
dedicated a lot of time to it there

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.370 
dedicated a lot of time to it there
could<00:05:53.520> be<00:05:53.550> room<00:05:53.970> to<00:05:54.360> be<00:05:54.510> really<00:05:54.990> really<00:05:55.200> good

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
could be room to be really really good

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.280 
could be room to be really really good
with<00:05:55.530> it<00:05:55.770> but<00:05:56.430> I<00:05:56.640> have<00:05:56.940> to<00:05:57.150> you<00:05:57.720> know<00:05:57.750> swap<00:05:58.080> back

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
and forth between a lot of weapons and

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.020 
and forth between a lot of weapons and
the<00:06:00.690> inevitable<00:06:01.680> fact<00:06:01.950> is<00:06:02.310> that<00:06:02.640> I'm<00:06:02.880> not

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
the inevitable fact is that I'm not

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.000 
the inevitable fact is that I'm not
really<00:06:03.240> going<00:06:03.450> to<00:06:03.510> enjoy<00:06:03.690> all<00:06:04.230> of<00:06:04.470> them<00:06:04.620> so

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
all-in-all this is pretty much going to

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.960 
all-in-all this is pretty much going to
wrap<00:06:07.050> it<00:06:07.080> up<00:06:07.290> I<00:06:07.500> try<00:06:07.919> not<00:06:08.070> to<00:06:08.220> be<00:06:08.340> so<00:06:08.520> negative

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970
