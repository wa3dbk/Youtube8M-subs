00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
case may be but I wouldn't doubt early

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.110 
case may be but I wouldn't doubt early
on<00:03:52.150> at<00:03:52.330> valero<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:54.220> know<00:03:54.340> everyone<00:03:54.820> thinks

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
on at valero you know everyone thinks

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.640 
on at valero you know everyone thinks
how<00:03:55.330> has<00:03:55.510> action-packed<00:03:56.080> fight<00:03:56.350> because<00:03:56.530> he's

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
how has action-packed fight because he's

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.080 
how has action-packed fight because he's
going<00:03:56.800> to<00:03:56.920> be<00:03:57.010> in<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:57.370> think<00:03:57.610> it<00:03:57.700> will<00:03:57.910> be

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
going to be in and I think it will be

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.699 
going to be in and I think it will be
but<00:03:58.510> I<00:03:58.570> wouldn't<00:03:58.900> doubt<00:03:58.959> if<00:03:59.140> it<00:03:59.230> takes<00:03:59.440> a

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
but I wouldn't doubt if it takes a

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.430 
but I wouldn't doubt if it takes a
couple<00:04:00.070> rounds<00:04:00.720> or<00:04:01.720> at<00:04:01.810> least<00:04:01.989> one<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:02.350> two

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
couple rounds or at least one to two

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.860 
couple rounds or at least one to two
rounds<00:04:03.070> for<00:04:03.489> it<00:04:03.580> to<00:04:03.700> become<00:04:03.850> action-packed<00:04:04.600> I

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
rounds for it to become action-packed I

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.470 
rounds for it to become action-packed I
could<00:04:05.140> see<00:04:05.380> him<00:04:05.530> taking<00:04:05.800> his<00:04:05.950> time<00:04:06.190> also<00:04:06.850> not

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
could see him taking his time also not

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.360 
could see him taking his time also not
just<00:04:07.690> that<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:07.870> think<00:04:08.230> DeMarco<00:04:08.650> may<00:04:08.920> give<00:04:09.220> them

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
just that I think DeMarco may give them

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.720 
just that I think DeMarco may give them
some<00:04:10.209> minor<00:04:10.510> problems<00:04:10.690> for<00:04:11.380> him<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:12.310> figure

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
some minor problems for him to figure

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.699 
some minor problems for him to figure
out<00:04:12.970> as<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.540> fight<00:04:13.780> goes<00:04:13.810> on<00:04:14.230> but<00:04:14.380> no<00:04:14.530> matter

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
get sloppy so what we'll see how this

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.480 
get sloppy so what we'll see how this
it'll<00:04:35.210> be<00:04:35.270> interesting<00:04:35.300> to<00:04:35.870> see<00:04:36.020> how<00:04:36.650> well<00:04:37.430> he

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
it'll be interesting to see how well he

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.760 
it'll be interesting to see how well he
adapts<00:04:38.300> to<00:04:38.390> a<00:04:38.480> technician<00:04:39.140> you<00:04:39.470> know<00:04:39.560> that

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
adapts to a technician you know that

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.560 
adapts to a technician you know that
that<00:04:39.980> will<00:04:40.100> be<00:04:40.190> interesting<00:04:40.340> to<00:04:40.670> see<00:04:40.760> but<00:04:41.540> I

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
that will be interesting to see but I

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.450 
that will be interesting to see but I
think<00:04:41.870> like<00:04:42.020> I<00:04:42.170> said<00:04:42.410> even<00:04:42.650> if<00:04:42.860> he's<00:04:43.010> losing

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
think like I said even if he's losing

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.190 
think like I said even if he's losing
the<00:04:43.550> fight<00:04:43.820> or<00:04:44.180> if<00:04:44.420> he's<00:04:44.570> in<00:04:44.720> a<00:04:44.810> really<00:04:45.080> tight

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
the fight or if he's in a really tight

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.380 
the fight or if he's in a really tight
fight<00:04:45.800> I<00:04:46.040> think<00:04:46.610> you'll<00:04:46.730> pull<00:04:46.970> it<00:04:47.090> out<00:04:47.210> either

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390
