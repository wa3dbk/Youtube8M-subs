00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
point for that yet but hopefully as a

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.319 
point for that yet but hopefully as a
next<00:02:54.180> version<00:02:54.569> will<00:02:54.689> be<00:02:54.720> able<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:54.989> do<00:02:55.109> that

obviously I've got the me card you walk
through<00:03:00.480> its<00:03:00.629> video<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.760> I've<00:03:02.760> got<00:03:02.819> the

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
search feature so I can show people you

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.259 
search feature so I can show people you
know<00:03:06.420> how<00:03:06.629> search<00:03:06.959> works<00:03:07.670> like<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.849> tell<00:03:09.209> the

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269

know how search works like the tell the
whole<00:03:09.420> story<00:03:09.510> about<00:03:09.720> how<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.049> search<00:03:10.290> is

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
whole story about how the search is

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.839 
whole story about how the search is
contextual<00:03:11.099> and<00:03:11.220> all<00:03:11.280> those<00:03:11.400> types<00:03:11.459> of<00:03:11.790> things

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
contextual and all those types of things

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.210 
contextual and all those types of things
so<00:03:12.720> again<00:03:12.900> these<00:03:13.019> these<00:03:13.260> assets<00:03:13.769> aren't<00:03:13.949> live

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
so again these these assets aren't live

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.670 
so again these these assets aren't live
emulated<00:03:15.120> yet<00:03:15.329> hopefully<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.349> next<00:03:16.440> version

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
emulated yet hopefully the next version

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.930 
emulated yet hopefully the next version
will<00:03:16.949> get<00:03:17.069> a<00:03:17.099> chance<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.430> really<00:03:17.760> build

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
will get a chance to really build

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.789 
will get a chance to really build
everything<00:03:18.269> out<00:03:18.569> but<00:03:19.169> as<00:03:19.319> you<00:03:19.410> can<00:03:19.500> see<00:03:19.680> we've

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
everything out but as you can see we've

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:20.780 
everything out but as you can see we've
got<00:03:19.829> a<00:03:19.949> lot<00:03:20.099> of<00:03:20.129> little<00:03:20.430> things<00:03:20.519> that

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
got a lot of little things that

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.909 
got a lot of little things that
subtleties<00:03:21.299> like<00:03:21.449> the<00:03:21.569> bounce<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.199> even<00:03:22.799> the

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
subtleties like the bounce and even the

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.770 
subtleties like the bounce and even the
swiper<00:03:23.160> cross<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.699> get<00:03:23.849> to<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.060> application

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
swiper cross you get to the application

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.569 
swiper cross you get to the application
screen<00:03:25.099> obviously<00:03:26.099> none<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.340> these<00:03:26.430> are

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
screen obviously none of these are

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.319 
screen obviously none of these are
active<00:03:27.030> right<00:03:27.209> now<00:03:27.269> but<00:03:28.730> users<00:03:29.730> will<00:03:30.030> get<00:03:30.180> an

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
active right now but users will get an

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.460 
active right now but users will get an
understanding<00:03:30.449> of<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.079> know<00:03:31.139> what's<00:03:31.349> going

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
understanding of you know what's going

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.349 
understanding of you know what's going
to<00:03:31.500> be<00:03:31.620> available<00:03:31.859> to<00:03:32.099> them<00:03:32.459> that<00:03:33.090> kind<00:03:33.299> of

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
to be available to them that kind of

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:41.360 
to be available to them that kind of
thing<00:03:33.599> so<00:03:35.840> that's<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:37.260> in<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:38.040> nutshell<00:03:39.739> and<00:03:40.739> I

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
thing so that's it in a nutshell and I
