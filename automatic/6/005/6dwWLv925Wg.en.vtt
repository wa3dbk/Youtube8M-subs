the other one won't download it for some
reason<00:01:39.909> so<00:01:40.909> what<00:01:41.090> this<00:01:41.240> is<00:01:41.509> much<00:01:41.810> easier<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:42.469> I

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:42.499 
reason so what this is much easier so I

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:45.669 
reason so what this is much easier so I
could<00:01:42.740> easily<00:01:42.889> just<00:01:43.310> make<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:45.049> songs<00:01:45.319> here

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679

make<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:46.729> video<00:01:47.060> on<00:01:47.179> Windows<00:01:47.299> Movie<00:01:47.599> Maker

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:47.779 
make the video on Windows Movie Maker

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:50.139 
make the video on Windows Movie Maker
here<00:01:48.349> then<00:01:48.950> just<00:01:48.979> put<00:01:49.429> them<00:01:49.549> on<00:01:49.609> YouTube<00:01:49.880> here

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
here then just put them on YouTube here
