00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.200
 currently construction available 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:09.970
 economy class housing is underway 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.650
 mainly on the border between 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.750
 petersburg and lynn area territories 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.550
 Marina Kudrova Bugry is not bypassed 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.310
 by attention of developers and Krasnoselsky 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.150
 the area or rather the territory adjacent 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.130
 directly to the red village 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.720
 so just the other day the company does not put 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.730
 once steel has brought a residential complex to the market 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.619
 Annna park where it is planned to build 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.160
 about 400 thousand square meters 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.080
 housing 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.580
 It is remarkable that it will be built in 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.119
 village cut ultrasound on the territory of flax 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.070
 areas 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.019
 however, the distance of this complex from 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.789
 Red Village just 1 kilometer gives 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:38.319
 opportunity to believe that future residents 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:39.640
 he will be enjoyed by him 

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:41.229
 infrastructure including 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.870
 transport while the situation with 

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:45.129
 the roads here only get worse 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.109
 in fact the only road leading 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.549
 Red force is Tallinn highway 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.589
 which after decoupling the roundabout 

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:53.109
 roads go to Krasnoe Selo and 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.659
 here the first road congestion begins 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.579
 tapers down 4 lanes to 2 problems creates 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.379
 intersection with Koloban sky street near 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.209
 residential complex would be a friend in the rock not 3 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.799
 he is not equipped with a traffic light that 

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:04.920
 makes it difficult to turn left from 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:04.920
 cities 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.850
 in the red village Krasnoselskoe shos 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.130
 Lenin Avenue passes 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.410
 Lenin central main highway 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.630
 red stella which connects him 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.550
 center of St. Petersburg on it move 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.960
 huge traffic flows including 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.700
 freight and transit 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.130
 because of the Leningrad region and others 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.930
 regions and even the smallest crashes leads 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.000
 here to huge traffic jams while still 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.560
 70s of the last century there 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.690
 red bypass construction project 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.340
 villages transit transport plans 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.290
 streams should not go downtown 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.280
 and on the outskirts of the red forces but I him 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.410
 road network 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.550
 however, today these plans are postponed to 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.200
 indefinite term 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.730
 local administration offers 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.740
 partially solve the transport problem 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.540
 red village due to less costly 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.520
 projects extremely busy 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.560
 Lenin Avenue has long required an understudy 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.390
 in this capacity could make street 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.040
 Lermontov which would allow 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.820
 unload the traffic flow itself 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.950
 red village 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.840
 however today this street rests on 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.280
 vacant lot and about 200 meters 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.350
 asphalt cloth could solve 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.510
 part of the red sill transport problems 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.040
 another solution for transport 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.649
 the situation of this area was building 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.149
 light rail lines about such 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.780
 opportunities announced in august past 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.300
 of the year 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.090
 ex-head of krt and boris murashov however and 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.440
 this idea has not yet been realized 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.489
 true to the station red village you can 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.650
 take an electric train 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.420
 but it is also not so easy to train from 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.370
 Baltic Station enter about once 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.610
 per hour and only during peak hours about once a 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.610
 half an hour 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.460
 here at this crossroads diverge 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.440
 traffic flows moving from 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.600
 Petersburg in the Leningrad region 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.850
 Gatchina or Kingisepp Highway 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.680
 however, in the near future, the administration 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.720
 the city prepared the locals 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.700
 big surprise next year red 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.620
 the village celebrate its 300th anniversary to 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.090
 this date it was marked the 70th anniversary 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.860
 victories in the great patriotic war on 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.870
 the intersection of Gatchina kingisepp 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.160
 the highway and Lenin Avenue are planning 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.600
 build a triumphal arch 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.070
 simultaneously with the construction of the arch 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.110
 planned to reconstruct this 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.000
 intersection although it is clear that 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.800
 he doesn’t need reconstruction 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.540
 years ago it was renovated with 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.400
 changing traffic patterns and setting 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.110
 traffic lights and building triumphal 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.180
 arches will lead to restriction of movement on 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.980
 this site may be the best gift and 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.780
 the red linen of the village would be a decision about 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.700
 building a traffic detour or 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.380
 at least duplicating the road construction 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.780
 the city’s main avenue 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.890
 Lenin Catherine Semchenko Andrew loves and 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.890
 Dmitry Maklakov Bento you 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.440
 with
