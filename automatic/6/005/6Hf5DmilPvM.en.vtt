this<00:00:00.420> is<00:00:00.690> the<00:00:00.870> red<00:00:01.050> scarlet<00:00:01.469> X<00:00:01.860> and<00:00:02.190> this<00:00:02.460> is

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
this is the red scarlet X and this is

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.980 
this is the red scarlet X and this is
the<00:00:02.820> new<00:00:03.000> GoPro<00:00:03.689> hero3<00:00:04.230> black<00:00:05.629> the<00:00:06.629> GoPro

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
the new GoPro hero3 black the GoPro

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.209 
the new GoPro hero3 black the GoPro
hero3<00:00:07.319> black<00:00:07.560> can<00:00:08.040> shoot<00:00:08.309> at<00:00:08.670> 2.7<00:00:09.660> k<00:00:10.219> with

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
hero3 black can shoot at 2.7 k with

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.320 
hero3 black can shoot at 2.7 k with
protune<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.500> raw<00:00:13.500> color<00:00:13.860> balance<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.549> shoot

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
protune and raw color balance and shoot

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.210 
protune and raw color balance and shoot
24<00:00:15.690> frames<00:00:16.080> per<00:00:16.170> second<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.590> think<00:00:16.650> even<00:00:16.859> 30

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
24 frames per second I think even 30

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.250 
24 frames per second I think even 30
frames<00:00:17.490> per<00:00:17.609> second<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.720> today<00:00:19.020> we're<00:00:19.170> going

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
frames per second so today we're going

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.140 
frames per second so today we're going
to<00:00:19.320> try<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.590> match<00:00:19.890> footage<00:00:20.400> between<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> two

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
to try to match footage between the two

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.599 
to try to match footage between the two
cameras<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.470> reason<00:00:22.619> we<00:00:22.980> would<00:00:23.160> want<00:00:23.369> to

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
cameras so the reason we would want to

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.880 
cameras so the reason we would want to
match<00:00:23.880> footage<00:00:24.480> from<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.720> GoPro<00:00:25.109> hero3<00:00:25.439> and

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
match footage from the GoPro hero3 and

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.339 
match footage from the GoPro hero3 and
the<00:00:25.980> scarlet<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:27.060> GoPro<00:00:27.449> hero3<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:28.109> go<00:00:28.230> in

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
the scarlet the GoPro hero3 can go in

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.200 
the scarlet the GoPro hero3 can go in
places<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.039> scarlet<00:00:29.429> can't<00:00:29.640> go<00:00:29.820> it's

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
places that the scarlet can't go it's

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.659 
places that the scarlet can't go it's
much<00:00:30.359> cheaper<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.869> replace<00:00:30.990> or<00:00:31.560> add<00:00:32.070> two<00:00:32.369> or

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
much cheaper to replace or add two or

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.549 
much cheaper to replace or add two or
more<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.210> add<00:00:33.510> different<00:00:33.750> scenes<00:00:34.200> to

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
more and add different scenes to

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.990 
more and add different scenes to
something<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.340> you're<00:00:35.460> shooting<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.850> an

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
something that you're shooting I an

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.420 
something that you're shooting I an
action<00:00:36.329> scene<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.320> on<00:00:37.469> just<00:00:37.500> like<00:00:37.800> GoPros<00:00:38.250> in

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
action scene so on just like GoPros in

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.310 
action scene so on just like GoPros in
the<00:00:38.520> past<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.300> order<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.600> do<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.079> test

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
the past so in order to do this test

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.350 
the past so in order to do this test
we're<00:00:40.530> going<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.739> set<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.100> GoPro<00:00:41.309> hero3<00:00:41.850> in

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
we're going to set the GoPro hero3 in

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.660 
we're going to set the GoPro hero3 in
protune<00:00:43.140> mode<00:00:43.379> with<00:00:43.739> raw<00:00:43.980> color<00:00:44.280> balance

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
protune mode with raw color balance

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.639 
protune mode with raw color balance
which<00:00:44.820> basically<00:00:45.210> gives<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.750> flattest<00:00:46.289> image

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
which basically gives the flattest image

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.430 
which basically gives the flattest image
possible<00:00:47.309> for<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.030> camera<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:49.230> we're

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
possible for this camera then we're

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.500 
possible for this camera then we're
going<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> take<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.520> we're<00:00:51.149> going<00:00:51.390> to

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
going to take that and we're going to

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.990 
going to take that and we're going to
put<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.780> up<00:00:51.899> against<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> scarlet<00:00:52.739> at<00:00:52.920> ISO<00:00:53.789> 800

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
put it up against the scarlet at ISO 800

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.029 
put it up against the scarlet at ISO 800
at<00:00:55.640> about<00:00:56.640> thirty<00:00:57.090> seven<00:00:57.480> hundred<00:00:57.719> Kelvin<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
at about thirty seven hundred Kelvin the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.130 
at about thirty seven hundred Kelvin the
scene<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.430> i'm<00:00:59.579> showing<00:00:59.789> you<00:01:00.000> was<00:01:00.690> designed

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
scene that i'm showing you was designed

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.410 
scene that i'm showing you was designed
to<00:01:01.260> push<00:01:01.469> both<00:01:01.680> cameras<00:01:02.129> civil<00:01:02.430> limits<00:01:02.730> so

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
to push both cameras civil limits so

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.140 
to push both cameras civil limits so
basically<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.559> 20<00:01:04.920> stops<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.339> range<00:01:05.549> you

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
basically you have 20 stops of range you

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.760 
basically you have 20 stops of range you
have<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.330> mixed<00:01:06.600> color<00:01:06.780> balance<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.260> fifty<00:01:07.560> six

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
have a mixed color balance of fifty six

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.380 
have a mixed color balance of fifty six
hundred<00:01:08.040> Kelvin<00:01:08.400> for<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> outside<00:01:09.060> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
hundred Kelvin for the outside and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.170 
hundred Kelvin for the outside and
thirty<00:01:09.689> two<00:01:09.869> hundred<00:01:09.900> Kelvin<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.700> inside

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
thirty two hundred Kelvin for the inside

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.140 
thirty two hundred Kelvin for the inside
and<00:01:12.540> what<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.229> wanted<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.340> with<00:01:14.790> 20

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
and what I wanted to see is with 20

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.390 
and what I wanted to see is with 20
stops<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.570> range<00:01:15.810> how<00:01:16.619> would<00:01:16.799> both<00:01:16.979> cameras

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
stops of range how would both cameras

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.280 
stops of range how would both cameras
handle<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.360> right<00:01:18.479> out<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> box<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
handle it so right out of the box the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.310 
handle it so right out of the box the
GoPro<00:01:20.130> hero3<00:01:20.460> doesn't<00:01:21.450> look<00:01:21.570> all<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.840> much

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
GoPro hero3 doesn't look all that much

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.359 
GoPro hero3 doesn't look all that much
different<00:01:22.770> than<00:01:23.840> red<00:01:24.840> scarlet<00:01:25.170> X<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.770> made<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
different than red scarlet X I made a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.609 
different than red scarlet X I made a
preset<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.210> magic<00:01:27.600> bullet<00:01:27.869> looks<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.320> four

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
preset in magic bullet looks with four

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.830 
preset in magic bullet looks with four
different<00:01:28.829> color<00:01:29.220> correction<00:01:29.820> options<00:01:30.240> so

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
different color correction options so

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.390 
different color correction options so
that<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.350> ever<00:01:31.380> shoot<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.070> situation

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
that if I ever shoot in this situation

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.399 
that if I ever shoot in this situation
again<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:33.030> both<00:01:33.240> cameras<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:33.960> go<00:01:34.170> back<00:01:34.380> to

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
again with both cameras I can go back to

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.980 
again with both cameras I can go back to
this<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.040> basically<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.939> reference<00:01:36.420> point<00:01:36.509> in

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
this is basically a reference point in

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.649 
this is basically a reference point in
order<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.680> get<00:01:37.860> both<00:01:38.130> cameras<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.729> match<00:01:38.939> with

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
order to get both cameras to match with

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.940 
order to get both cameras to match with
that<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.170> see<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.380> both<00:01:40.619> cameras

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that you can see that both cameras

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.620 
that you can see that both cameras
search<00:01:41.100> look<00:01:41.310> fairly<00:01:41.579> similar<00:01:41.729> you'd<00:01:42.420> be<00:01:42.540> able

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
search look fairly similar you'd be able

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.780 
search look fairly similar you'd be able
to<00:01:42.750> cut<00:01:42.960> them<00:01:43.079> together<00:01:43.259> without<00:01:43.700> noticing<00:01:44.700> a

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
to cut them together without noticing a

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.999 
to cut them together without noticing a
huge<00:01:45.030> difference<00:01:45.299> between<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> cameras<00:01:46.409> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
huge difference between the cameras and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.920 
huge difference between the cameras and
especially<00:01:47.340> now<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.759> watching<00:01:48.509> probably<00:01:48.840> on

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
especially now you watching probably on

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.679 
especially now you watching probably on
a<00:01:48.960> 1080p<00:01:49.470> screen<00:01:49.979> can't<00:01:50.790> really<00:01:51.299> tell<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
a 1080p screen can't really tell the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.139 
a 1080p screen can't really tell the
difference<00:01:51.720> between<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.500> two<00:01:52.850> one<00:01:53.850> note<00:01:54.119> is

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
difference between the two one note is

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.380 
difference between the two one note is
that<00:01:54.390> when<00:01:54.899> we're<00:01:55.140> matching<00:01:55.350> these<00:01:55.740> two

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
that when we're matching these two

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.520 
that when we're matching these two
you're<00:01:57.390> going<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.570> be<00:01:57.689> able<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.930> grade<00:01:58.229> and

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
you're going to be able to grade and

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.160 
you're going to be able to grade and
post<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.159> footage<00:01:59.340> from<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.790> red<00:02:00.170> much

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
post the footage from the red much

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.010 
post the footage from the red much
further<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.890> much<00:02:02.670> differently<00:02:03.270> if<00:02:03.600> you're

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
further and much differently if you're

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.310 
further and much differently if you're
going<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.380> do<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.829> final<00:02:05.490> look<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.790> it's

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
going to do a final look that it's

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.229 
going to do a final look that it's
something<00:02:07.320> completely<00:02:07.439> different<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.759> GoPro

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
something completely different the GoPro

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.700 
something completely different the GoPro
is<00:02:09.420> going<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.599> be<00:02:09.690> limited<00:02:09.929> because

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
is going to be limited because

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.610 
is going to be limited because
the<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.580> codec<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.240> so<00:02:12.450> starved<00:02:13.050> for<00:02:13.230> info

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
that when you start pushing you start

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.500 
that when you start pushing you start
doing<00:02:16.050> crazy<00:02:16.380> grades<00:02:16.830> on<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.250> footage<00:02:17.580> you'll

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
doing crazy grades on the footage you'll

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.730 
doing crazy grades on the footage you'll
start<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.840> run<00:02:19.020> into<00:02:19.260> problems<00:02:19.410> with

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
start to run into problems with

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.380

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
sorts of issues that you are going to

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.730 
sorts of issues that you are going to
see<00:02:26.190> on<00:02:26.460> say<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.570> red<00:02:27.780> but<00:02:28.380> if<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.530> aren't

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
see on say the red but if you aren't

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.340 
see on say the red but if you aren't
planning<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.510> wildly<00:02:30.510> color<00:02:30.750> correct<00:02:31.140> your

planning to wildly color correct your
final<00:02:31.680> footage<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.700> think<00:02:32.910> these<00:02:33.030> two

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
final footage and I think these two

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.510 
final footage and I think these two
cameras<00:02:33.900> can<00:02:34.080> actually<00:02:34.410> match<00:02:34.590> fairly<00:02:35.070> well<00:02:35.250> I

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
cameras can actually match fairly well I

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.460 
cameras can actually match fairly well I
wouldn't<00:02:36.180> be<00:02:36.360> surprised<00:02:36.810> if<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:37.110> started

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
wouldn't be surprised if you started

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.950 
wouldn't be surprised if you started
seeing<00:02:37.650> more<00:02:37.950> big-budget<00:02:38.520> movies<00:02:39.030> with<00:02:39.690> shots

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
from GoPros in the past it's not like

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.180 
from GoPros in the past it's not like
crank<00:02:42.870> or<00:02:43.170> it'll<00:02:43.350> stick<00:02:43.620> out<00:02:43.800> like<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:44.070> sore

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
crank or it'll stick out like a sore

thumb<00:02:44.540> footage<00:02:45.540> from<00:02:45.690> this<00:02:45.900> can<00:02:46.260> actually<00:02:46.980> cut

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
thumb footage from this can actually cut

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.830 
thumb footage from this can actually cut
in<00:02:47.280> with<00:02:47.490> a<00:02:47.520> lot<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.790> different<00:02:48.180> cameras<00:02:48.510> and

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
in with a lot of different cameras and

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.630 
in with a lot of different cameras and
as<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.290> can<00:02:49.410> see<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.800> actually<00:02:49.950> has<00:02:50.340> about<00:02:50.580> the
