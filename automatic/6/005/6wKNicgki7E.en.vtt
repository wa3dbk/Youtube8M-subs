00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
do some more accurate jobs with it like

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.760

also<00:02:14.070> use<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.400> as<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.550> shader<00:02:14.940> brush<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.390> create

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
also use it as a shader brush to create

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.210 
also use it as a shader brush to create
