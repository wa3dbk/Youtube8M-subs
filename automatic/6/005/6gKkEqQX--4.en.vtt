you're a 20 miles per hour the 20 is

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.960 
you're a 20 miles per hour the 20 is
going<00:03:18.380> to<00:03:18.530> light<00:03:18.800> up<00:03:19.040> since<00:03:19.459> you're<00:03:19.580> closest

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
going to light up since you're closest

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.190 
to that number also all the gauges on
this<00:03:22.459> thing<00:03:22.670> are<00:03:22.850> digital<00:03:23.420> so<00:03:23.900> that's<00:03:24.020> also

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
this thing are digital so that's also

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.920 
this thing are digital so that's also
very<00:03:24.500> interesting<00:03:25.070> little<00:03:25.280> gap<00:03:25.490> but<00:03:25.930> so

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
very interesting little gap but so
