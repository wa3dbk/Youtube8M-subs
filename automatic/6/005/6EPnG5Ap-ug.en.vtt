00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
with for many years now viola player and

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.380 
with for many years now viola player and
the<00:00:21.480> score<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:21.960> 450<00:00:22.519> orchestra<00:00:23.519> members<00:00:23.880> so

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
the score is 450 orchestra members so

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:32.760 
the score is 450 orchestra members so
it's<00:00:25.170> very<00:00:25.350> exciting<00:00:25.650> it's<00:00:26.130> gonna<00:00:26.660> wake<00:00:27.660> us<00:00:27.810> up

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.970 

we<00:00:33.770> started<00:00:34.190> with<00:00:34.400> a<00:00:34.430> very<00:00:34.690> basic<00:00:35.800> image<00:00:36.800> and

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
we started with a very basic image and

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.650 
we started with a very basic image and
idea<00:00:37.250> that<00:00:37.489> there<00:00:37.640> are<00:00:37.790> a<00:00:37.910> lot<00:00:38.120> of<00:00:38.150> people<00:00:38.570> on

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
idea that there are a lot of people on

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.100 
idea that there are a lot of people on
stage<00:00:39.020> and<00:00:39.739> feeling<00:00:40.130> that<00:00:40.489> the<00:00:40.670> piece<00:00:40.880> is

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
stage and feeling that the piece is

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.010 
stage and feeling that the piece is
always<00:00:42.340> evolving<00:00:43.340> going<00:00:43.700> between<00:00:43.880> what<00:00:44.750> seems

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
always evolving going between what seems

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.110 
always evolving going between what seems
to<00:00:45.140> be<00:00:45.230> control<00:00:45.860> and<00:00:46.070> out<00:00:46.250> of<00:00:46.460> control<00:00:46.850> and

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
to be control and out of control and

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.410 
to be control and out of control and
sort<00:00:47.450> of<00:00:47.540> waviness<00:00:48.500> and<00:00:49.040> oceanic<00:00:49.820> feel<00:00:50.090> to<00:00:50.330> it

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
sort of waviness and oceanic feel to it

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.650 
sort of waviness and oceanic feel to it
you<00:00:50.449> know<00:00:50.840> a<00:00:51.050> fluidity<00:00:51.860> to<00:00:52.370> both<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:53.239> movement

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
you know a fluidity to both the movement

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.380 
you know a fluidity to both the movement
and<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.140> composition<00:00:54.949> on<00:00:55.309> the<00:00:55.370> stage<00:00:55.670> but

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
and the composition on the stage but

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:05.190 
and the composition on the stage but
that's<00:00:56.600> that<00:00:56.930> was<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.170> starting<00:00:57.680> point

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.200 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.190 

it<00:01:06.200> starts<00:01:06.710> very<00:01:07.630> mathematically<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:09.020> work

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
it starts very mathematically the work

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.110 
it starts very mathematically the work
actually<00:01:09.650> it<00:01:09.740> starts<00:01:10.070> very<00:01:10.220> very<00:01:10.370> organized

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
actually it starts very very organized

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.750 
actually it starts very very organized
and<00:01:11.450> I'm<00:01:11.540> still<00:01:11.780> playing<00:01:12.020> with<00:01:12.310> ways<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:13.520> try

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
and I'm still playing with ways to try

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.620 
and I'm still playing with ways to try
to<00:01:13.790> break<00:01:14.720> that<00:01:16.960> mathematical<00:01:17.960> order<00:01:18.260> with

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
to break that mathematical order with

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.810 
to break that mathematical order with
animalistic<00:01:20.630> power<00:01:21.260> that<00:01:21.740> that<00:01:22.160> works<00:01:22.520> on

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
animalistic power that that works on

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.660 
animalistic power that that works on
these<00:01:23.060> on<00:01:24.020> this<00:01:24.200> group<00:01:24.410> of<00:01:24.560> people<00:01:24.740> super

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
and yeah just it just put a seed of a

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.050 
and yeah just it just put a seed of a
thought<00:01:50.600> in<00:01:50.780> my<00:01:50.810> mind<00:01:51.020> about<00:01:51.789> having<00:01:52.789> an

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
thought in my mind about having an

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.320 
thought in my mind about having an
immigrant<00:01:53.600> in<00:01:53.930> building<00:01:54.920> creating<00:01:55.700> work<00:01:55.940> in

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
immigrant in building creating work in

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.779 
immigrant in building creating work in
such<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:57.350> know<00:01:57.410> kind<00:01:57.890> of<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.100> sensitive<00:01:58.520> time

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
such a you know kind of a sensitive time

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.790 
such a you know kind of a sensitive time
so<00:01:59.300> that's<00:01:59.509> a<00:01:59.690> thought<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.140> a<00:02:00.200> feeling<00:02:00.560> that

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
so that's a thought and a feeling that

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.960 
so that's a thought and a feeling that
made<00:02:01.460> its<00:02:01.640> way<00:02:01.729> into<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.210> piece<00:02:02.390> as<00:02:02.570> well<00:02:02.750> but
