00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.710
 Paris 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.250
 video cameras recorded the way 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.619
 how criminals manage 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.380
 to cut a television from one of the 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.439
 rooms of a hotel located in the 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.500
 center of quad katiba this happened the 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:37.940
 night of July 23 as 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.309
 You can see in the camera image 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.470
 of hotel security the camera of the 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.690
 first floor the couple arrives and 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.890
 asks the receptionist for a 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.439
 room the woman notes down apparently the 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.559
 name of the person but in no 

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:57.739
 moment you see that you demand a document 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:01.189
 of identity the couple does not 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.129
 shows the receptionist no 

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:06.979
 identification even if you 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.500
 they watch carefully the woman notes the 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.970
 name on a sheet at the end of the book and 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.260
 now return to the sheets at the beginning 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.260
 what is not usual 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.360
 making other annotations or 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.550
 checks in the book but 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.950
 we repeat in no time them 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.150
 they show an identification no 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.050
 identification document 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:42.920
 the man pulls out his wallet now draws 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:46.580
 a 50 dollar bill apparently the woman 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.060
 says he does not have a simple search in 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.299
 your pockets 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.670
 the woman has taken the blanket for 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:58.360
 give them the man seeks and not 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.360
 find more money so the woman 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.899
 of the reception ends receiving the 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.899
 ticket 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:15.220
 the woman leaves the blanket for a moment 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.940
 reception desk look at the 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.319
 backlit ticket to verify that 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.170
 it is not false 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.170
 and then he goes to look for the change 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.880
 the waiting couple 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.070
 While 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.070
 the receptionist returns 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.470
 At this time the employee is back 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.569
 of the hotel 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.540
 and he gives him a ticket of 20 thousand pesos 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.689
 he keeps it and she with the blanket and 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.450
 ChÃ¡vez goes up to the second floor to 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:00.810
 make them deliver the room until 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.030
 there everything normal eleven at night 44 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.590
 minutes 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.030
 the second floor camera 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.500
 towards 2 in the morning and 17 minutes 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.709
 details a man who leaves one of 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.379
 the rooms carrying a television 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.620
 plasma there we can observe it the 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:24.250
 Guy goes to another room 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.830
 but he realizes that there is no way out 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.580
 to the balcony that faces the street is wrong 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.940
 this man never came through the door 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.220
 The main hotel is presumed to be 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.190
 individuals who entered opened the 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.440
 another room and the man climbed up the 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.980
 balcony and entered the room and now 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.730
 is taking out the television there is lost 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.470
 from camera view but it does the 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.650
 travel to the room that has 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.440
 the balcony towards the man street 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.480
 return again by the towel 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.010
 soap and toilet paper and control 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.530
 remote from the TV as it also 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.380
 they disappeared according to the administration 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.550
 of the hotel 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.800
 as we apparently said the two 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.590
 individuals who initially entered the 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.290
 couple facilitated things so that the 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.380
 man will enter through the balcony 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.900
 and commit the theft that is supposed to be 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.060
 that the three were accomplices and that 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.460
 they had done intelligence within 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.170
 hotel they knew that window had a 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.830
 balcony that faced the street that did not have 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.600
 gate and that they could pass by there 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.910
 television and take it out there the 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.670
 individual with the other elements that 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.470
 they were missing 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.600
 The curious thing is that the individual 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.120
 He left his handprint on both the 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.130
 wall where it climbed up the balcony as 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.080
 in the rooms internally that 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.940
 you will see later towards 4 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.120
 47 minutes in the morning the couple leaves 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.520
 The woman quietly crouches and looks 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.060
 through the staircase to the 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.970
 reception 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.970
 and they creep down the stairs 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:08.270
 they committed the theft apparently everything 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.840
 indicates that they helped raise the 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:15.380
 man and in the same way they helped him 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.990
 to go down the balcony of the hotel 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.840
 through one of the windows that opens onto the balcony 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:24.620
 and from there to the street as you will see 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.390
 later he left traces marked on 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.810
 the walls both outside the hotel 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:33.080
 as in the rooms now we will see 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.030
 a photograph of how the site was 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.670
 where the TV was anchored in a 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.830
 from the walls a TV like this 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.110
 that appears in this other picture there 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.210
 a television in each room of these 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.720
 and there are the traces left 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.520
 captured on the walls of the hands 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.290
 which is being used by the 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.290
 police to do the investigation
