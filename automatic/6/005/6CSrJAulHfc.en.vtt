may<00:02:26.930> have<00:02:27.200> fixed<00:02:27.500> this<00:02:27.710> issue<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.460> far<00:02:28.840> with

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
may have fixed this issue so far with

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.640

the<00:02:30.080> new<00:02:30.740> batch<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:30.980> consoles<00:02:31.610> um<00:02:32.230> because<00:02:33.230> I

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
the new batch of consoles um because I

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.460 
the new batch of consoles um because I
haven't<00:02:33.920> had<00:02:34.220> any<00:02:34.400> problems<00:02:34.940> with<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.180> yet<00:02:35.630> but

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
haven't had any problems with it yet but

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.520 
haven't had any problems with it yet but
then<00:02:36.770> again<00:02:36.920> i've<00:02:37.880> been<00:02:38.330> using<00:02:38.570> it<00:02:38.870> as<00:02:38.990> gentle

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
then again i've been using it as gentle

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.949 
then again i've been using it as gentle
as<00:02:39.770> an<00:02:40.670> old<00:02:41.180> man<00:02:41.330> brushing<00:02:42.050> his<00:02:42.410> dentures<00:02:42.709> so
