00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.459 
videos from there's one from six months
after<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.460> was<00:00:08.670> at<00:00:08.790> my<00:00:08.880> largest<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.630> six-month

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
after I was at my largest a six-month

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.280 
after I was at my largest a six-month
progression<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.340> then<00:00:11.849> there's<00:00:12.300> one<00:00:12.630> the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
progression and then there's one the

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.340 
progression and then there's one the
actual<00:00:14.420> new<00:00:15.420> years<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:15.960> was<00:00:16.139> at<00:00:16.320> my

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
actual new years that I was at my

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.660 
actual new years that I was at my
heaviest<00:00:17.300> you're<00:00:18.300> going<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.480> see<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:19.670> huge

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
heaviest you're going to see a huge

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.900 
heaviest you're going to see a huge
difference<00:00:20.869> in<00:00:22.310> especially<00:00:23.310> my<00:00:23.430> midsection

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
difference in especially my midsection

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.330 
difference in especially my midsection
but<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.840> be<00:00:24.930> honest<00:00:25.289> I've<00:00:25.470> really<00:00:25.769> lost<00:00:25.980> weight

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
but to be honest I've really lost weight

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.370 
but to be honest I've really lost weight
everywhere<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.750> way<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.900> kind<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.230> think

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
everywhere and the way I kind of think

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.669 
everywhere and the way I kind of think
about<00:00:28.500> weight<00:00:28.830> loss<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.449> when<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:31.439> know<00:00:31.560> we

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
about weight loss is when you know we

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.250 
about weight loss is when you know we
all<00:00:31.769> have<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.980> different<00:00:32.189> body<00:00:32.489> type<00:00:32.790> and

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
all have a different body type and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.290 
all have a different body type and
genetics<00:00:34.260> play<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> huge<00:00:34.860> role<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.940> basically

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
genetics play a huge role but basically

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.240 
genetics play a huge role but basically
the<00:00:36.540> shape<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.989> your<00:00:37.020> body<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:38.010> know<00:00:38.129> it's

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the shape of your body you know it's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.459 
the shape of your body you know it's
obviously<00:00:38.579> going<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.879> expand<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.870> some

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
obviously going to expand and some

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.110 
obviously going to expand and some
people<00:00:40.680> put<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:40.920> weight<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.370> different<00:00:41.700> areas

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
people put on weight in different areas

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.540 
people put on weight in different areas
maybe<00:00:42.690> some<00:00:42.960> hook<00:00:43.230> more<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.370> lower

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
maybe some hook more on in the lower

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.170 
maybe some hook more on in the lower
half<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.059> their<00:00:45.210> body<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.719> tend<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:47.000> put<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.120> on

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
half of their body I tend to put it on

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.439 
half of their body I tend to put it on
all<00:00:48.510> over<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:50.460> first<00:00:50.700> place<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.090> noticed

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
all over and the first place I noticed

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.389 
all over and the first place I noticed
it<00:00:51.570> came<00:00:51.809> off<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.350> kind<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> little<00:00:53.070> bit<00:00:53.309> of

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
it came off is kind of a little bit of

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.100 
it came off is kind of a little bit of
my<00:00:53.520> arms<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.329> was<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> biggest<00:00:54.780> difference

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
my arms that was the biggest difference

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.350 
my arms that was the biggest difference
to<00:00:55.500> me<00:00:55.649> remember<00:00:56.550> when<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.730> was<00:00:56.910> at<00:00:57.030> my<00:00:57.059> heaviest

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
to me remember when I was at my heaviest

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.020 
to me remember when I was at my heaviest
looking<00:00:58.289> down<00:00:58.530> when<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.100> were<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.550> club<00:00:59.910> in

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
looking down when we were this club in

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.610 
looking down when we were this club in
Chicago<00:01:00.480> which<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.660> referred<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.350> one<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.559> my

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
Chicago which I referred to in one of my

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.820 
Chicago which I referred to in one of my
transformations<00:01:02.719> and<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:04.199> looked<00:01:04.439> down<00:01:04.589> at<00:01:04.739> my

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
transformations and I looked down at my

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.890 
transformations and I looked down at my
shirt<00:01:05.070> which<00:01:05.369> came<00:01:05.909> down<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.299> here<00:01:06.540> anyways

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
shirt which came down to here anyways

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.420 
shirt which came down to here anyways
the<00:01:07.080> sleeve<00:01:07.350> because<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.710> was<00:01:07.830> trying<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> cover

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
the sleeve because I was trying to cover

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.060 
the sleeve because I was trying to cover
this<00:01:08.700> they<00:01:09.000> were<00:01:09.090> like<00:01:09.270> marshmallows<00:01:10.010> but<00:01:11.010> I

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
this they were like marshmallows but I

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.120 
this they were like marshmallows but I
looked<00:01:11.280> down<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.150> saw<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.510> skin<00:01:13.260> kind

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
looked down and like I saw the skin kind

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.100 
looked down and like I saw the skin kind
of<00:01:14.220> starting<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.939> roll<00:01:15.330> over<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.750> know<00:01:15.930> it

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
of starting to roll over I know it

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.039 
of starting to roll over I know it
sounds<00:01:16.850> maybe<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.119> not<00:01:18.360> as<00:01:18.570> bad<00:01:18.600> as<00:01:18.810> I

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
sounds maybe it's not as bad as I

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.190 
sounds maybe it's not as bad as I
thought<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:19.710> i<00:01:19.770> think<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.159> was<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:21.200> that's

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
thought but i think it was and that's

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.890 
thought but i think it was and that's
when<00:01:22.409> i<00:01:22.470> was<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:22.799> kind<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.780> when<00:01:24.780> did

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
when i was just kind of like when did

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.460 
when i was just kind of like when did
that<00:01:25.080> happen<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:27.119> know<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.840> lot<00:01:28.200> of

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
that happen and I you know this a lot of

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.770 
that happen and I you know this a lot of
things<00:01:28.650> happened<00:01:29.130> up<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.909> point<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.450> it

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
things happened up to that point and it

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.179 
things happened up to that point and it
all<00:01:30.930> kind<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.290> happened<00:01:31.650> at<00:01:31.740> once<00:01:31.860> when<00:01:32.159> I

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
all kind of happened at once when I

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.249 
all kind of happened at once when I
decided<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.759> change<00:01:32.939> my<00:01:33.030> mind<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.869> we<00:01:33.990> kind<00:01:34.229> of

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.190 
you when you put on fat and you start to
lose<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.310> well<00:01:53.880> strength<00:01:54.420> training<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.899> really

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
lose it well strength training is really

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.690 
lose it well strength training is really
important<00:01:55.649> because<00:01:55.680> you're<00:01:56.040> firming<00:01:56.549> up

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
important because you're firming up

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.730 
important because you're firming up
what's<00:01:57.030> underneath<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.659> fat<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.590> is

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
what's underneath the fat and this is

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.679 
what's underneath the fat and this is
how<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.920> see<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.310> pretend<00:01:59.820> this<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.149> like<00:02:00.390> this

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
how I see it pretend this is like this

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.870 
how I see it pretend this is like this
is<00:02:00.750> your<00:02:01.020> body

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
is your body

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.270 
is your body
and<00:02:01.969> as<00:02:02.570> your<00:02:02.810> muscles<00:02:03.200> grow<00:02:03.560> in<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:03.950> fat

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
and as your muscles grow in the fat

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.940 
and as your muscles grow in the fat
shrinks<00:02:04.939> it<00:02:05.240> just<00:02:05.899> starts<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:06.380> get<00:02:06.469> like<00:02:06.710> this

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
shrinks it just starts to get like this

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.770 
shrinks it just starts to get like this
and<00:02:07.189> eventually<00:02:07.250> it's<00:02:07.729> like<00:02:07.880> shrink<00:02:08.270> wrap<00:02:08.539> and

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
and eventually it's like shrink wrap and

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.779 
and eventually it's like shrink wrap and
the<00:02:08.869> reason<00:02:09.289> strength<00:02:10.039> training<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.489> so

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
the reason strength training is so

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.190 
the reason strength training is so
important<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.480> because<00:02:11.540> you're<00:02:12.019> going<00:02:12.110> to

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
important is because you're going to

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.920 
important is because you're going to
start<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.560> see<00:02:12.800> tone<00:02:13.160> as<00:02:13.519> soon<00:02:13.730> as<00:02:13.849> you<00:02:14.000> do<00:02:14.660> lose

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
start to see tone as soon as you do lose

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.229 
start to see tone as soon as you do lose
weight<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.530> also<00:02:16.130> it's<00:02:16.430> just<00:02:16.819> I'm<00:02:17.060> gonna

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
weight and also it's just I'm gonna

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.790 
weight and also it's just I'm gonna
change<00:02:17.510> my<00:02:17.569> life<00:02:17.900> by<00:02:18.230> doing<00:02:18.290> strength

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
change my life by doing strength

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.800 
change my life by doing strength
training<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:19.970> kind<00:02:20.269> of<00:02:20.300> just<00:02:20.480> wanted<00:02:20.690> to

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
training so I kind of just wanted to

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.680 
training so I kind of just wanted to
show<00:02:20.959> you<00:02:20.989> guys<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.260> little<00:02:21.530> bit<00:02:21.650> um<00:02:22.690> the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
show you guys a little bit um the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.100 
show you guys a little bit um the
difference<00:02:24.110> it's<00:02:24.290> made<00:02:24.470> in<00:02:24.620> me<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:25.239> have<00:02:26.239> lost<00:02:26.660> a

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
difference it's made in me I have lost a

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.960 
difference it's made in me I have lost a
lot<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.590> weight<00:02:27.830> in<00:02:27.950> my<00:02:28.069> stomach<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.730> you'll

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
lot of weight in my stomach and you'll

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.630 
lot of weight in my stomach and you'll
see<00:02:29.209> in<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.420> before<00:02:29.569> videos<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:31.010> mean<00:02:31.489> I<00:02:31.519> still

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
see in the before videos I mean I still

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.309 
see in the before videos I mean I still
have<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.000> ways<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:32.269> go<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.870> for<00:02:33.110> some<00:02:33.290> reason

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
have a ways to go and for some reason

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.759 
have a ways to go and for some reason
this<00:02:33.920> is<00:02:34.280> taking<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.180> longest<00:02:35.360> my<00:02:36.230> obliques

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
this is taking the longest my obliques

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.800 
this is taking the longest my obliques
and<00:02:37.160> this<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:37.700> really<00:02:38.030> tough<00:02:38.420> like<00:02:38.660> it's

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
and this is really tough like it's

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.479 
and this is really tough like it's
really<00:02:39.080> hard<00:02:39.319> and<00:02:39.620> there's<00:02:39.799> not<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:39.980> lot<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.190> fat

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
really hard and there's not a lot of fat

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.750 
really hard and there's not a lot of fat
there<00:02:40.760> there's<00:02:41.750> still<00:02:42.080> some<00:02:42.380> like<00:02:43.160> right<00:02:43.400> here

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
there there's still some like right here

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.430 
there there's still some like right here
and<00:02:44.090> I'd<00:02:44.180> say<00:02:44.330> on<00:02:44.450> my<00:02:44.569> lower<00:02:44.780> back<00:02:45.110> and

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
and I'd say on my lower back and

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.780 
and I'd say on my lower back and
definitely<00:02:45.980> my<00:02:46.130> leg<00:02:46.400> area<00:02:46.730> um<00:02:48.250> there's<00:02:49.250> I've

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
definitely my leg area um there's I've

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.780 
definitely my leg area um there's I've
lost<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.269> lot<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:50.620> fat<00:02:51.620> up<00:02:51.830> here<00:02:52.130> which<00:02:52.670> is

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
lost a lot of fat up here which is

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.839 
lost a lot of fat up here which is
unfortunate<00:02:53.360> but<00:02:53.989> that<00:02:54.980> just<00:02:55.010> kind<00:02:55.519> of<00:02:55.579> comes

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
unfortunate but that just kind of comes

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.819 
unfortunate but that just kind of comes
with<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.030> territory<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.989> you<00:02:57.019> kind<00:02:57.650> of<00:02:57.709> have

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
with the territory and you kind of have

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.360 
with the territory and you kind of have
to<00:02:57.860> accept<00:02:58.310> that<00:02:59.290> so<00:03:00.290> I'm<00:03:00.650> still<00:03:00.950> working<00:03:01.250> on

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
to accept that so I'm still working on

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.520 
to accept that so I'm still working on
this<00:03:01.579> and<00:03:01.940> sometimes<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:03.019> know<00:03:03.170> I've<00:03:03.290> learned

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
this and sometimes you know I've learned

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.120 
this and sometimes you know I've learned
through<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:05.000> fat<00:03:05.750> loss<00:03:05.989> process<00:03:06.380> that<00:03:06.890> things

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
through the fat loss process that things

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.090 
through the fat loss process that things
take<00:03:07.489> a<00:03:07.790> long<00:03:08.420> time<00:03:08.720> it's<00:03:09.140> for<00:03:09.650> certain<00:03:09.980> people

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
take a long time it's for certain people

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.640 
take a long time it's for certain people
I<00:03:10.640> mean<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.090> feel<00:03:11.299> like<00:03:11.450> this<00:03:12.079> part<00:03:12.410> of<00:03:12.530> me

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
I mean I feel like this part of me

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.449 
I mean I feel like this part of me
doesn't<00:03:12.920> match<00:03:13.640> up<00:03:13.670> to<00:03:14.329> maybe<00:03:15.200> my<00:03:15.560> arms<00:03:16.040> I<00:03:16.280> know

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
doesn't match up to maybe my arms I know

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.729 
doesn't match up to maybe my arms I know
there's<00:03:16.790> still<00:03:17.030> some<00:03:17.209> fat<00:03:17.420> there<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:18.079> I'm<00:03:18.530> not

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
there's still some fat there and I'm not

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.559 
there's still some fat there and I'm not
trying<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.250> achieve<00:03:19.549> perfection<00:03:20.000> by<00:03:20.359> any

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569

trying to achieve perfection by any
means<00:03:20.870> I<00:03:21.200> just<00:03:21.709> want<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.130> be<00:03:22.609> the<00:03:22.940> best<00:03:23.150> version

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
means I just want to be the best version

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.949 
means I just want to be the best version
of<00:03:23.690> me<00:03:23.840> I<00:03:23.870> can<00:03:24.170> be<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:25.959> continuously

of me I can be and so continuously
setting<00:03:27.470> goals<00:03:27.680> is<00:03:28.540> something<00:03:29.540> that<00:03:29.660> I<00:03:29.720> need

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
setting goals is something that I need

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.129 
setting goals is something that I need
in<00:03:30.139> my<00:03:30.170> life<00:03:30.290> because<00:03:31.209> with<00:03:32.209> me<00:03:32.450> I'm<00:03:32.690> kind<00:03:33.019> of

in my life because with me I'm kind of

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.590 
in my life because with me I'm kind of
one<00:03:33.530> way<00:03:33.709> or<00:03:33.889> the<00:03:33.920> other<00:03:34.069> um<00:03:34.579> I<00:03:34.970> don't<00:03:35.359> know<00:03:35.510> if

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
one way or the other um I don't know if

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.819 
one way or the other um I don't know if
you<00:03:35.720> would<00:03:35.810> call<00:03:35.989> an<00:03:36.109> addictive<00:03:36.680> personality

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
you would call an addictive personality

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.949 
you would call an addictive personality
but<00:03:37.639> in<00:03:37.760> some<00:03:37.970> ways<00:03:38.120> i<00:03:38.329> would<00:03:38.450> say<00:03:38.630> that<00:03:38.660> yeah

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
but in some ways i would say that yeah

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.449 
but in some ways i would say that yeah
that's<00:03:39.230> probably<00:03:39.470> true<00:03:39.709> about<00:03:40.130> myself<00:03:40.780> if<00:03:41.780> I'm

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.789 
that's probably true about myself if I'm
not<00:03:43.459> feeling<00:03:43.940> very<00:03:43.970> good<00:03:44.239> I<00:03:44.750> can<00:03:45.230> tend<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.650> go

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
not feeling very good I can tend to go

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.289 
not feeling very good I can tend to go
in<00:03:45.950> that<00:03:45.980> direction<00:03:46.220> a<00:03:46.609> lot<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:46.970> know<00:03:47.030> that

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
in that direction a lot and I know that

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.559 
in that direction a lot and I know that
about<00:03:47.450> myself<00:03:47.569> and<00:03:48.139> that's<00:03:48.319> why<00:03:48.760> I<00:03:49.760> take

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
about myself and that's why I take

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.460 
about myself and that's why I take
certain<00:03:50.930> steps<00:03:50.959> and<00:03:51.709> mental<00:03:52.690> steps<00:03:53.690> to<00:03:54.170> stay

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
certain steps and mental steps to stay

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.920 
certain steps and mental steps to stay
clear<00:03:54.829> from<00:03:54.980> that<00:03:55.069> path<00:03:55.489> by<00:03:56.150> continuously

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
clear from that path by continuously

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.629 
clear from that path by continuously
setting<00:03:57.350> goals<00:03:57.470> to<00:03:57.739> move<00:03:57.859> forward<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:58.459> that's

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
setting goals to move forward and that's

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.520 
setting goals to move forward and that's
why<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:58.940> fierce<00:03:59.329> forward<00:03:59.720> is<00:03:59.840> so<00:04:00.049> important

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
why the fierce forward is so important

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.949 
why the fierce forward is so important
to<00:04:00.620> me<00:04:00.709> as<00:04:00.799> a<00:04:00.829> manager<00:04:01.250> because<00:04:01.840> I'm<00:04:02.840> not

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
to me as a manager because I'm not

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.440 
to me as a manager because I'm not
always<00:04:03.200> thinking<00:04:03.620> about<00:04:03.769> going<00:04:03.920> forward<00:04:04.450> I

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
always thinking about going forward I

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.130 
always thinking about going forward I
can

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
can

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.600 
can
sometimes<00:04:06.500> let<00:04:06.710> my<00:04:06.740> emotions<00:04:07.100> of

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
sometimes let my emotions of

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.960 
sometimes let my emotions of
circumstances<00:04:08.450> and<00:04:08.930> take<00:04:09.710> over<00:04:09.920> and<00:04:10.310> I<00:04:10.910> know

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970

for<00:04:11.300> me<00:04:11.480> that<00:04:11.690> that's<00:04:11.870> kind<00:04:12.170> of<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.319> danger<00:04:12.709> zone

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
for me that that's kind of a danger zone

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.309 
for me that that's kind of a danger zone
and<00:04:13.220> I<00:04:13.400> know<00:04:13.459> where<00:04:13.850> it's<00:04:13.970> gotten<00:04:14.209> before<00:04:14.569> so<00:04:15.290> I
