00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:07.990 
after all the years that I'd put into
wrestling<00:02:07.069> for<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.369> point<00:02:07.580> just<00:02:07.789> seemed

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
wrestling for that point just seemed

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.880 
wrestling for that point just seemed
like<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.179> gamble<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.690> me<00:02:08.929> I<00:02:09.140> didn't<00:02:09.530> trust<00:02:09.679> how<00:02:09.860> I

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
like a gamble to me I didn't trust how I

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:18.540 
like a gamble to me I didn't trust how I
would<00:02:10.129> be<00:02:10.250> used

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.610 

you
