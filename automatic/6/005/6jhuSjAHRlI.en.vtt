generally<00:01:12.549> when<00:01:12.579> we're<00:01:12.820> looking<00:01:13.090> at<00:01:13.210> color

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
generally when we're looking at color

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.190 
generally when we're looking at color
and<00:01:13.899> princess<00:01:14.469> cuts<00:01:15.179> the<00:01:16.179> concentration<00:01:17.020> will

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
and princess cuts the concentration will

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.529 
and princess cuts the concentration will
usually<00:01:17.380> be<00:01:17.590> at<00:01:18.009> more<00:01:18.369> so<00:01:18.579> at<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.819> tips<00:01:19.149> of<00:01:19.389> the

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
usually be at more so at the tips of the

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.569 
usually be at more so at the tips of the
stone<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:19.869> at<00:01:20.229> the<00:01:20.380> ends<00:01:20.889> in<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.219> corners

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
stone and at the ends in the corners

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.010 
stone and at the ends in the corners
perhaps<00:01:24.579> a<00:01:24.729> little<00:01:24.819> bit<00:01:25.060> easier<00:01:25.569> to<00:01:25.630> see<00:01:25.749> the

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
perhaps a little bit easier to see the

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.859 
perhaps a little bit easier to see the
difference<00:01:26.409> would<00:01:26.560> be<00:01:26.619> if<00:01:26.859> I<00:01:27.009> tilt<00:01:27.369> these<00:01:27.840> at<00:01:28.840> a

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
difference would be if I tilt these at a

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:38.520 
difference would be if I tilt these at a
slight<00:01:29.259> angle

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:53.200 

so<00:01:50.800> this<00:01:51.800> guy<00:01:52.009> is<00:01:52.070> being<00:01:52.400> stubborn<00:01:52.729> there<00:01:53.090> you

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
so this guy is being stubborn there you

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.399 
so this guy is being stubborn there you
go

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.660 

oh<00:01:57.469> yes

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:13.500 

there<00:02:03.670> you<00:02:03.790> go<00:02:04.830> oops<00:02:08.220> getting<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.340> idea<00:02:12.510> so

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
there you go oops getting the idea so

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.660 
there you go oops getting the idea so
here<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:13.780> looking<00:02:14.200> at<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.650> profiles<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.490> each

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
here is looking at the profiles of each

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.800 
here is looking at the profiles of each
of<00:02:15.850> these<00:02:16.020> as<00:02:17.730> they're<00:02:18.730> on<00:02:18.880> it<00:02:19.030> as<00:02:19.360> they're<00:02:19.690> on

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
of these as they're on it as they're on

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.140 
of these as they're on it as they're on
a<00:02:19.840> slant<00:02:24.540> then<00:02:25.540> is<00:02:25.660> probably<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.140> easiest<00:02:26.170> way

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
a slant then is probably the easiest way

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.840 
a slant then is probably the easiest way
to<00:02:28.150> see<00:02:28.330> color<00:02:28.630> differences<00:02:29.260> more<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:29.860> between

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
to see color differences more so between

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.540 
to see color differences more so between
this<00:02:31.180> color<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:32.050> these<00:02:33.010> three<00:02:33.340> other

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
is the one of 117 e SI one that we have

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.770 
is the one of 117 e SI one that we have
here<00:03:43.470> also<00:03:43.880> but<00:03:44.880> i<00:03:44.940> wanted<00:03:45.330> to<00:03:45.420> show<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.570> these

here also but i wanted to show you these

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.720 
here also but i wanted to show you these
color<00:03:46.050> differences<00:03:46.650> upside<00:03:47.040> down<00:03:47.280> against<00:03:47.640> a

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
color differences upside down against a

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.360 
color differences upside down against a
flat<00:03:47.970> white<00:03:48.180> background<00:03:48.690> because<00:03:49.110> as<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:50.340> can

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
flat white background because as you can

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.830 
flat white background because as you can
see<00:03:50.520> when<00:03:50.880> we<00:03:50.970> look<00:03:51.000> at<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.330> 3gs<00:03:54.260> visually<00:03:56.840> we

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
see when we look at the 3gs visually we

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.860 
see when we look at the 3gs visually we
really<00:03:58.140> don't<00:03:58.290> see<00:03:58.940> much<00:03:59.940> of<00:04:00.000> any<00:04:00.420> difference

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
really don't see much of any difference

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.070 
really don't see much of any difference
between<00:04:01.290> those<00:04:01.470> three<00:04:02.450> visually<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:03.630> they're

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
between those three visually and they're

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.140 
between those three visually and they're
all<00:04:04.260> conservatively<00:04:05.100> lab<00:04:05.760> graded<00:04:06.240> g<00:04:07.020> colors

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
taking the eat color and putting it

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.260 
taking the eat color and putting it
alongside<00:04:46.539> two<00:04:47.020> of<00:04:47.169> the<00:04:47.289> G<00:04:47.529> colors<00:04:48.059> the<00:04:49.059> eat

difference in color from the e to both

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.480 
difference in color from the e to both
of<00:04:57.009> the<00:04:57.159> g's<00:04:57.460> is<00:04:58.559> really<00:04:59.559> in<00:04:59.710> our<00:04:59.830> opinion<00:05:00.099> of

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
of the g's is really in our opinion of

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.730 
of the g's is really in our opinion of
just<00:05:01.089> about<00:05:01.300> a<00:05:01.379> pretty<00:05:02.379> identical<00:05:03.689> so<00:05:04.689> as<00:05:05.529> far

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
just about a pretty identical so as far

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.299 
just about a pretty identical so as far
as<00:05:05.800> G<00:05:06.189> goes<00:05:06.430> I<00:05:06.699> think<00:05:07.059> you<00:05:07.210> got<00:05:07.860> you<00:05:08.860> got<00:05:08.979> a<00:05:09.039> nice

00:05:09.299 --> 00:05:09.309 
as G goes I think you got you got a nice
