 Panel days report

 what is the quality of education 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.250
 superior but before touching this point 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.660
 I want to point out that it will not be enough 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.810
 promote the quality of teaching 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.820
 superior but we have worked the basis of 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.470
 education and that is the lake the great 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.770
 task that we have been doing in these 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.930
 first two years the quality has 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.240
 a cash fund so that the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.300
 universities and technological institutes 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.580
 they can have a plan to improve their 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.660
 educational quality with a view to 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.630
 accreditation 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.509
 the pilgrim doctor morgan president 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.960

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.020
 densities are an integral part that is 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.390
 our interesting desire that's very 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.729
 meritorious but what interests us is 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.159
 improve the quality of education but 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.409
 with continuous improvement and for this it 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.899
 they have developed indicator standards 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.569
 that will allow to contrast in the 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.579
 university when they go through a process 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.769
 which has several stages 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.170
 Dr. Morgan indicated that when 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.819
 students leaving school will have 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.069
 the help to choose in what 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.410
 universities want to study and that 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.620
 after the end of their 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.120
 studies to be able to enter labor 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.370
 that means that the students 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.799
 they will know what careers exist dow in 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.989
 the technique as authoritarian and know 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.450
 also that if they choose what 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.970
 opportunities are going to have to insert 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.510
 occupationally of a life that he can 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.970
 in that way to be done with 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.010
 professional time but also to be 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.470
 competitive and help the country 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.470

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.570

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.640

 We have about 10 institutions missions 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.280
 that are already accredited but with this 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.320
 project is going to push harder 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.770
