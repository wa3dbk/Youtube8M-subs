00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.680 
design and in this short video I'm going
to<00:00:08.130> tell<00:00:08.309> you<00:00:08.400> about<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.730> new<00:00:08.910> how<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.269> design

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
to tell you about the new how to design

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.160 
to tell you about the new how to design
a<00:00:09.719> small<00:00:10.080> guard<00:00:10.320> formula

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
a small guard formula

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.440 
a small guard formula
with<00:00:12.950> small<00:00:13.190> gardens<00:00:13.640> there's<00:00:13.850> a<00:00:13.880> lot<00:00:14.120> you<00:00:14.150> can

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
with small gardens there's a lot you can

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.210 
with small gardens there's a lot you can
do<00:00:14.630> to<00:00:14.660> make<00:00:14.960> them<00:00:15.140> look<00:00:15.290> and<00:00:15.470> feel<00:00:15.650> larger<00:00:16.100> and

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
do to make them look and feel larger and

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.130 
do to make them look and feel larger and
more<00:00:16.370> interesting<00:00:17.030> now<00:00:17.600> most<00:00:17.810> people<00:00:17.960> think

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
more interesting now most people think

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.720 
more interesting now most people think
that<00:00:18.530> it's<00:00:18.680> the<00:00:18.800> plants<00:00:19.160> that<00:00:19.310> make<00:00:19.460> a<00:00:19.490> real

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
that it's the plants that make a real

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.700 
that it's the plants that make a real
difference<00:00:19.910> but<00:00:20.390> it's<00:00:20.570> not<00:00:20.810> plants<00:00:21.529> are<00:00:21.619> of

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
difference but it's not plants are of

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.320 
difference but it's not plants are of
course<00:00:21.860> important<00:00:22.610> but<00:00:23.090> they're<00:00:23.240> the

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
course important but they're the

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.420 
course important but they're the
finishing<00:00:23.810> touch<00:00:24.080> not<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:24.560> starting<00:00:25.130> point

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
finishing touch not the starting point

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.820 
finishing touch not the starting point
what<00:00:26.300> really<00:00:26.689> makes<00:00:26.900> a<00:00:27.050> difference<00:00:27.080> is<00:00:27.650> how

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
what really makes a difference is how

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.249 
what really makes a difference is how
you<00:00:27.890> shape<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:28.430> space<00:00:28.550> and<00:00:29.150> how<00:00:29.599> you<00:00:29.660> use<00:00:30.020> the

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
you shape the space and how you use the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.260 
you shape the space and how you use the
landscaping<00:00:30.770> materials<00:00:31.490> different<00:00:31.880> shaped

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
landscaping materials different shaped

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.300 
landscaping materials different shaped
Gardens<00:00:32.750> need<00:00:33.110> you<00:00:33.410> to<00:00:33.650> do<00:00:33.800> different<00:00:34.280> things

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
Gardens need you to do different things

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.060 
Gardens need you to do different things
with<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:35.000> shape<00:00:35.240> long<00:00:36.050> narrow<00:00:36.410> Gardens<00:00:36.890> need

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
with the shape long narrow Gardens need

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.069 
with the shape long narrow Gardens need
totally<00:00:37.550> different<00:00:37.880> shapes<00:00:38.150> to<00:00:38.329> square<00:00:38.720> wide

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
totally different shapes to square wide

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.140 
totally different shapes to square wide
Gardens<00:00:39.590> and<00:00:39.800> if<00:00:40.160> you<00:00:40.280> use<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:40.640> wrong<00:00:40.820> shapes

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
Gardens and if you use the wrong shapes

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.790 
Gardens and if you use the wrong shapes
in<00:00:41.360> your<00:00:41.390> garden<00:00:41.900> you<00:00:42.110> can<00:00:42.230> actually<00:00:42.380> end<00:00:42.650> up

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
in your garden you can actually end up

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.529 
in your garden you can actually end up
making<00:00:42.860> it<00:00:43.220> look<00:00:43.340> even<00:00:43.700> smaller<00:00:43.910> than<00:00:44.420> it

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
making it look even smaller than it

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:45.340 
making it look even smaller than it
already<00:00:44.690> is

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
already is

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.260 
already is
and<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:46.010> way<00:00:46.160> you<00:00:46.219> use<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:46.460> landscaping

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
and the way you use the landscaping

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.689 
and the way you use the landscaping
materials<00:00:47.359> also<00:00:48.199> has<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:48.379> dramatic<00:00:48.980> impact<00:00:49.129> on

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
materials also has a dramatic impact on

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.420 
materials also has a dramatic impact on
how<00:00:50.120> large<00:00:50.449> or<00:00:50.750> small<00:00:50.809> a<00:00:51.079> garden<00:00:51.530> looks<00:00:51.829> now

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
how large or small a garden looks now

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.040 
how large or small a garden looks now
the<00:00:52.489> two<00:00:52.760> Gardens<00:00:53.180> shown<00:00:53.449> in<00:00:53.629> the<00:00:53.690> picture

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
the two Gardens shown in the picture

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.139 
the two Gardens shown in the picture
here<00:00:54.260> were<00:00:54.379> actually<00:00:54.590> a<00:00:54.920> similar<00:00:55.190> width<00:00:55.550> but

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
here were actually a similar width but

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.209 
here were actually a similar width but
look<00:00:56.449> how<00:00:56.719> much<00:00:56.929> larger<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.620> garden<00:00:58.010> at<00:00:58.129> the

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
look how much larger the garden at the

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.520 
look how much larger the garden at the
bottom<00:00:58.609> looks<00:00:58.910> just<00:00:59.449> because<00:00:59.809> we've<00:01:00.050> used<00:01:00.079> the

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
bottom looks just because we've used the

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.130 
bottom looks just because we've used the
materials<00:01:01.100> in<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.340> right<00:01:01.550> way<00:01:01.929> so<00:01:02.929> in<00:01:03.019> the

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
materials in the right way so in the

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.170 
materials in the right way so in the
small<00:01:03.440> garden<00:01:03.620> design<00:01:04.100> formula<00:01:04.519> I'll<00:01:04.910> take

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180

level and how to create them if your

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.999 
level and how to create them if your
garden<00:01:26.150> is<00:01:26.270> flat<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:27.140> small<00:01:27.380> garden<00:01:27.710> design

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
garden is flat the small garden design

different<00:01:30.619> size<00:01:30.829> and<00:01:30.860> shape<00:01:31.159> gardens<00:01:31.790> to<00:01:31.970> give

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
different size and shape gardens to give

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.270 
different size and shape gardens to give
you<00:01:32.180> plenty<00:01:32.479> of<00:01:32.659> ideas<00:01:32.829> but<00:01:33.829> there's<00:01:34.040> also<00:01:34.130> a

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
you plenty of ideas but there's also a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.639 
you plenty of ideas but there's also a
deconstructed<00:01:35.119> version<00:01:35.540> of<00:01:35.630> each<00:01:35.750> plan<00:01:36.079> so

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
deconstructed version of each plan so

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.560 
deconstructed version of each plan so
you<00:01:36.740> can<00:01:36.890> see<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.280> underlying<00:01:37.640> design<00:01:38.180> shapes

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
you can see the underlying design shapes

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.539 
you can see the underlying design shapes
more<00:01:38.840> easily<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:39.740> this<00:01:40.009> will<00:01:40.250> help<00:01:40.430> you

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
more easily and this will help you

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.370 
more easily and this will help you
understand<00:01:41.030> what<00:01:41.329> makes<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.780> design<00:01:41.930> work

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
understand what makes the design work
