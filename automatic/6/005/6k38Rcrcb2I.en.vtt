hello welcome to Rockies academic
academy<00:00:03.360> today<00:00:03.720> I'm<00:00:03.870> going<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.049> be

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
academy today I'm going to be

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.869 
academy today I'm going to be
demonstrating<00:00:04.560> how<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.190> draw<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.460> square

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
demonstrating how to draw a square

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.390 
demonstrating how to draw a square
pyramid<00:00:06.450> now<00:00:07.140> square<00:00:07.440> pyramid<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.040> different

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
pyramid now square pyramid is different

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.740 
pyramid now square pyramid is different
from<00:00:08.490> other<00:00:08.730> pyramids<00:00:09.059> because<00:00:09.540> it<00:00:09.630> has<00:00:09.719> a

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
from other pyramids because it has a

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.530 
from other pyramids because it has a
square<00:00:10.110> base<00:00:10.700> besides<00:00:11.700> having<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.059> square<00:00:12.269> base

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
square base besides having a square base

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.839 
square base besides having a square base
it<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.590> three<00:00:13.950> dimensional<00:00:14.130> geometric

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
it is a three dimensional geometric

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.170 
it is a three dimensional geometric
figure<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:16.350> has<00:00:16.529> four<00:00:16.859> triangular<00:00:17.340> faces<00:00:17.490> and

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
figure it has four triangular faces and

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.660 
figure it has four triangular faces and
all<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.900> triangular<00:00:19.350> faces<00:00:19.680> connect<00:00:20.279> at<00:00:20.430> one

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
all the triangular faces connect at one

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.570 
all the triangular faces connect at one
point<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.750> point<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.289> called<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.650> vertex<00:00:23.279> it

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
point that point is called a vertex it

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.589 
point that point is called a vertex it
is<00:00:24.210> also<00:00:24.660> considered<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.410> closed<00:00:25.949> shape<00:00:26.539> now<00:00:27.539> to

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
is also considered a closed shape now to

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.439 
is also considered a closed shape now to
form<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.080> base<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.939> basically<00:00:29.939> am<00:00:30.150> going<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.390> be

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
form the base I basically am going to be

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.630 
form the base I basically am going to be
drawing<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.869> square<00:00:31.260> however<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.250> not<00:00:32.399> going

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
drawing a square however it's not going

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.450 
drawing a square however it's not going
to<00:00:32.700> look<00:00:32.850> quite<00:00:33.180> like<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.420> square<00:00:33.899> because<00:00:34.460> if

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
to look quite like a square because if

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.650 
to look quite like a square because if
you<00:00:35.550> look<00:00:35.700> at<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.030> square

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
you look at this square

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.580 
you look at this square
if<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.739> rotate<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.640> tilt<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.480> I'm<00:00:39.750> looking

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
if you rotate it and tilt it I'm looking

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.100 
if you rotate it and tilt it I'm looking
at<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.860> from<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.129> different<00:00:41.340> perspective<00:00:42.110> no

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
at it from a different perspective no

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.869 
at it from a different perspective no
longer<00:00:43.530> am<00:00:43.620> i<00:00:43.710> looking<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.250> from<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> top

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
longer am i looking it from the top

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.290 
longer am i looking it from the top
perspective<00:00:45.629> I'm<00:00:46.350> rotating<00:00:46.770> until<00:00:47.300> tilting

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
perspective I'm rotating until tilting

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.119 
perspective I'm rotating until tilting
it<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.320> doesn't<00:00:49.620> quite<00:00:49.739> look<00:00:49.800> like<00:00:49.980> a

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
it so it doesn't quite look like a

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.279 
it so it doesn't quite look like a
square<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.210> square<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.170> see

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
square but it is the square do you see

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.080 
square but it is the square do you see
it's<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.500> square<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.340> rotated<00:00:53.940> and

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
it's a square it's just rotated and

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.810 
it's a square it's just rotated and
tilted<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.829> because<00:00:56.160> we're<00:00:56.340> looking<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.730> it

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
tilted so because we're looking at it

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.340 
tilted so because we're looking at it
from<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.030> different<00:00:57.239> perspective<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:58.109> not

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
from a different perspective it's not

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.549 
from a different perspective it's not
going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.620> look<00:00:58.859> square<00:00:59.219> although<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.559> now

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
going to look square although it is now

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.399 
going to look square although it is now
the<00:01:01.649> first<00:01:01.859> step<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.190> making<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.969> base<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:04.080> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
the first step in making the base is to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.609 
the first step in making the base is to
draw<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.920> point<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.820> point<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.020> dot<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.860> space

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
draw a point a point is a dot in space

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.649 
draw a point a point is a dot in space
then<00:01:10.619> I'm<00:01:10.799> going<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.950> go<00:01:11.390> horizontally<00:01:12.390> across

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
then I'm going to go horizontally across

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.840 
then I'm going to go horizontally across
from<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.290> point<00:01:13.710> I'm<00:01:14.490> going<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.729> draw

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
from this point I'm going to draw

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.530 
from this point I'm going to draw
another<00:01:15.020> point<00:01:16.820> then<00:01:17.820> I'm<00:01:17.939> going<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.090> go<00:01:18.270> in

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
another point then I'm going to go in

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.960 
another point then I'm going to go in
between<00:01:19.110> these<00:01:19.619> two<00:01:19.860> points<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> center

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
between these two points to the center

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.950 
between these two points to the center
and<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:22.020> go<00:01:22.200> up<00:01:22.380> vertically<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.750> draw<00:01:24.750> another

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
and we go up vertically and draw another

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.609 
and we go up vertically and draw another
point<00:01:26.420> then<00:01:27.420> I'm<00:01:27.509> going<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.659> go<00:01:27.840> downward

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
point then I'm going to go downward

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.149 
point then I'm going to go downward
vertically<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.490> draw<00:01:30.299> another<00:01:30.390> point<00:01:31.159> then

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
vertically and draw another point then

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.819 
vertically and draw another point then
using<00:01:32.759> diagonal<00:01:33.329> line<00:01:33.509> segments<00:01:34.170> I'm<00:01:34.650> going

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
using diagonal line segments I'm going

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.590 
using diagonal line segments I'm going
to<00:01:34.890> connect<00:01:35.220> all<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.820> points<00:01:38.390> I'm<00:01:39.390> going<00:01:39.540> to

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
to connect all the points I'm going to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.130 
to connect all the points I'm going to
try<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.810> make<00:01:40.079> as<00:01:40.259> straight<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.159> lines<00:01:41.460> as

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
try to make as straight of lines as

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:52.910 
try to make as straight of lines as
possible

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.240 

now<00:01:53.520> I've<00:01:53.850> just<00:01:53.880> formed<00:01:54.870> a<00:01:55.080> square<00:01:55.530> base<00:01:55.800> it

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
now I've just formed a square base it

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.719 
now I've just formed a square base it
looks<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> diamond<00:01:56.970> because<00:01:57.479> remember

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
looks like a diamond because remember

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.070 
looks like a diamond because remember
it's<00:01:59.729> rotated<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.720> tilted<00:02:02.780> now<00:02:03.780> I'm<00:02:03.869> going<00:02:04.020> to

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
it's rotated and tilted now I'm going to

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.010 
it's rotated and tilted now I'm going to
go<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.100> center<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.790> my<00:02:06.150> square<00:02:06.479> base<00:02:06.690> and

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
go to the center of my square base and

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.340 
go to the center of my square base and
I'm<00:02:07.470> going<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.619> go<00:02:07.770> up<00:02:07.979> straight<00:02:09.229> go<00:02:10.229> up

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
I'm going to go up straight go up

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.430 
I'm going to go up straight go up
vertically<00:02:11.039> I'm<00:02:11.370> going<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.610> put<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> point<00:02:12.440> then

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
vertically I'm going to put a point then

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.500 
vertically I'm going to put a point then
I'm<00:02:13.560> going<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.709> connect<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.250> point<00:02:14.640> with<00:02:15.270> all

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
I'm going to connect the point with all

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.400 
I'm going to connect the point with all
the<00:02:16.260> corners<00:02:16.740> these<00:02:17.459> are<00:02:17.610> all<00:02:17.790> corners<00:02:18.600> how<00:02:19.290> to

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
the corners these are all corners how to

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.330 
the corners these are all corners how to
connect<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.830> point<00:02:20.130> with<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.550> corners

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
connect the point with the corners

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.460 
connect the point with the corners
drawing<00:02:24.739> as<00:02:25.739> straight<00:02:26.720> but<00:02:27.720> diagonal<00:02:28.080> lines

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
drawing as straight but diagonal lines

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.170 
drawing as straight but diagonal lines
as<00:02:28.739> possible<00:02:32.209> okay<00:02:33.209> now<00:02:33.390> my<00:02:33.660> pyramid<00:02:34.140> has<00:02:34.920> four

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
as possible okay now my pyramid has four

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.830 
as possible okay now my pyramid has four
triangular<00:02:36.180> faces<00:02:36.440> one<00:02:37.440> two<00:02:38.360> if<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.540> look<00:02:39.690> in

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
triangular faces one two if you look in

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.050 
triangular faces one two if you look in
the<00:02:39.930> interior<00:02:40.370> we<00:02:41.370> see<00:02:41.580> three<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.260> four<00:02:44.060> where

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
the interior we see three and four where

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.380 
the interior we see three and four where
the<00:02:45.209> edges<00:02:45.690> meet<00:02:46.050> this<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.010> called<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.820> vertex

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
the edges meet this is called a vertex

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.800 
the edges meet this is called a vertex
so<00:02:49.019> that's<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.410> vertex<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:50.160> vertex<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.239> vertex

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
so that's a vertex of vertex a vertex

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.449 
so that's a vertex of vertex a vertex
and<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.320> vertex<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:54.780> plural<00:02:55.140> form<00:02:55.470> of<00:02:55.680> vertex

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
and a vertex the plural form of vertex

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.800 
and a vertex the plural form of vertex
is<00:02:57.500> vertices<00:02:58.640> so<00:02:59.640> vertices<00:03:00.209> mean<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:02.190> corners

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
is vertices so vertices mean the corners

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.380 
is vertices so vertices mean the corners
where<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.930> edges<00:03:04.230> meet<00:03:04.850> edges<00:03:05.850> are<00:03:06.090> where

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
where the edges meet edges are where

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.620 
where the edges meet edges are where
faces<00:03:07.019> meet<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:07.680> this<00:03:07.890> is<00:03:08.010> an<00:03:08.130> edge<00:03:08.280> an<00:03:08.579> edge<00:03:09.269> an

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
faces meet so this is an edge an edge an

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.630 
faces meet so this is an edge an edge an
edge<00:03:10.380> an<00:03:10.680> edge<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.790> an<00:03:12.180> edge<00:03:13.220> now<00:03:14.220> if<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.459> want

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
edge an edge and an edge now if I want

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.780 
edge an edge and an edge now if I want
to<00:03:14.670> show<00:03:14.940> that<00:03:15.269> I<00:03:15.900> cannot<00:03:16.350> that<00:03:16.860> I'm<00:03:17.070> looking

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
to show that I cannot that I'm looking

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.240 
to show that I cannot that I'm looking
through<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.930> pyramid<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:19.709> can<00:03:19.890> see<00:03:20.100> the

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
through the pyramid and I can see the

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.520 
through the pyramid and I can see the
actual<00:03:20.370> backside<00:03:21.060> I'm<00:03:21.930> going<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.230> make<00:03:22.350> a

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
actual backside I'm going to make a

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.190 
actual backside I'm going to make a
broken<00:03:23.250> line<00:03:24.560> segment<00:03:25.560> so<00:03:26.989> I'm<00:03:27.989> going<00:03:28.140> to

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
broken line segment so I'm going to

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.380 
broken line segment so I'm going to
break<00:03:28.380> up<00:03:28.590> this<00:03:28.739> line<00:03:28.980> segment<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:32.640> form

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
break up this line segment to form

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.430 
break up this line segment to form
dotted<00:03:33.959> lines

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
dotted lines

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.670 
dotted lines
this<00:03:34.709> shows<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.430> interior<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:37.200> pyramid

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
this shows the interior of the pyramid

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.610 
this shows the interior of the pyramid
so<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.190> can<00:03:38.430> see<00:03:38.730> through<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.180> now<00:03:40.079> if<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.260> show

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
so I can see through it now if I show

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.009 
so I can see through it now if I show
that<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.829> can't<00:03:41.250> see<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.730> de<00:03:41.850> pyramid<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:42.390> need

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
that I can't see the de pyramid I need

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.550 
that I can't see the de pyramid I need
to<00:03:43.170> erase<00:03:43.549> these<00:03:44.549> line<00:03:45.320> interior<00:03:46.320> line

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
to erase these line interior line

00:03:46.560 --> 00:04:06.350 
to erase these line interior line
segments

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.260 

now<00:04:06.900> if<00:04:07.080> I<00:04:07.170> want<00:04:07.350> to<00:04:07.440> draw<00:04:07.620> bricks<00:04:08.090> this<00:04:09.090> is

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
now if I want to draw bricks this is

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.470 
now if I want to draw bricks this is
what<00:04:09.450> I<00:04:09.480> do<00:04:10.280> first<00:04:11.280> I'm<00:04:11.670> going<00:04:11.880> to<00:04:11.940> after<00:04:12.420> I

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
what I do first I'm going to after I

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.230 
what I do first I'm going to after I
race<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:12.990> go<00:04:13.260> over<00:04:13.440> all<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:14.250> line<00:04:14.460> segments

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
race I go over all the line segments

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:25.040 
race I go over all the line segments
once<00:04:15.960> again

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.240 

then<00:04:25.650> I'm<00:04:25.979> going<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.370> match<00:04:27.440> you<00:04:28.440> see<00:04:28.680> the

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
then I'm going to match you see the

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.520 
then I'm going to match you see the
angle<00:04:29.639> that<00:04:29.759> this<00:04:29.970> line<00:04:30.629> segment<00:04:31.139> is<00:04:31.199> going

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
angle that this line segment is going

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.640 
angle that this line segment is going
I'm<00:04:31.710> going<00:04:32.129> to<00:04:32.190> draw<00:04:32.759> parallel<00:04:33.449> lines<00:04:33.500> to<00:04:34.500> this

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
I'm going to draw parallel lines to this

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.490 
I'm going to draw parallel lines to this

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
and then I'm going to seen up any lines

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:56.159 
and then I'm going to seen up any lines
I'm<00:05:46.740> not<00:05:47.130> happy<00:05:47.340> with

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.449 

and<00:05:56.259> there<00:05:56.919> you<00:05:57.039> have<00:05:57.249> it<00:05:57.400> a<00:05:57.550> square<00:05:58.029> pyramid
