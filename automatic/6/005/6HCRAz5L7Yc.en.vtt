00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the highest up to a 32 gig I've seen as

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.200 
the highest up to a 32 gig I've seen as
much<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.170> 64<00:00:40.829> but<00:00:41.040> 32<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.700> science<00:00:42.120> is

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
much as a 64 but 32 is the science is

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.869 
much as a 64 but 32 is the science is
gonna<00:00:42.390> go<00:00:43.190> what<00:00:44.190> else<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.489> tell<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.789> about

this it doesn't do it automatically I

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.389 
this it doesn't do it automatically I
found<00:00:49.110> out<00:00:49.260> from<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.590> little<00:00:49.710> bit<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.010> research

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
found out from a little bit of research

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.029 
found out from a little bit of research

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
that uh the Android operating system

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.610 
that uh the Android operating system
Google<00:00:53.789> put<00:00:54.210> some<00:00:54.360> proprietary<00:00:54.600> operate<00:00:55.530> you

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
Google put some proprietary operate you

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.200

know<00:00:55.739> some<00:00:55.980> things<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.280> our<00:00:56.309> operating<00:00:56.820> system

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
know some things on our operating system

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.290 
know some things on our operating system
that<00:00:57.930> stops<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:59.039> from<00:00:59.070> being<00:00:59.579> able<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.910> mount

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
a SD card for it to throw it on it

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.410 
a SD card for it to throw it on it
without<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.010> rooting<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:05.700> without<00:01:06.210> you

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.210 
modifying the operating system itself
which<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> very<00:01:09.930> difficult<00:01:10.350> process<00:01:10.770> if
