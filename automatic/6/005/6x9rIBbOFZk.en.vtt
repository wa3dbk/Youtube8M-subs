make a transition from squared around we

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.509 
make a transition from squared around we
want<00:00:06.760> to<00:00:06.850> break<00:00:07.090> this<00:00:07.330> corner<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:09.220> do<00:00:09.340> that

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:09.519

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
and turn this down to a cylinder to ress

00:00:52.719 --> 00:01:02.910 
and turn this down to a cylinder to ress
it<00:00:52.870> away<00:00:53.050> down

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.380 

we<00:01:03.920> have<00:01:04.010> to<00:01:04.129> be<00:01:04.220> careful<00:01:04.670> introducing<00:01:05.300> the

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
we have to be careful introducing the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.450 
we have to be careful introducing the
chisel<00:01:05.840> close<00:01:06.080> to<00:01:06.290> these<00:01:06.440> cuts<00:01:06.770> we're<00:01:07.340> not

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
chisel close to these cuts we're not

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.560 
chisel close to these cuts we're not
going<00:01:07.580> to<00:01:07.640> be<00:01:07.700> able<00:01:07.760> to<00:01:07.850> run<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.210> cylinder

going to be able to run the cylinder

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.330 
going to be able to run the cylinder
down<00:01:08.720> all<00:01:09.050> the<00:01:09.200> way<00:01:09.350> right<00:01:09.590> here<00:01:09.830> we<00:01:10.100> can<00:01:10.190> get

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
down all the way right here we can get

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.920 
down all the way right here we can get
pretty<00:01:10.550> close<00:01:10.729> then<00:01:11.540> we'll<00:01:11.659> use<00:01:11.780> another

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
pretty close then we'll use another

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.719 
pretty close then we'll use another
chisel<00:01:12.500> come<00:01:12.650> back<00:01:12.830> and<00:01:13.010> just<00:01:13.100> clean<00:01:13.400> it<00:01:13.430> up

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
chisel come back and just clean it up

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.830 
chisel come back and just clean it up
when<00:01:13.880> we<00:01:13.940> make<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.420> marking<00:01:15.020> land<00:01:15.260> here<00:01:16.840> I've

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
when we make the marking land here I've

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.540 
when we make the marking land here I've
used<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.229> story<00:01:18.560> stick<00:01:18.860> to<00:01:19.009> mark<00:01:19.220> off<00:01:19.400> the

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
used the story stick to mark off the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.999 
used the story stick to mark off the
major<00:01:19.759> transition<00:01:20.540> points<00:01:21.020> now<00:01:21.710> with<00:01:21.860> this

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
major transition points now with this

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.240 
major transition points now with this

Powermatic 35 20 B lathe I can turn the
speed<00:01:25.520> down<00:01:25.700> very<00:01:26.000> slow<00:01:26.420> so<00:01:26.960> I<00:01:27.020> can<00:01:27.050> see<00:01:27.410> these

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
speed down very slow so I can see these

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.620 
speed down very slow so I can see these
marks<00:01:28.009> easily<00:01:28.430> go<00:01:28.940> ahead<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.150> hold<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.390> pencil

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.499 

now<00:01:39.890> if<00:01:40.039> these<00:01:40.220> marks<00:01:40.640> made<00:01:40.850> I<00:01:41.119> can<00:01:41.240> go<00:01:41.420> ahead

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
now if these marks made I can go ahead

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.810 
now if these marks made I can go ahead
and<00:01:41.720> turn<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.200> transition<00:01:42.920> points<00:01:43.310> down<00:01:43.520> and

at and how I want to cut each piece this
is<00:01:56.300> a<00:01:56.330> great<00:01:56.630> help<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:57.110> have<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.289> piece<00:01:57.679> back

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
is a great help to have the piece back

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.120 
is a great help to have the piece back
here<00:01:58.780> with<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.899> low<00:02:00.050> points<00:02:00.440> turned<00:02:00.679> I<00:02:00.890> can

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
here with the low points turned I can

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.800 
here with the low points turned I can
begin<00:02:01.369> rounding<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.030> other<00:02:02.119> parts<00:02:02.509> so<00:02:02.690> they

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
begin rounding the other parts so they

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.139 
begin rounding the other parts so they
flow<00:02:03.110> into<00:02:03.380> them<00:02:03.710> I'm<00:02:04.550> going<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.729> start<00:02:05.000> by

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
flow into them I'm going to start by

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.029 
flow into them I'm going to start by
rounding<00:02:05.330> off<00:02:05.690> this<00:02:05.929> broken<00:02:06.440> corner<00:02:06.830> here<00:02:07.009> a

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
rounding off this broken corner here a

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:08.980 
rounding off this broken corner here a
little<00:02:07.250> bit<00:02:07.459> more<00:02:07.729> we<00:02:08.030> just<00:02:08.060> want<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.539> get<00:02:08.810> this

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
little bit more we just want to get this

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.170 
little bit more we just want to get this
down<00:02:09.259> closer<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:10.039> we'll<00:02:10.580> finish<00:02:10.759> it<00:02:11.030> off<00:02:11.120> with

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
down closer and we'll finish it off with

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:23.560 
down closer and we'll finish it off with
sandpaper

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.910 

I've<00:02:24.570> gone<00:02:24.690> ahead<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:24.990> rough<00:02:25.260> shaped<00:02:25.590> all<00:02:25.800> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
I've gone ahead and rough shaped all the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.890 
I've gone ahead and rough shaped all the
rounded<00:02:26.310> parts<00:02:26.700> now<00:02:27.300> we're<00:02:27.420> going<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.570> do<00:02:27.750> the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
rounded parts now we're going to do the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.470 
rounded parts now we're going to do the
taper<00:02:28.170> on<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.560> main<00:02:28.860> body<00:02:29.100> andele<00:02:29.640> now<00:02:30.360> it

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
taper on the main body andele now it

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.000 
taper on the main body andele now it
looks<00:02:30.690> like<00:02:30.780> it's<00:02:31.080> tapered<00:02:31.470> almost<00:02:31.740> all<00:02:31.890> the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
looks like it's tapered almost all the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.590 
looks like it's tapered almost all the
way<00:02:32.130> up<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.640> actually<00:02:32.970> starts<00:02:33.390> right

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
way up and it actually starts right

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.750 
way up and it actually starts right
about<00:02:33.750> here<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.590> that's<00:02:35.130> another<00:02:35.460> good<00:02:35.700> point

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
about here and that's another good point

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.270 
about here and that's another good point
of<00:02:36.120> having<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.570> sample<00:02:37.050> back<00:02:37.260> here<00:02:37.740> because

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
of having the sample back here because

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.010 
of having the sample back here because
like<00:02:38.430> as<00:02:38.610> I'm<00:02:38.790> working<00:02:38.970> this<00:02:39.300> down<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.570> can<00:02:39.870> pay

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
like as I'm working this down I can pay

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.970 
like as I'm working this down I can pay
attention<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.590> where<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.800> taper<00:02:41.370> is<00:02:41.640> starting

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
attention to where a taper is starting

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.710 
attention to where a taper is starting
we'll<00:02:43.980> start<00:02:44.250> by<00:02:44.370> taking<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.850> cuts<00:02:45.120> right

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
we'll start by taking the cuts right

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.170 
we'll start by taking the cuts right
near<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.170> end<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.680> then<00:02:47.370> keep<00:02:47.610> moving<00:02:47.640> back

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
near the end and then keep moving back

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.300 
near the end and then keep moving back
with<00:02:48.450> every<00:02:48.660> cut<00:02:48.930> so<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.260> extend<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.070> taper

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
with every cut so you extend the taper

00:02:50.310 --> 00:03:11.209 
with every cut so you extend the taper
back<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.850> keep<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.240> smooth

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:11.219 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.640 

as<00:03:12.299> we<00:03:13.299> work<00:03:13.510> this<00:03:13.719> taper<00:03:14.019> and<00:03:14.319> you<00:03:14.409> want<00:03:14.560> to

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
as we work this taper and you want to

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.280 
as we work this taper and you want to
start<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.280> cut<00:03:15.760> death<00:03:16.000> up<00:03:16.269> here<00:03:16.629> and<00:03:16.810> then

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
start a cut death up here and then

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.229 
start a cut death up here and then
concentrate<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.010> holding<00:03:18.430> that<00:03:18.549> same<00:03:18.849> depth

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
concentrate and holding that same depth

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:31.610 
concentrate and holding that same depth
watch<00:03:19.659> the<00:03:19.900> line<00:03:20.109> as<00:03:20.379> you<00:03:20.500> go<00:03:20.650> down

all the chisel work is done and now
we're<00:03:37.680> going<00:03:37.830> to<00:03:37.920> sand<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.430> you<00:03:39.239> can<00:03:39.360> see<00:03:39.599> it

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
we're going to sand it you can see it

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.350 
we're going to sand it you can see it
left<00:03:39.900> flats<00:03:40.200> on<00:03:40.500> top<00:03:40.739> of<00:03:40.950> rounded<00:03:41.849> portions

left flats on top of rounded portions
when<00:03:42.989> we<00:03:43.140> sand<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.530> sides<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:44.280> flat<00:03:44.879> will

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
when we sand the sides that flat will

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.460 
when we sand the sides that flat will
just<00:03:45.269> disappear<00:03:45.420> and<00:03:45.930> give<00:03:46.049> us<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.260> nice

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
just disappear and give us a nice

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.410 
just disappear and give us a nice
rounded<00:03:46.950> edge<00:03:47.099> rather<00:03:47.489> than<00:03:47.730> coming<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.299> a

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
rounded edge rather than coming to a

rounded edge rather than coming to a
point<00:03:50.360> now<00:03:51.360> when<00:03:51.510> you're<00:03:51.690> sanding<00:03:52.230> make<00:03:52.980> sure

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
point now when you're sanding make sure

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.949 
point now when you're sanding make sure
you<00:03:53.310> keep<00:03:53.519> your<00:03:53.700> fingers<00:03:53.909> away<00:03:54.269> from<00:03:54.690> here

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
you keep your fingers away from here

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.420 
you keep your fingers away from here
because<00:03:55.079> we<00:03:55.319> know<00:03:55.500> those<00:03:55.709> corners<00:03:56.250> are

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
because we know those corners are

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:08.839 
because we know those corners are
swinging<00:03:56.849> around

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.550 

see<00:04:09.390> how<00:04:09.480> that<00:04:09.689> turned<00:04:09.989> around<00:04:10.200> us

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
see how that turned around us

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.589 
see how that turned around us
