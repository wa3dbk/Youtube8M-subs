to<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> situation<00:01:28.909> this<00:01:29.909> could<00:01:30.119> be<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
to the situation this could be for a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.109 
to the situation this could be for a
function<00:01:30.689> known<00:01:31.049> as<00:01:31.229> blind<00:01:31.590> eye<00:01:31.970> so<00:01:32.970> this

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
function known as blind eye so this

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.069 
function known as blind eye so this
starts<00:01:33.299> getting<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> little<00:01:33.630> bit<00:01:33.960> more

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
starts getting a little bit more

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.780 
starts getting a little bit more
technical<00:01:34.320> here<00:01:34.770> but<00:01:34.829> still<00:01:35.340> interesting

all good interesting information here
then<00:02:51.870> moving<00:02:52.079> on<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.440> second<00:02:52.769> picture

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
then moving on to the second picture

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.890 
then moving on to the second picture
this<00:02:53.549> one<00:02:53.730> also<00:02:53.849> has<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.090> lot<00:02:54.299> of<00:02:54.329> information

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
this one also has a lot of information

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.780 
this one also has a lot of information
but<00:02:54.930> it's<00:02:55.170> not<00:02:55.319> quite<00:02:55.620> as<00:02:55.739> interesting<00:02:56.010> as<00:02:56.549> the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
but it's not quite as interesting as the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.339 
but it's not quite as interesting as the
previous<00:02:57.000> one<00:02:57.360> so<00:02:57.810> I'm<00:02:57.900> not<00:02:58.049> going<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.260> go<00:02:58.319> over

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
previous one so I'm not going to go over

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.380 
previous one so I'm not going to go over
every<00:02:58.860> single<00:02:59.040> aspect<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.790> it<00:02:59.910> but<00:03:00.090> basically

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
every single aspect of it but basically

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.789 
every single aspect of it but basically
you<00:03:00.599> can<00:03:00.720> see<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.900> string<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.290> code<00:03:01.530> there<00:03:01.739> at

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
you can see a string of code there at

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.500 
you can see a string of code there at
the<00:03:01.860> beginning<00:03:02.099> followed<00:03:02.700> by<00:03:02.970> more<00:03:03.209> green

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
the beginning followed by more green

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.390 
the beginning followed by more green
text<00:03:03.900> that's<00:03:04.140> actually<00:03:04.560> readable<00:03:04.980> like<00:03:05.280> the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
text that's actually readable like the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.979 
text that's actually readable like the
first<00:03:05.579> one<00:03:05.730> there<00:03:05.879> says<00:03:06.060> heist<00:03:06.360> board<00:03:06.720> heist

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
first one there says heist board heist

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.930 
first one there says heist board heist
planning<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.980> then<00:03:08.220> it<00:03:08.340> says<00:03:08.489> this<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:08.849> the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
planning and then it says this is the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.339 
planning and then it says this is the
function<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.390> use<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.660> planning<00:03:10.019> board<00:03:10.140> to

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
function to use the planning board to

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.500 
function to use the planning board to
start<00:03:10.410> planning<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.069> crew<00:03:11.340> heist<00:03:11.670> mission<00:03:12.090> and

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
the effect that's going to make your

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.699 
the effect that's going to make your
controller<00:03:35.400> Rumble<00:03:35.970> when<00:03:36.599> when<00:03:37.260> something<00:03:37.620> in

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
controller Rumble when when something in

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.319 
controller Rumble when when something in
a<00:03:37.769> heist<00:03:37.950> mission<00:03:38.280> explodes<00:03:38.730> or<00:03:39.120> when<00:03:39.269> you

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
a heist mission explodes or when you

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.879 
a heist mission explodes or when you
smash<00:03:39.569> a<00:03:39.599> hole<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:40.139> the<00:03:40.230> ground<00:03:40.410> or<00:03:40.620> something

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
smash a hole in the ground or something

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.530 
smash a hole in the ground or something
like<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.430> then<00:03:41.790> lastly<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.389> very

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
like that and then lastly the very

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.870 
like that and then lastly the very
bottom<00:03:42.750> one<00:03:43.079> is<00:03:43.109> set<00:03:43.650> water<00:03:43.950> flood<00:03:44.430> building

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
bottom one is set water flood building

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.430 
bottom one is set water flood building
so<00:03:45.359> basically<00:03:45.780> this<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:46.109> going<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.349> be<00:03:46.410> a

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
so basically this is going to be a

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.170 
so basically this is going to be a
feature<00:03:46.680> where<00:03:47.130> somewhere<00:03:47.730> in<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.970> heist

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
feature where somewhere in a heist

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.640 
feature where somewhere in a heist
you're<00:03:48.419> gonna<00:03:48.569> break<00:03:48.840> some<00:03:49.139> sort<00:03:49.349> of<00:03:49.440> main

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
you're gonna break some sort of main

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.140 
you're gonna break some sort of main
water<00:03:49.919> valve<00:03:50.040> or<00:03:50.400> something<00:03:50.700> like<00:03:50.819> that<00:03:50.880> and

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
water valve or something like that and

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.940 
water valve or something like that and
you're<00:03:51.269> gonna<00:03:51.389> flood<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.750> building<00:03:52.169> so<00:03:52.680> this<00:03:52.859> is

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
you're gonna flood a building so this is

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.349 
you're gonna flood a building so this is
going<00:03:53.069> to<00:03:53.160> kind<00:03:53.400> of<00:03:53.459> tell<00:03:53.669> that<00:03:53.880> how<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.090> work

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
going to kind of tell that how to work

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.849 
going to kind of tell that how to work
so<00:03:54.810> overall<00:03:55.169> this<00:03:55.349> is<00:03:55.500> some<00:03:55.680> pretty
