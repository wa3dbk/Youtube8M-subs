00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.829 
okay now we're going to take a look at a
couple<00:00:03.560> of<00:00:03.620> pentatonic<00:00:04.279> sequences<00:00:04.939> which<00:00:05.689> can

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:05.839 
couple of pentatonic sequences which can

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.320 
couple of pentatonic sequences which can
help<00:00:05.990> use<00:00:06.259> this<00:00:06.410> first<00:00:06.649> position<00:00:06.859> in<00:00:07.309> a<00:00:07.850> more

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.940 
help use this first position in a more
kind<00:00:08.509> of<00:00:08.660> musical<00:00:09.049> context<00:00:09.589> so<00:00:09.710> if<00:00:09.799> you're

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
improvising it gives you a few ideas

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.600 
improvising it gives you a few ideas
that<00:00:11.750> you<00:00:11.809> can<00:00:11.990> throw<00:00:12.139> in<00:00:12.230> while<00:00:12.860> playing<00:00:13.190> over

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
that you can throw in while playing over

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.459 
that you can throw in while playing over
a<00:00:13.639> backing<00:00:14.030> track<00:00:14.059> so<00:00:14.690> here's<00:00:15.110> the<00:00:15.230> first

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:15.469

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:31.869 
a backing track so here's the first
sequence

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:31.879 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.160 

okay<00:00:32.879> start<00:00:33.210> off<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.420> sequence<00:00:33.870> we're<00:00:34.050> going

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
okay start off this sequence we're going

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.270 
okay start off this sequence we're going
to<00:00:34.230> start<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.590> twelfth<00:00:34.949> fret<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.129> the<00:00:35.219> low

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
to start on the twelfth fret on the low

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.040 
to start on the twelfth fret on the low
E<00:00:35.399> string<00:00:35.550> I'm<00:00:36.300> going<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.480> hammer<00:00:36.690> onto<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
E string I'm going to hammer onto the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
E string I'm going to hammer onto the
15th<00:00:37.469> fret<00:00:39.199> then<00:00:40.199> on<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.470> string<00:00:40.590> we've<00:00:40.949> got

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
15th fret then on the a string we've got

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.020 
15th fret then on the a string we've got
12<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.519> 14<00:00:41.969> pull<00:00:42.239> off<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.449> 12<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:44.030> then

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
12 to 14 pull off to 12 on the a then

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.479 
12 to 14 pull off to 12 on the a then
we've<00:00:45.180> got<00:00:45.329> 15<00:00:45.750> pull<00:00:45.989> off<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.199> 12<00:00:46.470> and<00:00:46.800> 1<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.040> 15

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
we've got 15 pull off to 12 and 1 to 15

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.250 
we've got 15 pull off to 12 and 1 to 15
on<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> low<00:00:47.879> E<00:00:49.040> so<00:00:50.040> altogether<00:00:53.899> ok<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:54.960> that's

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
on the low E so altogether ok so that's

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.660 
on the low E so altogether ok so that's
the<00:00:55.350> pattern<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.829> will<00:00:55.979> begin<00:00:56.129> gonna<00:00:56.550> be

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
the pattern that will begin gonna be

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.090 
the pattern that will begin gonna be
doing<00:00:56.970> from<00:00:57.149> each<00:00:57.449> string<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.949> that

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
doing from each string so so that

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.740 
doing from each string so so that
started<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.610> low<00:00:59.790> E<00:00:59.820> string<00:00:59.970> we're<00:01:00.629> now

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
started on the low E string we're now

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.959 
started on the low E string we're now
going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> carry<00:01:01.860> on<00:01:01.979> with<00:01:02.159> that<00:01:02.190> pattern<00:01:02.550> from

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
going to carry on with that pattern from

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.800 
going to carry on with that pattern from
the<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> string<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.840> we're<00:01:03.929> gonna<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:08.810> ok

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the a string and we're gonna do this ok

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.880 
the a string and we're gonna do this ok
so<00:01:09.869> that's<00:01:10.170> 12<00:01:10.649> to<00:01:10.800> 14<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.550> a<00:01:12.350> then<00:01:13.350> 12<00:01:13.740> to

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
so that's 12 to 14 on the a then 12 to

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.779 
so that's 12 to 14 on the a then 12 to
14<00:01:14.340> back<00:01:14.550> to<00:01:14.670> 12<00:01:14.940> on<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.149> d<00:01:15.800> then<00:01:16.800> 14<00:01:17.399> pull<00:01:17.700> off

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
14 back to 12 on the d then 14 pull off

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:26.330 
14 back to 12 on the d then 14 pull off
to<00:01:17.880> 12<00:01:18.149> backs<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.539> 14<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.860 

then<00:01:27.340> from<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.640> d-string<00:01:28.000> we've<00:01:28.240> got<00:01:28.420> 12<00:01:28.690> to

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
then from the d-string we've got 12 to

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:35.190 
then from the d-string we've got 12 to
14<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:31.270> 12<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.720> 14<00:01:32.140> back<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.530> 12<00:01:32.800> on<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.010> G<00:01:34.200> 14

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
14 then 12 to 14 back to 12 on the G 14

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.560 
14 then 12 to 14 back to 12 on the G 14
pull<00:01:35.500> off<00:01:35.590> to<00:01:35.710> 12<00:01:35.979> and<00:01:36.220> then<00:01:36.430> back<00:01:36.880> to<00:01:37.030> 14<00:01:37.450> on

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.170 
string then we've got 14 pull off to 12
home<00:05:33.100> runs<00:05:33.130> 14<00:05:33.730> on<00:05:33.910> the<00:05:33.940> D<00:05:35.130> then<00:05:36.130> 12<00:05:36.610> hang<00:05:36.910> on<00:05:37.030> to

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
home runs 14 on the D then 12 hang on to

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.740 
home runs 14 on the D then 12 hang on to
14<00:05:37.660> on<00:05:37.870> the<00:05:37.990> G<00:05:38.230> and<00:05:38.550> then<00:05:39.550> finish<00:05:40.030> on<00:05:40.150> 14<00:05:40.570> on<00:05:40.720> the

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
14 on the G and then finish on 14 on the

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.310 
14 on the G and then finish on 14 on the
D

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:53.630 

okay<00:05:44.320> so<00:05:44.380> we've<00:05:44.590> got<00:05:44.620> this

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
so a slow tempo the whole sequence

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:13.040 
so a slow tempo the whole sequence
should<00:05:56.530> sound<00:05:56.710> like<00:05:56.800> this

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050

okay now what I'm going to do is play
those<00:06:15.340> last<00:06:15.610> two<00:06:15.789> sequences<00:06:16.030> that<00:06:16.479> we<00:06:16.570> looked

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
those last two sequences that we looked

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.600 
those last two sequences that we looked
at<00:06:16.930> over<00:06:17.139> the<00:06:17.530> backing<00:06:17.889> track<00:06:18.100> just<00:06:18.340> to<00:06:18.430> see
