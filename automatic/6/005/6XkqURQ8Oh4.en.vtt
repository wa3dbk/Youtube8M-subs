00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
time instead of 20 feet up like I did

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.920 
time instead of 20 feet up like I did
with<00:00:40.980> my<00:00:41.010> pretest<00:00:41.579> why<00:00:42.270> not<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.510> got<00:00:42.780> some

with my pretest why not I got some

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.450 
with my pretest why not I got some
pretty<00:00:43.020> good<00:00:43.140> results<00:00:43.590> at<00:00:43.710> 20<00:00:44.010> feet<00:00:44.159> so<00:00:44.190> let's

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
pretty good results at 20 feet so let's

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.919 
pretty good results at 20 feet so let's
see<00:00:44.579> what<00:00:44.730> we<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:44.969> do<00:00:45.120> stretching<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.690> out<00:00:45.809> to

00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:45.929 
see what we can do stretching it out to

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.560 
see what we can do stretching it out to
30<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:47.129> see<00:00:47.339> if<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.699> get<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.940> say<00:00:48.359> within

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
30 and see if we can get it say within

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.090 
30 and see if we can get it say within
under<00:00:48.839> 2<00:00:48.989> inches<00:00:49.019> that<00:00:49.499> wouldn't<00:00:49.679> be<00:00:49.739> too<00:00:49.920> bad

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
under 2 inches that wouldn't be too bad

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.549 
under 2 inches that wouldn't be too bad
all<00:00:50.789> right<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.239> we're<00:00:51.390> loaded<00:00:51.690> up<00:00:51.839> we're<00:00:52.409> off

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
safe and we're just going to put 5

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:56.000 
safe and we're just going to put 5
around<00:00:54.960> through<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.230> hopefully<00:00:55.769> they<00:00:55.890> all

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
around through here hopefully they all

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.759 
around through here hopefully they all
read<00:00:56.249> and<00:00:56.780> see<00:00:57.780> if<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> same<00:00:58.199> results

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
read and see if we get the same results

would hit it every time so I've heard

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.640 
would hit it every time so I've heard
people<00:04:22.910> haters<00:04:23.480> well<00:04:23.690> I<00:04:23.930> want<00:04:24.320> to<00:04:24.410> call<00:04:24.560> them

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
people haters well I want to call them

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.230 
people haters well I want to call them
haters<00:04:24.800> it's<00:04:25.010> just<00:04:25.190> their<00:04:25.340> opinion<00:04:25.550> but

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
haters it's just their opinion but

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.660 
haters it's just their opinion but
they're<00:04:26.390> not<00:04:26.540> liking<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.080> trigger<00:04:27.380> and<00:04:27.680> you

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
they're not liking the trigger and you

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.610 
they're not liking the trigger and you
know<00:04:28.760> it's<00:04:28.970> a<00:04:29.060> heavy<00:04:29.240> trigger<00:04:29.570> 9<00:04:29.780> 10<00:04:30.050> pounds<00:04:30.410> no

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
know it's a heavy trigger 9 10 pounds no

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.960 
know it's a heavy trigger 9 10 pounds no
I'm<00:04:30.890> not<00:04:31.040> going<00:04:31.190> to<00:04:31.250> disagree<00:04:31.490> with<00:04:31.640> it<00:04:31.820> but

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
I'm not going to disagree with it but

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.600 
I'm not going to disagree with it but
it's<00:04:32.120> pretty<00:04:32.360> predictable<00:04:32.980> it's<00:04:33.980> not<00:04:34.400> like

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
it's pretty predictable it's not like

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.800 
it's pretty predictable it's not like
some<00:04:34.790> other<00:04:34.910> guns<00:04:35.120> that<00:04:35.240> have<00:04:35.360> been<00:04:35.450> referred

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
some other guns that have been referred

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.980 
some other guns that have been referred
to<00:04:35.840> like<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.640> skate<00:04:37.640> 3000<00:04:38.330> yes<00:04:38.540> that's<00:04:38.780> got<00:04:38.960> a

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
to like the skate 3000 yes that's got a

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.870 
to like the skate 3000 yes that's got a
heavy<00:04:39.230> trigger<00:04:39.560> really<00:04:40.100> heavy<00:04:40.250> trigger<00:04:40.669> it's

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
heavy trigger really heavy trigger it's

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.790 
heavy trigger really heavy trigger it's
belt-fed<00:04:41.210> so<00:04:41.600> it's<00:04:41.750> unpredictable<00:04:42.470> the<00:04:42.590> belt

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
belt-fed so it's unpredictable the belt

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.320 
belt-fed so it's unpredictable the belt
sort<00:04:43.070> of<00:04:43.160> has<00:04:43.250> more<00:04:43.460> tension<00:04:43.910> at<00:04:44.030> certain

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
sort of has more tension at certain

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.140 
sort of has more tension at certain
points<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:45.190> so<00:04:46.190> it's<00:04:46.310> hard<00:04:46.520> to<00:04:46.580> predict<00:04:46.970> when

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
points and so it's hard to predict when

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.400 
points and so it's hard to predict when
it's<00:04:47.270> going<00:04:47.300> to<00:04:47.450> release<00:04:47.720> and<00:04:48.020> what<00:04:48.200> kind<00:04:48.380> of

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
it's going to release and what kind of

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.540 
it's going to release and what kind of
pull<00:04:48.620> you're<00:04:48.770> going<00:04:48.919> to<00:04:48.980> get<00:04:49.100> this<00:04:49.190> is<00:04:49.340> very

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
pull you're going to get this is very

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.150 
pull you're going to get this is very
predictable<00:04:49.870> it's<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:51.080> same<00:04:51.290> every<00:04:51.560> time<00:04:51.590> and

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
predictable it's the same every time and

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.010 
predictable it's the same every time and
you<00:04:52.760> know<00:04:52.850> what<00:04:53.000> if<00:04:53.510> you've<00:04:53.660> got<00:04:53.810> double

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
you know what if you've got double

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.080 
you know what if you've got double
action<00:04:54.440> guns<00:04:54.680> that<00:04:55.460> have<00:04:55.610> heavy<00:04:55.760> trigger

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
action guns that have heavy trigger

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.670 
action guns that have heavy trigger
pulse<00:04:56.390> and<00:04:56.660> you<00:04:56.720> want<00:04:56.870> to<00:04:56.960> work<00:04:57.050> on<00:04:57.320> that<00:04:57.500> you

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
pulse and you want to work on that you

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.870 
pulse and you want to work on that you
want<00:04:57.830> to<00:04:57.890> strengthen<00:04:58.070> your<00:04:58.310> finger<00:04:58.669> and<00:04:58.820> get

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
want to strengthen your finger and get

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.130 
want to strengthen your finger and get
used<00:04:59.120> to<00:04:59.240> a<00:04:59.270> heavy<00:04:59.479> pull<00:04:59.750> this<00:04:59.870> would<00:05:00.020> be<00:05:00.110> a

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
used to a heavy pull this would be a

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.320 
used to a heavy pull this would be a
great<00:05:00.350> gun<00:05:00.560> for<00:05:00.800> training<00:05:01.100> that<00:05:01.250> way<00:05:01.430> nothing

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
great gun for training that way nothing

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.670 
great gun for training that way nothing
wrong<00:05:02.510> with<00:05:02.750> it<00:05:02.870> it's<00:05:02.990> just<00:05:03.050> got<00:05:03.350> a<00:05:03.380> heavy

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
wrong with it it's just got a heavy

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.650 
wrong with it it's just got a heavy
double<00:05:04.040> action<00:05:04.370> on<00:05:04.490> the<00:05:04.580> trigger<00:05:04.850> the<00:05:05.479> real

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
double action on the trigger the real

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.060 
double action on the trigger the real
gun<00:05:05.870> would<00:05:06.020> have<00:05:06.110> had<00:05:06.229> it's<00:05:06.380> more<00:05:06.590> of<00:05:06.650> a<00:05:06.710> single

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
gun would have had it's more of a single

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.260 
gun would have had it's more of a single
action<00:05:07.340> trigger<00:05:07.490> you<00:05:07.700> would<00:05:07.790> have<00:05:07.880> had<00:05:08.000> to<00:05:08.030> pre

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
action trigger you would have had to pre

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.750 
action trigger you would have had to pre
cock<00:05:08.540> it<00:05:08.780> pull<00:05:08.930> this<00:05:09.320> way<00:05:09.590> up<00:05:09.800> the<00:05:10.340> bolt<00:05:10.550> back

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
cock it pull this way up the bolt back

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.400 
cock it pull this way up the bolt back
essentially<00:05:11.240> then<00:05:11.840> you'd<00:05:11.960> be<00:05:12.080> in<00:05:12.110> single

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
essentially then you'd be in single

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.320 
essentially then you'd be in single
action<00:05:12.620> much<00:05:12.950> lighter<00:05:13.190> trigger<00:05:13.460> so<00:05:14.090> if<00:05:14.210> you're

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
action much lighter trigger so if you're

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.020 
action much lighter trigger so if you're
looking<00:05:14.450> for<00:05:14.750> a<00:05:14.960> realistic<00:05:15.850> replacement<00:05:16.850> for

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
looking for a realistic replacement for

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.020 
looking for a realistic replacement for
your<00:05:17.120> actual<00:05:17.479> real<00:05:17.810> feel<00:05:18.680> not<00:05:18.890> PLA<00:05:19.340> Luger<00:05:19.760> then

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
your actual real feel not PLA Luger then

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.100 
your actual real feel not PLA Luger then
this<00:05:20.180> isn't<00:05:20.360> probably<00:05:20.780> going<00:05:20.900> to<00:05:20.960> have<00:05:21.050> the

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
this isn't probably going to have the

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.520 
this isn't probably going to have the
same<00:05:21.290> Pole<00:05:21.590> but<00:05:21.770> it<00:05:21.890> does<00:05:22.070> have<00:05:22.280> a<00:05:22.310> nice<00:05:22.550> heavy

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
same Pole but it does have a nice heavy

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.570 
same Pole but it does have a nice heavy
kind<00:05:24.530> of<00:05:24.620> good<00:05:24.740> training<00:05:24.919> double<00:05:25.310> action

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
kind of good training double action

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.760 
kind of good training double action
trigger<00:05:25.700> for<00:05:26.060> you<00:05:26.120> anyways<00:05:26.479> as<00:05:27.290> I<00:05:27.470> said<00:05:27.650> before

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
trigger for you anyways as I said before

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.409 
trigger for you anyways as I said before
I'm<00:05:27.979> not<00:05:28.160> going<00:05:28.340> to<00:05:28.400> really<00:05:28.580> go<00:05:28.820> and<00:05:29.030> shoot<00:05:29.330> a

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
I'm not going to really go and shoot a

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.120 
I'm not going to really go and shoot a
whole<00:05:29.540> bunch<00:05:29.720> more<00:05:29.810> on<00:05:30.020> this<00:05:30.169> target<00:05:30.380> here<00:05:30.740> you

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
whole bunch more on this target here you

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.680 
whole bunch more on this target here you
can<00:05:31.280> check<00:05:31.400> out<00:05:31.550> my<00:05:31.669> tabletop<00:05:32.180> review<00:05:32.510> where<00:05:32.660> I

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
can check out my tabletop review where I

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.540 
can check out my tabletop review where I
put<00:05:32.990> essentially<00:05:33.919> a<00:05:33.950> hundred<00:05:34.190> rounds<00:05:34.430> into

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
put essentially a hundred rounds into

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.980 
put essentially a hundred rounds into
this<00:05:34.640> target<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:35.060> still<00:05:35.360> kept<00:05:35.600> a<00:05:35.660> really<00:05:35.750> nice

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
this target and still kept a really nice

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.860 
this target and still kept a really nice
pattern<00:05:36.260> I<00:05:36.560> am<00:05:36.590> was<00:05:37.070> able<00:05:37.370> to<00:05:37.400> get<00:05:37.610> easily<00:05:38.360> six

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
pattern I am was able to get easily six

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.350 
pattern I am was able to get easily six
magazines<00:05:39.380> or<00:05:39.560> about<00:05:39.710> 120<00:05:40.400> plus<00:05:40.610> shots<00:05:40.970> out<00:05:41.240> of

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
magazines or about 120 plus shots out of

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.390 
magazines or about 120 plus shots out of
one<00:05:41.510> co2<00:05:41.930> cartridge<00:05:42.350> so<00:05:42.500> it's<00:05:42.620> very<00:05:42.800> efficient

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
one co2 cartridge so it's very efficient

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.810 
one co2 cartridge so it's very efficient
I<00:05:43.550> was<00:05:44.180> in<00:05:44.330> the<00:05:44.479> again<00:05:45.020> you<00:05:45.229> know<00:05:45.320> the<00:05:45.440> 435<00:05:46.130> FPS

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
I was in the again you know the 435 FPS
