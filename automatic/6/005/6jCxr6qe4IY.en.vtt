kind of noticed like a super dark area I
thought<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.909> was<00:01:36.000> actually<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.479> glitch<00:01:36.780> in

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
thought it was actually like a glitch in

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080 
thought it was actually like a glitch in
the<00:01:36.990> game<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.920> where<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:38.490> black<00:01:38.820> where

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the game like where it's black where

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.940 
the game like where it's black where
they<00:01:39.180> forgot<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.659> add<00:01:39.810> texture<00:01:40.320> or<00:01:40.530> something

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
they forgot to add texture or something

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.969 
they forgot to add texture or something
but<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:41.939> actually<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> cave<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.439> just<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.770> lot

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979
