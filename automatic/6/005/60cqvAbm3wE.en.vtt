00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
each side maybe a half inch gap where

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.509 
each side maybe a half inch gap where
you<00:00:19.470> can<00:00:19.650> actually<00:00:19.890> move<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.820> trimmers<00:00:22.519> here

you can actually move the trimmers here
you<00:00:23.789> can<00:00:23.939> actually<00:00:24.150> see<00:00:24.660> where<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.220> trimmer

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
you can actually see where the trimmer

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.759 
you can actually see where the trimmer
can<00:00:26.369> move<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.539> floating<00:00:27.840> trimmer<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.560> can

move it an inch if you needed to we're

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.670 
move it an inch if you needed to we're
on<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.309> other<00:00:32.340> side<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.270> can't<00:00:33.690> if<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.260> need

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
on the other side you can't if you need

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.220 
on the other side you can't if you need
to<00:00:34.860> adjust<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.520> trimmers<00:00:35.969> for<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> window

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
to adjust the trimmers for the window

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.010 
to adjust the trimmers for the window
opening<00:00:37.860> then<00:00:38.520> obviously<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.660> wouldn't<00:00:39.840> be

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
opening then obviously you wouldn't be

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.270 
opening then obviously you wouldn't be
able<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.230> do<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.710> would<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.010> cut

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
able to do it and you would have to cut

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.490 
able to do it and you would have to cut
shims<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.510> let's<00:00:42.629> just<00:00:42.780> take<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> look<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.379> went

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
shims so let's just take a look I went

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.000 
shims so let's just take a look I went
ahead<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:43.950> drew<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.520> regular<00:00:45.379> window<00:00:46.379> framed

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
ahead and I drew a regular window framed

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.100 
ahead and I drew a regular window framed
opening<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.360> trimmers<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
opening you have the trimmers on the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.100 
opening you have the trimmers on the
side<00:00:49.350> your<00:00:49.829> king<00:00:50.100> studs<00:00:50.460> headers<00:00:51.059> your<00:00:51.629> sills

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
side your king studs headers your sills

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.939 
side your king studs headers your sills
your<00:00:52.739> cripples<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:54.079> you<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.260> see<00:00:55.500> with<00:00:55.739> this

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
your cripples and you can see with this

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.010 
your cripples and you can see with this
method<00:00:56.579> here<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.940> can<00:00:57.090> actually<00:00:57.270> move<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
method here you can actually move the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.709 
method here you can actually move the
trimmer<00:00:58.350> over<00:00:58.980> and<00:01:01.219> without<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> problem<00:01:02.719> now

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
trimmer over and without a problem now

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.359 
trimmer over and without a problem now
if<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.960> go<00:01:04.110> ahead<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.799> place<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.549> filler

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
if you go ahead and you place a filler

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.100 
if you go ahead and you place a filler
2x4<00:01:08.369> something<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.299> at<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.479> bottom<00:01:09.930> of

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
2x4 something like that at the bottom of

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.440 
2x4 something like that at the bottom of
a<00:01:10.350> header<00:01:10.760> then<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.150> see<00:01:12.299> you're<00:01:12.420> not

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
a header then you can see you're not

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.270 
a header then you can see you're not
going<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.080> able<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.260> move<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.680> unless<00:01:14.070> you

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
going to be able to move it unless you

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.760 
going to be able to move it unless you
leave<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.880> gap<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.049> clearly<00:01:16.290> see<00:01:16.619> this

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
leave a gap and you can clearly see this

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.980 
leave a gap and you can clearly see this
about<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.040> half-inch<00:01:17.549> gap<00:01:17.880> on<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.390> right<00:01:18.630> hand

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
about a half-inch gap on the right hand

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.240 
about a half-inch gap on the right hand
side<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.880> this<00:01:20.880> illustration<00:01:21.979> so<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.040> can

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
side of this illustration so you can

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.010 
side of this illustration so you can
clearly<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.909> something<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.720> this

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
clearly see that something like this

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.310 
clearly see that something like this
could<00:01:25.350> be<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.860> problem<00:01:26.479> so<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.020> again<00:01:28.290> I

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
could be a problem so I and again I

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.120 
could be a problem so I and again I
understand<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.189> more<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.700> tip<00:01:30.030> for

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
understand this is more of a tip for

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.890 
understand this is more of a tip for
framers<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.430> home<00:01:32.759> builders<00:01:33.270> than<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.750> would

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
framers and home builders than it would

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.929 
framers and home builders than it would
be<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> do-it-yourselfer<00:01:34.939> obviously

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
be for a do-it-yourselfer obviously

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.380 
be for a do-it-yourselfer obviously
you're<00:01:36.060> not<00:01:36.150> going<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.479> doing<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.960> lot<00:01:37.200> of

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
you're not going to be doing a lot of

professional home builder framing
carpenter<00:01:45.060> framing<00:01:45.479> contractor<00:01:46.200> should<00:01:46.439> be

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
carpenter framing contractor should be

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.840 
carpenter framing contractor should be
aware<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.450> things<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.990> where<00:01:49.259> this

aware of things like this where this

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.910 
aware of things like this where this
problem<00:01:50.850> could<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.390> easily<00:01:51.689> been<00:01:51.930> solved<00:01:52.619> by

problem could have easily been solved by

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.859 
problem could have easily been solved by
cutting<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> cripples<00:01:54.030> at<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.360> right<00:01:54.570> height

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
cutting the cripples at the right height

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.219 
cutting the cripples at the right height
and<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.320> wouldn't<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.710> needed<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.280> fill<00:01:57.229> the

bottom of the header but that's the way

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.700 
bottom of the header but that's the way
it<00:02:00.210> goes<00:02:00.390> that's<00:02:00.630> face<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.170> anyone<00:02:01.530> who's
