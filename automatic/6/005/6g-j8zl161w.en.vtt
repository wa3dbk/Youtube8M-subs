00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.820
 hello to all kids here I saw the crack 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.060
 10 today I bring you another video plus another 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.559
 trick over call of duty 2 and good here 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.019
 we see we have to come to this map 

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:29.849
 ok and get us a poet 'trinity and this 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.070
 trick is to be immortal in call 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.120
 of duty coast online but it only works 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.670
 in this map that we can 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.170
 drown and well we come here to this 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.610
 area in which in which if we get 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.440
 for those of us who drown 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.479
 the drowning doll is worth it and we have 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.089
 to put in the area before drowning 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:46.470
 right there you see that if not the most stuck 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:48.570
 for inside but without starting to drown 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.969
 we throw the trinity rocket and we leave 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.940
 pressed the circle we throw the bridge 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.769
 trinity we just burst when and 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.359
 when we explode we let go of the circle 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.219
 we have to leave the circle pressed 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.260
 until we throw the rocket of 30 and 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.089
 complete and we're going to stay down here 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.190
 of water, let's be immortal, 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.899
 that people can not get in the water 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.729
 we see that we do not drown and people 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.899
 when he gets in the water killing you does not 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.180
 can shoot can not kill you 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.100
 then here you will see what 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.020
 who was with me in the game comes to 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.640
 try to kill me and you see that we 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.470
 we can kill him but he shoots us and 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.870
 there is no way to kill us, then it's worth 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.120
 Well, it 's a way to be immortal 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.340
 I think it 's called water bucket either 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.530
 He can not kill you either and check it 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.700
 you but because I did not forget 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.640
 try it but let's go if we get 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.320
 pretty much below the bullets of the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.640
 enemies are not going to give you then good 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.170
 so you can put a trick here 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.119
 pretty curious call of duty coast 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.180
 online and as I said we throw the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.130
 trinity let's press the circle and 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.720
 when the trinity has just fallen 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.520
 we let go we did not skip before because 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.840
 if we let go before we will not leave 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.800
 the trick and then good you see that we 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.960
 we are under the water we are 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.070
 immortal and here you see my friend 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.860
 He was coming to kill me all the time 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.540
 so he could kill me and he could not kill me 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.520
 no way and I could kill him 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.800
 perfectly then well then I hope 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.600
 let this trick serve you, it is enough 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.130
 curious and pretty good the truth if you 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.280
 you liked it and want more tricks left 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.280
 a like and until the next kids 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.280
