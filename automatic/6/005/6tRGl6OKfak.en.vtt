bad<00:02:06.120> to<00:02:06.420> take<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.140> look<00:02:07.380> later<00:02:09.650> yeah<00:02:10.650> this<00:02:10.920> is

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
bad to take a look later yeah this is

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.990 
bad to take a look later yeah this is
basically<00:02:12.110> of<00:02:13.110> course<00:02:13.320> you<00:02:13.680> can<00:02:13.920> yeah<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.610> can

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
basically of course you can yeah you can

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.200 
basically of course you can yeah you can
do<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.330> move<00:02:15.540> in<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.010> vertical<00:02:17.010> plane<00:02:17.490> I'm

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
do that move in the vertical plane I'm

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.250 
do that move in the vertical plane I'm
in<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:18.780> case<00:02:19.160> but<00:02:20.160> exist<00:02:20.610> about<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.990> should

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
in this case but exist about you should

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:32.750 
in this case but exist about you should
go<00:02:22.530> like<00:02:22.890> this

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.570 

it's<00:02:33.510> not<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:34.830> well<00:02:35.159> execute<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:37.250> but<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.280> think

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
it's not to well execute it but I think

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.229 
it's not to well execute it but I think
you<00:02:38.700> will<00:02:38.849> get<00:02:39.000> what<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.209> mean<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.700> hope<00:02:42.090> you

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
you will get what I mean so I hope you

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.770

since<00:02:45.780> they're<00:02:46.019> also<00:02:46.140> less<00:02:46.379> gangster<00:02:47.040> odds<00:02:47.220> I

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
since they're also less gangster odds I

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.970 
since they're also less gangster odds I
think<00:02:47.580> every<00:02:47.909> minute<00:02:48.450> tutorial<00:02:48.599> can<00:02:49.110> help<00:02:49.290> out

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
think every minute tutorial can help out

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.170 
think every minute tutorial can help out
there<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:51.360> make<00:02:51.480> gang<00:02:51.870> more<00:02:52.080> popular<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:53.180> we

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
there to make gang more popular and we

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.559 
there to make gang more popular and we
can<00:02:54.360> share<00:02:54.569> more<00:02:54.690> tricks<00:02:55.080> with<00:02:55.290> each<00:02:55.440> other

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
can share more tricks with each other

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.560 
can share more tricks with each other
and<00:02:57.569> when<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.810> say<00:02:58.019> I<00:02:58.200> see
