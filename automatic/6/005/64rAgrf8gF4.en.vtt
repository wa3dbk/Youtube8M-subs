and you can see already over there that
we've<00:00:16.859> got<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.279> village<00:00:17.760> roofed<00:00:18.390> forest<00:00:18.570> swamp

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
we've got a village roofed forest swamp

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.189 
we've got a village roofed forest swamp
bird<00:00:19.920> forest<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:21.029> bunch<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.390> planes<00:00:21.779> around

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
bird forest and a bunch of planes around

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.130 
bird forest and a bunch of planes around
and<00:00:22.470> spawn<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.060> quite<00:00:24.210> cool<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.779> I'd

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
and spawn so that is quite cool and I'd

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.950 
and spawn so that is quite cool and I'd
say<00:00:25.410> let's<00:00:25.680> take<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> look<00:00:26.189> at<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:27.119> map<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
say let's take a look at the map of the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.380 
say let's take a look at the map of the
seed<00:00:28.230> because<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.340> think<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.119> more

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
seed because I think that this is more

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.510 
seed because I think that this is more
interesting<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.230> see<00:00:31.800> right<00:00:31.980> now<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.160> see

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
interesting to see right now to see

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.700 
interesting to see right now to see
where<00:00:32.700> all<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.969> biomes<00:00:33.239> are<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.780> as<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.590> can

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
where all the biomes are and as you can

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.670 
where all the biomes are and as you can
see<00:00:34.770> here's<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.370> spawn<00:00:35.700> right<00:00:36.350> here<00:00:37.350> next<00:00:37.530> to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
see here's the spawn right here next to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.740 
see here's the spawn right here next to
the<00:00:37.770> village<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.480> area<00:00:39.719> you

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
the village and this is the area you

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.110 
the village and this is the area you
spawn<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:41.010> quite<00:00:41.280> nice<00:00:41.460> place<00:00:41.850> to

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
spawn and it's a quite nice place to

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.569 
spawn and it's a quite nice place to
spawn<00:00:42.329> actually<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.200> then<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> swamp

there's even a witch hut here which we

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.049 
there's even a witch hut here which we
will<00:00:48.120> check<00:00:48.300> out<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.780> just<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.350> second<00:00:49.910> then<00:00:50.910> of

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
will check out in just a second then of

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.090 
will check out in just a second then of
course<00:00:51.300> we've<00:00:51.480> got<00:00:51.510> all<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> biomes<00:00:52.379> again<00:00:52.800> or

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
course we've got all the biomes again or

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.529 
course we've got all the biomes again or
the<00:00:53.430> biome<00:00:53.670> types<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:55.730> 1945<00:00:56.730> blocks<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.329> Sam

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
the biome types in 1945 blocks the Sam

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.860 
the biome types in 1945 blocks the Sam
so<00:00:57.750> under<00:00:58.020> 2000<00:00:58.530> blocks<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.270> that<00:01:00.270> means<00:01:00.539> that

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
so under 2000 blocks and that means that

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.930 
so under 2000 blocks and that means that
we've<00:01:01.140> got<00:01:01.170> jungle<00:01:01.920> here<00:01:02.129> we've<00:01:02.309> got<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.730> ice

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
we've got jungle here we've got the ice

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.890 
we've got jungle here we've got the ice
Plains<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.049> ice<00:01:04.379> spikes<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:05.100> course<00:01:05.600> may<00:01:06.600> send

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
Plains the ice spikes of course may send

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.109 
Plains the ice spikes of course may send
the<00:01:07.080> south<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.710> all<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> hot<00:01:08.159> biomes<00:01:08.490> kind<00:01:08.970> of

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
the south and all the hot biomes kind of

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.120 
the south and all the hot biomes kind of
are<00:01:09.270> here<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> south<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.710> code<00:01:10.890> ones

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
are here in the south and the code ones

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.590 
are here in the south and the code ones
are<00:01:11.400> here<00:01:11.729> over<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:13.170> side<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:14.600> then

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
are here over on this side and then

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.499 
are here over on this side and then
there<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.500> mega<00:01:17.100> taiga<00:01:17.460> up<00:01:17.610> here<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
there is the mega taiga up here in the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.179 
there is the mega taiga up here in the
north<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.049> want<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.409> get<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> pot<00:01:19.890> soil

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
north if you want to get the pot soil

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.880 
north if you want to get the pot soil
and<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:21.210> think<00:01:21.630> we<00:01:21.780> should<00:01:21.990> take<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.229> look<00:01:22.439> now<00:01:22.500> in

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
and I think we should take a look now in

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.280 
and I think we should take a look now in
the<00:01:23.070> game<00:01:23.220> because<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.909> think<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.659> seed

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
the game because I think that this seed

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.620 
the game because I think that this seed
has<00:01:25.320> some<00:01:26.040> quite<00:01:26.369> pretty<00:01:26.729> places<00:01:27.119> we<00:01:27.600> should

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
has some quite pretty places we should

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.530 
has some quite pretty places we should
definitely<00:01:28.409> check<00:01:28.680> out<00:01:28.939> so<00:01:29.939> let<00:01:30.119> me<00:01:30.210> bring<00:01:30.420> up

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
definitely check out so let me bring up

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.080 
definitely check out so let me bring up
the<00:01:30.750> map<00:01:30.900> for<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.799> screen<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.850> top

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
the map for you on the screen on the top

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.230 
the map for you on the screen on the top
like<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.220> then<00:01:35.220> we<00:01:35.310> can<00:01:35.490> have<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> look<00:01:35.850> so

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
like this and then we can have a look so

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.420 
like this and then we can have a look so
let's<00:01:36.540> first<00:01:37.170> go<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.680> village<00:01:37.890> over<00:01:38.250> here

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
let's first go to this village over here

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.830 
let's first go to this village over here
because<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.880> think<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.240> will<00:01:39.420> be<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.689> place

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
because I think this will be the place

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.200 
because I think this will be the place
where<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.259> spent<00:01:40.560> your<00:01:40.979> first<00:01:41.070> night<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.729> what

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
where we spent your first night and what

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.789 
where we spent your first night and what
you<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.450> see<00:01:42.630> over<00:01:42.780> here<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.320> you've<00:01:43.530> got

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
you can see over here is that you've got

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.490 
you can see over here is that you've got
so<00:01:44.280> many<00:01:44.490> animals<00:01:44.970> around<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.290> even

biomes<00:03:13.260> we've<00:03:14.260> got<00:03:14.470> a<00:03:14.500> nice<00:03:14.800> transition<00:03:15.370> in

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
biomes we've got a nice transition in

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.770 
biomes we've got a nice transition in
between<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:16.300> janya<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:18.300> code<00:03:19.300> biomes<00:03:19.600> oh

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
between the janya and the code biomes oh

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.750 
between the janya and the code biomes oh
I<00:03:20.050> haven't<00:03:20.500> seen<00:03:20.620> this<00:03:20.920> back<00:03:21.190> in<00:03:21.400> quite<00:03:21.730> a

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
I haven't seen this back in quite a

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.690 
I haven't seen this back in quite a
while<00:03:21.880> no<00:03:22.300> snow<00:03:22.600> in<00:03:22.780> this<00:03:22.990> stripe<00:03:23.700> interesting

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
while no snow in this stripe interesting

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.410 
while no snow in this stripe interesting
over<00:03:25.030> here<00:03:25.240> -<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:26.010> but<00:03:27.010> yeah<00:03:27.610> I<00:03:27.910> like<00:03:28.240> the

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
over here - and but yeah I like the

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.180 
over here - and but yeah I like the
transition<00:03:28.750> from<00:03:29.020> the<00:03:29.200> white<00:03:29.350> to<00:03:29.740> the<00:03:29.890> green

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
transition from the white to the green

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.840 
transition from the white to the green
so<00:03:30.970> let's<00:03:31.960> maybe<00:03:32.320> quickly<00:03:32.950> go<00:03:33.070> over<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.550> here

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
so let's maybe quickly go over to here

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.330 
so let's maybe quickly go over to here
because<00:03:34.210> here<00:03:34.450> we've<00:03:34.600> got<00:03:34.840> then<00:03:35.080> ice<00:03:35.620> spikes

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
because here we've got then ice spikes

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.580 
because here we've got then ice spikes
even<00:03:36.850> next<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.180> jungle<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:37.810> I<00:03:38.170> think<00:03:38.440> that

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
even next to jungle and I think that

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.830 
even next to jungle and I think that
this<00:03:38.770> is<00:03:38.950> this<00:03:39.250> is<00:03:39.430> a<00:03:39.550> quite<00:03:39.910> nice<00:03:40.150> place<00:03:40.570> it's

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
this is this is a quite nice place it's

favourite biomes next to each other the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.800 
favourite biomes next to each other the
ice<00:03:45.010> spikes<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:45.790> goes<00:03:46.030> pretty<00:03:46.300> pretty<00:03:46.600> well

with<00:03:46.990> the<00:03:47.170> green<00:03:47.380> of<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.680> jungle<00:03:47.980> over<00:03:48.070> here

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
with the green of the jungle over here

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.870 
with the green of the jungle over here
or<00:03:49.320> yeah<00:03:50.320> maybe<00:03:50.530> I'm<00:03:50.710> wrong<00:03:50.890> let<00:03:51.250> me<00:03:51.310> know<00:03:51.550> what

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
or yeah maybe I'm wrong let me know what

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.310 
or yeah maybe I'm wrong let me know what
you<00:03:52.000> think<00:03:52.150> about<00:03:52.390> this<00:03:52.540> and<00:03:52.780> that's<00:03:52.960> even

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
you think about this and that's even

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.470 
you think about this and that's even
another<00:03:53.560> temple<00:03:54.250> but<00:03:54.730> now<00:03:54.880> I<00:03:54.910> think<00:03:55.030> we<00:03:55.300> should

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
another temple but now I think we should

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.320 
another temple but now I think we should
quickly<00:03:55.720> go<00:03:55.960> back<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:57.370> spawn<00:03:57.640> because<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:57.970> want

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
quickly go back to spawn because I want

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330 
quickly go back to spawn because I want
