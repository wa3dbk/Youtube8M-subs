00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
back into these little cups okay there's

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.650 
back into these little cups okay there's
that<00:04:35.440> here's<00:04:35.860> a<00:04:35.920> really<00:04:36.130> hard<00:04:36.430> one<00:04:36.610> y'all<00:04:36.850> this

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
that here's a really hard one y'all this

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.340 
that here's a really hard one y'all this
is<00:04:38.460> so<00:04:39.460> hard<00:04:39.760> to<00:04:39.940> cut<00:04:40.180> because<00:04:40.480> you<00:04:40.870> don't<00:04:41.170> know

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
is so hard to cut because you don't know

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.650 
is so hard to cut because you don't know
exactly<00:04:41.530> know<00:04:42.070> where<00:04:42.250> that<00:04:42.370> seat<00:04:42.700> is<00:04:42.880> but<00:04:43.480> see

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
exactly know where that seat is but see

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.380 
exactly know where that seat is but see
it's<00:04:43.840> kind<00:04:44.050> of<00:04:44.110> oblong<00:04:44.710> this<00:04:45.340> direction<00:04:45.940> so

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
it's kind of oblong this direction so

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.050 
it's kind of oblong this direction so
I'm<00:04:46.540> thinking<00:04:46.870> that<00:04:46.900> seed<00:04:47.410> is<00:04:47.710> going<00:04:48.490> that

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
I'm thinking that seed is going that

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.120 
I'm thinking that seed is going that
direction<00:04:49.480> so<00:04:49.690> I'm<00:04:50.260> going<00:04:50.470> to<00:04:50.530> cut<00:04:50.710> down<00:04:50.890> one

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
direction so I'm going to cut down one

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.910 
direction so I'm going to cut down one
side<00:04:51.430> that's<00:04:51.880> good<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.570> they<00:04:53.260> cut<00:04:53.530> down<00:04:53.560> the

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
side that's good and they cut down the

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.120 
side that's good and they cut down the
other<00:04:54.100> side<00:04:54.190> oh<00:04:54.820> and<00:04:55.810> I<00:04:56.140> kind<00:04:56.410> of<00:04:56.500> ran<00:04:56.680> into<00:04:57.010> the

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
other side oh and I kind of ran into the

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.690 
other side oh and I kind of ran into the
seat<00:04:57.430> so<00:04:58.210> I'll<00:04:58.960> try<00:04:59.320> to<00:04:59.380> kind<00:04:59.620> of<00:04:59.800> go<00:04:59.950> around<00:05:00.100> it

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
seat so I'll try to kind of go around it

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.990 
seat so I'll try to kind of go around it
there<00:05:01.600> it<00:05:01.690> is<00:05:01.870> and<00:05:02.350> then<00:05:02.980> I've<00:05:03.550> got<00:05:03.790> these

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
there it is and then I've got these

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.330 
there it is and then I've got these
sides<00:05:04.390> to<00:05:04.660> deal<00:05:04.840> with<00:05:05.080> well<00:05:05.380> that's<00:05:05.530> okay<00:05:05.980> you

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
sides to deal with well that's okay you

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.640 
sides to deal with well that's okay you
just<00:05:06.550> kind<00:05:06.730> of<00:05:06.760> have<00:05:07.000> to<00:05:07.180> do<00:05:07.330> it<00:05:07.510> this<00:05:08.200> is<00:05:08.260> not

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
just kind of have to do it this is not

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.190 
just kind of have to do it this is not
the<00:05:09.040> most<00:05:09.790> ripe<00:05:10.800> mango<00:05:11.800> I've<00:05:11.920> ever<00:05:12.160> seen

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
the most ripe mango I've ever seen

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.560 
the most ripe mango I've ever seen
so<00:05:14.200> it<00:05:15.070> would<00:05:15.310> be<00:05:15.520> a<00:05:15.550> little<00:05:16.000> bit<00:05:16.090> easier<00:05:16.240> if

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
so it would be a little bit easier if

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.140 
so it would be a little bit easier if
you<00:05:16.630> had<00:05:16.840> a<00:05:16.870> riper<00:05:17.440> mango<00:05:17.800> but<00:05:18.370> then<00:05:18.550> cut<00:05:18.970> off

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
you had a riper mango but then cut off

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.480 
you had a riper mango but then cut off
the<00:05:19.420> peeling<00:05:19.900> and<00:05:20.110> here's<00:05:20.770> your<00:05:20.980> pieces<00:05:21.340> of

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
the peeling and here's your pieces of

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.180 
the peeling and here's your pieces of
mango<00:05:21.880> you<00:05:22.840> could<00:05:23.020> cut<00:05:23.260> off<00:05:23.410> the<00:05:23.440> peeling<00:05:24.040> on

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
mango you could cut off the peeling on

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.130 
mango you could cut off the peeling on
all<00:05:24.460> of<00:05:24.610> them<00:05:24.760> and<00:05:24.940> then<00:05:25.420> chop<00:05:25.780> them<00:05:25.960> all

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
all of them and then chop them all

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.740 
all of them and then chop them all
together<00:05:26.380> or<00:05:27.250> if<00:05:27.700> you<00:05:27.850> want<00:05:28.030> to<00:05:28.090> do<00:05:28.240> that<00:05:28.420> fancy

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
together or if you want to do that fancy

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.470 
together or if you want to do that fancy
little<00:05:29.230> thing<00:05:29.440> that<00:05:29.650> the<00:05:29.890> chef's<00:05:30.190> do<00:05:30.460> and<00:05:31.420> I

little thing that the chef's do and I

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.240 
little thing that the chef's do and I
have<00:05:31.630> to<00:05:31.660> use<00:05:31.930> this<00:05:32.200> side<00:05:32.500> of<00:05:32.620> my<00:05:32.740> knife<00:05:32.950> so

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
have to use this side of my knife so

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.630 
have to use this side of my knife so
maybe<00:05:33.490> I'll<00:05:33.700> put<00:05:34.300> it<00:05:34.420> down<00:05:34.570> on<00:05:34.720> my<00:05:34.900> board<00:05:35.580> so<00:05:36.580> I

maybe I'll put it down on my board so I

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.120 
maybe I'll put it down on my board so I
don't<00:05:37.030> cut<00:05:37.210> through<00:05:37.540> to<00:05:37.660> my<00:05:37.780> fingers<00:05:38.260> or<00:05:39.100> my

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
hand the palm of my hand and then I will

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.210 
hand the palm of my hand and then I will
cut<00:05:43.180> on<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.480> angle<00:05:43.960> like<00:05:44.140> this<00:05:46.770> now<00:05:47.770> see<00:05:48.070> what

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
cut on the angle like this now see what

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.920 
cut on the angle like this now see what
I've<00:05:48.370> got<00:05:48.580> I've<00:05:48.820> got<00:05:48.850> a<00:05:49.030> little<00:05:49.330> angle<00:05:49.720> thing

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
I've got I've got a little angle thing

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.770 
I've got I've got a little angle thing
going<00:05:50.260> there<00:05:50.440> and<00:05:50.650> then<00:05:51.280> you<00:05:51.490> can<00:05:51.730> turn<00:05:52.570> it

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
going there and then you can turn it

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.870 
going there and then you can turn it
inside<00:05:53.200> out<00:05:53.230> like<00:05:53.620> this<00:05:53.920> and<00:05:54.280> if<00:05:54.580> it<00:05:54.700> was<00:05:54.850> a

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
inside out like this and if it was a

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.700 
inside out like this and if it was a
little<00:05:55.090> bit<00:05:55.300> riper<00:05:55.600> it<00:05:56.080> would<00:05:56.260> do<00:05:56.410> it<00:05:56.500> a<00:05:56.560> little

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
little bit riper it would do it a little

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.290 
little bit riper it would do it a little
bit<00:05:56.950> better<00:05:57.160> but<00:05:57.430> then<00:05:57.640> you<00:05:57.820> can<00:05:58.030> cut<00:05:58.270> off

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
bit better but then you can cut off

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.410 
bit better but then you can cut off
those<00:05:59.140> little<00:05:59.380> squares<00:05:59.980> too<00:06:00.460> that's<00:06:01.060> another

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.420 
those little squares too that's another

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.350 
those little squares too that's another
way<00:06:01.660> to<00:06:01.930> cut<00:06:02.530> up<00:06:02.650> a<00:06:02.800> mango<00:06:03.280> and<00:06:03.550> this<00:06:04.090> little

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
way to cut up a mango and this little

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.900 
way to cut up a mango and this little
