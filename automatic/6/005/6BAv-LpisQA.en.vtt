00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.940 

to<00:01:53.540> my<00:01:53.690> head<00:01:53.900> about<00:01:54.200> every<00:01:54.530> two<00:01:54.680> minutes

after canoeing with you I don't believe

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.650 
after canoeing with you I don't believe
in<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.340> theory<00:05:10.670> of<00:05:10.700> a<00:05:10.880> safe<00:05:11.090> seat<00:05:11.330> there<00:05:11.510> are

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
in the theory of a safe seat there are

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.660 
in the theory of a safe seat there are
no<00:05:11.840> safe<00:05:12.410> seats<00:05:12.710> in<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:12.950> connote<00:05:13.250> so<00:05:13.610> you

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
no safe seats in that connote so you

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.190 
no safe seats in that connote so you
think<00:05:14.000> there's<00:05:14.210> a<00:05:14.300> shot<00:05:14.510> that<00:05:14.570> the<00:05:14.870> Liberals

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
think there's a shot that the Liberals

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.180 
think there's a shot that the Liberals
can<00:05:15.380> form<00:05:15.590> a<00:05:15.650> minority<00:05:16.100> government

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190

can form a minority government
absolutely<00:05:17.060> I<00:05:17.270> think<00:05:17.510> we<00:05:17.720> can<00:05:17.870> form<00:05:18.050> a

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
absolutely I think we can form a

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.370 
absolutely I think we can form a
