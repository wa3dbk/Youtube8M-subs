00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
is perhaps one of the most important

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.129 
is perhaps one of the most important
features<00:06:05.219> for<00:06:05.429> many<00:06:05.610> that<00:06:06.089> is<00:06:06.360> having<00:06:07.050> the

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
features for many that is having the

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:09.290 
features for many that is having the
ability<00:06:07.379> to<00:06:07.740> actually<00:06:08.069> run<00:06:08.610> the<00:06:08.669> operating

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.790 
ability to actually run the operating
system<00:06:09.779> when<00:06:10.349> you<00:06:10.439> look<00:06:10.589> at<00:06:10.679> these

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
system when you look at these

it's<00:06:18.809> obvious<00:06:19.319> that<00:06:19.349> these<00:06:19.769> are<00:06:19.919> not<00:06:20.069> steep

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
it's obvious that these are not steep

already<00:06:25.619> meet<00:06:26.219> these<00:06:26.429> requirements<00:06:26.639> listed

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:27.449 
already meet these requirements listed

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:29.269 
already meet these requirements listed
here<00:06:27.779> and<00:06:27.899> it's<00:06:28.649> important<00:06:29.069> to<00:06:29.099> know<00:06:29.249> that

00:06:29.269 --> 00:06:29.279 
here and it's important to know that

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:31.579 
here and it's important to know that
many<00:06:29.579> systems<00:06:29.879> that<00:06:30.269> currently<00:06:30.899> run<00:06:31.229> Windows

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:31.589 
many systems that currently run Windows

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:35.509 
many systems that currently run Windows
XP<00:06:32.039> will<00:06:32.610> also<00:06:33.089> be<00:06:33.269> able<00:06:33.389> to<00:06:33.869> run<00:06:34.050> Windows<00:06:34.439> 8<00:06:34.619> so

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:35.519 
XP will also be able to run Windows 8 so

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:37.189 
XP will also be able to run Windows 8 so
you<00:06:35.579> may<00:06:35.819> have<00:06:35.939> all<00:06:36.179> the<00:06:36.389> existing<00:06:36.659> Hardware

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 
you may have all the existing Hardware

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:39.290 
you may have all the existing Hardware
right<00:06:37.439> now<00:06:37.619> that<00:06:37.860> you<00:06:37.979> need<00:06:38.189> in<00:06:38.429> order<00:06:38.849> to<00:06:39.029> run

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
right now that you need in order to run

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.269 
right now that you need in order to run
this<00:06:39.419> operating<00:06:39.809> system<00:06:39.919> well<00:06:40.919> those<00:06:41.159> are

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:41.279 
this operating system well those are

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:44.839 
this operating system well those are
