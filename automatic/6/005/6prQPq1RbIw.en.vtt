00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 welcome to tutorial yes like games 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.360
 me the zelda ocarina of time master 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.710
 quest in german so i have a long time too 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.740
 she then looked for the solution 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.240
 she is very simple so first 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.070
 download links are in the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.460
 description that I add after so 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.869
 a year so first project 64 1.6 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.150
 I have here and then once the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.980
 downloaded in the full name 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.859
 it is called the legend of zelda 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.150
 ocarina of time master quest so then 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.859
 click on it if I have that 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.420
 installed clique then glory 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.640
 You can certainly open already 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.469
 and then on the legend of zelda ocarina 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.680
 of time parrilla 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:42.809
 then it will load here now for 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.390
 apps are very nice and i click 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.559
 here's what's going on 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.629
 if I 'm still quieter afterward 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.489
 actually try the team 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.600
 To start with how their German can 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.280
 Of course no English no joke but 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.160
 if we want to, for example, now 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.820
 players in german have it as well 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.670
 then want to have 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.309
 so we go to my god where was that 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.159
 no that was wrong 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.939
 well let's go then and then 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.770
 let's go to languages â€‹â€‹select like this 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.659
 click on it and I already have 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.520
 German selected if not you click 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.560
 then double-click on it and and you can 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.880
 you between english german &amp; friends 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.680
 decisive that is in English that 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.600
 means German French English 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.180
 and then you push up and then 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.860
 So now from here we can 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.979
 on crutches and tadler because it is German 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.350
 So how can I do it again? 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.170
 that somehow that everytime if 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.509
 that is called the schied then must 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.850
 You look at settings if that works 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.220
 then goes to setting shows again 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.899
 then go to options on settings 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.060
 you on option again and then stands 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.930
 here at the game start no here selected 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.670
 Save saved 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.159
 they are saved and always when 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.200
 you have faithfully saved then and 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.479
 then the cross presses so did not have 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.060
 Now you are working 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.619
 open again to green and that would have to 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.370
 then automatically be in German 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.570
 Let's have a look 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.080
 I can not decide now yes 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.020
 well see man is in German so that 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.700
 was a small tutorial and if so 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.230
 it interested you have a look 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.340
 let's play on that will be in 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.050
 be uploaded shortly or 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.120
 or namely then on from 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.080
 zelda master quest I wonder if 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.520
 I'll do it 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.170
 how many parts i need if it is 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.970
 It's pretty hard to really make it 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.950
 probably and see you then 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.170
 maybe hurt or play 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.120
 Another let's play gives thumbs thumbs up 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.209
 Highly commented and I hope I could 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.410
 I could help you 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.410
 that 's it then until then
