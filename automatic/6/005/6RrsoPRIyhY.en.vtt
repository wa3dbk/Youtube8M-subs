00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.970
 the implantation had support from Brazil may have been a precipitous step 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.160
 I have to meet 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.389
 the beginning 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.259
 introducing elements 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:13.899
 however a year and a half ago more or less 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:16.199
 right after the championship 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.199
 the government would create 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.449
 deliberate adoption of the paulo system 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.449
 called television broadcasts to establish the implementation treaty 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.919
 we thought that deployment should only be done 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.370
 in 74 or 75 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.660
 the argument would be correct 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.260
 It was necessary for the person with peace efforts beyond the prison to 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.940
 to break 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.470
 we felt that the market is still the market widely exploited profession 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.350
 black and white 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.780
 both in terms of the volume of sectors 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.780
 I want Roberto's cousin to respect his schedule 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.400
 but the government also has strong arguments 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.430
 and nothing of the increase color television 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.610
 is a technological advance and a country of illusion Brazil 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.359
 in explosive expansion 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.650
 could not delay the deployment of the system 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.740
 and our reasons and the government's reasons come 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.930
 which is exactly March 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.350
 72 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.480
 we have both 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.640
 Deployment on Mouse Over 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.870
 should be in 74 tries 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.740
 on small tanajura bridges that had good reasons too 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.180
 lived to want to deploy then however anticipation the quota system 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.830
 the mother should ask the next question 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.189
 everybody talks 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.510
 Then I ask, cousin. 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.950
 with the consequences 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.510
 Search by company: 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.380
 and all that aside 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.409
 in summary the main use opening that predictions 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.160
 according to the 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.400
 it's a date between us 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.180
 and it was an ordeal 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.650
 with aging 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.450
 it is currently impossible to pass 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.560
 What novelty? 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.100
 on investment 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.850
 noble technician 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.850
 the members to fulfill their side 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.760
 of the thing 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.149
 google comes from our country 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.149
 Meanwhile 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.589
 the dollar was right 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:17.499
 trying to implant 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.419
 to deliver the woman's time resume 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:21.939
 there is still this moment 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.109
 Now I ask you respect, I loved you. 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.109
 cadu would artistically sport 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.779
 of municipalities 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:33.909
 promotion 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.139
 no employees 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.879
 on the television label 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.589
 this expiration who even in plenary 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:42.069
 could not have made progress 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.089
 a government sponsorship 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:46.850
 for a specific schedule to leave power 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.009
 in chile for the dome 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:52.859
 the subject then went to ventilated haiti 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.239
 ours along with ministers who tie 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.639
 it's a Corsican 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.869
 already at 90 days 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:01.299
 Findings on the service by virtue of 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.059
 I understand this caution 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:05.449
 we will have to keep programming 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:07.289
 when falcao fernando paulo 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:11.339
 programming so that the investment goes beyond our 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:12.769
 economic forces 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.090
 if we show the team to be interesting, would the government sponsor a 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.819
 with a day a week in each of the vedetas we are not three 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.759
 a high-level program 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:24.999
 that could be a step beyond 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:28.309
 of what they do of the black river why the color television 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.169
 it will inevitably be with marcel television to break in relation to 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:32.829
 radio 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.919
 it was a televised radio 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.400
 color will be so its first moments unfortunately for us 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.459
 black and white television in color 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:44.870
 Unfortunately not 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.659
 this will be the scenario and we would argue 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.429
 who have already made effort to implement the technical equipment 

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:55.359
 since we have made big investments it would be fair to present 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.520
 technically I saw artfully 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.840
 something beyond 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.329
 black and white 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.389
 in black and white 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.539
 He thought they would have to take his place. 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.559
 since on paper we have already done 

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:13.329
 and that he would be interested in government bodies to be 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.120
 and high-level programs to truly 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.499
 has fulfilled its objective what it would be and improve the quality of 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:24.259
 be made in tub
