available now you can't create a

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.810 
available now you can't create a
different<00:00:52.289> pattern<00:00:52.500> if<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.010> want<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.550> but<00:00:53.699> you

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
different pattern if you want to but you

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.939 
different pattern if you want to but you
can<00:00:53.940> also<00:00:54.059> use<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.480> pen<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.110> fingerprint<00:00:55.800> or<00:00:55.890> a

can also use a pen a fingerprint or a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.380 
can also use a pen a fingerprint or a
password<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.460> be<00:00:56.670> able<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.850> take<00:00:57.030> advantage<00:00:57.360> of

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
password to be able to take advantage of

password to be able to take advantage of
this<00:00:57.480> feature<00:00:57.660> now<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.590> essentially
