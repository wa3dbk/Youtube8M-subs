00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:14.330
 one of the windows phone phones more 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.099

 to playback technology this panel is 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.679
 able to show deep blacks and 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.689
 that come to be confused with the frame 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.100
 of the phone itself while offering 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.170
 high visibility even in 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.250
 environments with abundant natural light their 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.230
 colors are rich and slightly 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.460
 saturated partly thanks to the contrast 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.920
 with the black background of the interface 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.050
 windows phones its rear camera 8 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.940
 megapixels with carl zeiss optics you can 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.530
 record video at 720p while the 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.629
 videoconference camera has a 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.370
 resolution of a mega pixel without reaching 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.079
 rival a compact camera 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.789
 main offers a high quality and 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.430
 places the 900 lumia in the upper part of 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.020
 the photographic pyramid the software and the 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.280
 appearance of aluminum 900 do not differ 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.760
 from any other windows phone 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.410
 phones 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.239
 except for the inclusion of the typical 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.289
 own apps from nokia to 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.729
 difference from what happens with the 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:08.899
 Third-party software are 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.770
 truly practical and the great 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.090
 quality 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.560
 the operating system behaves 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.090
 very fluid way more even than the 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.399
 most windows mobile phones 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.149
 phone 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.100
 unfortunately Microsoft has confirmed 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.869
 that the lumia 900 can not be updated 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.329
 windows by 8 so you can only 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.500
 go from 7.5 to 7.8, thus obtaining the 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.000
 new interface and some of the 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.110
 key characteristics of the next great 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.110
 operating system revision 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.920
 ergonomically speaking it is clear that 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.009
 The Lumia 900 is not a telephone for 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.710
 small pockets or 128 millimeters 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.950
 long 69 millimeters wide and 12 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.110
 millimeters thick 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.700
 in the upper part we find the 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.500
 microusb port for charging 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.210
 data transfers as well as the 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.909
 audio connector 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.060
 behind as usual, the camera 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.380
 Main photos equipped with a led flash 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.570
 on the right side are the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.310
 sound controls on and camera 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.290

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.660
 amazing power speaker 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.520
