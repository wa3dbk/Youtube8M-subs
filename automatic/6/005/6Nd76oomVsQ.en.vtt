00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.420
 [Music] 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.410
 March this 31 quad gets out of driving 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.179
 rather with brutally good weather you see 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.130
 also already bonanza or so because it 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.810
 just right it was afraid though 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.670
 also that's why so many people 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.760
 We will be on the go 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.760
 watch 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:31.120
 sonnet in here 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:33.340
 and find out who's going off with me 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.989
 have this morning the forester from the 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.580
 driving out of the woods watch from me 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.960
 home only hope that he does not 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.100
 others put it back pure driving 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.110
 sometime if the weather stays that way 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.050
 can assume that in a flash 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.670
 the trees are really green again 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.379
 knew that this weird lane 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.390
 or far as I even have a name here 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.520
 has properly signposted normal 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.070
 There are no cars here 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.750
 ever a good sign 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.550
 The tree is really suspicious 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.380
 ship man is indeed depends already 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.920
 longer every case a very interesting one 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.570
 route 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.379
 I definitely do not want to 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.450
 fall down that's a back and forth 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.729
 here 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.049
 I really wanted to go to the castle 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.960
 show but I already see 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.060
 hikers on these tours back there and 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.409
 that 's just what that is 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.240
 we do not need it now if there 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.280
 so many people on the road are doing that 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.560
 not fun but in the weather it was 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.030
 of course it became clear Monday is ne we 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.049
 will definitely be back 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.619
 and then look again after the 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.140
 right 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.610
 that is, there is someone right there 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.140
 because we we do not need now 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.789
 in the basket change are any 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.409
 That's why touris are also from behind 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:43.270
 Range approach and not before 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:46.539
 even that was also someone is long 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.179
 worn or galloped long 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.069
 probably even correct 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.679
 really summery here goes the moto 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.579
 cross season right back down there 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.959
 there is a little blue hunter stand 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.549
 sees relatively short from the 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.959
 thing that worries me a bit 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.369
 prepares in these broken off 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.049
 I always had tree trunks everywhere 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.880
 hang if he drunter then driver 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.160
 it falls now upon us it is the 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.640
 gone we have often driven up 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.290
 or 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.680
 was not down today 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.420
 drove back my last video was 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.720
 By the way, so shaky because I'm in sony 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.670
 have stabilized vegas and 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.500
 stabilizing it does not have that way now 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.329
 better done in things only slightly 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.310
 were shaky then you could tell 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.109
 but if we are in things too 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.609
 are more involved then that 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:32.410
 is simply totally hagg laid then then 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:35.280
 easy movements are left out 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.280
 and that's really shit 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.610
 these funny rain gutters were lena 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.290
 also a very cool outlook here 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.920
 I have a settlement or something 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.390
 again such a gutter you have this 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.620
 then things do not arise anymore 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:54.330
 completely straight is a horny place 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.330
 the way up for this 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.020
 that's a cool looks cool here 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.300
 argued briefly flattened and with 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.610
 the rock formations nothing 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.410
 rock formation it looks strong there 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.410
 below you can see the cars driving 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.460
 quite cool that you usually notice only when 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.650
 you really like that with the quad or with 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.780
 Motorcycle through the woods and through the 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.240
 meadows and so drives how beautiful the 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.680
 Double the environment in which one lives 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.630
 that does not even tell me 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.910
 and if you go for a walk now 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.970
 You should always be so small 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.720
 fritter was the wiso 345 kilometers 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.160
 how far do you go for a walk? 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.810
 Of course you can go for a walk 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.480
 but so much faster 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.160
 More with just a little bit 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.900
 Stop where it is really beautiful 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.700
 can not understand it why 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.010
 some people are against it 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.190
 if you just like that the environment 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.570
 explores more and more broken drive than 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.130
 any rangers with any 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.310
 cars or something you do not even 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.300
 not the garbage bag here 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.780
 such people will then come off scot-free 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.780
 from that 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.030
 really cool view is definitely 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.400
 glad that youtube not smell 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.449
 seems to exaggerate has its farmer 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.789
 just neatly insulated bottom shaft 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:24.150
 cool for such trips you need 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:26.039
 then not such a 70 ps quadrant 70 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.599
 ps engine just achieves such a clear 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:31.410
 250er and if you see everything 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.590
 what you see 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.430
 it actually comes time to where 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.520
 you want to go 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.349
 that just right where 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.389
 I also have nothing against 70 ps motor 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:45.960
 objection would we have here 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:48.780
 over again, yes we were once too 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.509
 More trees and butterflies I can 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.340
 the really only recommend for times 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:59.990
 wants to switch off from school or from 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.990
 profession you just think 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:07.139
 So I think who made that once 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.699
 once owned a enduro did he 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.349
 will always want to own one 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.610
 because it's just fun as it is 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.159
 of course it is the case with another 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.590
 if you have a 250 then you want 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:18.720
 then a 450er but that's the way it is 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.610
 at another even if you are only one 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.349
 one bmw had then one would like 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.840
 next time maybe a 3 bmw 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:27.520
 and so that's just also thought 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.949
 our passion that you just 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.090
 to nail that is nail the so 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.500
 children probably other youtubers 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.389
 The much more nail has been added 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.770
 It is more like an exploratory trip 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:41.199
 i may be so indiana jones without 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.180
 fall and things that want to kill us 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.280
 I am always with my father always 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.169
 with motorcycle with sidecar here by the 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.110
 Forestry was such an old one 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.849
 Bundeswehr motorcycle that had red 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.210
 painted or purple 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:56.440
 I think purple was, and we are having with 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.940
 the things here through the forests 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.169
 drove so the ways 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.880
 That's why my father knows the 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.880
 best finish when one is headed 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.940
 now the tail has just broken out 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.060
 where the sun comes from is real 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.900
 was really cool has a bit 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.479
 All-terrain Who do I want in the summer 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.300
 always drive through the rivers and streams 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:19.430
 and so with that again 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.360
 shit widows do here but in the 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.610
 I stay with the 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.410
 Tail-driven always stuck 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.449
 I have recently just tried it 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.370
 I have to be with my father too 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:31.669
 get rid of it because the thing then easy 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.410
 in the morass gets stuck but for the time being 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:36.319
 must that was in the behavior because mine 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:38.270
 Studying really very expensive 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:40.610
 became as I had thought 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:43.340
 that brings a lot with you 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.440
 I can afford a motorcycle unfortunately 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:51.889
 Really can not afford at the moment is indeed 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:53.690
 pity but if I would have a major 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:55.940
 I really really different 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:59.300
 drive again and so on 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:02.419
 just so weird way but so 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.220
 even if you have no or little things 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:05.990
 he gets out everywhere with the bring 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.729
 It can not be done twice 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.800
 carry away if with his quad first 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:12.040
 has fallen over for next says 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.950
 the mini brook 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:18.190
 would readjust you with friends 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:20.140
 then it was the 31 quartier knows the 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.550
 Say if you liked it then 

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.260
 I go to the big green thumb 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.900
 I'm really grateful to you for that 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:28.870
 we just stand by me like that and if 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.730
 there are now 183 people and me 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.420
 hope will be a few more so to 

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.930
 next time 

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.930
