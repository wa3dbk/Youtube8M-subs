bring up a topic that I believe is where
a<00:00:13.230> lot<00:00:13.500> of<00:00:13.530> people<00:00:14.009> go<00:00:14.280> wrong<00:00:14.309> when<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.120> comes

to weight loss it's an area that people

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.140 
to weight loss it's an area that people
don't<00:00:18.270> really<00:00:18.510> think<00:00:18.720> about<00:00:18.869> as<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.230> flaw<00:00:19.680> in

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
don't really think about as a flaw in

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.490 
don't really think about as a flaw in
dieting<00:00:21.150> but<00:00:21.539> it's<00:00:21.840> something<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.320> I've

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
dieting but it's something that I've

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.439 
dieting but it's something that I've
noticed<00:00:22.710> when<00:00:23.189> working<00:00:23.400> with<00:00:23.850> weight<00:00:24.300> loss

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
noticed when working with weight loss

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.349 
noticed when working with weight loss
clients<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.400> they<00:00:26.640> focus<00:00:26.849> too<00:00:27.240> much

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
clients and that is they focus too much

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.890 
clients and that is they focus too much
on<00:00:28.160> numbers<00:00:29.160> they<00:00:29.519> focus<00:00:29.880> too<00:00:29.910> much<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.570> their

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
on numbers they focus too much on their

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.770 
on numbers they focus too much on their
weight<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.669> how<00:00:32.669> many<00:00:32.880> pounds<00:00:33.360> they<00:00:33.480> want<00:00:33.690> to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
weight and how many pounds they want to

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.069 
weight and how many pounds they want to
lose<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.320> they<00:00:35.040> focus<00:00:35.399> less<00:00:35.730> about<00:00:36.239> changing

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
lose and they focus less about changing

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.100 
lose and they focus less about changing
their<00:00:37.680> behaviors<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.790> they<00:00:39.750> make<00:00:39.930> their

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
their behaviors and they make their

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.000 
their behaviors and they make their
goals<00:00:40.410> weight<00:00:41.010> specific<00:00:41.760> instead<00:00:42.300> of

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
goals weight specific instead of

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.549 
goals weight specific instead of
nutrition<00:00:44.010> specific<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.450> good<00:00:46.110> goal<00:00:46.350> would

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
nutrition specific so a good goal would

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.979 
nutrition specific so a good goal would

those behaviors from bad to good and

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.870 
those behaviors from bad to good and
with<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.530> pounds<00:01:31.920> will<00:01:32.009> drop<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.610> it's

with that the pounds will drop and it's

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.190 
with that the pounds will drop and it's
something<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.479> won't<00:01:33.689> even<00:01:33.810> need<00:01:34.079> to

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
something that you won't even need to

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.740 
something that you won't even need to
think<00:01:34.439> about<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.310> know<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.700> when<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.450> start

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
think about you know like when you start

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.929 
think about you know like when you start
decreasing<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.770> amount<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.220> processed

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
decreasing the amount of processed

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.060 
decreasing the amount of processed
snacks<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.509> eat<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:40.320> your<00:01:40.500> weight<00:01:40.650> will

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
snacks you eat then your weight will

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.859 
snacks you eat then your weight will
coincide<00:01:41.430> with<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.240> your<00:01:42.390> weight<00:01:42.600> will

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
coincide with that and your weight will

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.440 
coincide with that and your weight will
decrease<00:01:43.320> along<00:01:43.530> with<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.450> it's

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
decrease along with that and it's

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.960 
decrease along with that and it's
something<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.079> think<00:01:46.369> will<00:01:47.369> lead<00:01:47.610> to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
something that I think will lead to

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.719 
something that I think will lead to
lasting<00:01:48.240> weight<00:01:48.810> loss<00:01:49.100> because<00:01:50.100> some<00:01:50.340> people

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
lasting weight loss because some people

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.550 
lasting weight loss because some people
they'll<00:01:51.270> do<00:01:51.420> anything<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.079> lose<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.409> weight

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
they'll do anything to lose the weight

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.810 
they'll do anything to lose the weight
if<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.100> means<00:01:53.310> consuming<00:01:55.130> 1200<00:01:56.130> calorie<00:01:56.549> packs

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
if it means consuming 1200 calorie packs

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.660 
if it means consuming 1200 calorie packs
a<00:01:57.090> day<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.540> that's<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.259> then<00:01:58.920> they<00:01:59.100> will<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.490> it

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
a day and that's it then they will do it

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.359 
a day and that's it then they will do it
but<00:02:00.329> whenever<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.200> do<00:02:01.409> things<00:02:01.920> like<00:02:02.100> that

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
behaviors but instead you're just

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.559 
behaviors but instead you're just
focusing<00:02:07.979> on<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.250> weight<00:02:08.429> loss<00:02:08.670> then<00:02:09.420> it

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
focusing on the weight loss then it

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.420 
focusing on the weight loss then it
won't<00:02:09.690> be<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.959> lasting<00:02:10.500> weight<00:02:10.709> loss<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.280> it's

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
won't be a lasting weight loss and it's

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.010 
won't be a lasting weight loss and it's
something<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:12.060> you're<00:02:12.270> going<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.690> have<00:02:12.840> to

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
something that you're going to have to

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.309 
something that you're going to have to
reap

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
again and again and again and then you

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.709 
again and again and again and then you
get<00:02:16.260> stuck<00:02:16.439> in<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.799> yo-yo<00:02:17.159> dieting<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:17.909> it

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:18.719 
get stuck in the yo-yo dieting so it

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.319 
get stuck in the yo-yo dieting so it
really<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.109> important<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.950> identify<00:02:20.760> where

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
it's again a set salt sugar intake

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.929 
it's again a set salt sugar intake

that I'm going to make a healthy choice
and<00:03:05.129> by<00:03:05.639> doing<00:03:05.879> that<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.510> after<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.930> few<00:03:07.169> weeks

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
and by doing that and after a few weeks

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.110 
and by doing that and after a few weeks
doing<00:03:07.739> out<00:03:07.859> one<00:03:08.069> night<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.310> week<00:03:08.579> and<00:03:08.939> then

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
doing out one night a week and then

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.000 
doing out one night a week and then
increasing<00:03:09.629> it<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.109> two<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.439> three<00:03:10.650> times<00:03:10.829> a

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
increasing it to two to three times a

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.280 
increasing it to two to three times a
week<00:03:11.129> then<00:03:11.909> it<00:03:12.060> will<00:03:12.209> slowly<00:03:12.480> become<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:13.019> habit

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
week then it will slowly become a habit

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.409 
week then it will slowly become a habit
and<00:03:13.620> that's<00:03:14.129> where<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.549> weight<00:03:14.730> loss<00:03:14.939> will

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419 
and that's where the weight loss will

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.020 
and that's where the weight loss will
stick<00:03:15.780> that's<00:03:16.109> when<00:03:16.500> when<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.400> scale<00:03:17.699> drops

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
stick that's when when the scale drops

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.689 
stick that's when when the scale drops
it'll<00:03:18.359> stay<00:03:18.840> dropping<00:03:19.409> if<00:03:19.859> that<00:03:20.099> makes<00:03:20.340> sense

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
it'll stay dropping if that makes sense

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.819 
it'll stay dropping if that makes sense
and<00:03:21.389> you<00:03:21.540> won't<00:03:21.689> see<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.019> scale<00:03:22.319> going<00:03:22.560> back

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
and you won't see the scale going back

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.089 
and you won't see the scale going back
up<00:03:23.069> so<00:03:23.729> again<00:03:23.849> my<00:03:24.509> tidbit<00:03:25.079> for<00:03:25.319> today<00:03:25.590> focus

don't focus on weight loss and along

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.219 
don't focus on weight loss and along
with<00:03:31.979> that<00:03:32.220> try<00:03:32.729> not<00:03:32.939> to<00:03:33.120> focus<00:03:33.329> too<00:03:33.780> much<00:03:33.810> on

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:34.229 
with that try not to focus too much on

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:37.339 
with that try not to focus too much on
weighting<00:03:34.650> yourself<00:03:35.069> as<00:03:35.280> well<00:03:35.689> stick<00:03:36.689> to<00:03:36.930> at

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
weighting yourself as well stick to at

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.159 
weighting yourself as well stick to at
the<00:03:37.889> max<00:03:38.159> weighing<00:03:38.639> yourself<00:03:38.870> one<00:03:39.870> time<00:03:40.139> a

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
the max weighing yourself one time a

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.199 
the max weighing yourself one time a
week<00:03:40.470> in<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.889> mornings<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.639> that's<00:03:41.939> it

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
week in the mornings and that's it

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.849 
week in the mornings and that's it
because<00:03:42.930> when<00:03:43.109> you<00:03:43.199> start<00:03:43.470> weighing<00:03:43.709> yourself

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
because when you start weighing yourself

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.249 
because when you start weighing yourself
multiple<00:03:44.669> times<00:03:44.939> throughout<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.569> week<00:03:45.599> then

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:46.259 
multiple times throughout the week then

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:47.839 
multiple times throughout the week then
it<00:03:46.439> really<00:03:46.979> does<00:03:47.129> affect<00:03:47.310> your<00:03:47.639> mood

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
it really does affect your mood

multiple times a day

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.030 
multiple times a day
if<00:03:51.750> you<00:03:51.900> weigh<00:03:52.019> yourself<00:03:52.109> before<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:52.859> eat
