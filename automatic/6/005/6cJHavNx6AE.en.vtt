00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 good a central work one of the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.350
 large structural works together with the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.940
 work of parana of the palms that is the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.920
 water intake here to the plant 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.170
 sewage treatment one 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.360
 historical debt that the nation had with 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.090
 berazategui with the province of good 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.460
 airs and with fundamentally with the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.900
 users of what was the old works 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.060
 Currently sanitary water and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.740
 Argentine sanitation to it from a 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.110
 company recovered by the president 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.180
 Kirchner 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.560
 in the private company that was 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.200
 previously he suffered the 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.900
 contract for the presence of nitrates in 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.600
 water had planned to start this work in 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.490
 in 2016 that is two years from now and today 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.590
 the president is going to inaugurate on the 8th 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.809
 May with which is a new reality 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.790
 of this decade gained in water 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.710
 and sanitation are 200 years of the 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.750
 creation of the fatherland and 100 years from 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.120
 that we are turning in front of the 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.870
 City of Buenos Aires- here in the in the 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.610
 river of silver and berazategui was taken 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.790
 as synonymous with an unpleasant place 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.910
 because loading the porteños 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.500
 they loaded their sewage effluents or 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.000
 the opposite ones are placed in the goal 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.100
 are properly treated which 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.470
 protects not only the health of the 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.910
 80 versatile but also good 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.490
 airs of the city ​​of Buenos Aires of the 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.590
 silver of venezuela inlet of quilmes 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.170
 of the whole riverside city river of the 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.870
 silver downstream of the city of 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.229
 buenos aires I think it's a breakthrough 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.970
 huge significant historical and that 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.680
 clearly mark 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.810
 the government's inclusion policy 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.370
 national problem is solved not 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.220
 only aesthetic but fundamentally 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.160
 sanitary and sanitary and also one thing 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.570
 that will be recovered it would seem that 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.060
 the environment exists in some 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.360
 sides and on the other side I have never seen 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.290
 big complaints in relation to the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.690
 situation of the issuer that I had here 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.330
 Argentine waters 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.370
 today we are transforming a day to one 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.540
 of the most serious health problems 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.610
 of Argentina- in a reality 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.770
 effective concrete and that is more health 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.310
 for the inhabitants of the river littoral 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.310
