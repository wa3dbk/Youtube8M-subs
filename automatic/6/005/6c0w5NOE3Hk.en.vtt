caused by a motorcycle accident was just

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.130 
caused by a motorcycle accident was just
dipping<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.619> water<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.189> 15<00:01:20.610> minutes

dipping it in the water for 15 minutes
do<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.229> think<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> water<00:01:22.860> was<00:01:23.159> actually<00:01:23.369> a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
do you think the water was actually a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.719 
do you think the water was actually a
disinfectant<00:01:24.600> solution<00:01:25.250> yes<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.430> thought<00:01:26.670> it

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
disinfectant solution yes I thought it

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.640 
disinfectant solution yes I thought it
was<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> disinfectant<00:01:27.810> solution<00:01:27.900> at<00:01:28.259> first<00:01:28.470> but

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
was a disinfectant solution at first but

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.530 
was a disinfectant solution at first but
later<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.920> learned<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.579> was<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:30.090> acidic

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
later I learned that it was just acidic

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.670 
later I learned that it was just acidic
water<00:01:30.840> how<00:01:31.829> did<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.130> feel<00:01:32.369> about<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:33.619> well<00:01:34.619> I

water how did you feel about that well I

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.770 
water how did you feel about that well I
doubted<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.520> would<00:01:35.670> heal<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.060> injury<00:01:41.780> don't

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
