00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.480
 others probed about the widow and that 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.010
 a rain of money whip anna anna is one 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.510
 my best friends from home 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.340
 and always when we talk to each other 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.930
 visit then that has become a tradition 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.060
 that I have that make-up we have 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.619
 somehow both totally enjoy it and us 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.999
 have the camera running and 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.999
 I hope you like the video 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.180
 we started with foundation two meters 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.250
 katies with plus of those the brightest 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.410
 colors and I have only with so 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.239
 a slip applied to the left of 11 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.250
 just to spread the knowledge and 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.050
 then again with the garbage technics 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.449
 brush the skin a bit 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.859
 worked in and then the basin too 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.660
 Concealer, and that's what you're talking about 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.969
 finish concealer and I only open it 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.410
 tours and impurities applied when 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.590
 Do not use it under the eyes 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.590
 should 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.969
 I'll have that easy for me then 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.379
 eyebrows emphasized because the 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.019
 actually does not really and also does 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.550
 not like when to be strongly emphasized 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.420
 and that's why I have it only very discreet 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.670
 and then I am among the 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.710
 eyes still this container of reval de 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.450
 loop applied really bright 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.250
 and actually quite well cover and 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.920
 Therefore, I can really recommend 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.560
 and then I have an eyeshadow 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.950
 base applied and blinded with 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.119
 a brush 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.810
 then i have this credit shadow from 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.810
 food applied 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.310
 and then I have the two palette 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.770
 uses the tones tutti core and 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.180
 thies rixen brighter shimmering 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.740
 eyeshadow I have over the entire 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.660

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.680

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:55.580
 This matt he light brown eyeshadow 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.020
 we give thies means and so that 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.330
 all a bit blinded and then 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.150
 I still have an eyeshadow, so to speak 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.470
 Pulled as an eyeliner and was with 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
 blackout that's just a stop 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.979
 normal black is tapping on the weather 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.570
 and I still have that with me 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.310
 a clean brush a bit 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.770
 the mud so that a bit too 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.630
 mau looks and then I have it on 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.370
 showered out of eyelashes and her oscar 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:25.580
 applied and means that the sn to 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:26.900
 Everyday then I have the glass 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.340
 I did not use that though 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.840
 here to make a close-up 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.580
 I showed another one 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.230
 Actually we have bound computer science 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.510
 but that of aunt minna fabienne 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.980
 Pietsch is very similar to that and 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.209
 Then we are on the way to Lipstick 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.220
 Runner has a mac 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.970
 lipstick in the color viva glam for 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.010
 bought me one full name and the one 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.840
 is very dark and the red and very 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.300
 dull and very noticeable and very nice 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.680
 and thus receives for the parents 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.360
 a little less blatant, I have the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.390
 applied with a lip 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.459
 if it was easy and yes that was it 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.260
 even the last one protects the way from that 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.640
 then you will become a partner again 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.340
 falling out of names 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.840
 the make up and 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.940
 that was it with the video I hope 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.000
 you liked it then you are not 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.000
