00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
interval running and it has to do with

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.020 
interval running and it has to do with
your<00:01:44.690> rest<00:01:45.280> bout<00:01:46.280> okay

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
your rest bout okay

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.120 
your rest bout okay
the<00:01:47.390> recovery<00:01:47.930> or<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.200> rest<00:01:48.560> bout<00:01:48.799> is<00:01:48.979> going

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
the recovery or the rest bout is going

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.770 
the recovery or the rest bout is going
to<00:01:49.189> be<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.340> most<00:01:49.610> important<00:01:50.240> determining

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
to be the most important determining

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.120 
to be the most important determining
factor<00:01:50.810> as<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:52.460> how<00:01:52.820> hard<00:01:53.479> you<00:01:54.380> perceive<00:01:54.860> an

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
factor as to how hard you perceive an

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.830 
factor as to how hard you perceive an
interval<00:01:55.460> running<00:01:55.610> workout<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.210> be<00:01:56.360> now<00:01:56.720> let

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
interval running workout to be now let

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.280 
interval running workout to be now let
me<00:01:56.930> give<00:01:57.049> you<00:01:57.110> an<00:01:57.200> example<00:01:57.260> of<00:01:57.590> this<00:01:57.729> so<00:01:58.729> on<00:01:59.689> the

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
example I had them do probability a year

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.110 
example I had them do probability a year
ago<00:02:12.859> I<00:02:12.889> had<00:02:12.950> them<00:02:13.159> do<00:02:13.249> a<00:02:13.279> specific<00:02:13.549> workout

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
ago I had them do a specific workout

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.610 
ago I had them do a specific workout
where<00:02:14.419> they<00:02:14.569> did<00:02:14.749> a<00:02:14.959> 200-meter<00:02:15.919> run

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
where they did a 200-meter run

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.589 
where they did a 200-meter run
okay<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.160> good<00:02:17.610> like<00:02:17.760> I'm<00:02:17.879> to<00:02:18.030> retractable

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
okay so a good like I'm to retractable

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.000 
okay so a good like I'm to retractable
like<00:02:18.750> 90%<00:02:19.560> plus<00:02:20.099> pace<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.450> 200<00:02:21.989> meters<00:02:22.230> 200

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
like 90% plus pace so 200 meters 200

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.280 
like 90% plus pace so 200 meters 200
meters<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.489> recover<00:02:23.849> now<00:02:24.569> as<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.870> mentioned<00:02:25.230> in

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
meters to recover now as I mentioned in

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.640 
meters to recover now as I mentioned in
a<00:02:25.739> previous<00:02:25.769> video<00:02:27.140> using<00:02:28.140> intervals<00:02:28.440> based

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
a previous video using intervals based

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.309 
a previous video using intervals based
on<00:02:28.860> distance<00:02:29.310> can<00:02:29.610> be<00:02:29.730> deceiving<00:02:30.209> because<00:02:30.510> it

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
on distance can be deceiving because it

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.589 
on distance can be deceiving because it
might<00:02:31.530> take<00:02:31.739> maybe<00:02:32.010> 30<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.459> 35<00:02:32.940> seconds<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.480> run

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
might take maybe 30 to 35 seconds to run

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.600 
might take maybe 30 to 35 seconds to run
that<00:02:33.690> 200<00:02:34.110> meters<00:02:34.319> but<00:02:35.040> as<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.430> work

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
that 200 meters but as the work

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.400 
that 200 meters but as the work
progresses<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.629> guys<00:02:36.810> start<00:02:37.110> losing

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
progresses and the guys start losing

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.050 
progresses and the guys start losing
their<00:02:37.650> minds<00:02:38.040> like<00:02:38.099> they're<00:02:38.280> all<00:02:38.400> like<00:02:38.610> lucid

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
their minds like they're all like lucid

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.190 
their minds like they're all like lucid
you<00:02:39.090> know<00:02:39.239> they're<00:02:39.390> all<00:02:39.480> like<00:02:39.660> delusional

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
you know they're all like delusional

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.320 
you know they're all like delusional
because<00:02:40.410> we're<00:02:40.500> getting<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:40.769> tired<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.879> 200

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
because we're getting so tired that 200

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.780 
because we're getting so tired that 200
meter<00:02:42.510> recovery<00:02:42.959> turns<00:02:43.769> into<00:02:43.980> three<00:02:44.459> minutes

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
meter recovery turns into three minutes

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.020 
meter recovery turns into three minutes
sometimes<00:02:45.209> so<00:02:45.930> what<00:02:46.110> we<00:02:46.230> did<00:02:46.379> is<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:47.340> instituted

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
sometimes so what we did is I instituted

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.410 
sometimes so what we did is I instituted
what<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.870> called<00:02:49.200> forced<00:02:50.040> recovery<00:02:50.760> intervals

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
what I called forced recovery intervals

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.780 
what I called forced recovery intervals
so<00:02:52.049> this<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.470> really<00:02:53.099> applicable<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.430> a

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
so this is a really applicable to a

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.850 
so this is a really applicable to a
track<00:02:54.150> where<00:02:54.450> let's<00:02:54.750> say<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:54.989> this<00:02:55.110> in<00:02:55.260> in<00:02:55.500> this

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
track where let's say in this in in this

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.240 
track where let's say in this in in this
scenario<00:02:56.340> they<00:02:57.150> did<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.390> gave<00:02:57.720> them<00:02:57.900> 35<00:02:58.680> seconds

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
scenario they did I gave them 35 seconds

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.250 
scenario they did I gave them 35 seconds
to<00:02:59.280> complete<00:02:59.700> 200<00:03:00.209> meters<00:03:00.450> okay<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.019> they<00:03:01.110> had

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
to complete 200 meters okay so they had

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.140 
to complete 200 meters okay so they had
35<00:03:01.799> seconds<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.310> do<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.519> two<00:03:02.640> enemy<00:03:02.879> to<00:03:02.970> run

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
35 seconds to do the two enemy to run

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.460 
35 seconds to do the two enemy to run
and<00:03:03.360> then<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.319> instituted<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.780> maximum<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.959> 1

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
and then I instituted a maximum of 1

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.640 
and then I instituted a maximum of 1
minutes<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.250> recover<00:03:08.549> on<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:10.019> 200<00:03:10.470> meter

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
minutes to recover on the 200 meter

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.100 
minutes to recover on the 200 meter
recovery<00:03:11.069> okay<00:03:11.579> if<00:03:11.940> they<00:03:12.480> were<00:03:12.540> lagging

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
recovery okay if they were lagging

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.960 
recovery okay if they were lagging
behind<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.950> if<00:03:14.069> it<00:03:14.190> took<00:03:14.370> them<00:03:14.519> more<00:03:14.730> than<00:03:14.879> a

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
behind and if it took them more than a

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.380 
behind and if it took them more than a
minute

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
minute

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.940 
minute
you<00:03:15.720> know<00:03:15.810> I'd<00:03:15.900> be<00:03:16.079> right<00:03:16.319> there<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.560> push<00:03:16.769> them

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
you know I'd be right there to push them

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.530 
you know I'd be right there to push them
through<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.250> let<00:03:17.819> them<00:03:17.910> know<00:03:18.030> hey<00:03:18.150> guys<00:03:18.329> you

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
through I let them know hey guys you

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.390 
through I let them know hey guys you
know<00:03:18.629> you<00:03:18.660> guys<00:03:18.780> you're<00:03:19.049> like<00:03:19.079> you're<00:03:20.069> 50

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
know you guys you're like you're 50

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.890 
know you guys you're like you're 50
meters<00:03:20.609> away<00:03:20.760> from<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.180> start<00:03:21.480> point<00:03:21.660> and

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
meters away from the start point and

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.509 
meters away from the start point and
there's<00:03:22.019> 10<00:03:22.230> seconds<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.680> go<00:03:22.799> so<00:03:23.010> pick<00:03:23.280> up<00:03:23.400> the

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
there's 10 seconds to go so pick up the

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.640 
there's 10 seconds to go so pick up the
recovery<00:03:23.760> speed<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.870> reason<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.260> did<00:03:25.470> that<00:03:25.500> is

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
recovery speed the reason I did that is

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.940 
recovery speed the reason I did that is
because<00:03:26.209> recovery<00:03:27.209> is<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.930> most<00:03:28.260> important

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
because recovery is the most important

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.520 
because recovery is the most important
factor<00:03:29.459> in<00:03:29.489> your<00:03:30.450> interval<00:03:30.900> running<00:03:31.019> workout

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
factor in your interval running workout

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.580 
factor in your interval running workout
because<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:33.090> can<00:03:33.269> sprint<00:03:33.780> as<00:03:33.959> fast<00:03:33.989> as<00:03:34.470> you

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
because you can sprint as fast as you

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.710 
because you can sprint as fast as you
want<00:03:34.769> but<00:03:35.730> if<00:03:35.819> you<00:03:35.940> have<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.090> long<00:03:36.359> recovery

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
want but if you have a long recovery

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.589 
want but if you have a long recovery
period<00:03:37.109> no<00:03:37.709> problem<00:03:38.099> ok<00:03:38.519> as<00:03:38.940> soon<00:03:39.000> as<00:03:39.239> we<00:03:39.359> start

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
period no problem ok as soon as we start

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.080 
period no problem ok as soon as we start
chopping<00:03:40.079> away<00:03:40.170> that<00:03:40.500> recovery<00:03:41.069> now<00:03:41.700> that

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
chopping away that recovery now that

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.479 
chopping away that recovery now that
Sprint's<00:03:42.660> seems<00:03:43.079> a<00:03:43.170> lot<00:03:43.380> more<00:03:43.620> daunting<00:03:43.859> ok

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
Sprint's seems a lot more daunting ok

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.039 
Sprint's seems a lot more daunting ok
because<00:03:45.060> here's<00:03:45.419> what<00:03:45.510> happens<00:03:45.870> as<00:03:46.019> a

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
because here's what happens as a

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.069 
because here's what happens as a
beginner<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.889> typically<00:03:47.190> start<00:03:47.280> off<00:03:47.549> with<00:03:47.790> a

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
beginner you typically start off with a

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.680 
beginner you typically start off with a
just<00:03:49.079> as<00:03:49.169> an<00:03:49.319> example<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.889> 1<00:03:50.459> to<00:03:50.669> 4<00:03:50.940> work<00:03:51.359> to<00:03:51.510> rest

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
just as an example a 1 to 4 work to rest

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.960 
just as an example a 1 to 4 work to rest
ratio<00:03:52.079> so<00:03:52.319> you<00:03:52.380> sprint<00:03:52.799> for<00:03:53.400> let's<00:03:53.519> say<00:03:53.669> 30

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
ratio so you sprint for let's say 30

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.330 
ratio so you sprint for let's say 30
seconds<00:03:54.419> recover<00:03:54.780> for<00:03:54.989> two<00:03:55.169> minutes<00:03:55.440> right<00:03:55.950> 30

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
seconds recover for two minutes right 30

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.000

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
seconds 2 minutes 1 to 4 as you get

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.909 
seconds 2 minutes 1 to 4 as you get
fitter<00:03:59.250> we<00:03:59.970> lessen<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.959> recovery<00:04:01.410> so<00:04:01.650> then<00:04:01.799> it

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
fitter we lessen the recovery so then it

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.620 
fitter we lessen the recovery so then it
as<00:04:02.069> you<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.639> know<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:02.790> get<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.120> point<00:04:03.419> where

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
as you you know you get to a point where

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.920 
as you you know you get to a point where
it's<00:04:03.780> 1<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.500> 2<00:04:04.709> 1<00:04:05.579> to<00:04:05.819> 1<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:06.389> now<00:04:06.510> it's<00:04:06.660> 30

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
it's 1 to 2 1 to 1 so now it's 30

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.740 
it's 1 to 2 1 to 1 so now it's 30
seconds<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.440> work<00:04:07.560> 30<00:04:08.220> seconds<00:04:08.639> off<00:04:08.760> right<00:04:09.540> now

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
seconds of work 30 seconds off right now

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.120 
seconds of work 30 seconds off right now
we're<00:04:09.989> starting<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.590> get<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:10.709> little<00:04:10.799> bit<00:04:10.980> more

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
we're starting to get a little bit more

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.129 
we're starting to get a little bit more
taxing<00:04:11.639> and<00:04:11.819> as<00:04:12.419> you<00:04:12.569> can<00:04:12.690> get<00:04:12.840> fitter<00:04:13.049> than

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
taxing and as you can get fitter than

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.129 
taxing and as you can get fitter than
that<00:04:13.700> we<00:04:14.700> start<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.000> get<00:04:15.090> 2<00:04:15.389> to<00:04:15.510> 1<00:04:15.660> right<00:04:15.930> so

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
that we start to get 2 to 1 right so

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.690 
that we start to get 2 to 1 right so
we're<00:04:16.289> working<00:04:16.410> twice<00:04:16.859> as<00:04:17.039> long<00:04:17.190> as<00:04:17.430> we're

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
we're working twice as long as we're

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.550 
we're working twice as long as we're
recovering<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.570> if<00:04:19.019> you're<00:04:19.169> an<00:04:19.260> advanced

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
recovering and if you're an advanced

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.020 
recovering and if you're an advanced
runner<00:04:19.889> this<00:04:20.160> is<00:04:20.310> where<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.669> intervals

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
runner this is where the intervals

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.270 
runner this is where the intervals
really<00:04:21.539> start<00:04:21.780> to<00:04:21.840> make<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.019> huge<00:04:22.410> huge<00:04:23.010> impact

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
really start to make a huge huge impact

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.540 
really start to make a huge huge impact
on<00:04:24.210> your<00:04:24.479> performance<00:04:24.710> let's<00:04:25.710> say<00:04:25.979> you're

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
on your performance let's say you're

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.040 
on your performance let's say you're
training<00:04:26.820> for<00:04:26.909> a<00:04:27.030> 5k<00:04:27.270> race<00:04:27.659> which<00:04:27.900> is

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
training for a 5k race which is

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.570 
training for a 5k race which is
personally<00:04:28.409> my<00:04:28.469> favorite<00:04:28.950> race<00:04:29.070> because<00:04:29.430> it's

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
personally my favorite race because it's

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.080 
personally my favorite race because it's
the<00:04:29.729> short

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
the short

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.790 
the short
and<00:04:30.360> I'm<00:04:30.449> not<00:04:30.540> a<00:04:30.600> huge<00:04:30.930> fan<00:04:31.260> of<00:04:31.290> running<00:04:31.680> long

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
and I'm not a huge fan of running long

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.030 
and I'm not a huge fan of running long
distance<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.400> because<00:04:33.210> I<00:04:33.300> like<00:04:33.419> running<00:04:33.600> fast

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
distance and because I like running fast

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.460 
distance and because I like running fast
so<00:04:35.040> if<00:04:35.340> you<00:04:35.669> want<00:04:35.820> to<00:04:35.880> run<00:04:36.000> faster<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:37.139> best

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
so if you want to run faster the best

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.770 
so if you want to run faster the best
way<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.650> do<00:04:37.860> that<00:04:38.010> is<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.460> train<00:04:38.820> faster<00:04:39.570> than

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
way to do that is to train faster than

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.200 
way to do that is to train faster than
at<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.470> pace<00:04:40.710> where<00:04:41.520> you're<00:04:41.729> going<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:42.030> run

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
at the pace where you're going to run

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.420 
at the pace where you're going to run
okay<00:04:42.780> so<00:04:43.260> let's<00:04:43.440> say<00:04:43.620> you're<00:04:43.800> at<00:04:43.919> a<00:04:43.949> work<00:04:44.190> to

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
okay so let's say you're at a work to

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.070 
okay so let's say you're at a work to
rest<00:04:44.610> ratio<00:04:44.970> of<00:04:45.090> one<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.479> one<00:04:45.630> right<00:04:45.840> so<00:04:45.990> you're

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
rest ratio of one to one right so you're

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.260 
rest ratio of one to one right so you're
going<00:04:46.199> to<00:04:46.260> spin<00:04:46.530> for<00:04:46.710> 30<00:04:46.889> seconds<00:04:47.370> recover<00:04:48.060> for

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
going to spin for 30 seconds recover for

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.120 
going to spin for 30 seconds recover for
30<00:04:48.479> seconds<00:04:48.900> spin<00:04:49.110> for<00:04:49.320> 30<00:04:49.470> seconds<00:04:49.830> recover

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
30 seconds spin for 30 seconds recover

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.010 
30 seconds spin for 30 seconds recover
for<00:04:50.310> 30<00:04:50.460> seconds<00:04:50.820> you<00:04:51.270> do<00:04:51.330> that<00:04:51.449> workout<00:04:51.780> and

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
for 30 seconds you do that workout and

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.350 
for 30 seconds you do that workout and
you're<00:04:52.680> working<00:04:52.979> for<00:04:53.160> let's<00:04:53.400> say<00:04:53.520> 15<00:04:53.940> to<00:04:54.090> 20

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
you're working for let's say 15 to 20

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.460 
you're working for let's say 15 to 20
minutes<00:04:54.600> right<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:54.930> average<00:04:55.350> fast<00:04:55.800> 5k<00:04:56.400> pace

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
minutes right the average fast 5k pace

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.450 
minutes right the average fast 5k pace
okay<00:04:58.470> so<00:04:58.800> you've<00:04:58.919> done<00:04:58.949> that<00:04:59.130> I<00:04:59.190> work<00:04:59.310> at<00:04:59.400> a

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
okay so you've done that I work at a

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.219 
okay so you've done that I work at a
couple<00:04:59.699> times<00:04:59.880> now<00:05:00.600> you're<00:05:00.780> ready<00:05:00.930> to<00:05:01.020> take<00:05:01.169> it

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
couple times now you're ready to take it

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.930 
couple times now you're ready to take it
up<00:05:01.380> to<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.500> next<00:05:01.710> level<00:05:01.770> so<00:05:02.310> now<00:05:02.490> you're<00:05:02.820> going

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
up to the next level so now you're going

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.850 
up to the next level so now you're going
to<00:05:03.030> you're<00:05:03.419> going<00:05:03.510> to<00:05:03.570> Sprint's<00:05:04.139> or<00:05:04.290> work<00:05:04.680> at

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
to you're going to Sprint's or work at

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.550 
to you're going to Sprint's or work at
90<00:05:05.250> percent<00:05:05.430> of<00:05:05.850> your<00:05:06.030> maximum<00:05:06.300> speed<00:05:06.450> for<00:05:06.840> one

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
90 percent of your maximum speed for one

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.969 
90 percent of your maximum speed for one
minute<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:08.060> recover<00:05:09.060> for<00:05:09.450> still<00:05:09.690> 30<00:05:10.470> seconds

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
minute and recover for still 30 seconds

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.270 
minute and recover for still 30 seconds
so<00:05:11.610> now<00:05:11.760> we've<00:05:12.000> doubled<00:05:12.510> the<00:05:12.600> work<00:05:12.990> and<00:05:13.470> we've

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
so now we've doubled the work and we've

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.879 
so now we've doubled the work and we've
maintained<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.720> recovery<00:05:16.229> it's<00:05:16.440> still<00:05:16.650> 30

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
maintained the recovery it's still 30

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.129 
maintained the recovery it's still 30
seconds<00:05:17.340> can<00:05:17.850> if<00:05:18.090> we<00:05:18.150> wanted<00:05:18.750> to<00:05:18.840> get<00:05:18.900> even

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
seconds can if we wanted to get even

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:20.960 
seconds can if we wanted to get even
more<00:05:19.290> technical<00:05:19.740> as<00:05:19.800> you<00:05:19.950> get<00:05:20.070> fitter<00:05:20.280> we<00:05:20.790> can

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
more technical as you get fitter we can

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.480 
more technical as you get fitter we can
maintain<00:05:21.090> two<00:05:21.630> minutes<00:05:21.870> of<00:05:21.960> work<00:05:22.139> or<00:05:23.100> one

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
maintain two minutes of work or one

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.080 
maintain two minutes of work or one
minute<00:05:23.729> of<00:05:23.789> work<00:05:24.200> 15<00:05:25.200> seconds<00:05:25.800> to<00:05:25.950> recover<00:05:26.100> so

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
minute of work 15 seconds to recover so

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.670 
minute of work 15 seconds to recover so
as<00:05:27.240> we<00:05:27.479> start<00:05:27.690> chopping<00:05:28.199> away<00:05:28.289> at<00:05:28.440> that

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
as we start chopping away at that

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.529 
as we start chopping away at that
recovery<00:05:29.190> interval<00:05:29.580> it's<00:05:30.120> almost<00:05:30.360> like

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
recovery interval it's almost like

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.420 
recovery interval it's almost like
there's<00:05:30.720> no<00:05:30.900> recovery<00:05:31.410> at<00:05:31.530> all<00:05:31.620> and<00:05:31.889> as<00:05:32.250> I've

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
there's no recovery at all and as I've

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.830 
there's no recovery at all and as I've
mentioned<00:05:32.460> before<00:05:32.789> interval<00:05:33.510> training<00:05:33.780> is

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
mentioned before interval training is

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.750 
mentioned before interval training is
very<00:05:34.050> inefficient<00:05:34.530> from<00:05:35.070> a<00:05:35.160> fuel<00:05:35.520> utilization

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
very inefficient from a fuel utilization

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.840 
very inefficient from a fuel utilization
standpoint<00:05:36.750> so<00:05:37.229> it's<00:05:37.410> actually<00:05:37.590> easier<00:05:37.979> to

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
standpoint so it's actually easier to

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.719 
standpoint so it's actually easier to
run<00:05:39.330> faster<00:05:39.960> non-stop<00:05:40.650> than<00:05:41.250> if<00:05:41.370> you<00:05:41.490> kept

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
run faster non-stop than if you kept

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.700 
run faster non-stop than if you kept
stopping<00:05:42.180> and<00:05:42.450> starting<00:05:42.690> but<00:05:43.289> that's<00:05:43.440> what<00:05:43.620> we

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
stopping and starting but that's what we

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.830 
stopping and starting but that's what we
want<00:05:43.889> to<00:05:43.979> do<00:05:44.130> we<00:05:44.789> want<00:05:44.970> to<00:05:45.060> train<00:05:45.330> your<00:05:45.510> body<00:05:45.660> to

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
want to do we want to train your body to

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.710 
want to do we want to train your body to
become<00:05:46.410> to<00:05:47.130> overcome<00:05:47.639> that<00:05:47.789> inefficiency<00:05:48.210> so

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
become to overcome that inefficiency so

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.350 
become to overcome that inefficiency so
during<00:05:48.990> races<00:05:49.500> you're<00:05:50.250> able<00:05:50.520> to<00:05:50.550> bypass<00:05:51.090> the

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
during races you're able to bypass the

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.520 
during races you're able to bypass the
person<00:05:51.840> in<00:05:51.960> front<00:05:52.050> of<00:05:52.169> you

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
person in front of you

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.830 
person in front of you
Sprint's<00:05:53.190> up<00:05:53.310> a<00:05:53.430> hill<00:05:53.610> you<00:05:53.940> know<00:05:54.360> go<00:05:54.599> around

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
Sprint's up a hill you know go around

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.390 
Sprint's up a hill you know go around
some<00:05:54.960> kind<00:05:55.110> of<00:05:55.139> obstacle<00:05:55.680> and<00:05:55.830> still<00:05:56.160> be<00:05:56.310> able

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
some kind of obstacle and still be able

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.060 
some kind of obstacle and still be able
to<00:05:56.520> run<00:05:56.820> at<00:05:57.000> a<00:05:57.060> fast<00:05:57.300> pace<00:05:57.470> so<00:05:58.470> I<00:05:58.500> hope<00:05:58.770> this<00:05:58.919> is

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
to run at a fast pace so I hope this is

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.879 
to run at a fast pace so I hope this is
making<00:05:59.130> sense<00:05:59.400> for<00:05:59.700> you<00:05:59.940> and<00:06:00.410> if<00:06:01.410> you're<00:06:01.800> at

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
making sense for you and if you're at

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.710 
making sense for you and if you're at
the<00:06:01.979> point<00:06:02.220> where<00:06:02.400> you're<00:06:03.210> looking<00:06:03.479> to<00:06:03.599> run

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
the point where you're looking to run

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.800 
the point where you're looking to run
faster<00:06:04.229> for<00:06:04.440> a<00:06:04.500> longer<00:06:05.099> period<00:06:05.310> of<00:06:05.430> time<00:06:05.810> okay

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
faster for a longer period of time okay

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.300 
faster for a longer period of time okay
you<00:06:06.870> can<00:06:07.110> do<00:06:07.229> two<00:06:07.410> things<00:06:07.650> you<00:06:07.830> can<00:06:07.979> increase

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
you can do two things you can increase

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.150 
you can do two things you can increase
the<00:06:08.580> workout<00:06:09.060> or<00:06:09.720> decrease<00:06:10.440> the<00:06:10.620> recovery

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
the workout or decrease the recovery

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.610 
the workout or decrease the recovery
interval<00:06:11.729> one<00:06:12.630> or<00:06:12.810> the<00:06:12.870> other<00:06:13.020> don't<00:06:13.320> do<00:06:13.440> both

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
interval one or the other don't do both

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.339 
interval one or the other don't do both
the<00:06:13.830> same<00:06:14.010> time<00:06:14.280> can't<00:06:14.700> take<00:06:15.000> you<00:06:15.450> know<00:06:15.570> every

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
the same time can't take you know every

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:17.990 
the same time can't take you know every
week<00:06:16.560> you<00:06:16.740> know<00:06:16.770> maybe<00:06:17.039> change<00:06:17.370> one<00:06:17.639> variable

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
week you know maybe change one variable

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.659 
week you know maybe change one variable
don't<00:06:18.330> people<00:06:18.599> at<00:06:18.660> the<00:06:18.810> same<00:06:18.990> time<00:06:19.050> so<00:06:19.979> again

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669 
don't people at the same time so again

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.460 
don't people at the same time so again
if<00:06:20.910> you<00:06:21.030> want<00:06:21.150> to<00:06:21.300> maintain<00:06:21.419> thirty<00:06:22.050> seconds

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
if you want to maintain thirty seconds

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.549 
if you want to maintain thirty seconds
of<00:06:22.530> work

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:23.559 
of work

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:25.379 
of work
and<00:06:23.649> you've<00:06:24.039> been<00:06:24.129> working<00:06:24.519> at<00:06:24.639> 30<00:06:24.939> seconds<00:06:25.329> of

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:25.389 
and you've been working at 30 seconds of

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.509 
and you've been working at 30 seconds of
recovery<00:06:25.599> choppa<00:06:26.589> wait<00:06:26.799> the<00:06:26.919> recovery<00:06:27.309> maybe

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:27.519 
recovery choppa wait the recovery maybe

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:29.219 
recovery choppa wait the recovery maybe
it's<00:06:27.699> 15<00:06:27.999> seconds<00:06:28.359> of<00:06:28.419> recovery<00:06:28.659> maybe<00:06:29.019> now

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:29.229 
it's 15 seconds of recovery maybe now

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:31.859 
it's 15 seconds of recovery maybe now
it's<00:06:29.439> 10<00:06:29.799> seconds<00:06:30.309> of<00:06:30.429> recovery<00:06:30.669> to<00:06:31.449> the<00:06:31.569> point

00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:31.869 
it's 10 seconds of recovery to the point

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:34.289 
it's 10 seconds of recovery to the point
where<00:06:32.679> you're<00:06:32.889> essentially<00:06:33.279> just<00:06:33.429> running<00:06:34.209> at

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:34.299 
where you're essentially just running at

00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:36.089 
where you're essentially just running at
a<00:06:34.329> fast<00:06:34.599> pace<00:06:34.719> all<00:06:35.139> the<00:06:35.469> way<00:06:35.559> around<00:06:35.829> and

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:36.099 
a fast pace all the way around and

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:38.489 
a fast pace all the way around and
that's<00:06:36.489> the<00:06:36.639> power<00:06:36.849> of<00:06:36.999> interval<00:06:37.509> right<00:06:37.659> so<00:06:38.349> if

00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:38.499 
that's the power of interval right so if

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:40.199 
that's the power of interval right so if
you<00:06:38.619> want<00:06:38.799> more<00:06:39.009> great<00:06:39.219> stuff<00:06:39.519> more<00:06:39.879> great

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:40.209 
you want more great stuff more great

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:43.829 
you want more great stuff more great
workouts<00:06:42.119> you<00:06:43.119> know<00:06:43.209> with<00:06:43.389> respect<00:06:43.419> to

00:06:43.829 --> 00:06:43.839 
workouts you know with respect to

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:45.149 
workouts you know with respect to
interval<00:06:44.169> running<00:06:44.409> then<00:06:44.679> you've<00:06:44.799> got<00:06:44.949> to<00:06:45.039> come

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:45.159 
interval running then you've got to come

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:46.829 
interval running then you've got to come
back<00:06:45.279> to<00:06:45.429> my<00:06:45.549> treadmill<00:06:45.759> trainer<00:06:46.149> calm<00:06:46.509> right
