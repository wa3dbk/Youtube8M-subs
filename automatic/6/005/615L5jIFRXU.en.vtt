00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.800 
and I'm kicked me out of their group so
I<00:01:21.930> was<00:01:22.259> left<00:01:22.500> friendless<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.850> didn't<00:01:24.720> have

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
I was left friendless so I didn't have

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.330 
I was left friendless so I didn't have
any<00:01:24.930> friends<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.590> just<00:01:25.770> became<00:01:25.950> really

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
any friends and I just became really

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.310 
any friends and I just became really
really<00:01:26.640> introverted<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:28.110> was<00:01:28.229> actually

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
really introverted and I was actually

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.249 
really introverted and I was actually
really<00:01:28.619> extroverted<00:01:29.369> before<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.960> really

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
really extroverted before so it really

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.560 
really extroverted before so it really
changed<00:01:31.860> me<00:01:32.189> maybe<00:01:32.549> i'll<00:01:32.729> talk<00:01:33.000> about<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.360> more

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
changed me maybe i'll talk about it more

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.920 
changed me maybe i'll talk about it more
in<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.780> future<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:35.070> yeah<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:36.329> guess<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.780> next

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
in the future so yeah I guess the next

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.950 
in the future so yeah I guess the next
thing<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.799> when<00:01:38.340> i<00:01:38.369> was<00:01:38.579> 21<00:01:38.970> i<00:01:39.180> think<00:01:39.479> i

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
thing is that when i was 21 i think i

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.719 
thing is that when i was 21 i think i
think<00:01:40.259> i<00:01:40.320> was<00:01:40.439> 21<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:41.130> couple<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.460> years<00:01:41.579> ago

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
think i was 21 this couple of years ago

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.609 
think i was 21 this couple of years ago
actually<00:01:42.390> met<00:01:42.869> Pharrell<00:01:44.030> he<00:01:45.030> was<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.390> Sydney<00:01:46.380> a
