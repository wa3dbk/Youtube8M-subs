00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.290
 9 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.570
 the Dutch dressage team has meters wide 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.649
 it is sometimes very fast on the articles 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:14.649
 protect land here from flooding 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.790
 This will be a fact became a spot along with the waves heading north along the 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.539
 Dutch coast to the Wadden Sea 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.009
 coast of zanten, for example, slowly cracked newspaper 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.999
 our ancestors already knew that 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.930
 she is stuck in the sand with tires and breakwaters 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.930
 and the plants brought along the dunes to protect the coast 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.470
 it was recorded on a trailer 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.450
 shortening occurs in other places 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.100
 rising sea levels and more severe storms will make the future even bigger 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.220
 becomes santos 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.290
 that is why we want to put an enormous amount of sand off the coast 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.700
 wind and current 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.840
 so that the sand spread along the coast 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.630
 kuipers had widened in the shoreline 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.489
 and increased flood protection 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.489
 moreover, space is created for nature development and recreation 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.440
 it is called building with nature 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.900
 this animation film shows how this approach could turn out 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.360
 a large trailing suction hopper dredger 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.580
 salt with sand on the North Sea from Kempen 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.800
 the seabed is thus left behind 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.800
 can recover quickly afterwards 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.240
 the hoppers sail to the coast 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.410
 we make a beach house with the sand 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.570
 a kind of peninsula 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.570
 this makes the risk of flooding those guidelines 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.580
 here and there the position becomes a meter or ten consecutive variation too 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.450
 increase 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.050
 then from the first day the mood went well slowly 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.600
 especially in the beginning and major changes 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.760
 there is room enough for spectacle and last season 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.000
 although it is still on the lookout for new and unexpected trends 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:16.639
 after a few years the first birds breed on the bald stand of the 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.509
 sandy plain 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:21.150
 for the rest they have enough grit shells 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.150
 a washed-up material 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.880
 young lady revived around the us 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.880
 the first customers 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.349
 jens toornstra has the sand in the lagoon 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.479
 settles in the calm water 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:42.619
 those emerge small ones as soon as possible to blow off in growth with small ones 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:45.619
 hall little ones 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.519
 in the shallow water of the lagoon 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.559
 the army gate of heaven 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:57.579
 people who come regularly 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.579
 we will see how quickly the landscape changes due to weather and wind 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:11.829
 it is ten to fifteen years later 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.929
 the hay-sand game has declined due to a storm 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:17.699
 it has worn wide creeks 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:21.009
 the seaside resorts have grown 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.299
 part of the sand that has been cut off is now on the coast 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.359
 bordeaux in these places the chance of flooding is smaller 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.119
 have been sat with them by many storms 

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:36.129
 in the seven bind with the lagoon 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.159
 those who still want to hit the point of the stand will have to walk water and what 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.929
 per day and a good deal has already been filled with sand spreading 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:49.959
 nb law is a large area to come 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.039
 it is a great place to jute 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:55.069
 everywhere is obvious women and other to sponsor money 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:01.469
 both countries are also popular with seals 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:04.769
 they get together in the lagoon and off the coast 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.769
 well now and then a porpoise stripped 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.939
 the whole beach hook has now been moved a lot to that country 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.509
 and for the old row of dunes in itself so much sand that new ones are free afterwards 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:18.159
 arise 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:22.360
 the mobile beach tent has been built on the advanced coastline that can be taken along 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.979
 to weigh with the changes of the landscape so that is behind the 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.499
 row of dunes do sail with the many visitors to the new coastal area 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:33.499
 the light 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.639
 the sky is almost completely filled 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.270
 and the new dunes off the coast are so high due to all that extra sand supply 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.020
 what a species like sea buckthorn zetes tool and snake herb will grow 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:50.400
 9 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.400
 hagoort is worth the coast sturdy 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.979
 and become more attractive 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.129
 thanks to the wider get it afterwards and the expansion of nature 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.090
 it is a great place for students during a lot of plastic 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.090
 that there is much to experience 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.849
 the position is almost gone 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.760
 the new dunes are now so high 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.749
 that they open here and there again where you 

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:15.029
 and a beautiful blankert emerged 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:18.240
 that has succeeded is so vast and multifaceted 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.240
 or that it is processed quietly even in the event of large crowds 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.770
 between the new horticulture, the groundwater only carries a few dune lakes 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.719
 wet dune valleys 3 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.909
 sometimes she only entered this area by storm 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:39.090
 these swampy areas are among the richest nature in our country 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.180
 in the spring it is a colorful sea of ​​flowers 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.830
 as soon as they ensure that thereafter there is a change from most of the bushes 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.830
 and forests 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:56.619
 about fifty years on average 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:06:00.209
 the meat has been rinsed healthy and the coastline is almost straight again 

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:07.539
 messages the neighbors dykes and among other things with a good solution 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.020
 by building with nature 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.809
 it is not only the rich dune areas that originated 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:18.149
 but that has also succeeded in growing with fifty years 

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:21.669
 sea ​​level rise and the coastline to be sustainably strengthened 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.639
 then the cycle can start again 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.919
 the 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:38.919
