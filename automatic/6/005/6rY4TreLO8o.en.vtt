00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.580
 I made a phone call 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.060
 Net 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:07.879
 More than now 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:15.900
 7th place finisher on 3 / 67765357-11-7 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.400
 Talked colorfully 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.239
 Nasuno is a small area 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.310
 Early 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.369
 Impact on the village by the 7th within the first 2000 meters 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:29.810
 there is 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.480
 It is so with handwriting that mental appraisal wrote in still auction 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.450
 It's a question that is basically the most basic, but the answer 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.820
 Did it 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.720
 Which one is it 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.970
 Targeted as expected to wear last year 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.060
 I can not release for a moment 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.229
 According to relocation 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.570
 It seems to be able to output that way by the instructions of the company 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.990
 There is no reason why we can not show all the faces 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.340
 In addition to the above, let me chat with chat 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.200
 It is about 10 years ago to continue playing 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.610
 The research level at that time is rising, but some dissatisfaction 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.830
 Suggested to government 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.180
 On the other hand, it was severe overseas maximum 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.150
 It became faster 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.550
 Get on the school bus and shop 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.550
 I would like to have you also wait for Oaks 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.280
 Make a successful bid with your mouth 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.600
 Still with this year's gold cup 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.600
 There is no way not to use Fukuma 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.100
 Miyahara Yano cherry blossom award horse is really low if I ease 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.660
 It's delicious, it's an animal 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.240
 If you go with that, it's straight, even when it's straight and sunglasses 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.330
 It has started to have meaning too 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.650
 It would have been difficult if it was not surprising 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.280
 I felt that I was not 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.410
 So much change 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.310
 I want to compete relatively lightly 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.640
 That 2400 tablets 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.640
 I think that I agree 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.810
 Is there an opposition to the university-wide Tsurumaru? 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.080
 Ten yen appreciation of eight yen 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.630
 It's 90 in the middle of the right 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.740
 It was said variously, but until there is very advanced paperback 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.290
 It is the first of 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.860
 But in fact that 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.500
 That's why I'm kidding at the Ohana Prize, but it's still unknown above 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.449
 This from the one who is misunderstood 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:15.259
 Price raised to maturity 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.149
 So pray for participation with the children of the country 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:21.069
 From there, it's a good time to get in on the sports newspaper season 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.689
 It is done, but we finish on the 27th and finally how about 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.119
 Japan is Western Europe 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:30.509
 The vodka has been in power up with something in four, but in the middle 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:33.509
 That's why income is Wataru Shiozuka 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:37.519
 Fell with the country 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.819
 Teppei Hayashi 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.819
 For desks 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.139
 Ever packed 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.609
 Futaba Den from 71,500 yen 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.039
 I'm talking about wanting a solar car 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:53.769
 There is also a great betting ticket if it is structured as you see 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.609
 What happens if you say 1200-1.8 times 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.309
 I wondered why 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:59.449
 Announced on the 20th
