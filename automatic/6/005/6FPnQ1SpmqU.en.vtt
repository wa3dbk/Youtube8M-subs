tubal-cain latest video and it's about

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.320 
tubal-cain latest video and it's about
his<00:00:16.770> seseri<00:00:17.770> fiend<00:00:18.220> after<00:00:18.610> you<00:00:18.700> want<00:00:19.000> to<00:00:19.119> call

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
his seseri fiend after you want to call

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.769 
his seseri fiend after you want to call
it<00:00:19.480> that<00:00:19.890> anyway<00:00:20.890> I<00:00:21.160> found<00:00:21.760> this<00:00:22.150> motor

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
it that anyway I found this motor

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:31.040 
it that anyway I found this motor
it's<00:00:23.380> a<00:00:23.590> Dayton<00:00:24.900> 115<00:00:25.900> volt<00:00:26.199> AC<00:00:26.740> DC<00:00:27.519> motor<00:00:28.119> and

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.259 

it<00:00:32.050> turns<00:00:32.500> a<00:00:32.769> hundred<00:00:33.580> revolutions<00:00:33.760> per

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:34.269 
it turns a hundred revolutions per

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:38.490 
it turns a hundred revolutions per
minute<00:00:34.540> and<00:00:35.970> then<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.120> gear<00:00:37.390> reduction<00:00:38.140> on<00:00:38.320> it

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
minute and then the gear reduction on it

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.969 
minute and then the gear reduction on it
is<00:00:38.650> 52<00:00:39.400> to<00:00:39.549> 1<00:00:39.850> so<00:00:40.390> that's<00:00:41.080> cutting<00:00:41.500> that<00:00:41.680> about

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:41.979 
is 52 to 1 so that's cutting that about

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:46.380 
is 52 to 1 so that's cutting that about
in<00:00:42.159> half<00:00:43.530> anyway<00:00:44.530> I'm<00:00:44.979> gonna<00:00:45.190> was<00:00:45.970> thinking

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
in half anyway I'm gonna was thinking

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.469 
in half anyway I'm gonna was thinking
similarly<00:00:47.019> about<00:00:47.140> hooking<00:00:47.830> mine<00:00:48.100> up<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:49.089> same

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
similarly about hooking mine up the same

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.140 
similarly about hooking mine up the same
way<00:00:49.809> that<00:00:50.019> he's<00:00:50.260> got<00:00:50.530> his<00:00:50.769> hooked<00:00:51.040> up<00:00:51.280> I<00:00:51.670> have<00:00:52.119> a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
way that he's got his hooked up I have a

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
way that he's got his hooked up I have a
foot<00:00:52.600> control<00:00:53.170> with<00:00:53.710> this<00:00:53.890> motor

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
foot control with this motor

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.170 
foot control with this motor
then<00:00:56.170> I<00:00:56.260> located<00:00:56.799> at<00:00:57.070> a<00:00:57.100> box<00:00:57.400> of<00:00:57.640> stuff<00:00:57.909> that<00:00:58.089> I

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
then I located at a box of stuff that I

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.259 
then I located at a box of stuff that I
bought<00:00:58.479> from<00:00:58.750> from<00:00:59.500> a<00:00:59.699> machinist<00:01:00.699> that<00:01:00.729> passed

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
bought from from a machinist that passed

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:08.190 
bought from from a machinist that passed
away<00:01:02.760> another<00:01:03.760> brilliant<00:01:04.119> man<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.869> I<00:01:07.990> had<00:01:08.170> a

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
away another brilliant man that I had a

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.340 
away another brilliant man that I had a
lot<00:01:08.439> of<00:01:08.560> respect<00:01:08.979> for<00:01:09.250> much<00:01:09.939> like<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.899> respect

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
lot of respect for much like the respect

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.020 
lot of respect for much like the respect
I<00:01:11.500> have<00:01:11.530> tubal-cain<00:01:13.109> anyway<00:01:14.109> I<00:01:14.700> noticed<00:01:15.700> that

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
I have tubal-cain anyway I noticed that

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.660 
I have tubal-cain anyway I noticed that
in<00:01:16.210> his<00:01:16.929> video<00:01:17.640> piece<00:01:19.679> he's<00:01:20.679> hooking<00:01:21.159> up<00:01:21.340> right

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
in his video piece he's hooking up right

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:29.550 
in his video piece he's hooking up right
here<00:01:22.420> on<00:01:22.600> this<00:01:22.840> end<00:01:26.249> and<00:01:27.899> from<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:29.109> looks<00:01:29.350> in

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
here on this end and from the looks in

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.270 
here on this end and from the looks in
the<00:01:29.649> video<00:01:30.009> it<00:01:30.670> appears<00:01:31.479> that<00:01:31.679> he's<00:01:32.679> doing

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
the video it appears that he's doing

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.039 
the video it appears that he's doing
like<00:01:33.460> what<00:01:33.670> I<00:01:33.700> had<00:01:33.969> done<00:01:34.179> on<00:01:34.359> a<00:01:34.390> cross<00:01:34.719> slab

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
like what I had done on a cross slab

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.399 
like what I had done on a cross slab
once<00:01:35.350> before<00:01:35.759> used<00:01:36.759> a<00:01:37.030> socket<00:01:37.450> for<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:38.020> point

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
once before used a socket for the point

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.149 
once before used a socket for the point
of<00:01:38.560> attachment<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:40.840> as<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.319> can<00:01:41.499> see<00:01:41.859> this

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
of attachment but as you can see this

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.940 
of attachment but as you can see this
piece<00:01:42.490> of<00:01:42.700> metal<00:01:43.119> is<00:01:43.359> interfering<00:01:44.229> with<00:01:44.259> the

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
piece of metal is interfering with the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.059 
piece of metal is interfering with the
socket<00:01:45.729> so<00:01:46.859> my<00:01:47.859> question<00:01:48.399> is<00:01:48.639> going<00:01:48.850> to<00:01:48.939> be<00:01:50.069> did

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
socket so my question is going to be did

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.109 
socket so my question is going to be did
he<00:01:51.280> mill<00:01:51.609> this<00:01:51.939> bracket<00:01:53.069> so<00:01:54.069> the<00:01:54.429> socket<00:01:54.939> would

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
he mill this bracket so the socket would

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.830 
he mill this bracket so the socket would
go<00:01:55.359> up<00:01:55.539> in<00:01:55.749> there<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.259> make<00:01:56.439> a<00:01:56.469> better<00:01:56.740> fit<00:01:57.189> or

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
go up in there and make a better fit or

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.599 
go up in there and make a better fit or
I<00:01:58.840> wonder<00:01:59.499> did<00:01:59.679> he<00:02:00.060> replace<00:02:01.060> this<00:02:01.539> nut<00:02:02.579> with<00:02:03.579> a

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609 
I wonder did he replace this nut with a

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.959 
I wonder did he replace this nut with a
fatter<00:02:04.119> nut<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:05.649> is<00:02:05.889> actually<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.369> locking

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
fatter nut this is actually a locking

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.290 
fatter nut this is actually a locking
nut<00:02:07.209> when<00:02:07.509> I<00:02:07.539> was<00:02:07.719> thinking<00:02:07.929> about<00:02:08.080> doing<00:02:08.319> this

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
nut when I was thinking about doing this

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.950 
nut when I was thinking about doing this
putting<00:02:10.300> off<00:02:10.450> thicker<00:02:11.230> nut<00:02:11.650> on<00:02:11.890> there

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
putting off thicker nut on there

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.650 
putting off thicker nut on there
drilling<00:02:13.960> it<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.290> tapping<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.460> and<00:02:15.580> putting<00:02:16.450> a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
drilling it and tapping it and putting a

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.890 
drilling it and tapping it and putting a
brass

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
brass

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.789 
brass
stop<00:02:18.769> down<00:02:19.129> in<00:02:19.370> there<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.939> then<00:02:20.470> locking<00:02:21.470> it

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
stop down in there and then locking it

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.569 
stop down in there and then locking it
down<00:02:21.829> to<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:23.379> feed<00:02:24.379> square<00:02:24.799> Leechburg

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
down to the feed square Leechburg

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.500 
down to the feed square Leechburg
and<00:02:26.000> then<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:27.049> would<00:02:27.319> give<00:02:27.620> me<00:02:27.650> enough<00:02:28.510> to

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
and then that would give me enough to

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.210 
and then that would give me enough to
get<00:02:29.780> this<00:02:30.110> up<00:02:30.379> on<00:02:30.590> there<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:32.379> then<00:02:33.379> mount<00:02:33.980> my

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
get this up on there and then mount my

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.809 
get this up on there and then mount my
pulley<00:02:34.519> wheel<00:02:34.870> over<00:02:35.870> here<00:02:36.049> on<00:02:36.140> this<00:02:36.349> side

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.300 

anyway<00:02:40.819> that's<00:02:41.780> where<00:02:42.109> I'm<00:02:42.319> at<00:02:42.590> on<00:02:42.859> the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
anyway that's where I'm at on the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.240 
anyway that's where I'm at on the
project<00:02:43.939> and<00:02:47.079> I'm<00:02:48.079> not<00:02:48.260> sure<00:02:48.560> which<00:02:48.769> way<00:02:49.040> I'm

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
project and I'm not sure which way I'm

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.149 
project and I'm not sure which way I'm
going<00:02:49.489> to<00:02:49.579> go<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:52.549> video<00:02:53.319> did<00:02:54.319> he<00:02:54.620> put<00:02:55.010> on

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
going to go the video did he put on

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
there you know it showed it in action

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.860 
there you know it showed it in action
but<00:03:01.010> it<00:03:01.159> didn't<00:03:01.459> really<00:03:01.609> you<00:03:02.269> know<00:03:02.389> I<00:03:02.420> didn't<00:03:02.750> I

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.750 
didn't expect him to take the Machine
apart<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:05.239> show<00:03:05.480> us<00:03:05.689> out<00:03:06.430> exactly<00:03:07.430> every

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
apart to show us out exactly every

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.800 
apart to show us out exactly every
little<00:03:08.000> detail<00:03:08.180> about<00:03:08.840> it<00:03:09.109> but<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:11.420> would<00:03:11.659> be

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
little detail about it but it would be

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.110 
little detail about it but it would be
nice<00:03:12.049> to<00:03:12.079> know<00:03:12.590> if<00:03:12.829> he<00:03:13.040> went<00:03:13.310> with<00:03:13.519> a<00:03:13.549> larger

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
nice to know if he went with a larger

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.839 
nice to know if he went with a larger
node<00:03:14.389> here<00:03:14.900> or<00:03:15.079> if<00:03:15.200> he<00:03:15.379> machined<00:03:15.950> this<00:03:16.250> out<00:03:16.519> to

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
node here or if he machined this out to

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.129 
node here or if he machined this out to
accommodate<00:03:17.239> this<00:03:17.959> or<00:03:19.510> exactly<00:03:20.510> would<00:03:20.870> his

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
accommodate this or exactly would his

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:26.170 
accommodate this or exactly would his
point<00:03:21.560> of<00:03:21.680> attachment<00:03:22.099> method<00:03:22.910> is<00:03:24.910> it<00:03:25.910> may<00:03:26.120> be

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
point of attachment method is it may be

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.869 
point of attachment method is it may be
something<00:03:26.569> totally<00:03:26.930> different<00:03:27.199> than<00:03:27.879> than

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
something totally different than than

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.879 
something totally different than than
what<00:03:29.239> I'm<00:03:29.419> thinking<00:03:30.280> but<00:03:31.280> this<00:03:31.760> is<00:03:32.829> this<00:03:33.829> is

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
what I'm thinking but this is this is

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.339 
what I'm thinking but this is this is
the<00:03:34.280> route<00:03:34.579> that<00:03:34.609> I<00:03:35.000> was<00:03:35.269> gonna<00:03:35.510> go<00:03:35.780> on<00:03:36.079> my

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
the route that I was gonna go on my

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.740 
the route that I was gonna go on my
machine<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:37.430> I<00:03:37.639> have<00:03:37.909> the<00:03:38.090> exact<00:03:38.419> same

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
machine and I have the exact same

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.349 
machine and I have the exact same
machine<00:03:39.590> that<00:03:39.620> he<00:03:40.010> has<00:03:42.549> over<00:03:43.549> here<00:03:44.000> on<00:03:44.120> this

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
machine that he has over here on this

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:52.089 
machine that he has over here on this
side<00:03:44.750> of<00:03:45.729> my<00:03:46.729> workshop<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:50.620> I've<00:03:51.620> enjoyed<00:03:52.069> it

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
side of my workshop and I've enjoyed it

side of my workshop and I've enjoyed it
it's<00:03:52.760> been<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.000> great<00:03:53.299> machine<00:03:54.729> anyway<00:03:57.579> maybe

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
it's been a great machine anyway maybe

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:04.659 
it's been a great machine anyway maybe
he'll<00:03:58.849> see<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.329> video<00:03:59.690> and<00:04:02.620> pop<00:04:03.620> on<00:04:03.889> over<00:04:04.129> and

he'll see the video and pop on over and

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.180 
he'll see the video and pop on over and
give<00:04:05.449> me<00:04:05.479> some<00:04:05.840> suggestions<00:04:06.440> or<00:04:06.949> some

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:36.459 
yes kid couldn't even really turn it

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:38.369 
yes kid couldn't even really turn it
down<00:04:36.639> any<00:04:37.119> more<00:04:37.269> than<00:04:37.330> that<00:04:37.719> you<00:04:38.080> wouldn't

down any more than that you wouldn't

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:42.449 
down any more than that you wouldn't
want<00:04:38.559> to<00:04:38.589> do<00:04:38.709> that<00:04:40.709> maybe<00:04:41.709> he'll<00:04:41.979> give<00:04:42.159> me<00:04:42.189> some

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:42.459 
want to do that maybe he'll give me some

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:45.540 
want to do that maybe he'll give me some
insight<00:04:42.939> on<00:04:42.969> it<00:04:43.619> well<00:04:44.619> lay<00:04:44.860> them<00:04:45.069> over<00:04:45.189> on<00:04:45.459> the

insight on it well lay them over on the
other<00:04:45.759> side<00:04:46.089> now<00:04:46.509> I'm<00:04:47.169> always<00:04:47.409> talking<00:04:47.739> about

this<00:04:48.159> big<00:04:48.809> machine<00:04:49.809> I<00:04:50.110> got<00:04:50.529> here<00:04:50.979> it's<00:04:51.610> a<00:04:51.879> 17

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 
this big machine I got here it's a 17

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:56.219 
this big machine I got here it's a 17
inch<00:04:52.779> tornado<00:04:53.319> and<00:04:54.839> all<00:04:55.839> right

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
inch tornado and all right

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.219 
inch tornado and all right
a<00:04:56.259> lot<00:04:56.649> of<00:04:56.800> people<00:04:57.009> probably<00:04:57.159> don't<00:04:58.229> believe

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
a lot of people probably don't believe

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.899 
a lot of people probably don't believe
it<00:04:59.469> when<00:04:59.619> I<00:04:59.649> say<00:04:59.949> how<00:05:00.099> long<00:05:00.339> is<00:05:00.550> there<00:05:00.729> anything

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:00.909 
it when I say how long is there anything

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:04.319 
it when I say how long is there anything
as<00:05:01.319> this<00:05:02.319> is<00:05:02.739> a<00:05:02.769> monster<00:05:03.489> man<00:05:03.729> this<00:05:04.029> thing<00:05:04.300> is

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:04.329 
as this is a monster man this thing is

00:05:04.329 --> 00:05:08.790 
as this is a monster man this thing is
uh<00:05:04.509> I<00:05:06.059> bet<00:05:07.059> I<00:05:07.300> had<00:05:07.509> barely<00:05:07.809> could<00:05:08.169> get<00:05:08.349> it<00:05:08.469> in<00:05:08.619> it

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
uh I bet I had barely could get it in it

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.179 
uh I bet I had barely could get it in it
and<00:05:09.039> and<00:05:09.489> the<00:05:09.729> little<00:05:10.929> here<00:05:11.379> where<00:05:12.159> I

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:12.189 
and and the little here where I

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:16.169 
and and the little here where I
work<00:05:12.459> at<00:05:12.759> and<00:05:14.249> you<00:05:15.249> know<00:05:15.279> put<00:05:15.639> a<00:05:15.699> hole<00:05:15.879> in<00:05:15.909> the

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:16.179 
work at and you know put a hole in the

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:20.759 
work at and you know put a hole in the
wall<00:05:16.360> there<00:05:16.659> so<00:05:16.689> I<00:05:16.989> can<00:05:17.199> put<00:05:17.469> big<00:05:17.919> stock<00:05:19.769> and

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:20.769 
wall there so I can put big stock and

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:25.589 
wall there so I can put big stock and
run<00:05:21.069> it<00:05:21.219> all<00:05:21.569> outside<00:05:22.569> and<00:05:23.219> I<00:05:24.219> take<00:05:24.639> man<00:05:25.209> check

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
run it all outside and I take man check

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:29.100 
run it all outside and I take man check
out<00:05:25.749> this<00:05:25.899> Chuck<00:05:26.319> I<00:05:27.119> mean<00:05:28.119> it<00:05:28.269> takes<00:05:28.509> a<00:05:28.689> crane

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
out this Chuck I mean it takes a crane

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.409 
out this Chuck I mean it takes a crane
to<00:05:29.739> change<00:05:30.039> the<00:05:30.429> chuckling<00:05:30.909> this<00:05:31.029> thing<00:05:31.269> I

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
to change the chuckling this thing I

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.819 
to change the chuckling this thing I
can't<00:05:31.719> pick<00:05:31.929> it<00:05:31.959> up<00:05:33.990> I've<00:05:34.990> got<00:05:35.199> a<00:05:35.229> four<00:05:35.559> jaw

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:35.829
