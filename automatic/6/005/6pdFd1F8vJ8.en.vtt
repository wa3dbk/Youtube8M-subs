 then 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.230
 for the first time on television the videos that prove what can be

 nor emerging from the waters of the Cartagena lagoon in Puerto Rico 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.339
 one of the minors must leave the race 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.509
 and then a scientist from the University of California reveals that 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.039
 the jealous supersonic speeds nis are not only scientifically 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.039
 possible but probable 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.360
 perhaps the region with the greatest history of activity 2000 if on the coast that surrounds 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.880
 the island of puerto rico 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.130
 to be located in the mysterious southern end of the Bermuda triangle during 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.780
 decades the island has been the center of many debates about these artifacts 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.340
 good condition Puerto Rico is a focus of submarine UFO activity and it seems 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.460
 conform to the pattern of the other special cases

 the argus project members a group of ufologists based on the island we 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.810
 invite you to a tour of some of the places supposedly more 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.810
 frequented by jazz 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.670
 nothing 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.890
 the Cartagena lagoon is an isolated lake near the south eastern end of the 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.799
 island that has been associated with a large part of the supposed 2000 activity of the 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.980
 country 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.140
 where also the work both Cartagena lagoon and where it narrates one 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.440
 It is also explained that there is a lot of secrecy of UFOs 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.500
 the career area 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.340
 In addition to the offer

 jajajajajajajajajajaja 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.560
 October 11, 2002, approximately nine o'clock in the evening

 Carlos Torres Police Officers of the Puerto Rican Police Argus Project 500 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.140
 It divides some red and bright wickerwork emerging from the waters of the lagoon 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.440
 Cartagena at an incredible speed 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.890
 then it stops and remains motionless on the water 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.620
 from where you are

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.929
 over the Cartagena lagoon 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.529
 but involved military were witnesses also lemcke good time 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.399
 returns again 7 from the area of 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:20.329
 c of the staff is founded 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.929
 thinking about the gap of the Canary Islands 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:27.289
 after scoring for several minutes on the area it was seen how the eye turned to 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:30.289
 immerse yourself in 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.140
 another member of Argusino Icefi Quiñones believes that he also recorded the same 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.139
 object in 2004 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.650
 Check in good with a video of November 20 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.719
 2004 in the Ariana vicinity of a letter in which he demonstrated why 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:49.749
 someone 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:53.609
 a look at scoop images for television could prove the 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.039
 existence of a few thousand indignant with the bomb 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:01.099
 a the bright apparatus that was seen coming out of the water was floating for almost a 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.099
 Minute before leaving Morán Min 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:07.430
 in one year 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.680
 The moment of the truth 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.679
 the 90's it was tried to lie what is happening on the site 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:17.029
 turn off even though there were a hundred of cesc the testimony they claimed to have 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:18.599
 viewed 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.599
 we have to enter and exit bankruptcy 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.199
 basically sighting two habit of understanding the lack of puerto rico 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:31.959
 but place in the aforementioned lagoon Cartagena to the road of sotres 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.639
 the ajax region that crosses the a303 road has been another source of 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.199
 reports on UFOs and os x 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:46.029
 among them the one of a possible shock in montevideo in 1997 I direct scorched the 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:47.109
 impact zone 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:56.409
 and many unanswered questions once for May 5, 1997 by the way 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.569
 even so that a saucer crashed 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.149
 bart de wever I fear many lands on top of the mountain 

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:08.129
 to walk a tree that was no longer given by the federal Aranda de Copa and opened 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.129
 you do not know what not 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:17.599
 After the 1997 accident the local authorities began to take 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:20.599
 more serious about UFO notices 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:26.199
 as a direct result the mayor of lajas recently renamed the highway 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.819
 that crosses the center of puerto rico like the extraterrestrial route 303 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.939
 but for now other extraterrestrial affairs on the island claim the 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:41.419
 immediate attention from experts 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.590
 from the hillsides that surround the zas the government usually throws a mysterious 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.580
 moored aerostatic balloon that carries a radar that reaches almost 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.919
 5 kilometers of altitude 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.900
 apparently its mission is to control traffic and time but ufologists 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.289
 that's not that that's just a cover for its true function to observe and 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.289
 record any extraterrestrial activity 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.439
 there is a government document 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.749
 in the legislature 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:11.759
 ds asked for a secret investigation 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:13.499
 does not publish secrets 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:17.279
 especially UFO sightings survive with the waters 

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:21.289
 but the document also says that they do not represent any danger to the 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:22.580
 humanity 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.339
 the volume of reports on hosni without winch to this little island 

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:29.999
 has led many to consider the possibility that the depths that 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:33.609
 open under the southern end of the Bermuda triangle next to the 

00:05:33.609 --> 00:05:36.609
 same coast hide something else that you have 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.600
 experts and ufologists around the world are convinced that it could 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.330
 harboring a whole base of these suspected appliances 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:53.639
 There are some bases or a nearby base between the palm tree and the area near Alvaro 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:54.969
 from cabo rojo 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:59.019
 these hours a zone that is believed to reach the lagoon 

00:05:59.019 --> 00:05:59.919
 cartagena 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.710
 the reason for entering and leaving lies because it would surpass menem was the pnv 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.069
 nevertheless a specific area I left and on the other hand in a vile 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:13.639
 i also and the one that came from below the unne are all these events 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.700
 fruit of local mysticism 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.490
 josé de urquiza to the cultural influence of the triangle of Bermudas in the 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.950
 popular entries of the Puerto Rican culture most of the 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.560
 people although they talk about the chupacabra and the triangle of 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.849
 Bermuda 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:34.080
 the night nothing of those very basic things or something else in all of it 

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:36.860
 is a reality 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.550
 with the story that a reality is happening and there are many hundreds of 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.469
 heritage and evidence and demonstrates it well 

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:44.969
 I think it's going to come 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:51.039
 And even though this disease affects real, we will demand the offer of 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:52.769
 gas that time it's a reality
