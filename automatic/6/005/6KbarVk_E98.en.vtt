00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.359 
definitely put a link below so you make
sure<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.520> get<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.759> right<00:01:59.969> one<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.950> comes<00:02:02.130> with

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
sure you get the right one it comes with

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.230 
sure you get the right one it comes with
both<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.759> module<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.560> cable<00:02:04.820> ok<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:05.880> here's

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
both the module and a cable ok so here's

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.779 
both the module and a cable ok so here's
how<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.659> initially<00:02:07.290> going<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.500> work

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
how this is initially going to work

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.080 
how this is initially going to work
going<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.110> have<00:02:10.110> droid<00:02:10.410> planner<00:02:10.709> paired<00:02:11.489> with

shows the final setup okay so initially
I'm<00:02:52.240> going<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:52.930> go<00:02:53.050> ahead<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.560> power<00:02:53.830> this<00:02:54.370> guy

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
I'm going to go ahead and power this guy

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.870 
I'm going to go ahead and power this guy
now<00:02:55.030> luckily<00:02:55.960> I<00:02:55.990> had<00:02:56.230> these<00:02:56.410> connectors<00:02:57.040> that

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
now luckily I had these connectors that

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.450 
now luckily I had these connectors that
came<00:02:58.120> with<00:02:58.330> a<00:02:58.360> one<00:02:59.140> of<00:02:59.230> my<00:02:59.290> lipo<00:02:59.650> chargers<00:03:00.160> and

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
came with a one of my lipo chargers and

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.800 
came with a one of my lipo chargers and
so<00:03:01.210> you'll<00:03:01.450> notice<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.100> servo

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
so you'll notice that just the servo

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.410 
so you'll notice that just the servo
housing<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.050> I'm<00:03:05.500> going<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.680> use<00:03:05.800> a<00:03:05.830> standard

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
housing and I'm going to use a standard

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:15.330 
housing and I'm going to use a standard
servo<00:03:07.420> connector<00:03:07.780> on<00:03:08.550> this<00:03:09.550> end<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:14.220> then<00:03:15.220> on

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
servo connector on this end and then on

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.500 
servo connector on this end and then on
our<00:03:15.490> module<00:03:16.000> will<00:03:16.540> notice<00:03:17.070> VCC<00:03:18.070> and<00:03:18.100> ground<00:03:18.510> so

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
our module will notice VCC and ground so

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.240 
our module will notice VCC and ground so
I'm<00:03:19.570> going<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:19.930> run<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:22.690> we<00:03:22.810> have<00:03:22.960> our<00:03:23.250> red

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
I'm going to run so we have our red

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.840 
I'm going to run so we have our red
going<00:03:24.490> to<00:03:24.670> power<00:03:24.880> and<00:03:25.300> brown<00:03:25.510> going<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:25.960> ground

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
going to power and brown going to ground

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.120 
going to power and brown going to ground
okay<00:03:27.850> you'll<00:03:28.030> notice<00:03:28.330> that<00:03:28.540> our<00:03:28.830> power<00:03:29.830> supply

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
okay you'll notice that our power supply

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.850 
okay you'll notice that our power supply
I<00:03:30.550> have<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.790> set<00:03:30.970> at<00:03:31.000> 4.5<00:03:31.750> volts<00:03:32.260> this<00:03:32.470> will<00:03:32.680> run

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
I have it set at 4.5 volts this will run

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.420 
I have it set at 4.5 volts this will run
from<00:03:33.040> 3.6<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.240> 6<00:03:34.510> volts<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:36.040> we've<00:03:36.130> got<00:03:36.250> that

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
from 3.6 to 6 volts so we've got that

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.940 
from 3.6 to 6 volts so we've got that
going<00:03:36.670> we<00:03:37.090> have<00:03:37.240> our<00:03:37.390> leads<00:03:37.600> hooked<00:03:37.870> up<00:03:38.080> and<00:03:38.710> go

I noticed several screenshots that

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:39.809 
I noticed several screenshots that
showed<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.419> settings<00:04:37.840> up<00:04:38.080> here<00:04:38.919> well<00:04:39.219> if<00:04:39.729> you

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:39.819 
showed the settings up here well if you

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:41.640 
showed the settings up here well if you
have<00:04:39.969> a<00:04:39.999> device<00:04:40.360> that<00:04:40.629> has<00:04:40.749> physical<00:04:41.080> buttons

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
have a device that has physical buttons

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.209 
have a device that has physical buttons
like<00:04:41.860> this<00:04:42.069> guy<00:04:42.279> for<00:04:43.180> your<00:04:43.379> menu<00:04:44.379> or<00:04:44.770> for<00:04:45.099> your

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:45.219 
like this guy for your menu or for your

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.300 
like this guy for your menu or for your
settings<00:04:45.610> they're<00:04:45.999> actually<00:04:46.449> down<00:04:46.629> here<00:04:47.310> so

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
settings they're actually down here so

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.070 
settings they're actually down here so
and<00:04:48.789> you'll<00:04:48.999> notice<00:04:49.300> that<00:04:49.479> the<00:04:49.659> telemetry

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
and you'll notice that the telemetry

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.580 
and you'll notice that the telemetry
connection<00:04:50.650> type<00:04:50.889> is<00:04:51.460> currently<00:04:51.849> USB<00:04:52.590> we're

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
connection type is currently USB we're

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.839 
connection type is currently USB we're
going<00:04:53.710> to<00:04:53.770> change<00:04:54.009> that<00:04:54.249> to<00:04:54.310> bluetooth<00:04:55.020> and

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
going to change that to bluetooth and

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:01.019 
going to change that to bluetooth and
I'm<00:04:57.849> going<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.479> just<00:04:58.719> close<00:04:59.050> out<00:04:59.259> of<00:04:59.439> this<00:05:00.029> okay

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:01.029 
I'm going to just close out of this okay

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:02.550 
I'm going to just close out of this okay
so<00:05:01.090> now<00:05:01.419> it's<00:05:01.569> configured<00:05:02.050> to<00:05:02.080> use<00:05:02.259> bluetooth

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
so now it's configured to use bluetooth

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.950 
so now it's configured to use bluetooth
I'm<00:05:02.919> going<00:05:03.039> to<00:05:03.099> hit<00:05:03.219> connect<00:05:03.669> and<00:05:03.939> let's<00:05:04.719> watch

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
I'm going to hit connect and let's watch

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.390 
I'm going to hit connect and let's watch
our<00:05:05.430> LED<00:05:06.430> at<00:05:06.520> the<00:05:06.669> same<00:05:06.879> time<00:05:07.949> you<00:05:08.949> can<00:05:09.159> see

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
our LED at the same time you can see

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.850 
our LED at the same time you can see
that<00:05:09.610> it<00:05:09.729> said<00:05:10.000> connected<00:05:10.870> now<00:05:11.620> we're

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
that it said connected now we're

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.619 
that it said connected now we're
constant<00:05:12.460> so<00:05:12.789> that<00:05:12.819> was<00:05:13.120> the<00:05:13.270> first<00:05:13.509> challenge

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:13.629 
constant so that was the first challenge

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:16.320 
constant so that was the first challenge
to<00:05:14.199> overcome<00:05:14.740> and<00:05:15.099> I'm<00:05:15.729> going<00:05:15.939> to<00:05:16.000> be<00:05:16.090> trying

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
to overcome and I'm going to be trying

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.420 
to overcome and I'm going to be trying
to<00:05:16.419> overcome<00:05:16.840> two<00:05:17.259> other<00:05:17.500> challenges<00:05:18.069> one<00:05:18.279> is

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
to overcome two other challenges one is

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.300 
to overcome two other challenges one is
this<00:05:18.610> by<00:05:18.879> default<00:05:19.349> communicates<00:05:20.349> over<00:05:20.469> 9600

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
this by default communicates over 9600

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.559 
this by default communicates over 9600
baud<00:05:21.460> and<00:05:22.259> 3dr<00:05:23.259> telemetry<00:05:23.529> expects<00:05:24.430> a<00:05:24.819> minimum

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.569 
baud and 3dr telemetry expects a minimum

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:29.189 
baud and 3dr telemetry expects a minimum
of<00:05:25.689> fifty<00:05:26.020> seven<00:05:26.349> six<00:05:26.620> baud<00:05:27.009> so<00:05:27.580> I<00:05:28.389> believe

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
of fifty seven six baud so I believe

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.140 
of fifty seven six baud so I believe
using<00:05:29.740> an<00:05:29.949> eighty<00:05:30.129> command<00:05:30.639> we<00:05:30.729> can<00:05:30.939> change

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
using an eighty command we can change

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.760 
using an eighty command we can change
the<00:05:31.330> baud<00:05:31.509> rate<00:05:31.719> of<00:05:31.839> this<00:05:31.990> guy<00:05:32.139> so<00:05:32.439> I'll

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
the baud rate of this guy so I'll

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.100 
the baud rate of this guy so I'll
definitely<00:05:33.250> be<00:05:33.430> sharing<00:05:34.029> how<00:05:34.300> to<00:05:34.360> do<00:05:34.599> that<00:05:34.810> and

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
definitely be sharing how to do that and

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.209 
definitely be sharing how to do that and
then<00:05:35.620> also<00:05:35.849> we<00:05:36.849> don't<00:05:37.240> want<00:05:37.449> to<00:05:37.599> have<00:05:37.900> this

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:38.219 
then also we don't want to have this

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:40.800 
then also we don't want to have this
clunky<00:05:39.219> power<00:05:39.460> supply<00:05:39.969> at<00:05:40.029> the<00:05:40.210> field<00:05:40.449> so<00:05:40.750> I'm

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
clunky power supply at the field so I'm

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
clunky power supply at the field so I'm
going<00:05:40.930> to<00:05:40.960> have<00:05:41.080> to<00:05:41.169> find<00:05:41.349> a<00:05:41.439> good<00:05:41.620> way<00:05:41.770> to

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
going to have to find a good way to

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.529 
going to have to find a good way to
power<00:05:42.189> both<00:05:42.520> the<00:05:43.210> module<00:05:43.689> and<00:05:44.729> the<00:05:45.729> 3dr<00:05:46.089> radio

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
power both the module and the 3dr radio

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.240 
power both the module and the 3dr radio
so<00:05:46.899> I<00:05:46.930> just<00:05:47.139> wanted<00:05:47.409> to<00:05:47.500> share<00:05:47.710> where<00:05:47.949> I<00:05:47.979> am

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
so I just wanted to share where I am

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.059 
so I just wanted to share where I am
with<00:05:48.490> that<00:05:48.750> hopefully<00:05:49.750> you<00:05:50.139> don't<00:05:50.770> have<00:05:50.949> to

with that hopefully you don't have to

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:52.769 
with that hopefully you don't have to
deal<00:05:51.250> with<00:05:51.279> all<00:05:51.580> this<00:05:51.759> you<00:05:52.360> can<00:05:52.569> download

hopefully have that on on-the-go cable
work<00:05:57.939> nicely<00:05:58.300> but<00:05:59.199> if<00:05:59.349> not<00:05:59.589> I<00:05:59.620> just<00:06:00.099> wanted<00:06:00.339> to
