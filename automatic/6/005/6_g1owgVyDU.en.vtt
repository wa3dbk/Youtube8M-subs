of these elements that you may want to
look<00:02:12.169> at

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
look at

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.640

it's<00:02:16.280> quite<00:02:16.550> a<00:02:16.580> challenge<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.090> master<00:02:17.980> or

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
it's quite a challenge to master or

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.470 
it's quite a challenge to master or
perhaps<00:02:19.190> you<00:02:19.400> don't<00:02:19.580> write<00:02:19.730> description<00:02:20.300> so

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
perhaps you don't write description so

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.210 
perhaps you don't write description so
well<00:02:20.690> in<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.080> case<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.500> recommend<00:02:21.530> practicing

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
well in that case I recommend practicing

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.250 
well in that case I recommend practicing
by<00:02:22.790> going<00:02:23.150> out<00:02:23.330> let's<00:02:23.810> say<00:02:23.960> go<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.200> the
