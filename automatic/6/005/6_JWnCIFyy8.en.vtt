00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.430
 questions not having philological 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.470
 historical science direct relationship 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.810
 it's absolutely not the case for all its 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.870
 problems our Russian

 independent their judgments from 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.230
 academic bureaucracy but it 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.090
 happens when for example they leave

 their posts and there by age and so on 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.869
 nevertheless do not remain large 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.290
 scientists and heads of bags by authors 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:13.159
 textbooks there dictionaries how far then 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.420
 greis the largest scientists getting land 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.009

 this question of big specialists 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.509
 luminaries of our science long ago he already 

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:28.990
 resolved in a positive way and can 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.280
 name the names of our largest scientists 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.069
 for example , Yuri Konstantinovich and runner 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.829

 scientists who simply did not give the word a 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.470
 recently it just sit on hundreds 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.709
 scientists major scientists

 University and many, many others 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:24.760
 scientists, I think that now it is time that 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.920
 but the people who need to give the word 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.900
 produce scientific collections on what they have 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.840
 everyone has a thought on a person engaged 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.580
 This or that problem concerning ours 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.370
 ancient history of culture and he 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.750
 arises thoughts appeared their books a 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.140
 pressure of our academic bureaucracy 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.490
 don't give them a word long time ago 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.040
 improve this 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:49.570
 setting around this topic here and give 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.980
 the word is really big scientists without 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.030
 Doctor of Philology Doctor 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.310
 historical sciences 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.490
 do as it was done before on 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.160
 Ukraine in the Czech Republic in Serbia 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:05.180
 where you got your book you hide chapters 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:08.090
 schools and circle the largest scientists who 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.500
 only exist Slavic world and for the sake of 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.150
 howling pawn die ingenuity 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.740
 sector god he was anyone on logical

 here he is also known around the world 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.270
 since he worked him won them in 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.850
 Italy then and then when it is the largest 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.170
 the scientist fought off morovich this is the dean 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.010
 Faculty of Philology of Belgrade 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.720

 and then there is what was in and lips shein 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.220
 goswamis in serbia 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.750
 circle of scientists who are there 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.419
 and there are other specialists there for this 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.290
 question no they all spoke all 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:54.860
 color of science spoke out got his book 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.480
 before in in the Czech Republic let's say the greatness of iron 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.729
 piri piri ul and here are my translations 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.100
 their books and they are now being taught in 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.390
 Prague University is the same 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.780
 happened at the University of Bonn 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.880
 the oldest university in Europe is there about 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.430
 Courses on Veles books are held 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.470
 Slovene in all our 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.260
 a monument on those and books on those 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.660
 editions that I’ve come out of and 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.870
 go courses they go about 15 years already 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:24.560
 so these 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:29.180
 names known but all on scientists say 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.590
 Europe here and this problem of course our 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.090
 academic science rather ours 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.990
 academic bureaucracy who is afraid 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:38.389
 all new and often afraid of their place 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.880
 thinks I don't know 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.560
 over with them to understand how what they have 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.820
 there is about this gamete but they all 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.190
 far from authentic science 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:53.470
 Now currently in the domain zone 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:56.270
 under gelendzhik enthusiasts I was 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:59.360
 Museum of Russian Runic is open

 and which concern our ancient history 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:08.120
 history of south russia course history 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:11.479
 just ancient slavic history and our 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.139
 the museum began to produce collections of scientific 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:15.139
 collections 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.830
 this we even have prices 107 lower 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.760
 candidate of science 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:21.169
 do not skip articles showing related 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.389
 ancient monuments of our history 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:26.620
 writing and of course in the first place 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:29.270
 our articles are worth our luminaries 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.760
 Soviet and Russian academic 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.940
 sciences here are the names i listed 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.889
 and we hope to cooperate with 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.030
 academic science of our museum 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:42.680
 will continue their future invite everyone

 scientists who are interested in this issue with 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.349
 point of view of the most different that uchun 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.180
 the work of various fields and 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:53.770

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.889
 woe is also like our ancient records she 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.630
 can

 investigated a variety of areas then 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.990
 we think we have a big future 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.770
 have research led their books 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.020
 academic studies only from

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.849
 of us dreamed about them in childhood but only 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.060
 units have been able to realize this dream in 

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:37.060
