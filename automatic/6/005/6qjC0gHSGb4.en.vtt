00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.330 
corn milk that can be from a can so 600
meals<00:01:05.270> and<00:01:06.590> this<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.740> what<00:01:07.979> you're<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.280> to

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
meals and this is what you're going to

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:25.020 
meals and this is what you're going to
use<00:01:08.399> to<00:01:09.210> mix<00:01:09.479> all<00:01:10.020> together

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.020 

still<00:01:25.810> until<00:01:26.380> it<00:01:26.530> becomes<00:01:27.100> dough-like

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
still until it becomes dough-like

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:42.660 
still until it becomes dough-like
consistency

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.010 

until<00:01:43.570> all<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:44.100> flour<00:01:45.479> dissolve

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.859 

so<00:01:50.020> with<00:01:50.740> this<00:01:50.950> consistency<00:01:53.850> if<00:01:54.850> it's<00:01:55.420> too

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
so with this consistency if it's too

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.200 
so with this consistency if it's too
thin<00:01:56.200> for<00:01:56.229> you<00:01:56.710> you<00:01:56.979> can<00:01:57.190> just<00:01:57.430> add<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:58.060> little

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
thin for you you can just add a little

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.230 
thin for you you can just add a little
bit<00:01:58.690> more<00:01:59.200> of<00:01:59.470> the<00:01:59.740> rice<00:02:00.340> a<00:02:00.610> glutinous<00:02:01.210> rice

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
bit more of the rice a glutinous rice

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.530 
bit more of the rice a glutinous rice
flour<00:02:02.080> to<00:02:02.410> make<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:02.950> thicker<00:02:03.490> so<00:02:03.520> it's<00:02:03.880> it<00:02:04.270> will

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
flour to make it thicker so it's it will

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.389 
flour to make it thicker so it's it will
be<00:02:04.690> easier<00:02:05.080> for<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:05.440> to<00:02:05.619> wrap<00:02:05.920> in<00:02:06.220> a<00:02:08.399> banana

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
be easier for you to wrap in a banana

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.840 
be easier for you to wrap in a banana
leaves<00:02:09.789> later<00:02:10.209> on<00:02:10.600> so<00:02:11.470> I<00:02:11.920> think<00:02:12.040> it's<00:02:12.459> a<00:02:12.610> bit

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
leaves later on so I think it's a bit

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.890 
leaves later on so I think it's a bit
thin<00:02:13.360> like<00:02:14.170> right<00:02:14.440> now<00:02:14.620> I'm<00:02:14.950> just<00:02:14.980> gonna<00:02:15.370> add<00:02:15.900> a

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
thin like right now I'm just gonna add a

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:30.780 
thin like right now I'm just gonna add a
little<00:02:17.380> bit<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.950> make<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:19.140> thicker<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.650> bit

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.839 

not<00:02:31.420> too<00:02:31.689> much<00:02:31.989> but<00:02:32.530> at<00:02:32.890> least<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.580> will<00:02:33.790> be

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
not too much but at least it will be

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:53.589 
not too much but at least it will be
easier<00:02:34.390> for<00:02:34.689> you<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:34.900> rap<00:02:35.760> later<00:02:36.760> on

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.440 

so<00:02:54.170> now<00:02:54.349> with<00:02:54.650> this<00:02:54.819> consistency<00:02:55.819> it's<00:02:56.209> now

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
so now with this consistency it's now

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.390 
so now with this consistency it's now
ready<00:02:56.749> to<00:02:57.019> be<00:02:57.170> wrapped<00:02:57.889> with<00:02:58.129> banana<00:02:58.790> leaves

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
ready to be wrapped with banana leaves

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.530 
ready to be wrapped with banana leaves
okay<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:01.459> our<00:03:01.849> next<00:03:02.569> steps<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:04.329> rub<00:03:05.329> the

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
okay so our next steps is to rub the

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.530 
okay so our next steps is to rub the
mixture<00:03:06.109> with<00:03:06.349> banana<00:03:06.799> leaves<00:03:07.359> but<00:03:10.420> for<00:03:11.420> the

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
mixture with banana leaves but for the

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.940 
mixture with banana leaves but for the
banana<00:03:11.900> leaves<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.379> make<00:03:12.620> it<00:03:12.829> pliable<00:03:14.950> you

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
banana leaves to make it pliable you

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.209 
banana leaves to make it pliable you
have<00:03:16.189> we<00:03:16.549> have<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:18.049> heat<00:03:18.260> it<00:03:18.409> up<00:03:18.560> over<00:03:19.069> this

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:19.219 
have we have to to heat it up over this

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.360 
have we have to to heat it up over this
stone<00:03:19.719> so<00:03:20.719> it<00:03:20.840> will<00:03:21.049> be<00:03:21.200> easier<00:03:21.560> for<00:03:21.590> us<00:03:21.889> to

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
stone so it will be easier for us to

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.869 
stone so it will be easier for us to
wrap<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:23.260> mixture<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.590> make<00:03:24.829> it<00:03:25.040> into<00:03:25.459> too

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
wrap the mixture and make it into too

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.959 
wrap the mixture and make it into too
big<00:03:27.849> so<00:03:28.849> now<00:03:29.060> I'm<00:03:29.389> going<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.629> show<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:29.959> how<00:03:30.439> to

big so now I'm going to show you how to

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:37.170 
big so now I'm going to show you how to

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
wrap it okay to wrap it with the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.920 
wrap it okay to wrap it with the
corrupted<00:03:38.180> your<00:03:38.419> mixture<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:39.889> have<00:03:39.919> to<00:03:40.930> you

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
corrupted your mixture you have to you

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.309 
corrupted your mixture you have to you

banana leaf so you want to stick the the

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:04.960 
banana leaf so you want to stick the the
rice<00:03:55.840> when<00:03:56.840> you<00:03:57.019> roast<00:03:57.260> it<00:03:58.359> so<00:03:59.470> like<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:03.970> put

rice when you roast it so like that put

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:14.780 
rice when you roast it so like that put
2<00:04:05.470> tbsp<00:04:06.470> I<00:04:06.739> guess<00:04:07.659> of<00:04:08.659> your<00:04:09.109> mixture

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.629 

and<00:04:15.790> Rafi

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
you can you can just calculate how how

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.320 
you can you can just calculate how how
much<00:04:24.629> you<00:04:24.780> can<00:04:24.930> put<00:04:25.610> according<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:26.819> the<00:04:26.970> size

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
much you can put according to the size

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.149 
much you can put according to the size
of<00:04:27.599> your<00:04:27.919> banana<00:04:28.919> leaves<00:04:29.689> so<00:04:30.689> there<00:04:31.159> that's

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:32.159 
of your banana leaves so there that's

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:35.689 
of your banana leaves so there that's
ready<00:04:32.789> to<00:04:33.090> be<00:04:33.240> roasted<00:04:34.009> you<00:04:35.009> can<00:04:35.219> roast<00:04:35.490> it

ready to be roasted you can roast it

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:42.760 
ready to be roasted you can roast it
into<00:04:36.150> a<00:04:36.949> griddle<00:04:37.949> or<00:04:38.219> into<00:04:38.759> your<00:04:39.020> interior
