00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.910
 Hello everyone, Dynamo 29 is the first 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.160
 ucoz site creation lesson 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.500
 free website builder too 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.830
 This KMS is very convenient and by the way and 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.330
 so that immediately given free hosting 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.150
 that is, the site immediately appears in 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.449
 on the internet and that's yes it's all free 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.180
 in general, now you will understand everything yourself and here I am 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.530
 already moved to create a new site 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.710
 the principle that such a sign flashed 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.020
 you just need to enter this site or 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.390
 register and click create site 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.749
 so enter the address of the site let's say we want 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.089
 name any site and do as 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:50.690
 Jumla put it on and game 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:54.139
 Trix try if not busy and here we are 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.129
 select the name of the site that's why for 

00:00:54.139 --> 00:01:00.319
 free because ucoz.ru that is 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.949
 principle, if something and you need to buy something 

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:06.020
 you can remove the advertisement for a fee and 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:09.200
 buy a domain, that is, not to have ucoz 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.790
 in the line of the site was now going to be game 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.500
 tricks . ucoz.ru 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.360
 and you can buy there for literally 100 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.110
 rubles to just a dot ru 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:24.980
 In general, it does not matter look further so 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:28.510
 we enter so I agree with the rights so 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:34.630
 create a site is necessary 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.630
 buggy and take it again 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.200
 so all such a site is not a site dreamtrips 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.690
 ucoz.ru successfully created go to panel 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.510
 management push with us and meetings with 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.950
 such a thing the name of the site we enter there 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:57.230
 game 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:59.420
 Trix is â€‹â€‹the best gaming site principle here 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.090
 creation is not as tricky as it were, for 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.909
 Jumla here is very easy site design 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.259
 stand up standard grandson can choose 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.209
 the usual design and there well that 's the principle 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.170
 the most so normal of those then there 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.209
 but there are better 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.939
 In principle, we will put our template 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.650
 find some on the internet so 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:21.170
 choose what we need here is the editor 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.569
 pages of a thief news site then 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.440
 his book doesn't really need a catalog of articles 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.940
 of files 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.870
 tags polls mail forms 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.849
 online store I need but if you 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.900
 want you pics photo albums in general 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:38.360
 see for yourself so here's welcome 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.000
 in the control panel and also nobody 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.950
 let's your login and password there because 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.420
 that the control panel can be removed 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.640
 site and there it is like this so in general like this 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.750
 control panel looks Davao 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.220
 let's create the rest 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.220
 inactive now we have yet to lead 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.799
 points so bang click on the mini chat in 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.799
 inactive click activate water 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.989
 so we all activated the module and on 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.810
 push inactive 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.049
 We look so here we still okay in 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.660
 principle to give more site statistics 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.700
 activate tests and tests then you can 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.400
 they should be specially created 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.380
 just everything in the control panel 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.320
 so we will sort it out in order 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.049
 lessons what where when 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.400
 here we press the general go to the site 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.620
 we have this as you can see on the Internet 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.290
 you can already give a friend a friend 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.910
 and there a similar site already exists in 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.700
 the internet is tight statistics here's a poll 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:48.200
 here is a mini chat it can communicate in general 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:51.650
 all that we have created is this system 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.410
 there is also a very comfortable one I will say easily 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.600
 add material no such here 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.780
 debilizm of both the Joomla itself but 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.530
 it is in principle very easy very easy 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.780
 now also not exactly something easy but 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.359
 hack that's why they don't want to create 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.390
 I write well for starters, you can 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:13.370
 create such sites hack principle 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.299
 no one is going to gather them, much less can 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.030
 account to put all that principle all 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:23.120
 for the first roar ok next 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.729
 lesson we will sort something look 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.539
 the number of parse subscribe to the channel 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.539
 put the husks bye
