called<00:00:38.680> to<00:00:38.829> a<00:00:38.860> shop<00:00:39.250> with<00:00:39.520> a<00:00:39.550> very<00:00:39.910> strange

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
called to a shop with a very strange

called to a shop with a very strange
problem<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.860> shop<00:00:42.160> had<00:00:42.460> in<00:00:42.720> 1999<00:00:43.720> ford<00:00:44.079> focus

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
problem the shop had in 1999 ford focus

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.479 
problem the shop had in 1999 ford focus
with<00:00:44.920> a<00:00:44.980> 1.9<00:00:45.880> liter<00:00:46.150> and<00:00:46.480> a<00:00:46.840> 48<00:00:47.530> automatic

with a 1.9 liter and a 48 automatic
transmission<00:00:49.350> experiencing<00:00:50.350> a<00:00:50.440> loss<00:00:50.650> of

transmission experiencing a loss of
power<00:00:51.160> with<00:00:51.520> the<00:00:51.670> headlights<00:00:52.180> on<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:54.640> seemed

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
power with the headlights on this seemed

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.450 
power with the headlights on this seemed
too<00:00:55.270> far-fetched<00:00:55.660> for<00:00:56.290> this<00:00:56.500> robot<00:00:57.010> to

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
too far-fetched for this robot to

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.819 
too far-fetched for this robot to
believe<00:00:57.850> so<00:00:58.329> I<00:00:58.360> was<00:00:58.750> very<00:00:58.780> eager<00:00:59.200> to<00:00:59.350> see<00:00:59.710> it

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
believe so I was very eager to see it

believe so I was very eager to see it
for<00:01:00.070> myself<00:01:00.780> maybe<00:01:01.780> they<00:01:02.110> were<00:01:02.170> trying<00:01:02.350> to

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
for myself maybe they were trying to

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.310 
for myself maybe they were trying to
pull<00:01:03.070> a<00:01:03.100> hoax<00:01:03.370> on<00:01:03.670> me<00:01:03.970> to<00:01:04.119> test<00:01:04.390> my<00:01:04.659> computing

when I arrived at the shop the head

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.390 
when I arrived at the shop the head
technician<00:01:22.750> handed<00:01:23.409> me<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.770> keys<00:01:23.799> to<00:01:24.280> the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
technician handed me the keys to the

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.490 
technician handed me the keys to the
demon<00:01:24.760> and<00:01:24.850> jumped<00:01:25.600> in<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.810> passenger<00:01:26.470> seat

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
demon and jumped in the passenger seat

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.190 
demon and jumped in the passenger seat
waiting<00:01:27.460> to<00:01:27.820> see<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.180> expression<00:01:28.810> on<00:01:28.930> my

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
waiting to see the expression on my

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.060 
waiting to see the expression on my
robotic<00:01:29.710> face<00:01:29.950> I<00:01:30.390> got<00:01:31.390> in<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.750> car<00:01:32.049> started<00:01:32.890> up

robotic face I got in the car started up

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.210 
robotic face I got in the car started up
and<00:01:33.280> everything<00:01:33.970> seemed<00:01:34.299> to<00:01:34.420> be<00:01:34.540> fine<00:01:35.040> then<00:01:36.040> I

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
and everything seemed to be fine then I

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.340 
and everything seemed to be fine then I
placed<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.760> vehicle<00:01:37.210> in<00:01:37.330> drive<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:37.810> sped

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
placed the vehicle in drive and sped

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.910 
placed the vehicle in drive and sped
away<00:01:38.500> with<00:01:38.920> no<00:01:39.189> problems<00:01:39.220> at<00:01:40.000> all<00:01:40.030> I<00:01:40.920> continued

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
away with no problems at all I continued

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.859 
away with no problems at all I continued
to<00:01:42.130> drive<00:01:42.400> the<00:01:42.670> vehicle<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:43.210> few<00:01:43.450> more<00:01:43.689> blocks

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
to drive the vehicle a few more blocks

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.850 
to drive the vehicle a few more blocks
and<00:01:44.380> could<00:01:44.860> not<00:01:45.040> see<00:01:45.460> anything<00:01:45.820> wrong<00:01:46.270> at<00:01:46.540> all

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
and could not see anything wrong at all

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.890 
and could not see anything wrong at all
then<00:01:47.860> the<00:01:48.369> tech<00:01:48.640> told<00:01:48.909> me<00:01:49.150> to<00:01:49.360> stop<00:01:49.689> the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
then the tech told me to stop the

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.770 
then the tech told me to stop the
vehicle<00:01:50.110> turn<00:01:50.890> on<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.220> headlights<00:01:51.400> and<00:01:52.090> tried

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
vehicle turn on the headlights and tried

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.320 
vehicle turn on the headlights and tried
to<00:01:52.990> accelerate<00:01:53.710> I<00:01:53.979> did<00:01:54.970> this<00:01:55.119> without

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
to accelerate I did this without

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.510 
to accelerate I did this without
questioning<00:01:56.259> and<00:01:56.409> then<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:56.830> was<00:01:57.070> in<00:01:57.280> total

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
questioning and then I was in total

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.100 
questioning and then I was in total
shock<00:01:59.159> the<00:02:00.159> vehicle<00:02:00.670> would<00:02:00.909> not<00:02:01.180> accelerate

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
shock the vehicle would not accelerate

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.030 
shock the vehicle would not accelerate
and<00:02:02.350> felt<00:02:02.860> as<00:02:03.070> if<00:02:03.400> it<00:02:03.580> was<00:02:03.820> in<00:02:04.030> third<00:02:04.299> gear<00:02:04.750> I

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
and felt as if it was in third gear I

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.890 
and felt as if it was in third gear I
quickly<00:02:06.040> turned<00:02:06.520> off<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:07.030> headlights<00:02:07.270> and

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
quickly turned off the headlights and

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.319 
quickly turned off the headlights and
the<00:02:08.409> transmission<00:02:09.039> down<00:02:09.399> shifted<00:02:09.970> into<00:02:10.119> a

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:10.329 
the transmission down shifted into a

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.949 
the transmission down shifted into a
lower<00:02:10.659> gear<00:02:11.019> and<00:02:11.230> took<00:02:11.769> off<00:02:11.950> immediately<00:02:12.159> I

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
lower gear and took off immediately I

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.809 
lower gear and took off immediately I
was<00:02:13.959> without<00:02:14.260> words<00:02:16.140> how<00:02:17.140> could<00:02:17.440> this<00:02:17.620> be<00:02:17.860> how

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
was without words how could this be how

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.540 
was without words how could this be how

someone crossed some wires somewhere at
this<00:02:34.990> point<00:02:35.320> I<00:02:35.560> decided<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:36.340> get<00:02:36.490> back<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:37.000> the

this point I decided to get back to the

this point I decided to get back to the
shop<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.630> hook<00:02:37.810> up<00:02:37.990> my<00:02:38.020> scope<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.950> see<00:02:38.980> what<00:02:39.460> was

shop to hook up my scope to see what was

so<00:04:59.750> I<00:04:59.780> decided<00:05:00.410> to<00:05:00.710> access<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.430> light

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
so I decided to access the light

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.840 
so I decided to access the light
