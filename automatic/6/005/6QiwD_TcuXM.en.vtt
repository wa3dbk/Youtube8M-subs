 820 wants to use westring forest 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.330
 Coaching is a great feature, however 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.430
 it works at 820 it with the 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.470
 delivered becca what you are now 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.539
 device has not been so easy for 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.300
 it's a special skin cover that one 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.850
 In addition , you can buy in looks 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.680
 this hort cover is a plate seperate 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.870
 which supports wireless charging 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.539
 must now, however, these two 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.329
 main characters okay now you have to 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.370
 first the old one was the cover of 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.479
 your device is best removed 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.039
 catch the upper right corner of what 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:52.940
 be careful so that the noses not 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.679
 break away and now you can see here how 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.839
 you can compare my two covers 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.670
 that the most diverse in the 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.859
 white cover you can not see anything and in the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.289
 floor cover you can see plate and 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.600
 the wireless charging function and we 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:09.020
 the red cover on your device on it 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.700
 best catch from the bottom again until 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.450
 be careful not to nose 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.310
 abort, stop 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.520
 everything closes properly at no 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:21.320
 split pension well and now finally 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.369
 now you just need the cink here 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.820
 loads this and connect to the network 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.700
 put the cable in the adapter with the 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.149
 in socket and connects the other 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.630
 end of the cable with touchscreen 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:41.060

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.460

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.409
 However, I want to tell you that you still 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.360

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.790
