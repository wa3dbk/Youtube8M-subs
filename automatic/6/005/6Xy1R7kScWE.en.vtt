it's<00:00:20.189> by<00:00:20.520> coincidence<00:00:21.180> but<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:22.100> did<00:00:23.300> get<00:00:24.300> some

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
it's by coincidence but I did get some

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.490 
it's by coincidence but I did get some
new<00:00:24.960> pens<00:00:25.880> over<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> week<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.480> these<00:00:28.080> are<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
new pens over the week and these are the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.970 
new pens over the week and these are the
Statler<00:00:28.890> sketch<00:00:29.580> pens<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.960> they<00:00:31.439> do<00:00:31.500> have<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
Statler sketch pens and they do have the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.549 
Statler sketch pens and they do have the
different<00:00:32.399> size<00:00:32.489> tips<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.140> micron

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
different size tips like the micron

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.810 
different size tips like the micron
pigment<00:00:35.070> pens<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:37.160> the<00:00:38.160> reason<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.489> didn't<00:00:38.700> get

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
pigment pens do the reason I didn't get

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.760 
pigment pens do the reason I didn't get
the<00:00:38.940> my<00:00:39.090> cons<00:00:39.390> again<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.960> because<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.500> store

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
the my cons again is because the store

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.290 
the my cons again is because the store
that<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:40.980> went<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.309> did<00:00:41.640> not<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.820> them<00:00:42.530> I'm<00:00:43.530> not

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
that I went to did not have them I'm not

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.810 
that I went to did not have them I'm not
thoroughly<00:00:45.559> impressed<00:00:46.559> with<00:00:47.070> these<00:00:47.280> Statler

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
thoroughly impressed with these Statler

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.380 
thoroughly impressed with these Statler
pens

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
pens

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.080 
pens
I<00:00:48.570> chose<00:00:48.989> Statler<00:00:49.530> because<00:00:49.950> they<00:00:50.730> happen<00:00:51.059> to

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
I chose Statler because they happen to

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.600 
I chose Statler because they happen to
be<00:00:51.180> one<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.539> my<00:00:51.629> favorite<00:00:52.110> brands<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> was<00:00:53.340> I

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
be one of my favorite brands so I was I

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.720 
be one of my favorite brands so I was I
had<00:00:53.910> high<00:00:54.120> expectations<00:00:54.539> for<00:00:55.170> these<00:00:55.640> but<00:00:56.640> if

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
had high expectations for these but if

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.700 
had high expectations for these but if
you<00:00:56.850> notice<00:00:57.180> when<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.390> use<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.809> wider<00:00:58.020> tip<00:00:58.350> pens

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
you notice when I use the wider tip pens

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.959 
you notice when I use the wider tip pens
they<00:00:59.489> do<00:00:59.550> bleed<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> little<00:01:00.359> bit<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.940> when<00:01:02.940> I

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
they do bleed a little bit and when I

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.570 
they do bleed a little bit and when I
lift<00:01:03.270> my<00:01:03.690> pen<00:01:03.930> off<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.589> paper<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.189> leaves<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
lift my pen off of the paper it leaves a

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.210 
lift my pen off of the paper it leaves a
dot<00:01:05.790> behind<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.689> I'm<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:07.650> really<00:01:07.979> impressed

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
dot behind so I'm not really impressed

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.670 
dot behind so I'm not really impressed
with<00:01:08.760> these<00:01:08.909> pens<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:10.049> will<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.530> to

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
with these pens and I will have to

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.469 
with these pens and I will have to
purchase<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.340> microns<00:01:11.790> again<00:01:12.119> but<00:01:12.360> these

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
purchase the microns again but these

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.660 
purchase the microns again but these
will<00:01:12.630> work<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:13.049> now<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.200> guess

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.039 

I<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:21.640> noticed<00:01:22.060> that<00:01:22.240> these<00:01:22.420> shapes<00:01:22.750> look

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
I have noticed that these shapes look

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.719 
I have noticed that these shapes look
kind<00:01:23.290> of<00:01:23.409> boring<00:01:23.710> on<00:01:24.659> camera<00:01:25.659> right<00:01:25.869> now<00:01:26.049> but

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
kind of boring on camera right now but

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.370 
kind of boring on camera right now but
once<00:01:27.729> I<00:01:27.850> put<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.149> shading<00:01:28.540> in<00:01:28.689> and<00:01:28.960> everything

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
once I put the shading in and everything

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.380 
once I put the shading in and everything
it'll<00:01:29.710> really<00:01:29.950> bring<00:01:30.189> the<00:01:30.610> picture<00:01:30.939> to<00:01:31.180> life

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
it'll really bring the picture to life

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.840 
it'll really bring the picture to life
but<00:01:31.840> right<00:01:32.020> now<00:01:32.259> it's<00:01:32.530> is<00:01:33.220> looking<00:01:33.580> kind<00:01:33.790> of

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
but right now it's is looking kind of

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.760 
but right now it's is looking kind of
blah<00:01:34.060> and<00:01:34.390> I've<00:01:34.540> actually<00:01:34.750> been<00:01:35.110> considering

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
blah and I've actually been considering

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.550 
blah and I've actually been considering
shading<00:01:36.310> as<00:01:36.460> I<00:01:36.610> go<00:01:36.850> but<00:01:37.180> I<00:01:37.210> like<00:01:37.960> waiting<00:01:38.140> until

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
shading as I go but I like waiting until

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.469 
shading as I go but I like waiting until
the<00:01:38.680> end<00:01:38.710> of<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.100> project<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.640> add<00:01:39.789> color<00:01:40.119> or

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
the end of the project to add color or

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.749 
the end of the project to add color or
to<00:01:40.780> add<00:01:40.960> shading<00:01:41.350> just<00:01:41.799> because<00:01:42.100> I<00:01:42.430> really

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
to add shading just because I really

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.160 
to add shading just because I really
like<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.409> effect<00:01:44.409> at<00:01:44.649> the<00:01:44.770> end<00:01:44.799> of<00:01:45.130> it<00:01:45.310> just

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
like the effect at the end of it just

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.810 
like the effect at the end of it just
it's<00:01:47.170> like<00:01:47.320> a<00:01:47.350> little<00:01:47.560> surprise<00:01:47.799> for<00:01:48.369> myself

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
it's like a little surprise for myself

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.050 
it's like a little surprise for myself
when<00:01:49.090> I'm<00:01:49.380> completely<00:01:50.380> done<00:01:50.830> with<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.100> shapes

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
when I'm completely done with the shapes

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.430 
when I'm completely done with the shapes
and<00:01:52.330> everything<00:01:52.690> and<00:01:52.780> then<00:01:52.899> add<00:01:53.050> the<00:01:53.200> shading

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
and everything and then add the shading

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.249 
and everything and then add the shading
it's<00:01:53.800> I<00:01:54.250> just<00:01:54.819> like<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.149> I<00:01:55.479> just<00:01:55.929> like<00:01:56.050> doing

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
it's I just like the I just like doing

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.950 
it's I just like the I just like doing
it<00:01:56.409> in<00:01:56.500> that<00:01:56.649> order<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:57.009> I<00:01:57.130> don't<00:01:57.190> know<00:01:57.399> why

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
it in that order and I don't know why

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.070 
it in that order and I don't know why
but<00:01:58.960> I<00:01:59.110> hope<00:01:59.259> you<00:01:59.440> liked<00:01:59.740> today's<00:02:00.429> video<00:02:01.080> leave
