00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.080
 and what happens sick minds of youtube if 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.440
 then we're back here again 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.759
 this time to talk about a topic 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.240
 interesting relatively because it's 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.440
 extremely geek if today we are here 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.440
 to talk about the anime 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:48.110
 well the anime is both animated but 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.320
 what would it be for the Japanese and those 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:56.059
 come derived from when 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.720
 a comic of these is very successful and 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:03.079
 therefore if it succeeds as not 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.479
 produces many of these then the 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.130
 people say or we can do much more 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.780
 paste this so let's make a 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.390
 series based on the comic continues sucking 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.390
 money to people and that 's what you 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.030
 he calls him anime well there are many kinds of 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.090
 encourage the first one is 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.850
 the absurd soul 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.770
 do not look at me before I'm convincing the 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.870
 Friday 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:34.540
 silver for me also costs 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.540
 and I'm becoming a family 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.290
 but we are becoming 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.290
 carrot 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.430
 I could have turned once 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.040
 in action 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.020
 and have paid 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.440
 the gore 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.120
 yes no 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.270
 and more 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.270
 Hurrah 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.519
 no, I do not know 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:51.010
 the romantics is to do without 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.950
 them because rainbows arise so 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.570
 there are so many anime classes and all 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.300
 we have seen it in our childhood and 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.960
 we wanted not because if you did not see this 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.960
 scene from here 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.140
 is that you did not have childhood and if the 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.680
 normal administration this is a view 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.680
 it's here 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.410
 good that you had childhood but not 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.940
 It will have been as fun as the one 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.190
 I would have had on glass lying 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.270
 therefore anime is a phenomenon 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.820
 international world that was generated in 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:47.070
 Japan and now it's at the whole point of 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:50.450
 world and that generates a lot of this 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:55.000
 enough of this 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:57.260
 and as I said before there are many exits 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.750
 I feel 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:05.480
 Thousands perhaps pain and a lot of pain 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:10.220
 after having seen this there will be 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:15.170
 some that I say only for children of 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:18.820
 channel not because if a little boy 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.820
 see this 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.900
 it seems to me that it would be I do not know a little bit 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.900
 traumatized because now look 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.669
 but as it is there are many more examples and 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.220
 Well I think I have nothing left 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.220
 to say so I say goodbye to you 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.120
 Y 

00:04:55.869 --> 00:05:00.460
 or not 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.930
 i
