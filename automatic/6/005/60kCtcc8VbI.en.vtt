00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
computer on an HDMI stick so when we saw

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.780 
computer on an HDMI stick so when we saw
that<00:00:12.269> pi<00:00:12.719> 320<00:00:13.650> from<00:00:13.860> ZOTAC<00:00:14.340> we<00:00:14.549> were<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.759> know

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
that pi 320 from ZOTAC we were you know

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.340 
that pi 320 from ZOTAC we were you know
kind<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.089> excited<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.509> we<00:00:15.630> could<00:00:15.750> get<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.929> PC

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
kind of excited that we could get a PC

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.960 
kind of excited that we could get a PC
so<00:00:16.379> small<00:00:16.920> well<00:00:17.130> they<00:00:17.220> keep<00:00:17.369> getting<00:00:17.730> smaller

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
so small well they keep getting smaller

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.029 
so small well they keep getting smaller
and<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.140> smallest<00:00:19.380> one<00:00:19.560> I've<00:00:19.830> seen

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
and this is the smallest one I've seen

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.290 
and this is the smallest one I've seen
forget<00:00:20.340> about<00:00:20.430> mounting<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.150> can<00:00:21.270> just

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
forget about mounting it you can just

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.359 
forget about mounting it you can just
plug<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.750> right<00:00:21.869> into<00:00:22.050> your<00:00:22.140> television<00:00:22.769> and

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
plug it right into your television and

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.620 
plug it right into your television and
you're<00:00:23.580> off<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.939> running<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.300> one<00:00:24.510> is

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
you're off and running this one is

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.540 
you're off and running this one is
called<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.050> amigo<00:00:25.500> pad<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.130> think<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:26.430> is

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
called the amigo pad and I think this is

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.519 
called the amigo pad and I think this is
the<00:00:26.640> one<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.240> lot<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.630> folks<00:00:27.930> were<00:00:28.080> talking

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
the one that a lot of folks were talking

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.769 
the one that a lot of folks were talking
about<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.949> has<00:00:29.099> an<00:00:29.279> atom<00:00:29.670> bay<00:00:29.880> trail<00:00:30.119> processor

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
about it has an atom bay trail processor

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.170 
about it has an atom bay trail processor
inside<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.920> fully<00:00:32.160> capable<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.880> running

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
inside it is fully capable of running

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.810 
inside it is fully capable of running
Windows<00:00:33.570> 8.1<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.590> does<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.920> fairly<00:00:35.640> well

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
Windows 8.1 and it does it fairly well

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.240 
Windows 8.1 and it does it fairly well
the<00:00:36.719> one<00:00:36.930> caveat<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.739> they<00:00:38.070> don't

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the one caveat is that they don't

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.040 
the one caveat is that they don't
actually<00:00:38.399> give<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> real<00:00:39.510> version<00:00:39.809> of

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
actually give you a real version of

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.290 
actually give you a real version of
Windows<00:00:40.379> 8.1<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:41.280> like<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> pirated<00:00:42.239> version

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
Windows 8.1 it's like a pirated version

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.690 
Windows 8.1 it's like a pirated version
in<00:00:42.750> fact<00:00:42.989> when<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.260> got<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.340> running<00:00:44.520> it

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
in fact when I got it up and running it

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.279 
in fact when I got it up and running it
said<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.879> need<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.149> activate<00:00:45.629> Windows<00:00:46.050> when<00:00:46.260> I

Bing on this because really a Windows
license<00:01:04.229> costs<00:01:04.619> pretty<00:01:04.799> much<00:01:05.010> domos<00:01:05.430> double

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
what this $99 PC on a stick cost so

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.609 
what this $99 PC on a stick cost so
let's<00:01:09.360> take<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> look<00:01:09.750> though<00:01:09.930> at<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.290> hardware

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
let's take a look though at the hardware

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.929 
let's take a look though at the hardware
and<00:01:10.680> pretend<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.159> everything<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> up

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
and pretend that everything is on the up

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.149 
and pretend that everything is on the up
and<00:01:12.119> up<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.450> operating<00:01:12.869> system<00:01:13.110> side<00:01:13.500> what

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
and up on the operating system side what

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.740 
and up on the operating system side what
I<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.460> about<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.360> got<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.540> nice

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
I like about it is that it's got a nice

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.660 
I like about it is that it's got a nice
amount<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.170> storage<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.680> got<00:01:16.799> 32<00:01:17.189> gigabytes

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
amount of storage it's got 32 gigabytes

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.340 
amount of storage it's got 32 gigabytes
of<00:01:17.790> on-board<00:01:18.060> storage<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.930> it's<00:01:19.080> got<00:01:19.200> one<00:01:19.320> of

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
of on-board storage so it's got one of

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.380 
of on-board storage so it's got one of
those<00:01:19.470> little<00:01:19.590> emmc<00:01:20.189> drives<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.909> onboard

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
those little emmc drives and onboard

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.420 
those little emmc drives and onboard
maybe<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.750> an<00:01:21.869> embedded<00:01:22.200> flash<00:01:22.350> chip<00:01:22.740> it

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
maybe just an embedded flash chip it

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.840 
maybe just an embedded flash chip it
also<00:01:23.580> has<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.180> full-size<00:01:24.509> USB<00:01:25.610> interface<00:01:26.610> here

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
also has a full-size USB interface here

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.030 
also has a full-size USB interface here
so<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.210> plug<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.659> hubs<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.200> keyboards

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
so you can plug in hubs and keyboards

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.170 
so you can plug in hubs and keyboards
and<00:01:29.189> whatnot<00:01:29.460> we're<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.790> plug<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and whatnot we're going to plug in a

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.240 
and whatnot we're going to plug in a
little<00:01:30.659> Apple<00:01:31.049> keyboard<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.619> has<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.799> hub<00:01:32.100> on

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
little Apple keyboard that has a hub on

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.010 
little Apple keyboard that has a hub on
board<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.610> we<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.759> use<00:01:32.909> our<00:01:33.000> mouse<00:01:33.210> as<00:01:33.420> well<00:01:33.450> it

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
board so we can use our mouse as well it

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.770 
board so we can use our mouse as well it
is<00:01:34.170> powered<00:01:34.590> by<00:01:34.619> USB<00:01:35.100> voltage<00:01:35.970> at<00:01:36.210> only<00:01:36.390> two

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
is powered by USB voltage at only two

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.990 
is powered by USB voltage at only two
amps<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.470> just<00:01:37.619> plug<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.040> right<00:01:38.280> there

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
amps and you just plug it in right there

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.730 
amps and you just plug it in right there
with<00:01:39.210> an<00:01:39.360> included<00:01:39.780> power<00:01:39.960> adapter<00:01:40.590> but

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
with an included power adapter but

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.789 
with an included power adapter but
really<00:01:41.009> any<00:01:41.220> 2<00:01:41.579> amp<00:01:41.880> USB<00:01:42.600> power<00:01:43.140> source<00:01:43.560> should

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
really any 2 amp USB power source should

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.770 
really any 2 amp USB power source should
work<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.790> only<00:01:45.030> issue<00:01:45.270> with<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.720> is

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
work and the only issue with this is

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.170 
work and the only issue with this is
that<00:01:45.990> because<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:47.159> only<00:01:47.340> two<00:01:47.640> amps<00:01:48.060> I'm

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
that because it's only two amps I'm

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.670 
that because it's only two amps I'm
seeing<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.570> little<00:01:48.750> bit<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.170> performance

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
seeing a little bit of a performance

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.039 
seeing a little bit of a performance
degradation<00:01:49.860> as<00:01:50.520> compared<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.360> other<00:01:51.720> systems

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
degradation as compared to other systems

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.050 
degradation as compared to other systems
that<00:01:52.290> are<00:01:52.439> also<00:01:52.619> running<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.189> same<00:01:53.460> atom<00:01:53.880> Bay

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
that are also running the same atom Bay

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.940 
that are also running the same atom Bay
Trail<00:01:54.360> processors<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.500> got<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> power<00:01:55.829> button

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
Trail processors you got a power button

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.670 
Trail processors you got a power button
here<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.939> have<00:01:57.090> an<00:01:57.270> HDMI<00:01:57.840> input<00:01:57.869> here<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.590> you

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
here you have an HDMI input here so you

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.020 
here you have an HDMI input here so you
just<00:01:58.710> plug<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.100> into<00:01:59.219> your<00:01:59.399> television<00:01:59.549> it

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
just plug it into your television it

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.940 
just plug it into your television it
does<00:02:00.149> not<00:02:00.299> come<00:02:00.600> with<00:02:00.780> an<00:02:00.899> extender<00:02:01.380> cable<00:02:01.560> so

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
does not come with an extender cable so

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.170 
does not come with an extender cable so
if<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.159> need<00:02:02.369> one<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.610> those<00:02:02.759> you'll<00:02:02.969> have<00:02:03.060> to

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
if you need one of those you'll have to

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.480 
if you need one of those you'll have to
get<00:02:03.390> one<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.860> course<00:02:05.070> find<00:02:05.100> those

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
get one but you can of course find those

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.219 
get one but you can of course find those
very<00:02:05.700> easily<00:02:06.000> if<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.390> doesn't<00:02:06.659> quite<00:02:06.810> fit<00:02:07.049> in

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
very easily if it doesn't quite fit in

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.350 
very easily if it doesn't quite fit in
your<00:02:07.380> situation<00:02:08.099> now<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:08.910> side<00:02:09.119> what's

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
your situation now on this side what's

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.720 
your situation now on this side what's
interesting<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.560> has<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> another<00:02:11.129> USB

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
interesting is that it has a another USB

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.790 
interesting is that it has a another USB
port<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.209> an<00:02:12.420> OTG<00:02:12.810> port<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:13.560> you

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
port this is an OTG port so you

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.010 
port this is an OTG port so you
get<00:02:14.100> an<00:02:14.370> OTG<00:02:14.760> cable<00:02:15.180> which<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:15.480> also<00:02:15.780> not

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
get an OTG cable which is also not

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.560 
get an OTG cable which is also not
included<00:02:16.560> plug<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.400> in<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:18.150> can<00:02:18.300> attach

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
included plug that in and you can attach

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.720 
included plug that in and you can attach
additional<00:02:18.870> devices<00:02:19.560> through<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:20.520> side

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
additional devices through this side

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.220 
additional devices through this side
here<00:02:20.940> but<00:02:21.060> if<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.180> had<00:02:21.270> like<00:02:21.390> an<00:02:21.540> OTG<00:02:21.780> memory

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
here but if you had like an OTG memory

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.540 
here but if you had like an OTG memory
card<00:02:22.470> or<00:02:22.590> something<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:22.980> could<00:02:23.070> pop<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.430> in

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
card or something you could pop that in

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.240 
card or something you could pop that in
without<00:02:23.790> an<00:02:23.970> adapter<00:02:24.210> and<00:02:24.660> over<00:02:25.290> here<00:02:25.680> you

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
without an adapter and over here you

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.370 
without an adapter and over here you
have<00:02:26.460> an<00:02:26.640> SD<00:02:26.850> card<00:02:27.060> slot<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.840> can<00:02:27.960> put<00:02:28.140> into

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
have an SD card slot so you can put into

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.980 
have an SD card slot so you can put into
I<00:02:28.410> believe<00:02:28.710> up<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:29.010> 64<00:02:29.580> gigabyte<00:02:30.060> microSD

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
I believe up to a 64 gigabyte microSD

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.830 
I believe up to a 64 gigabyte microSD
card<00:02:31.650> in<00:02:31.860> here<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.310> get<00:02:32.550> some<00:02:32.840> augmented

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
card in here and get some augmented

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.210 
card in here and get some augmented
storage<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:34.650> pretty<00:02:34.860> much<00:02:34.980> the

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
storage so that is pretty much the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.650 
storage so that is pretty much the
system<00:02:35.580> it's<00:02:35.700> really<00:02:35.970> nice<00:02:36.150> though<00:02:36.360> because

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
system it's really nice though because

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.530 
system it's really nice though because
it<00:02:36.780> also<00:02:36.930> has<00:02:37.200> 2<00:02:37.920> gigs<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.340> on-board<00:02:38.580> ram<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:39.450> it

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
it also has 2 gigs of on-board ram so it

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.840 
it also has 2 gigs of on-board ram so it
actually<00:02:39.720> has<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.140> little<00:02:40.410> bit<00:02:40.650> more<00:02:41.460> than<00:02:41.670> some

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
actually has a little bit more than some

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.370 
actually has a little bit more than some
of<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.030> tablets<00:02:42.480> we've<00:02:42.600> looked<00:02:42.840> at<00:02:42.990> that<00:02:43.170> cost

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
of the tablets we've looked at that cost

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.470 
of the tablets we've looked at that cost
about<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.860> same<00:02:44.070> as<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:44.640> does<00:02:44.910> so<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.270> is

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
about the same as this does so that is

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.030 
about the same as this does so that is
pretty<00:02:45.690> cool<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.140> let's<00:02:46.290> boot<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.650> thing<00:02:46.860> up

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
pretty cool so let's boot this thing up

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.830 
pretty cool so let's boot this thing up
and<00:02:47.190> see<00:02:47.730> how<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:47.940> performs<00:02:48.360> all<00:02:48.570> right<00:02:48.690> got

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
and see how it performs all right got

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.570 
and see how it performs all right got
everything<00:02:49.110> hooked<00:02:49.230> up<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.680> plugged<00:02:50.100> in<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.520> do

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
everything hooked up and plugged in I do

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.100 
everything hooked up and plugged in I do
have<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.820> little<00:02:51.090> extension<00:02:51.570> cable<00:02:51.840> running

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
have a little extension cable running

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.500 
have a little extension cable running
here<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.730> HDMI<00:02:53.730> splitter<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:54.210> I<00:02:54.270> have<00:02:54.420> it

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
here to a HDMI splitter so I have it

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.420 
here to a HDMI splitter so I have it
running<00:02:54.630> through<00:02:54.780> my<00:02:54.990> video<00:02:55.290> system<00:02:55.800> we<00:02:56.310> do

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
running through my video system we do

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.010 
running through my video system we do
have<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.610> keyboard<00:02:57.060> plugged<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:57.600> along<00:02:57.840> with<00:02:57.990> a

have a keyboard plugged in along with a

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.660 
have a keyboard plugged in along with a
mouse<00:02:58.320> that's<00:02:58.530> hooked<00:02:58.770> up<00:02:58.980> into<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.430> so<00:02:59.550> we've

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
mouse that's hooked up into it so we've

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.280 
mouse that's hooked up into it so we've
got<00:02:59.820> an<00:02:59.940> Apple<00:03:00.300> keyboard<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.810> has<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.960> hub

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
got an Apple keyboard that has a hub

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.690 
got an Apple keyboard that has a hub
built<00:03:01.560> in<00:03:01.740> so<00:03:01.890> we'll<00:03:02.010> be<00:03:02.100> able<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.310> get<00:03:02.490> a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
built in so we'll be able to get a

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.340 
built in so we'll be able to get a
keyboard<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.450> mouse<00:03:03.510> through<00:03:03.870> that<00:03:03.990> single

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
keyboard and mouse through that single

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.870 
keyboard and mouse through that single
USB<00:03:04.770> port<00:03:05.070> but<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.310> will<00:03:05.430> also<00:03:05.700> demonstrate

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
USB port but this will also demonstrate

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.690 
USB port but this will also demonstrate
how<00:03:06.840> USB<00:03:07.380> hubs<00:03:07.680> work<00:03:07.860> with<00:03:08.070> it<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.370> then<00:03:08.670> I

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
how USB hubs work with it and then I

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.060 
how USB hubs work with it and then I
have<00:03:08.880> power<00:03:09.120> plugged<00:03:09.570> into<00:03:09.840> its<00:03:10.290> power<00:03:10.590> port

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
have power plugged into its power port

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.710 
have power plugged into its power port
so<00:03:11.190> what<00:03:11.310> we're<00:03:11.400> gonna<00:03:11.490> do<00:03:11.670> now<00:03:11.850> is<00:03:12.150> this<00:03:12.570> it

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
so what we're gonna do now is this it

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.060 
so what we're gonna do now is this it
the<00:03:12.810> little<00:03:13.050> switch<00:03:13.290> that's<00:03:13.500> on<00:03:13.620> this<00:03:13.800> side<00:03:14.040> of

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
the little switch that's on this side of

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.530 
the little switch that's on this side of
the<00:03:14.370> device<00:03:14.640> here<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.000> little<00:03:15.180> blue<00:03:15.300> light

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
the device here the little blue light

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
the device here the little blue light
will<00:03:15.690> come<00:03:15.810> on<00:03:15.870> I'm<00:03:16.050> just<00:03:16.170> going<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.320> switch

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
will come on I'm just going to switch

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.920 
will come on I'm just going to switch
over<00:03:16.710> to<00:03:16.860> my<00:03:16.980> window<00:03:17.910> here<00:03:18.030> cuz<00:03:18.209> my<00:03:18.300> TriCaster

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
over to my window here cuz my TriCaster

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.530 
over to my window here cuz my TriCaster
actually<00:03:19.290> displays<00:03:19.770> things<00:03:20.400> faster<00:03:21.060> than<00:03:21.330> my

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
actually displays things faster than my

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.090 
actually displays things faster than my
monitor<00:03:21.989> does<00:03:22.200> it's<00:03:22.410> based<00:03:22.560> on<00:03:22.709> how<00:03:22.830> all<00:03:22.980> this

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
monitor does it's based on how all this

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.920 
monitor does it's based on how all this
crazy<00:03:23.370> HDMI<00:03:24.000> stuff<00:03:24.270> works<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:24.570> might<00:03:24.690> see<00:03:24.840> me

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
crazy HDMI stuff works you might see me

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.240 
crazy HDMI stuff works you might see me
glitch<00:03:25.170> out<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.380> little<00:03:25.560> bit<00:03:25.739> here<00:03:25.920> as<00:03:26.040> things

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
glitch out a little bit here as things

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.010 
glitch out a little bit here as things
are<00:03:26.370> loading<00:03:26.640> up<00:03:26.760> but<00:03:27.330> you<00:03:27.390> can<00:03:27.510> see<00:03:27.690> just<00:03:27.900> how

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
are loading up but you can see just how

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.280 
are loading up but you can see just how
quickly<00:03:28.410> this<00:03:29.370> thing<00:03:29.430> loads<00:03:30.090> up<00:03:30.330> our<00:03:30.750> windows

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
quickly this thing loads up our windows

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.780 
quickly this thing loads up our windows
session<00:03:31.950> here<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:32.220> what<00:03:32.310> I'm<00:03:32.370> gonna<00:03:32.459> do<00:03:32.670> is

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
session here so what I'm gonna do is

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.940 
session here so what I'm gonna do is
just<00:03:33.030> pop<00:03:33.209> in<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.780> we'll<00:03:34.320> take<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.590> look<00:03:34.830> around

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
just pop in and we'll take a look around

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.430 
just pop in and we'll take a look around
and<00:03:35.340> see<00:03:35.550> how<00:03:36.150> some<00:03:36.390> things<00:03:36.660> work<00:03:36.959> on<00:03:37.140> it<00:03:37.290> it's

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
and see how some things work on it it's

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.890 
and see how some things work on it it's
actually<00:03:37.800> pretty<00:03:38.040> capable<00:03:38.880> little<00:03:39.420> computer

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
actually pretty capable little computer

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.840 
actually pretty capable little computer
it<00:03:39.989> performs<00:03:40.500> like<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.709> said<00:03:40.860> about<00:03:41.010> 20<00:03:41.400> percent

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
it performs like I said about 20 percent

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.720 
it performs like I said about 20 percent
slower<00:03:42.750> than<00:03:43.140> some<00:03:43.350> of<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.500> other<00:03:43.739> atom<00:03:44.250> based

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
slower than some of the other atom based

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.880 
slower than some of the other atom based
devices<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.420> we've<00:03:45.570> looked<00:03:45.810> at<00:03:46.050> but<00:03:46.680> again

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
devices that we've looked at but again

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
devices that we've looked at but again
it<00:03:47.010> when<00:03:47.130> you're<00:03:47.250> just<00:03:47.520> kind<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.700> poking

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
it when you're just kind of poking

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.910 
it when you're just kind of poking
around<00:03:48.120> it<00:03:48.420> doesn't<00:03:48.660> feel<00:03:48.840> all<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:49.770> much

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
around it doesn't feel all that much

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.670 
around it doesn't feel all that much
slower<00:03:50.250> here<00:03:50.580> so<00:03:50.760> we'll<00:03:50.910> go<00:03:51.030> pop<00:03:51.270> into<00:03:51.690> chrome

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
slower here so we'll go pop into chrome

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.190 
slower here so we'll go pop into chrome
here<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.250> maybe<00:03:53.370> I'll<00:03:53.580> load<00:03:53.790> up<00:03:53.820> CNN<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:54.810> I

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
here and maybe I'll load up CNN and I

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.020 
here and maybe I'll load up CNN and I
will<00:03:55.590> give<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.770> quick<00:03:56.010> look<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.430> see<00:03:56.700> how<00:03:56.820> that

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
will give a quick look and see how that

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.010 
will give a quick look and see how that
works<00:03:57.270> but<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:57.480> can<00:03:57.570> see<00:03:57.690> when<00:03:57.840> you're<00:03:57.959> moving

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
works but you can see when you're moving

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.660 
works but you can see when you're moving
around<00:03:58.200> inside<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.830> windows<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.280> stuff<00:03:59.520> it

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
around inside the windows and stuff it

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.000 
around inside the windows and stuff it
does<00:03:59.880> seem<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.690> work<00:04:00.959> pretty<00:04:00.989> nicely<00:04:01.500> here<00:04:01.860> so

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
does seem to work pretty nicely here so

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.070 
does seem to work pretty nicely here so
we'll<00:04:02.130> just<00:04:02.280> pop<00:04:02.489> open<00:04:02.720> CNN<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:03.810> hopefully<00:04:04.020> my

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
we'll just pop open CNN and hopefully my

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.690 
we'll just pop open CNN and hopefully my
Wi-Fi<00:04:04.440> connected<00:04:04.920> back<00:04:05.100> and<00:04:05.370> it<00:04:05.459> looks<00:04:05.640> like

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
Wi-Fi connected back and it looks like

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.430 
Wi-Fi connected back and it looks like
it<00:04:05.880> did<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.360> there<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:06.930> go<00:04:07.050> it<00:04:07.170> does<00:04:07.290> have

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
it did and there you go it does have

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.960 
it did and there you go it does have
built-in<00:04:07.739> Wi-Fi<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.220> could<00:04:08.489> of<00:04:08.610> course<00:04:08.640> hook

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
built-in Wi-Fi you could of course hook

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.680 
built-in Wi-Fi you could of course hook
up<00:04:09.090> Ethernet<00:04:09.600> through<00:04:10.440> that<00:04:10.650> USB<00:04:11.550> OTG<00:04:11.760> adapter

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
up Ethernet through that USB OTG adapter

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.150 
up Ethernet through that USB OTG adapter
or<00:04:12.870> of<00:04:13.019> course<00:04:13.170> through<00:04:13.440> a<00:04:13.470> hub<00:04:13.680> or<00:04:13.860> something

or of course through a hub or something

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.350 
or of course through a hub or something
I<00:04:14.220> do<00:04:14.310> have<00:04:14.430> like<00:04:14.550> this<00:04:14.670> really<00:04:14.850> neat<00:04:15.090> little

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
I do have like this really neat little

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.259 
I do have like this really neat little
USB<00:04:15.660> 3<00:04:16.169> hub<00:04:16.769> that<00:04:17.040> also<00:04:17.250> has<00:04:17.549> Ethernet<00:04:18.060> built

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
USB 3 hub that also has Ethernet built

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.580 
USB 3 hub that also has Ethernet built
in<00:04:18.419> which<00:04:18.570> will<00:04:18.720> work<00:04:18.870> fine<00:04:19.109> with<00:04:19.140> this<00:04:19.440> as

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
in which will work fine with this as

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.470 
in which will work fine with this as
well<00:04:19.769> so<00:04:19.830> but<00:04:20.730> you<00:04:20.790> can<00:04:20.850> see<00:04:21.030> how<00:04:21.090> quickly<00:04:21.299> the

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
well so but you can see how quickly the

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.750 
well so but you can see how quickly the
pages<00:04:21.780> come<00:04:21.930> up<00:04:22.049> it<00:04:22.169> does<00:04:22.350> render<00:04:23.130> pretty<00:04:23.460> fast

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
pages come up it does render pretty fast

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.279 
pages come up it does render pretty fast
and<00:04:24.000> CNN<00:04:24.419> of<00:04:24.539> course<00:04:24.750> just<00:04:24.840> changed<00:04:25.169> their

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
and CNN of course just changed their

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.380 
and CNN of course just changed their
website<00:04:25.680> everything's<00:04:26.039> bigger<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.580> takes

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
website everything's bigger and takes

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.680 
website everything's bigger and takes
long

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
long

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.720 
long
a<00:04:27.720> load<00:04:28.020> but<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:28.740> is<00:04:28.860> able<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.160> render<00:04:29.340> things

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
a load but it is able to render things

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.150 
a load but it is able to render things
out<00:04:29.940> pretty<00:04:30.600> nicely<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:31.170> the<00:04:31.470> Windows<00:04:31.830> stuff

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
out pretty nicely the the Windows stuff

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.460 
out pretty nicely the the Windows stuff
also<00:04:32.640> looks<00:04:32.970> pretty<00:04:33.180> nice<00:04:33.360> as<00:04:33.570> well<00:04:33.750> so<00:04:34.080> hi

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
also looks pretty nice as well so hi

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.200 
also looks pretty nice as well so hi
this<00:04:34.650> you<00:04:34.890> know<00:04:34.980> pretty<00:04:35.190> quick<00:04:35.490> responding

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
this you know pretty quick responding

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.080 
this you know pretty quick responding
but<00:04:36.300> again<00:04:36.600> not<00:04:36.810> so<00:04:37.560> fast<00:04:37.830> when<00:04:38.040> we<00:04:38.100> saw<00:04:38.370> some

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
but again not so fast when we saw some

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.640 
but again not so fast when we saw some
of<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.270> benchmarks<00:04:39.570> I<00:04:39.900> ran<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.170> octane

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
of the benchmarks I ran the octane

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.830 
of the benchmarks I ran the octane
benchmark<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.370> other<00:04:41.550> day<00:04:41.700> and<00:04:42.000> it<00:04:42.300> scores

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
benchmark the other day and it scores

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.070 
benchmark the other day and it scores
again<00:04:43.110> about<00:04:43.550> 4700<00:04:44.550> on<00:04:45.060> that's<00:04:45.300> on<00:04:45.480> that<00:04:45.630> test

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
again about 4700 on that's on that test

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.470 
again about 4700 on that's on that test
and<00:04:46.260> that's<00:04:46.410> about<00:04:46.650> 20%<00:04:47.070> slower<00:04:47.670> than<00:04:48.060> the

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
and that's about 20% slower than the

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.060 
and that's about 20% slower than the

Trail processor along with 2 gigabytes
of<00:05:27.930> RAM<00:05:28.140> we<00:05:28.320> saw<00:05:28.500> about<00:05:28.680> 40<00:05:29.070> frames<00:05:29.280> per<00:05:29.520> second

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
of RAM we saw about 40 frames per second

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.430 
of RAM we saw about 40 frames per second
or<00:05:29.910> so<00:05:29.970> with<00:05:30.270> these<00:05:30.450> same<00:05:30.660> quality<00:05:31.140> settings

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
or so with these same quality settings

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.290 
or so with these same quality settings
we're<00:05:31.590> not<00:05:31.710> quite<00:05:31.919> getting<00:05:32.160> that<00:05:32.340> here<00:05:32.700> we're

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
we're not quite getting that here we're

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.930 
we're not quite getting that here we're
getting<00:05:33.540> in<00:05:33.660> somewhere<00:05:34.140> in<00:05:34.169> the<00:05:34.290> 20s<00:05:34.830> or<00:05:35.010> so<00:05:35.280> so

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
getting in somewhere in the 20s or so so

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.600 
getting in somewhere in the 20s or so so
really<00:05:36.240> not<00:05:36.450> a<00:05:36.690> terribly<00:05:37.620> fast<00:05:37.919> performer<00:05:38.520> and

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
really not a terribly fast performer and

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.420 
really not a terribly fast performer and
again<00:05:38.820> I<00:05:38.850> think<00:05:38.940> it's<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.419> issue<00:05:39.540> related<00:05:40.169> to

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
again I think it's the issue related to

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.980 
again I think it's the issue related to
voltage<00:05:41.430> on<00:05:41.669> this<00:05:42.120> particular<00:05:42.450> device

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
voltage on this particular device

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.500 
voltage on this particular device
because<00:05:43.440> the<00:05:43.800> zotac<00:05:44.190> would<00:05:44.430> take<00:05:44.610> 3<00:05:44.880> amps<00:05:45.180> at<00:05:45.300> 5

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
because the zotac would take 3 amps at 5

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.110 
because the zotac would take 3 amps at 5
volts<00:05:45.900> this<00:05:46.380> is<00:05:46.440> only<00:05:46.740> taking<00:05:47.070> 2<00:05:47.310> amps<00:05:47.730> at<00:05:47.880> 5

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
volts this is only taking 2 amps at 5

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.000 
volts this is only taking 2 amps at 5
volts<00:05:48.150> and<00:05:48.480> I<00:05:48.600> think<00:05:48.840> that<00:05:49.050> is<00:05:49.260> kind<00:05:49.890> of

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
volts and I think that is kind of

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.380 
volts and I think that is kind of
limiting<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.790> performance<00:05:51.240> of<00:05:51.330> the

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
limiting the performance of the

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.790 
limiting the performance of the
processor<00:05:51.870> may<00:05:51.960> not<00:05:52.110> be<00:05:52.169> able<00:05:52.260> to<00:05:52.320> burst<00:05:52.680> I'll

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800

the<00:05:57.360> kind<00:05:57.900> of<00:05:57.930> performance<00:05:58.380> that<00:05:58.440> we<00:05:58.590> saw<00:05:58.800> out

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
the kind of performance that we saw out

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.350 
the kind of performance that we saw out
of<00:05:59.010> the<00:05:59.160> zotac<00:05:59.550> and<00:05:59.790> I<00:05:59.820> think<00:06:00.060> that<00:06:00.240> is

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
of the zotac and I think that is

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.230 
of the zotac and I think that is
probably<00:06:00.570> due<00:06:00.960> just<00:06:01.740> to<00:06:01.800> the<00:06:02.010> lack<00:06:02.250> of<00:06:02.280> amount

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
probably due just to the lack of amount

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.640 
probably due just to the lack of amount
of<00:06:03.330> juice<00:06:03.600> going<00:06:03.870> into<00:06:04.230> this<00:06:04.320> and<00:06:04.530> of<00:06:04.590> course

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
of juice going into this and of course

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.840 
of juice going into this and of course
on<00:06:04.919> some<00:06:05.040> of<00:06:05.130> those<00:06:05.220> tablets<00:06:05.490> they<00:06:05.700> have<00:06:05.790> a

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
on some of those tablets they have a

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.880 
on some of those tablets they have a
bigger<00:06:06.030> battery<00:06:06.300> and<00:06:06.750> usually<00:06:07.380> those<00:06:07.500> tablets

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
bigger battery and usually those tablets

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.530 
bigger battery and usually those tablets
actually<00:06:08.250> draw<00:06:08.520> from<00:06:08.790> the<00:06:08.940> battery<00:06:09.120> before

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
actually draw from the battery before

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.170 
actually draw from the battery before
they<00:06:10.380> even<00:06:10.500> touch<00:06:10.650> the<00:06:11.040> power<00:06:11.280> that's<00:06:11.970> plugged

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
they even touch the power that's plugged

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.060 
they even touch the power that's plugged
into<00:06:12.390> them<00:06:12.630> so<00:06:12.870> that<00:06:12.960> is<00:06:13.080> the<00:06:13.230> amiibo<00:06:13.590> pad<00:06:13.890> it

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
into them so that is the amiibo pad it

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.310 
into them so that is the amiibo pad it
is<00:06:14.160> a<00:06:14.220> functional<00:06:14.850> Windows<00:06:15.240> PC<00:06:15.750> on<00:06:15.930> a<00:06:15.960> stick

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
is a functional Windows PC on a stick

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.780 
is a functional Windows PC on a stick
and<00:06:16.530> it<00:06:16.620> works<00:06:16.860> pretty<00:06:17.070> well<00:06:17.280> it's<00:06:17.610> a<00:06:17.640> little

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
and it works pretty well it's a little

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.340 
and it works pretty well it's a little
bit<00:06:17.970> slower<00:06:18.240> than<00:06:18.450> some<00:06:18.630> of<00:06:18.720> the<00:06:18.780> other<00:06:18.960> atom

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
bit slower than some of the other atom

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.840

bait rail devices that we've played with

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.970 
bait rail devices that we've played with
but<00:06:21.120> it<00:06:21.330> is<00:06:21.540> still<00:06:21.870> very<00:06:21.930> usable<00:06:22.650> for<00:06:22.800> web

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980

my<00:06:25.320> biggest<00:06:25.620> concern<00:06:26.130> at<00:06:26.280> the<00:06:26.340> moment<00:06:26.370> and<00:06:26.880> why

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
my biggest concern at the moment and why

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.420 
my biggest concern at the moment and why
I<00:06:27.120> really<00:06:27.540> can't<00:06:27.750> recommend<00:06:28.020> it<00:06:28.320> right<00:06:28.530> now<00:06:28.770> is

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
I really can't recommend it right now is

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.740 
I really can't recommend it right now is
that<00:06:29.610> they're<00:06:29.730> distributing<00:06:30.270> a<00:06:30.330> version<00:06:30.540> of

that<00:06:34.050> ASAP<00:06:34.680> because<00:06:34.860> at<00:06:35.130> the<00:06:35.220> moment<00:06:35.250> you'll

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
that ASAP because at the moment you'll

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.550 
that ASAP because at the moment you'll
get<00:06:36.060> about<00:06:36.210> 30<00:06:36.479> days<00:06:36.720> of<00:06:36.870> usage<00:06:37.020> out<00:06:37.350> of<00:06:37.470> it

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
get about 30 days of usage out of it

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.110 
get about 30 days of usage out of it
before<00:06:37.680> you<00:06:38.010> have<00:06:38.130> to<00:06:38.250> activate<00:06:38.729> Windows

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
before you have to activate Windows

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.250 
before you have to activate Windows
meaning<00:06:39.390> you<00:06:39.450> have<00:06:39.570> to<00:06:39.660> go<00:06:39.750> out<00:06:39.840> and<00:06:39.990> buy<00:06:40.229> it

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
meaning you have to go out and buy it

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.600 
meaning you have to go out and buy it
which<00:06:41.100> of<00:06:41.220> course

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
which of course

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.100 
which of course
cost<00:06:41.759> more<00:06:42.030> than<00:06:42.270> the<00:06:42.479> cost<00:06:42.689> of<00:06:42.840> the<00:06:42.960> device

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
cost more than the cost of the device

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.050 
cost more than the cost of the device
this<00:06:43.530> is<00:06:43.650> certainly<00:06:43.889> eligible<00:06:44.520> to<00:06:44.639> get<00:06:44.759> into

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 
this is certainly eligible to get into

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.330 
this is certainly eligible to get into
the<00:06:45.719> windows<00:06:46.110> with<00:06:46.289> Bing<00:06:46.590> program<00:06:47.069> which<00:06:47.219> is

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
the windows with Bing program which is

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.770 
the windows with Bing program which is
that<00:06:47.490> free<00:06:47.759> version<00:06:48.120> of<00:06:48.210> Windows<00:06:48.539> that<00:06:48.659> is

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
that free version of Windows that is

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.899 
that free version of Windows that is
coming<00:06:49.020> with<00:06:49.159> low-priced<00:06:50.159> devices<00:06:50.789> so

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:50.909 
coming with low-priced devices so

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:52.490 
coming with low-priced devices so
hopefully<00:06:51.240> they'll<00:06:51.449> get<00:06:51.629> into<00:06:51.870> that<00:06:51.990> program

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 
hopefully they'll get into that program

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.170 
hopefully they'll get into that program
and<00:06:52.680> then<00:06:53.099> I<00:06:53.250> can<00:06:53.400> recommend<00:06:53.669> it<00:06:53.969> because<00:06:54.060> at

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
and then I can recommend it because at

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.520 
and then I can recommend it because at
the<00:06:54.270> moment<00:06:54.629> you're<00:06:55.050> gonna<00:06:55.139> have<00:06:55.259> to<00:06:55.319> buy

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
the moment you're gonna have to buy

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.230 
the moment you're gonna have to buy
Windows<00:06:55.800> to<00:06:56.159> be<00:06:56.280> legal<00:06:56.669> and<00:06:56.759> that's<00:06:56.939> going<00:06:57.150> to

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 
Windows to be legal and that's going to

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.330 
Windows to be legal and that's going to
be<00:06:57.330> a<00:06:57.360> huge<00:06:57.780> expense<00:06:58.139> for<00:06:58.800> something<00:06:59.129> so

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
be a huge expense for something so

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.249 
be a huge expense for something so
inexpensive<00:07:00.090> there<00:07:00.240> will<00:07:00.360> be<00:07:00.389> a<00:07:00.509> BIOS<00:07:00.930> update

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:01.259 
inexpensive there will be a BIOS update

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:03.110 
inexpensive there will be a BIOS update
coming<00:07:01.560> soon<00:07:01.770> that<00:07:01.979> will<00:07:02.099> allow<00:07:02.370> a<00:07:02.669> dual

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
coming soon that will allow a dual

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.179 
coming soon that will allow a dual
booting<00:07:03.509> with<00:07:03.780> Windows<00:07:04.199> and<00:07:04.229> Android<00:07:04.949> so<00:07:05.099> you

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:05.189 
booting with Windows and Android so you

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:06.890 
booting with Windows and Android so you
can<00:07:05.310> decide<00:07:05.610> which<00:07:05.849> of<00:07:06.090> those<00:07:06.479> operating

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
can decide which of those operating

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.929 
can decide which of those operating
systems<00:07:07.319> you<00:07:07.439> want<00:07:07.560> to<00:07:07.710> run<00:07:07.919> on<00:07:08.129> your<00:07:08.310> TV<00:07:08.520> so

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:08.939 
systems you want to run on your TV so

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:10.999 
systems you want to run on your TV so
pretty<00:07:09.150> cool<00:07:09.389> that<00:07:09.569> that<00:07:10.229> will<00:07:10.379> be<00:07:10.500> available

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:11.009 
pretty cool that that will be available

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:12.260 
pretty cool that that will be available
very<00:07:11.189> shortly<00:07:11.340> so<00:07:11.729> hopefully<00:07:12.030> they'll<00:07:12.150> get

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:12.270 
very shortly so hopefully they'll get

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.790 
very shortly so hopefully they'll get
