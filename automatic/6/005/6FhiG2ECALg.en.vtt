00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
is just you know there are variables

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.440 
is just you know there are variables
it's<00:04:45.500> just<00:04:45.620> statistics<00:04:46.190> and<00:04:47.060> actually<00:04:47.389> I

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
it's just statistics and actually I

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.820 
it's just statistics and actually I
think<00:04:47.479> just<00:04:47.750> California<00:04:48.020> statistics<00:04:48.680> they're

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
think just California statistics they're

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.140 
think just California statistics they're
the<00:04:48.890> only<00:04:48.979> ones<00:04:49.250> i<00:04:49.400> think<00:04:49.610> in<00:04:49.669> this<00:04:49.790> country

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
the only ones i think in this country

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.070 
the only ones i think in this country
that<00:04:50.180> massive<00:04:50.960> study<00:04:51.560> on<00:04:51.710> motorcycles<00:04:52.960> but<00:04:53.960> i

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
that massive study on motorcycles but i

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.320 
that massive study on motorcycles but i
mean<00:04:54.310> when<00:04:55.310> you<00:04:55.400> own<00:04:55.550> a<00:04:55.580> bike<00:04:55.820> I've<00:04:56.030> said<00:04:56.210> this

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
mean when you own a bike I've said this

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.440 
mean when you own a bike I've said this
100<00:04:56.660> times<00:04:57.010> everyone<00:04:58.010> wants<00:04:58.280> to<00:04:58.310> kill<00:04:58.580> you<00:04:58.760> all

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
100 times everyone wants to kill you all

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.360 
100 times everyone wants to kill you all
the<00:04:59.810> natural<00:04:59.990> laws<00:05:00.470> of<00:05:00.770> gravity<00:05:01.220> in<00:05:01.280> the

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
the natural laws of gravity in the

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.480 
the natural laws of gravity in the
universe<00:05:01.729> do<00:05:01.910> not<00:05:02.060> exist<00:05:02.440> and<00:05:03.440> so<00:05:03.830> you<00:05:03.890> need<00:05:04.340> to

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
universe do not exist and so you need to

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.520 
universe do not exist and so you need to
know<00:05:04.700> the<00:05:05.210> basics<00:05:05.419> and<00:05:07.750> now<00:05:08.750> be<00:05:08.930> prepared<00:05:09.440> for

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
know the basics and now be prepared for

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.680 
know the basics and now be prepared for
anything<00:05:09.830> that<00:05:10.460> will<00:05:10.850> inevitably<00:05:11.180> happen

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
anything that will inevitably happen

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.830 
anything that will inevitably happen
everybody<00:05:12.620> drops<00:05:12.979> their<00:05:13.190> bike<00:05:13.840> everybody

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
everybody drops their bike everybody

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.880 
everybody drops their bike everybody
crashes<00:05:15.520> eventually<00:05:16.520> I<00:05:16.700> mean<00:05:17.419> I<00:05:17.840> mean<00:05:18.680> that's

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
crashes eventually I mean I mean that's

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.430 
crashes eventually I mean I mean that's
not<00:05:19.850> majority<00:05:20.539> I<00:05:20.570> think<00:05:20.810> like<00:05:20.930> ninety-nine

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
not majority I think like ninety-nine

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.950 
not majority I think like ninety-nine
point<00:05:21.650> nine<00:05:21.740> percent<00:05:22.220> of<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:22.340> people<00:05:22.630> and<00:05:23.630> so

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
point nine percent of the people and so

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.719 
point nine percent of the people and so
what<00:05:24.860> you<00:05:24.979> have<00:05:25.010> to<00:05:25.340> do<00:05:25.580> is<00:05:25.789> you<00:05:26.690> have<00:05:26.720> to

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
what you have to do is you have to

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:31.810 
what you have to do is you have to
prepare<00:05:28.729> yourself<00:05:29.210> to<00:05:29.860> absorb<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:31.130> impact<00:05:31.250> of

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
prepare yourself to absorb the impact of

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.350 
prepare yourself to absorb the impact of
your<00:05:32.530> no<00:05:33.530> crash<00:05:33.860> as<00:05:34.220> well<00:05:34.400> as<00:05:34.520> possible<00:05:35.000> and

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
your no crash as well as possible and

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.190 
your no crash as well as possible and
why<00:05:35.600> is<00:05:35.660> that<00:05:35.840> not<00:05:36.350> cool<00:05:36.910> why<00:05:37.910> is<00:05:37.970> that<00:05:38.200> you

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
why is that not cool why is that you

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.180 
why is that not cool why is that you
know<00:05:39.350> not<00:05:39.650> up<00:05:39.919> to<00:05:40.280> Jack<00:05:41.150> Nicholson's

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
know not up to Jack Nicholson's

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.600 
know not up to Jack Nicholson's

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
it was a green light and I was slowing

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.990 
it was a green light and I was slowing
down<00:05:56.599> for<00:05:56.750> some<00:05:56.870> reason

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
down for some reason

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.210 
down for some reason
for<00:05:59.600> some<00:05:59.780> reason<00:06:00.080> people<00:06:00.350> think<00:06:00.380> they<00:06:01.190> don't

for some reason people think they don't

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.130 
for some reason people think they don't
need<00:06:01.610> anything<00:06:02.000> to<00:06:02.240> protect<00:06:02.390> the<00:06:02.630> face<00:06:02.810> maybe

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
like full helmet which I don't

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.840 
like full helmet which I don't
understand<00:06:12.200> why<00:06:12.380> not<00:06:12.620> but<00:06:13.340> if<00:06:13.430> you<00:06:13.520> don't<00:06:13.760> you

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
understand why not but if you don't you

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.350 
understand why not but if you don't you
should<00:06:13.880> at<00:06:14.090> least<00:06:14.270> have<00:06:14.570> a<00:06:14.840> safety<00:06:15.680> shield

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360
