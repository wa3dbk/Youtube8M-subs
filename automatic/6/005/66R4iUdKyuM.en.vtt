think<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.500> at<00:01:10.799> least<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:11.460> goal<00:01:11.700> will<00:01:11.939> be

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
think that at least one goal will be

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.210 
think that at least one goal will be
scored<00:01:12.330> by<00:01:12.420> travis<00:01:12.840> owning<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.140> game<00:01:13.220> okay

that you may have two away goals upon
them<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.650> know<00:01:19.740> surely<00:01:20.009> they're<00:01:20.159> going<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.369> be

of a lot of 1.8 III Edison it's really
just<00:01:40.439> deeper<00:01:40.799> yep<00:01:41.400> would<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.880> also<00:01:42.030> combine

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
just deeper yep would you also combine

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.569 
just deeper yep would you also combine
that<00:01:42.869> then<00:01:43.079> you've<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.530> win<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.950> both<00:01:44.130> teams<00:01:44.340> to

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
that then you've a win and both teams to

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.950

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
score price at 3.25 with Paddy Power I

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.330 
score price at 3.25 with Paddy Power I
think<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.079> will<00:01:49.350> assist<00:01:49.740> are<00:01:49.950> two<00:01:50.100> more

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
think that will assist are two more

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.420 
think that will assist are two more
goals<00:01:50.610> than<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.970> first<00:01:51.180> leg<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:52.040> you<00:01:53.040> may<00:01:53.280> if

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430
