invention<00:02:13.590> by<00:02:13.710> Bill<00:02:13.980> best<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.490> tech<00:02:15.080> but<00:02:16.080> the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
invention by Bill best of tech but the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.830 
invention by Bill best of tech but the
concept<00:02:16.710> is<00:02:16.920> again<00:02:17.550> instead<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.420> getting<00:02:18.750> all

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
concept is again instead of getting all

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.420 
concept is again instead of getting all
the<00:02:18.990> greases<00:02:19.410> on<00:02:19.530> there<00:02:19.680> stopping<00:02:20.040> up<00:02:20.250> your

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
the greases on there stopping up your

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.150 
the greases on there stopping up your
holes<00:02:20.640> having<00:02:21.120> your<00:02:21.240> burners<00:02:21.630> fall<00:02:22.350> apart<00:02:22.710> and

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
holes having your burners fall apart and

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.480 
holes having your burners fall apart and
rust<00:02:24.000> out<00:02:24.240> they<00:02:24.990> put<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:25.410> over<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:26.220> top<00:02:26.430> of

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
rust out they put this over the top of

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:33.320 
rust out they put this over the top of
it<00:02:26.880> just<00:02:27.920> like<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:31.620> heats<00:02:31.920> up<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:33.090> grease

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
it just like so this heats up the grease

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.230 
it just like so this heats up the grease
drippings<00:02:33.780> hit<00:02:33.960> this<00:02:34.200> they<00:02:34.950> vaporize<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.910> our

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
drippings hit this they vaporize and our

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.510 
drippings hit this they vaporize and our
draw<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:37.200> drain<00:02:37.470> off<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.040> back<00:02:38.220> and

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
draw and drain off to the back and

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.270 
draw and drain off to the back and
because<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.720> way<00:02:39.870> it's<00:02:40.200> like<00:02:40.440> there's

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
because of the way it's like there's

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.630 
because of the way it's like there's
technologies<00:02:42.320> they're<00:02:43.320> bigger<00:02:43.650> grills<00:02:44.040> it's

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
technologies they're bigger grills it's

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.540 
technologies they're bigger grills it's
because<00:02:45.030> there's<00:02:45.330> no<00:02:45.570> or<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.470> hole<00:02:46.800> there's<00:02:47.400> not

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
because there's no or a hole there's not

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.390 
because there's no or a hole there's not

a whole lot of air in between the grids

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.980 
a whole lot of air in between the grids
right<00:02:50.700> here<00:02:50.910> when<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.120> put<00:02:51.330> your<00:02:51.480> meats<00:02:51.720> right

right here when you put your meats right
on<00:02:52.140> top<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:53.180> you<00:02:54.180> don't<00:02:54.300> get<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:55.380> flare-ups

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
on top of it you don't get the flare-ups

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.280 
on top of it you don't get the flare-ups
that<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.220> would<00:02:56.370> on<00:02:56.550> a<00:02:56.580> normal<00:02:56.840> girl<00:02:57.840> as<00:02:58.050> we
