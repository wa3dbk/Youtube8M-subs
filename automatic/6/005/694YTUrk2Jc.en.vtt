00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.069 
it disconnected you saw an intelligence
level<00:04:11.650> to<00:04:11.799> a<00:04:11.829> point<00:04:12.340> but<00:04:12.880> then<00:04:13.150> you<00:04:13.630> saw<00:04:13.870> his

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
level to a point but then you saw his

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.550 
level to a point but then you saw his
limitations<00:04:14.859> because<00:04:15.389> he<00:04:16.389> figured<00:04:16.900> out<00:04:17.109> that

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
limitations because he figured out that

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.920 
limitations because he figured out that
he<00:04:19.160> could<00:04:19.370> get<00:04:19.489> access<00:04:19.730> to<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.180> pinata<00:04:20.739> by

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
he could get access to the pinata by

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.629 
he could get access to the pinata by
getting<00:04:23.930> to<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.110> bungee<00:04:24.530> cord<00:04:24.560> higher<00:04:25.310> up

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
getting to the bungee cord higher up

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.520 
getting to the bungee cord higher up
with<00:04:26.000> he<00:04:26.120> could<00:04:26.300> actually<00:04:26.420> reach<00:04:26.780> and<00:04:27.110> pull<00:04:27.350> it

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
with he could actually reach and pull it

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.659 
with he could actually reach and pull it
up<00:04:27.680> to<00:04:27.860> himself<00:04:28.240> but<00:04:29.240> then<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:30.669> pinata

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
up to himself but then the the pinata

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.000 
up to himself but then the the pinata
was<00:04:31.910> hitting<00:04:32.210> some<00:04:32.240> perching<00:04:32.930> and<00:04:33.200> he<00:04:33.830> just

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
was hitting some perching and he just

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.010 
was hitting some perching and he just
kept<00:04:34.250> trying<00:04:34.430> to<00:04:34.580> force<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:35.060> issue<00:04:35.180> and<00:04:35.720> he

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
kept trying to force the issue and he

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.350 
kept trying to force the issue and he
couldn't<00:04:36.290> quite<00:04:36.440> figure<00:04:36.710> out<00:04:36.950> how<00:04:37.520> to<00:04:37.580> move<00:04:37.940> it

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
couldn't quite figure out how to move it

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.080 
couldn't quite figure out how to move it
to<00:04:38.750> free<00:04:39.350> it<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:39.590> get<00:04:39.770> up<00:04:39.950> where<00:04:40.130> he<00:04:40.220> had<00:04:40.340> full

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
to free it to get up where he had full

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.629 
to free it to get up where he had full
access<00:04:41.120> so<00:04:41.630> you<00:04:42.110> saw<00:04:42.680> it<00:04:42.710> and<00:04:42.980> tells<00:04:43.160> his<00:04:43.340> level

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
access so you saw it and tells his level

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.280 
access so you saw it and tells his level
to<00:04:43.730> a<00:04:43.760> point<00:04:44.120> but<00:04:44.780> then<00:04:44.930> you<00:04:45.050> saw<00:04:45.230> the

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
to a point but then you saw the

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.110 
to a point but then you saw the
limitation<00:04:45.950> of<00:04:46.010> that<00:04:46.100> until<00:04:46.580> it's<00:04:46.700> just<00:04:46.730> level

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
limitation of that until it's just level

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.760 
limitation of that until it's just level
two<00:04:47.270> so<00:04:47.510> that<00:04:47.600> was<00:04:47.750> quite<00:04:47.930> interesting<00:04:50.620> but<00:04:51.620> I

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
two so that was quite interesting but I

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.690 
two so that was quite interesting but I
got<00:04:52.010> a<00:04:52.040> hunch

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:09.210 

let's<00:04:57.000> not

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.800 

oh<00:05:09.250> yeah

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.840 

Oh
