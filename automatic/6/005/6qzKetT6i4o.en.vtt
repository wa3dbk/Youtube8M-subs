00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.410
 and welcome a loan to their new one 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.420
 power their of your hosts from jordi 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.199
 because you build that question new are the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.029
 audio 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.830
 that is more dull but it still made 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.810
 new in any case 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.390
 today we are going to look forward to hearing 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.050
 children and julia ask what is the hear 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.269
 he just 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.080
 can you lie under a stone of 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.600
 the walking dead is really their best baby 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.130
 series over almost the entire world 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.710
 you go on 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.450
 think it really is just like that 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.730
 anyway a 2nd or 3rd 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.950
 but anyway it is in a top 3 and 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.440
 how being a dent is just really the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.440
 Best franchise from zombies that are on this 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.120
 moment and beats how westend is evil 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.980
 and now I'm going to say a lot where 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.629
 perhaps 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.610
 well i'm not going to regret it 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.800
 9 have had no regrets because 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.059
 getting is just twice as good as 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.520
 dear mist 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.339
 the story is also super amazing and with 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.170
 every new episode of the series 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.119
 come further in the story and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.310
 then look about say a prologue to me 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.470
 because exactly happened in advance 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.650
 van Roder and 4th came out and is grateful 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.790
 so sometimes bus drivers already mentioned in the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.790
 marquee net 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.680
 and these markers yes those are the sins 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.580
 point went wrong I hit 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.710
 that had to happen 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.180
 how is that all according to the virus 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.009
 are up against mail 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.350
 every one son of the what now i can one 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.689
 little more about how she actually is 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.430
 belgians go what I still think is super cool 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.920
 the bar is just that it is based 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.110
 so I already come across a comic book 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.310
 can be right with a play by 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.520
 comic book 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.659
 kick too cool and so it's just one 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.750
 fucking 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:53.829
 series made of it and it really looks like 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.770
 everyone's expectations one by one 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:59.049
 at least the navy is super bold 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.810
 your one 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.009
 there is a giver but the code 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.990
 two more 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.450
 the then a game and complete 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.519
 new game in which you as one 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.000
 main character plays someone in the 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.700
 series 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.450
 and that is namely daryl and dermul 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.220
 boys he is not the main character but 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.750
 in the main characters 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.000
 Martello is like my favorite 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.489
 character simply really the best 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.549
 has a furry crossbow he has one 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.980
 strange past with neck past and he 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.620
 is just super fat 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.170
 daryl is just really a vest character 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.380
 and when he dies the series will 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.190
 I also die a little and that is 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.739
 really awful 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.530
 in any case you will be super greasy 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.600
 series you should really watch especially the bowl 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.720
 I also read I will also buy soon 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.019
 and big game I have sprayed on 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.019
 my channel 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.319
 what it was no oh nothing nothing no no 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:07.959
 but I also let's play the game on 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:09.819
 my channel and yes it is super fat and them 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.060
 really don't know morgan and is 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.940
 I give this tip go watch it go 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.829
 read or go play because if you are one of 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.829
 Do these three things when you do the series 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.720
 looks and come I read if the game plays 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.609
 is stuck anyway for bible for the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.150
 rest of your life so green is very bad 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.290
 difficult 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.819
 Willem and so I have about the 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.319
 next time I go to a previous one 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.859
 We are now living back with a new 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.940
 to build 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:36.160
 no case until then and then no thank you 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.720
 there is wider than what you combine 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.720
 pick up several times
