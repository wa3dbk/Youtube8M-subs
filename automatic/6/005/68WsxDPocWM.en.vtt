00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.510
 Hello 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:58.589
 would cut in the hair 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.210
 yes yes clear before you feel 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.210
 let's put on a robe 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.890
 how do you want support as I see how I 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.020

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.310
 perfect and while I cut it I'm going to 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.650
 put these hearing aids to listen 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:20.160
 music very well you listen to us and the 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.160
 listeners 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.730
 scissors cut the hair from cut 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.220
 with scissors like this 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.940
 if you think we cut a bit more 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.790
 above 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.070
 well, they, too, are me 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.200
 checking this one that you think is your 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.920
 short law and I matched him from this other 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.920
 side is already 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.140
 and a lot 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.200
 but you have to count less you have 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.200
 to cut so much if you go 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.540
 the appointment is already set 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.400
 and it is already 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.620
 so we can show you do not go 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.769
 to show something else 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.610
 or could review it could be revised well 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.300
 you like it is looking good you like it 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:28.670
 yes I like if that degree 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:32.510
 on the other side while on that side to 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.740
 there we are going to cut this take and it is a 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.740
 little more a little 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.810
 analyzing it more 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.650
 but uneven 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.730
 what do you think of as headquarters 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.940
 now yes we are going to take it out 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.450
 good 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.240
 exactly like that 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.810
 this is a dryer what we are going to do 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.520
 is to cover it we turn it on 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.250
 a towel is important 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.760
 that white talk to the others so that 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.760
 you will not need 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.069
 Now I take it off and you tell me 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.610
 like me 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.610
 yes 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.610
 and he liked how it was 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.010
 I like very much 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.010
 low 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.130
