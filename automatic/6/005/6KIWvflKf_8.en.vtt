draw all the artifacts and by learning
how<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.189> draw<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.610> artifacts<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.390> would

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
how to draw the artifacts you would

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.149 
how to draw the artifacts you would
basically<00:01:51.840> be<00:01:52.439> learning<00:01:52.740> how<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.890> design

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
basically be learning how to design

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.340 
basically be learning how to design
products<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.570> know<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.780> would<00:01:54.930> draw<00:01:55.110> like

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
products but you know we would draw like

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.319 
products but you know we would draw like
different<00:01:55.799> like<00:01:55.920> trains<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.670> cars<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
different like trains and cars and

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.870 
different like trains and cars and
vehicles<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:58.259> like<00:01:58.409> learn<00:01:58.619> how<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.159> do

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
vehicles and like learn how to like do

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.840 
vehicles and like learn how to like do
all<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.180> stuff<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.930> basically<00:02:01.740> like<00:02:02.340> at<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
all this stuff and basically like at the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.020 
all this stuff and basically like at the
American<00:02:03.240> military<00:02:03.659> museum<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.350> where<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.610> was

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
there for a class drawing these vehicles

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.270 
there for a class drawing these vehicles
and<00:02:09.090> when<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.360> was<00:02:09.509> there<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.690> discovered

and when I was there I discovered
this<00:02:11.940> Humvee<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.990> had<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.700> an<00:02:14.700> extremely

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
this Humvee that had a an extremely

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.310 
this Humvee that had a an extremely
durable<00:02:16.670> tarp<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.270> at<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.720> time<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.050> was

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
durable tarp on it and at the time I was

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.720 
durable tarp on it and at the time I was
wanting<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.680> make<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> waterproof<00:02:20.580> and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
sustainable backpack and I realized that

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.650 
sustainable backpack and I realized that
I<00:02:23.820> could<00:02:24.510> use<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.470> tarp<00:02:25.770> from<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.660> military

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
I could use the tarp from this military

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.320 
I could use the tarp from this military
truck<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.920> make<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.370> waterproof<00:02:30.210> and

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
truck to make a waterproof and

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.430 
truck to make a waterproof and
sustainable<00:02:30.750> backpack

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
sustainable backpack

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.670 
sustainable backpack
each<00:02:31.650> bag<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.220> we<00:02:32.310> make<00:02:32.460> is<00:02:32.610> unique<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:34.500> is

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
each bag that we make is unique this is

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.490 
each bag that we make is unique this is
uh<00:02:35.570> this<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.630> where<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:36.930> all<00:02:36.990> started

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
uh this is where it all started

all begins you know I go through some of

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.990 
all begins you know I go through some of
the<00:03:31.320> ink<00:03:31.440> sketchbooks<00:03:31.860> yeah

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
the ink sketchbooks yeah

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.870 
the ink sketchbooks yeah
really<00:03:33.360> quickly<00:03:33.660> -<00:03:33.989> yeah<00:03:34.890> yeah<00:03:35.430> this<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:35.820> like

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
really quickly - yeah yeah this is like

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.229 
really quickly - yeah yeah this is like
those<00:03:36.150> sketches<00:03:36.390> were<00:03:36.510> gonna<00:03:36.630> have<00:03:36.720> now<00:03:38.239> yeah

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
those sketches were gonna have now yeah

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.660 
those sketches were gonna have now yeah
I<00:03:39.420> carry<00:03:39.690> them<00:03:39.840> around<00:03:39.930> all<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.440> time<00:03:40.519> you<00:03:41.519> can

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
I carry them around all the time you can

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.360 
I carry them around all the time you can
see<00:03:41.880> how<00:03:41.910> like<00:03:42.470> you<00:03:43.470> know<00:03:43.560> coming<00:03:43.920> down<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.280> the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
see how like you know coming down to the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.009 
see how like you know coming down to the
details<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.940> internal<00:03:45.390> components<00:03:45.870> of<00:03:45.959> the

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
details the internal components of the

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.000 
details the internal components of the
bag<00:03:46.200> how<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.590> kind<00:03:46.769> of<00:03:46.800> like<00:03:46.980> gets<00:03:47.700> made<00:03:49.010> like

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
bag how it kind of like gets made like

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.080 
bag how it kind of like gets made like
just<00:03:50.880> different<00:03:51.060> details<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:52.050> stuff

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
just different details and stuff

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.170 
just different details and stuff
I<00:03:54.150> think<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:54.989> lot<00:03:55.140> of<00:03:55.170> it<00:03:55.349> comes<00:03:55.500> from<00:03:56.180> materials

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
I think a lot of it comes from materials

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.199 
I think a lot of it comes from materials
and<00:03:57.709> processes<00:03:58.709> yeah<00:03:59.550> I<00:03:59.580> spent<00:03:59.819> a<00:03:59.849> lot<00:04:00.000> of<00:04:00.030> time

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209
