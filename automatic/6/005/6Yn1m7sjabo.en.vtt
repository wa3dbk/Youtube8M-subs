going to choose to go here and take down

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.180 
going to choose to go here and take down
the<00:02:15.420> inferno<00:02:15.720> which<00:02:16.350> means<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.680> misses<00:02:16.920> an<00:02:17.040> air

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
the inferno which means it misses an air

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.460 
the inferno which means it misses an air
of<00:02:17.220> hats<00:02:17.460> but<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.790> start<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.210> get<00:02:18.450> an<00:02:18.810> inferno

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
of hats but the start you get an inferno

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.520 
of hats but the start you get an inferno
and<00:02:19.620> an<00:02:19.740> air<00:02:19.860> defense<00:02:20.160> with<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.430> structure

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
and an air defense with this structure

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.680 
and an air defense with this structure
so<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:23.430> States<00:02:23.670> took<00:02:23.940> taken<00:02:24.240> down<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.450> Queen

so it's June just under 200 damage for
at<00:03:39.950> second<00:03:40.950> with<00:03:41.760> six<00:03:42.510> hits<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.990> did<00:03:43.340> 1200

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
at second with six hits it did 1200

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.760 
at second with six hits it did 1200
points<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.880> damage<00:03:45.060> before<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:46.140> just<00:03:46.440> got<00:03:46.560> one

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
points of damage before it just got one

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.820 
points of damage before it just got one
stood<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:48.450> you<00:03:48.570> can<00:03:48.780> see<00:03:48.930> it<00:03:49.140> least<00:03:49.620> it's

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
stood so you can see it least it's

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.970 
stood so you can see it least it's
better<00:03:49.950> than<00:03:50.900> leaving<00:03:51.900> them<00:03:52.050> just<00:03:52.770> hitting

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
better than leaving them just hitting

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.130 
better than leaving them just hitting
the<00:03:53.010> hound<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:53.730> it's<00:03:53.940> done<00:03:54.120> 1200<00:03:54.870> points<00:03:54.990> of

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
the hound so it's done 1200 points of

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.540 
the hound so it's done 1200 points of
damage<00:03:55.260> which<00:03:55.560> otherwise<00:03:55.890> would<00:03:56.010> have<00:03:56.250> done

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
damage which otherwise would have done

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.790 
damage which otherwise would have done
but<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.620> challenge<00:03:58.620> here<00:03:59.160> is<00:04:00.440> because<00:04:01.440> it's

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
but the challenge here is because it's

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.520 
but the challenge here is because it's
shallow<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.670> balloons<00:04:02.970> are<00:04:03.120> relatively

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
shallow the balloons are relatively

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.840 
shallow the balloons are relatively
unpunished<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.830> it<00:04:05.160> was<00:04:05.250> only<00:04:05.340> heating<00:04:05.670> for

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
unpunished and it was only heating for

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.700 
unpunished and it was only heating for
balloons<00:04:06.210> and<00:04:06.540> therefore<00:04:06.840> i<00:04:06.870> only<00:04:07.050> got<00:04:07.140> 1,200

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
balloons and therefore i only got 1,200

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.900 
balloons and therefore i only got 1,200
points<00:04:07.860> of<00:04:08.040> them<00:04:08.160> in<00:04:08.280> general<00:04:08.520> you're<00:04:08.610> whisked

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
points of them in general you're whisked

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.480 
points of them in general you're whisked
out<00:04:09.000> now<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.110> that's<00:04:10.320> kind<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.710> the<00:04:10.770> point<00:04:11.280> I'm

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
out now and that's kind of the point I'm

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.460 
out now and that's kind of the point I'm
making<00:04:11.520> is<00:04:11.880> if<00:04:12.270> you<00:04:12.660> can<00:04:13.020> get<00:04:13.170> a<00:04:13.200> balloon

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
making is if you can get a balloon

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.900 
making is if you can get a balloon
hitting<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.920> bunch<00:04:14.100> of<00:04:14.220> say<00:04:14.340> twenty<00:04:14.490> balloons

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
hitting a bunch of say twenty balloons

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.840 
hitting a bunch of say twenty balloons
it's<00:04:15.570> doing<00:04:16.080> you<00:04:16.500> know<00:04:16.620> 960<00:04:17.430> points<00:04:17.670> of<00:04:17.760> damage

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
it's doing you know 960 points of damage

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.539 
it's doing you know 960 points of damage
a<00:04:18.090> second<00:04:18.470> 30<00:04:19.470> balloons<00:04:19.739> it's<00:04:20.040> during<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.400> up

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
a second 30 balloons it's during the up

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.200 
a second 30 balloons it's during the up
over<00:04:20.850> 1400

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
over 1400

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.559 
over 1400
damage<00:04:23.020> per<00:04:23.139> second<00:04:23.470> but<00:04:23.620> you<00:04:24.220> you<00:04:24.610> know<00:04:24.639> 200

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:25.569 
damage per second but you you know 200

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:28.080 
damage per second but you you know 200
damage<00:04:26.500> per<00:04:26.800> second<00:04:27.130> is<00:04:27.310> not<00:04:27.340> enough<00:04:27.759> out<00:04:28.030> of

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
damage per second is not enough out of

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.450 
damage per second is not enough out of
your<00:04:28.509> wish<00:04:29.080> towers<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.800> make<00:04:29.949> your<00:04:30.160> defense

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
your wish towers to make your defense

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.450 
your wish towers to make your defense
work<00:04:31.110> that<00:04:32.110> said<00:04:32.410> it's<00:04:32.650> better<00:04:32.919> than<00:04:33.130> it

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
work that said it's better than it

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.510 
work that said it's better than it
hitting<00:04:33.699> a<00:04:33.819> hound<00:04:34.680> so<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:35.740> can<00:04:36.009> see<00:04:36.190> it's<00:04:36.370> come

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
hitting a hound so you can see it's come

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.309 
hitting a hound so you can see it's come
across<00:04:36.759> here<00:04:37.000> your<00:04:37.180> standard<00:04:37.569> it<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:38.080> freeze

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
across here your standard it to freeze

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.930 
across here your standard it to freeze
but<00:04:38.979> what<00:04:39.069> I<00:04:39.130> want<00:04:39.250> to<00:04:39.340> point<00:04:39.490> out<00:04:39.639> here<00:04:39.729> is

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
but what I want to point out here is

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.430 
but what I want to point out here is
this<00:04:40.330> is<00:04:40.449> why<00:04:40.630> we're<00:04:40.810> going<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:40.990> move<00:04:41.110> to<00:04:41.139> deep

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
this is why we're going to move to deep

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.719 
this is why we're going to move to deep
this<00:04:41.710> town<00:04:41.949> so<00:04:42.370> and<00:04:43.030> this<00:04:43.389> Inferno<00:04:43.900> dies<00:04:44.080> here

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
this town so and this Inferno dies here

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.520 
this town so and this Inferno dies here
okay<00:04:45.729> it's<00:04:45.910> a<00:04:46.030> great<00:04:46.240> example<00:04:46.479> okay<00:04:46.930> now<00:04:47.110> have

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
okay it's a great example okay now have

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.620 
okay it's a great example okay now have
a<00:04:47.560> look<00:04:47.620> at<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.979> with<00:04:48.639> the<00:04:48.789> structure<00:04:49.120> see<00:04:49.479> the

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
a look at the with the structure see the

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.960 
a look at the with the structure see the
hound<00:04:49.840> comes<00:04:50.289> across<00:04:50.560> and<00:04:51.550> you<00:04:51.610> can<00:04:51.729> see<00:04:51.880> The

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
hound comes across and you can see The

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.540 
hound comes across and you can see The
Wiz<00:04:52.000> tail<00:04:52.389> starts<00:04:52.750> hitting<00:04:53.050> mound<00:04:53.550> rather

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
Wiz tail starts hitting mound rather

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.170 
Wiz tail starts hitting mound rather
than<00:04:54.669> the<00:04:54.789> balloons<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:55.620> so<00:04:56.620> it's<00:04:57.130> got<00:04:57.340> hit

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
than the balloons and so it's got hit

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.560 
than the balloons and so it's got hit
pounds<00:04:58.660> now<00:04:59.349> it's<00:04:59.560> at<00:04:59.710> a<00:04:59.740> range<00:05:00.120> so<00:05:01.120> like<00:05:01.389> it

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
pounds now it's at a range so like it

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.810 
pounds now it's at a range so like it
one<00:05:01.930> shot<00:05:01.960> away<00:05:02.349> it<00:05:02.740> gets<00:05:02.860> one<00:05:03.130> shot<00:05:03.160> away<00:05:03.460> on

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
one shot away it gets one shot away on

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.240 
one shot away it gets one shot away on
those<00:05:03.940> two<00:05:04.180> balloons<00:05:04.479> before<00:05:04.780> it<00:05:04.990> goes<00:05:05.139> down

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
those two balloons before it goes down

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.900 
those two balloons before it goes down
so<00:05:06.250> with<00:05:07.210> the<00:05:07.740> looking<00:05:08.740> at<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.919> pathing<00:05:09.430> you

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
so with the looking at the pathing you

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.640 
so with the looking at the pathing you
know<00:05:10.030> if<00:05:10.360> you<00:05:10.509> were<00:05:10.660> a<00:05:10.690> situation<00:05:11.259> where<00:05:11.470> the

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
know if you were a situation where the

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.350 
know if you were a situation where the
hounds<00:05:12.130> are<00:05:12.820> going<00:05:13.090> to<00:05:13.830> come<00:05:14.830> across<00:05:15.159> and<00:05:15.550> draw

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
hounds are going to come across and draw

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.990 
hounds are going to come across and draw
the<00:05:16.419> West<00:05:16.720> how<00:05:16.900> far<00:05:17.169> even<00:05:17.409> for<00:05:17.590> a<00:05:17.830> period<00:05:18.130> you

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
the West how far even for a period you

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.360 
the West how far even for a period you
can<00:05:19.150> see<00:05:19.389> you're<00:05:19.570> not<00:05:19.690> getting<00:05:19.930> a<00:05:19.990> lot<00:05:20.139> of

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
can see you're not getting a lot of

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.620 
can see you're not getting a lot of
value<00:05:21.370> out<00:05:21.400> of<00:05:21.550> your<00:05:21.909> balloons<00:05:22.240> and<00:05:22.509> that's

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
value out of your balloons and that's

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.290 
value out of your balloons and that's
the<00:05:22.750> problem<00:05:23.729> that's<00:05:24.729> probably<00:05:25.090> going<00:05:25.240> to

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
the problem that's probably going to

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.999 
the problem that's probably going to
have<00:05:25.389> to<00:05:25.449> look<00:05:25.690> at<00:05:25.840> into<00:05:26.169> the<00:05:26.320> base<00:05:26.470> design<00:05:26.860> in

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
have to look at into the base design in

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.700 
have to look at into the base design in
terms<00:05:27.159> of<00:05:27.340> defense<00:05:27.669> but<00:05:28.509> I<00:05:29.080> want<00:05:29.320> to<00:05:29.380> continue

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
terms of defense but I want to continue

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.110 
terms of defense but I want to continue
with<00:05:29.800> its<00:05:29.949> range<00:05:30.159> because<00:05:30.460> I<00:05:30.639> want<00:05:30.789> to<00:05:30.849> show

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
with its range because I want to show

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.120 
with its range because I want to show
the<00:05:31.210> potential<00:05:31.479> risk<00:05:31.810> tails<00:05:32.020> now<00:05:32.259> have<00:05:33.009> a<00:05:33.039> look

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
the potential risk tails now have a look

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.430 
the potential risk tails now have a look
at<00:05:33.400> this<00:05:33.639> point<00:05:33.940> here<00:05:34.120> now<00:05:34.330> this<00:05:35.110> is<00:05:35.229> where<00:05:35.409> I

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
at this point here now this is where I

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.080 
at this point here now this is where I
wished<00:05:35.770> I'd<00:05:36.009> be<00:05:36.159> really<00:05:36.340> useful<00:05:36.520> they<00:05:36.940> had

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
wished I'd be really useful they had

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.510 
wished I'd be really useful they had
it's<00:05:37.419> got<00:05:37.570> its<00:05:37.840> got<00:05:37.990> a<00:05:38.050> whisked<00:05:38.349> out<00:05:38.440> here<00:05:38.770> got

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
it's got its got a whisked out here got

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.920 
it's got its got a whisked out here got
some<00:05:39.669> distraction<00:05:40.150> balloons<00:05:40.449> because<00:05:40.630> it's

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
some distraction balloons because it's

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.010 
some distraction balloons because it's
shallow<00:05:41.169> if<00:05:41.740> the<00:05:42.070> wiz<00:05:42.250> tower<00:05:42.520> was<00:05:42.880> deep<00:05:43.150> or

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
shallow if the wiz tower was deep or

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.230

here it's like listen they look at here
is<00:05:46.360> example<00:05:46.659> you<00:05:47.380> got<00:05:47.469> a<00:05:47.530> bunch<00:05:47.680> of<00:05:47.949> of<00:05:48.310> the

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:48.969 
is example you got a bunch of of the

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:52.020 
is example you got a bunch of of the
blu-ray<00:05:49.449> dealers<00:05:49.750> you<00:05:49.960> know<00:05:50.080> 14<00:05:50.500> balloons<00:05:51.030> i

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
blu-ray dealers you know 14 balloons i

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.390 
blu-ray dealers you know 14 balloons i
whisked<00:05:52.810> out<00:05:52.900> here<00:05:53.229> that<00:05:53.710> I'm<00:05:53.800> if<00:05:54.099> it<00:05:54.219> was

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
whisked out here that I'm if it was

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.100 
whisked out here that I'm if it was
shooting<00:05:55.320> would<00:05:56.320> be<00:05:56.680> I'm<00:05:57.000> doing<00:05:58.000> in<00:05:58.240> the<00:05:58.840> order

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
shooting would be I'm doing in the order

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.189 
shooting would be I'm doing in the order
of<00:05:59.229> 500<00:05:59.530> damage<00:05:59.919> per<00:06:00.159> second<00:06:00.520> on<00:06:00.639> that<00:06:00.789> punch

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
of 500 damage per second on that punch

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:05.969 
of 500 damage per second on that punch
and<00:06:02.199> probably<00:06:03.009> save<00:06:03.430> the<00:06:03.669> whole<00:06:03.820> base<00:06:04.229> now<00:06:05.229> by

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
and probably save the whole base now by

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:07.860 
and probably save the whole base now by
the<00:06:06.039> time<00:06:06.460> it<00:06:06.729> all<00:06:06.880> groups<00:06:07.150> you<00:06:07.509> know<00:06:07.539> it's

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
the time it all groups you know it's

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.629 
the time it all groups you know it's
your<00:06:08.500> situation<00:06:09.039> where<00:06:09.159> we<00:06:09.340> stay<00:06:09.550> out<00:06:09.610> here

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
your situation where we stay out here

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.159 
your situation where we stay out here
you<00:06:09.909> might<00:06:10.090> have<00:06:10.180> been<00:06:10.270> doing<00:06:10.509> even<00:06:10.719> more<00:06:10.750> and

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
you might have been doing even more and

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.980 
you might have been doing even more and
so<00:06:11.800> we<00:06:11.919> need<00:06:12.039> to<00:06:12.159> have<00:06:12.370> a<00:06:12.400> situation<00:06:12.610> where<00:06:13.150> you

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
so we need to have a situation where you

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.540 
so we need to have a situation where you
need<00:06:14.169> to<00:06:14.380> the<00:06:14.590> trick<00:06:14.800> is<00:06:14.830> to<00:06:15.009> bunch<00:06:15.340> of

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
need to the trick is to bunch of

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.810 
need to the trick is to bunch of
balloons<00:06:15.820> I'm<00:06:16.240> through<00:06:17.110> the<00:06:17.590> path<00:06:18.280> thing<00:06:18.610> and

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
balloons I'm through the path thing and

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.240 
balloons I'm through the path thing and
then<00:06:19.509> get<00:06:19.719> Westhouse<00:06:20.199> to<00:06:20.440> fire<00:06:20.680> on<00:06:20.860> bunch<00:06:21.099> of

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
then get Westhouse to fire on bunch of

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.420 
then get Westhouse to fire on bunch of
balloons<00:06:22.020> not<00:06:23.020> a<00:06:23.050> hound<00:06:23.349> and<00:06:23.680> so<00:06:23.949> that's<00:06:24.099> the

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
balloons not a hound and so that's the

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.189 
balloons not a hound and so that's the
challenging<00:06:25.030> base<00:06:25.240> design<00:06:25.599> right<00:06:25.750> now<00:06:25.960> and

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:26.199 
challenging base design right now and

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.939 
challenging base design right now and
you<00:06:26.770> can<00:06:26.889> see<00:06:27.130> that<00:06:27.479> this<00:06:28.530> unfortunately<00:06:29.530> it

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:29.949 
you can see that this unfortunately it

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:32.189 
you can see that this unfortunately it
appears<00:06:29.979> this<00:06:30.370> design<00:06:30.789> where<00:06:31.150> I'm<00:06:31.900> you

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 
appears this design where I'm you

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.680 
appears this design where I'm you
separated<00:06:32.770> you're<00:06:33.250> running<00:06:33.370> a<00:06:33.490> circle<00:06:33.909> of<00:06:34.029> air

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
separated you're running a circle of air

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:35.519 
separated you're running a circle of air

if it's risked our life doesn't seem to

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:40.409 
if it's risked our life doesn't seem to
work<00:06:38.079> just<00:06:38.919> as<00:06:39.429> the<00:06:39.579> Wiz<00:06:39.759> towers<00:06:40.059> are<00:06:40.269> too

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:40.419 
work just as the Wiz towers are too

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:42.179 
work just as the Wiz towers are too
shallow<00:06:40.689> they<00:06:41.469> can<00:06:41.619> be<00:06:41.709> picked<00:06:41.889> off<00:06:41.979> with

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:42.189 
shallow they can be picked off with

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:44.969 
shallow they can be picked off with
distraction<00:06:42.669> balloons<00:06:43.349> and<00:06:44.349> then<00:06:44.559> they<00:06:44.949> just

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979 
distraction balloons and then they just

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:47.159 
distraction balloons and then they just
don't<00:06:45.189> hit<00:06:45.489> the<00:06:45.839> balloons<00:06:46.839> when<00:06:47.019> they're

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:47.169 
don't hit the balloons when they're

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:49.439 
don't hit the balloons when they're
bunched<00:06:47.439> enough<00:06:47.879> whereas<00:06:48.879> in<00:06:48.999> the<00:06:49.089> center<00:06:49.419> you

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:49.449 
bunched enough whereas in the center you

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:50.639

look more of a chaps and actually
