00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
high up in the air the kick returner

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.370 
high up in the air the kick returner
goes<00:01:05.670> ahead<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.030> does<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.600> fair<00:01:06.810> catch<00:01:07.049> if

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
goes ahead and does the fair catch if

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.560 
goes ahead and does the fair catch if
it's<00:01:07.860> sunday<00:01:08.189> night<00:01:08.369> or<00:01:08.400> monday<00:01:08.549> night<00:01:09.000> he

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
it's sunday night or monday night he

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.120 
it's sunday night or monday night he
fields<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.200> traffic<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.680> tries<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.920> make

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
fields it in traffic and tries to make

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.740 
fields it in traffic and tries to make
the<00:01:11.250> big<00:01:11.400> play<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.030> actually<00:01:12.180> think<00:01:12.510> that's

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the big play and I actually think that's

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.170 
the big play and I actually think that's
optimal<00:01:13.350> from<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.979> personal<00:01:14.430> perspective<00:01:14.580> also

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
optimal from a personal perspective also

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.480 
optimal from a personal perspective also
yes<00:01:15.990> I'm<00:01:16.200> risking<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.590> little<00:01:16.799> injury<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.159> could

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
yes I'm risking a little injury I could

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.310 
yes I'm risking a little injury I could
fumble<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.119> also<00:01:18.509> could<00:01:18.810> make<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.110> big<00:01:19.290> play

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
fumble I also could make the big play

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.980 
fumble I also could make the big play
but<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> bottom<00:01:20.610> line<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.450> with<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
but the bottom line is it with the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.719 
but the bottom line is it with the
bright<00:01:22.229> lights<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.710> if<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.130> run<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.490> kick

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
bright lights on if I can run that kick

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.359 
bright lights on if I can run that kick
back<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.420> really<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:25.170> good<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.920> me<00:01:26.100> my

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
back it's really really good for me my

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.810 
back it's really really good for me my
brand<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.840> makes<00:01:28.680> sense<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.040> go<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.700> so

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
brand and it makes sense to go for it so

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.219 
brand and it makes sense to go for it so
you<00:01:29.880> see<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.180> consistently<00:01:30.840> with<00:01:31.020> all<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
you see that consistently with all the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.530 
you see that consistently with all the
kick<00:01:31.380> returners<00:01:31.860> similarly<00:01:32.700> with<00:01:32.820> players<00:01:33.150> do

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
kick returners similarly with players do

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.060 
kick returners similarly with players do
they<00:01:33.659> want<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> be<00:01:34.020> seen<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.380> primetime<00:01:34.650> going

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
they want to be seen on primetime going

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.560 
they want to be seen on primetime going
out<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.220> bounds<00:01:35.430> or<00:01:35.759> am<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.060> going<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.240> cut<00:01:36.450> up

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
out of bounds or am I going to cut up

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.030 
out of bounds or am I going to cut up
the<00:01:36.689> field<00:01:36.930> try<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.439> pick<00:01:37.619> up<00:01:37.740> some<00:01:37.950> extra

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
the field try to pick up some extra

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.730 
the field try to pick up some extra
yardage<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.170> consistently<00:01:40.170> all<00:01:40.439> these

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
yardage and consistently all these

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.620 
yardage and consistently all these
little<00:01:41.130> things<00:01:41.280> seem<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.820> be<00:01:41.939> adding<00:01:42.329> up<00:01:42.450> to

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
little things seem to be adding up to

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.069 
little things seem to be adding up to
more<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.470> more<00:01:43.560> points<00:01:44.310> being<00:01:44.820> scored<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.750> I

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
more and more points being scored and I

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.020 
more and more points being scored and I
think<00:01:46.259> that's<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.470> big<00:01:46.680> reason<00:01:46.860> why<00:01:47.070> we're

gave money would pour in on the overs

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.920 
gave money would pour in on the overs
because<00:05:20.279> of<00:05:20.400> this<00:05:20.520> recent<00:05:21.240> trend<00:05:21.509> that<00:05:21.629> really

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
because of this recent trend that really

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.450 
because of this recent trend that really
isn't<00:05:22.020> that<00:05:22.229> recent<00:05:22.650> it's<00:05:22.770> been<00:05:22.830> working<00:05:23.129> for

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
isn't that recent it's been working for

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.610 
isn't that recent it's been working for
years<00:05:23.729> and<00:05:24.000> it<00:05:24.449> just<00:05:24.629> hasn't<00:05:24.870> happened<00:05:25.080> and<00:05:25.560> I

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
years and it just hasn't happened and I

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.959 
years and it just hasn't happened and I
just<00:05:25.830> think<00:05:25.979> what's<00:05:26.159> happening<00:05:26.580> there<00:05:26.789> is

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
just think what's happening there is

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:29.959 
just think what's happening there is
that<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:27.779> the<00:05:28.319> math<00:05:28.589> guys<00:05:28.919> who<00:05:29.669> have<00:05:29.789> made

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:29.969 
that the the math guys who have made

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.149

52 in far away places it's painted 51 so

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.010 
52 in far away places it's painted 51 so
what's<00:05:50.460> happening<00:05:51.000> is<00:05:51.120> that<00:05:51.210> when<00:05:51.839> people

one<00:06:21.060> other<00:06:21.180> item<00:06:21.360> I<00:06:21.750> would<00:06:22.349> say<00:06:22.500> as<00:06:22.620> far<00:06:22.649> as<00:06:22.889> a

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:22.949 
one other item I would say as far as a

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:24.290 
one other item I would say as far as a
subset<00:06:23.339> if<00:06:23.430> you<00:06:23.520> are<00:06:23.669> an<00:06:23.819> under<00:06:24.060> player

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
subset if you are an under player

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.179 
subset if you are an under player
probably<00:06:24.899> do<00:06:25.110> just<00:06:25.349> fine<00:06:25.589> still<00:06:25.979> playing

00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:26.189 
probably do just fine still playing

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:28.670 
probably do just fine still playing

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
penalties because the totals are being

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.329
