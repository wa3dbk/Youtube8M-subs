look at this buckle here you can
actually<00:01:42.360> flip<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.049> buckle<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.590> other<00:01:43.770> way

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
actually flip this buckle the other way

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.310 
actually flip this buckle the other way
and<00:01:44.369> there<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> cable<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.420> here<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.170> that

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and there is a cable on here and that

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.590 
and there is a cable on here and that
cable<00:01:46.560> can<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:46.920> used<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.939> buckle<00:01:48.299> cable

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
cable can be used that buckle cable

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.660 
cable can be used that buckle cable
system<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:49.049> be<00:01:49.110> used<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.409> two<00:01:49.560> things<00:01:49.770> one<00:01:50.189> is

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
system can be used for two things one is

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.520 
system can be used for two things one is
it<00:01:50.939> actually<00:01:51.210> allows<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.810> back<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> cuff

it actually allows the back of the cuff

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.490 
it actually allows the back of the cuff
to<00:01:52.770> drop<00:01:53.159> giving<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.909> ski/walk<00:01:54.270> feature<00:01:54.500> for

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
to drop giving it a ski/walk feature for

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
the cuff dropped back so it doesn't put

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.710 
the cuff dropped back so it doesn't put
quite<00:02:09.039> so<00:02:09.220> much<00:02:09.340> pressure<00:02:09.640> on<00:02:09.850> your<00:02:09.970> knee<00:02:10.149> but

quite so much pressure on your knee but
the<00:02:10.840> primary<00:02:11.140> reason<00:02:11.380> this<00:02:11.770> was<00:02:11.980> developed<00:02:12.160> is

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
the primary reason this was developed is

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.010 
the primary reason this was developed is
so<00:02:12.790> for<00:02:13.090> those<00:02:13.180> people<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.540> want<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.870> do

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
so for those people that want to do

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.750 
so for those people that want to do
backcountry<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.770> are<00:02:14.860> climbing<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.460> stuff

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
backcountry and are climbing and stuff

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.220 
backcountry and are climbing and stuff
they<00:02:16.090> don't<00:02:16.180> have<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.480> have<00:02:16.600> so<00:02:16.810> much<00:02:16.930> forward

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
they don't have to have so much forward

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.600 
they don't have to have so much forward
lean<00:02:17.500> built<00:02:17.830> into<00:02:18.040> their<00:02:18.160> boots<00:02:18.340> so<00:02:18.490> by

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
lean built into their boots so by

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.430 
lean built into their boots so by
dropping<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.090> cuff<00:02:19.270> back<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:20.020> allows<00:02:20.260> you

dropping the cuff back that allows you

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.140 
dropping the cuff back that allows you
to<00:02:20.530> climb<00:02:20.740> up<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.070> slope<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.459> makes<00:02:21.880> it<00:02:22.000> much

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
to climb up the slope it makes it much

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.060 
to climb up the slope it makes it much
much<00:02:22.390> easier<00:02:22.450> yep

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
much easier yep

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.850 
much easier yep
in<00:02:24.520> addition<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.209> it<00:02:25.780> also<00:02:25.840> has<00:02:26.410> four

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
in addition to that it also has four

in addition to that it also has four
micro<00:02:27.220> adjustable<00:02:27.580> buckles<00:02:28.000> which<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.240> would

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
micro adjustable buckles which you would

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.910 
micro adjustable buckles which you would
expect<00:02:28.360> metal<00:02:29.050> buckles<00:02:29.380> on<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.500> boot<00:02:29.709> like<00:02:29.890> this

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
expect metal buckles on a boot like this

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.460 
expect metal buckles on a boot like this
there's<00:02:30.730> also<00:02:30.910> some<00:02:31.270> additional<00:02:31.470> adjustments

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
there's also some additional adjustments

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.860
