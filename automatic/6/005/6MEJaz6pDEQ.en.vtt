00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.319 
as well navigated to what I thought
might<00:02:03.609> be<00:02:03.759> an<00:02:03.849> interesting<00:02:04.000> picture<00:02:06.329> to

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
might be an interesting picture to

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.380 
might be an interesting picture to
represent<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.929> image<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.619> again<00:02:08.950> just<00:02:09.390> you

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
represent the image and again just you

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.300 
represent the image and again just you
know<00:02:10.479> I'll<00:02:10.840> pop<00:02:11.140> ups<00:02:11.379> get<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.769> the<00:02:11.860> front<00:02:12.040> and

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
know I'll pop ups get to the front and

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.460 
know I'll pop ups get to the front and
drag<00:02:12.579> it<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:13.769> my<00:02:14.769> media<00:02:15.099> file<00:02:15.989> okay<00:02:16.989> so<00:02:17.049> I<00:02:17.230> have

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
drag it to my media file okay so I have

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.750 
drag it to my media file okay so I have
my<00:02:17.680> images<00:02:18.160> that<00:02:18.340> are<00:02:18.430> going<00:02:18.519> to<00:02:18.579> represent

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
my images that are going to represent

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.119 
my images that are going to represent
the<00:02:19.209> videos<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:19.750> now<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:19.840> just<00:02:19.930> have<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.290> drag

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
the videos and now I just have to drag

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.680 
the videos and now I just have to drag
them<00:02:21.310> into<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.610> timeline<00:02:21.849> where<00:02:22.329> I<00:02:22.360> want<00:02:22.599> them

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
them into the timeline where I want them

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.009 
them into the timeline where I want them
to<00:02:22.750> show<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.700> as<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.819> can<00:02:24.940> see<00:02:24.970> i'm<00:02:25.390> sort<00:02:25.959> of

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
to show and as you can see i'm sort of

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.270 
to show and as you can see i'm sort of
putting<00:02:26.290> them<00:02:26.410> right<00:02:26.440> in<00:02:26.829> between<00:02:26.980> those

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
putting them right in between those

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.150 
putting them right in between those
transitions<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.590> like<00:02:29.590> i<00:02:29.680> said<00:02:29.769> that's<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
transitions and like i said that's the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.069 
transitions and like i said that's the
area<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.489> I<00:02:30.640> had<00:02:30.849> planned<00:02:31.180> I<00:02:31.450> want<00:02:31.840> them<00:02:31.989> both

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
area that I had planned I want them both

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.509 
area that I had planned I want them both
to<00:02:32.140> show<00:02:32.410> up<00:02:32.530> at<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.739> same<00:02:32.890> time<00:02:33.129> so<00:02:33.400> I'm

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
to show up at the same time so I'm

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.580 
to show up at the same time so I'm
aligning<00:02:34.030> them<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.390> now<00:02:35.140> I'm<00:02:35.230> just<00:02:35.379> going<00:02:35.470> to

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
aligning them and now I'm just going to

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.020 
aligning them and now I'm just going to
you<00:02:35.859> know<00:02:35.950> play<00:02:36.129> around<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:37.150> little<00:02:37.329> bit<00:02:37.720> and

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
you know play around a little bit and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.819 
you know play around a little bit and
make<00:02:40.030> them<00:02:40.180> look<00:02:40.299> even<00:02:40.590> inconsistent<00:02:41.590> and

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
make them look even inconsistent and

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:49.050 
make them look even inconsistent and
line<00:02:42.190> them<00:02:42.340> up

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.620 

yeah<00:02:49.930> couple<00:02:50.440> shadows<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.220> them<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.730> I'm

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
yeah couple shadows to them and I'm

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.290 
yeah couple shadows to them and I'm
going<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:52.840> add<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.020> starting<00:02:53.440> transition<00:02:54.300> so

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
going to add a starting transition so

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.940 
going to add a starting transition so
they<00:02:55.420> come<00:02:55.630> in<00:02:55.750> smoothly<00:02:56.400> that's<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.520> fade<00:02:57.760> in

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
they come in smoothly that's a fade in

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.580 
they come in smoothly that's a fade in
I'm<00:02:59.950> also<00:03:00.099> making<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.640> transitions<00:03:01.510> this<00:03:01.870> to

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
I'm also making the transitions this to

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:09.120 
I'm also making the transitions this to
match<00:03:02.770> same<00:03:03.340> speed<00:03:03.670> as<00:03:03.910> well<00:03:07.590> okay<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:08.920> there

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
match same speed as well okay so there

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.490 
match same speed as well okay so there
are<00:03:09.250> my<00:03:09.340> video<00:03:09.580> links<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:10.349> I'm<00:03:11.349> just

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019

what<00:04:01.209> I'm<00:04:01.329> just<00:04:01.510> sort<00:04:01.690> of<00:04:01.750> aligning<00:04:02.170> them<00:04:02.530> to

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
what I'm just sort of aligning them to

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.890 
what I'm just sort of aligning them to
make<00:04:03.160> them<00:04:03.370> more<00:04:03.730> centered<00:04:04.450> more

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
make them more centered more

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.990 
make them more centered more
professional<00:04:05.500> let's<00:04:06.430> run<00:04:06.670> through<00:04:06.819> that

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.539 

pretty<00:04:10.000> cool<00:04:10.239> I<00:04:10.480> think<00:04:11.380> I<00:04:11.440> might<00:04:11.590> put<00:04:11.859> click<00:04:12.370> to

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
pretty cool I think I might put click to

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.750 
pretty cool I think I might put click to
video<00:04:12.819> somewhere<00:04:13.329> click<00:04:13.720> video<00:04:13.930> to<00:04:14.140> play

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.700 
video now here's one of the best
features<00:05:51.820> about<00:05:52.000> this<00:05:52.660> a<00:05:52.960> little<00:05:53.230> trick<00:05:53.530> is

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
features about this a little trick is

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.670 
features about this a little trick is
that<00:05:53.919> when<00:05:54.370> people<00:05:54.580> embed<00:05:55.300> your<00:05:55.540> video<00:05:55.900> those

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
that when people embed your video those

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.740 
that when people embed your video those
are<00:05:56.950> live<00:05:57.250> links<00:05:57.700> back<00:05:57.880> to<00:05:57.940> your<00:05:58.150> YouTube<00:05:58.600> blog

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.260 
are live links back to your YouTube blog
so<00:05:59.230> so<00:05:59.830> the<00:05:59.950> idea<00:06:00.070> behind<00:06:00.370> that<00:06:00.580> is<00:06:00.730> that<00:06:00.910> when

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
so so the idea behind that is that when

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.270 
so so the idea behind that is that when
your<00:06:01.419> blog<00:06:01.690> ism<00:06:02.020> when<00:06:02.710> your<00:06:02.860> video<00:06:03.130> is
