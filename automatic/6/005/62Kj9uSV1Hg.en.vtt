00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
some of these licks are played with a

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.599 
some of these licks are played with a
capo<00:03:02.090> actually<00:03:02.930> three<00:03:03.379> of<00:03:03.680> these<00:03:03.859> licks<00:03:04.250> three

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
capo actually three of these licks three

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.099 
capo actually three of these licks three
out<00:03:04.699> of<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.849> four<00:03:05.060> play<00:03:05.480> with<00:03:05.629> the<00:03:05.689> capo<00:03:06.049> so

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
out of the four play with the capo so

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.839 
out of the four play with the capo so

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
ago but to make it a little bit easier

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.199
