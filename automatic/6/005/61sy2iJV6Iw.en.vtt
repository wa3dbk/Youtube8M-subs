00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.529 
in the window in the viewport and drag
right<00:00:28.500> now<00:00:28.939> everything<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.029> selected<00:00:30.449> because

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
right now everything is selected because

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.280 
right now everything is selected because
nothing<00:00:31.050> selected<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:32.550> will<00:00:32.759> simply<00:00:33.390> push

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
nothing selected and it will simply push

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.889 
nothing selected and it will simply push
out<00:00:34.530> all<00:00:35.070> geometry<00:00:35.670> along<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> normals<00:00:36.660> and

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
out all geometry along the normals and

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.799 
out all geometry along the normals and
since<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.710> fear<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.340> will<00:00:38.640> stay<00:00:38.940> as<00:00:39.180> fear<00:00:39.450> so

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
since it is fear it will stay as fear so

if I made a selection do push it will

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.639 
if I made a selection do push it will
only<00:00:42.899> work<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.710> selection<00:00:45.379> like<00:00:46.379> that

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
only work on the selection like that

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.410 
only work on the selection like that

control-z if I wanted to make it more
interesting<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:52.110> could<00:00:52.320> say<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:53.160> linear<00:00:53.550> fall

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
interesting I could say a linear fall

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.660 
interesting I could say a linear fall
off<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.420> want<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.930> right<00:00:55.199> click<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.559> drag<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
off I want to right click and drag the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.500 
off I want to right click and drag the
linear<00:00:56.969> fall<00:00:57.239> off<00:00:58.550> place<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.800> now<00:01:02.390> when<00:01:03.390> i

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
linear fall off place it and now when i

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.719 
linear fall off place it and now when i
select<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.170> push<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.559> click<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.250> viewport<00:01:05.580> to

select a push to click in a viewport to

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.390 
select a push to click in a viewport to
activate<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> tool<00:01:06.510> now<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.040> different

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
activate a tool now you see a different

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.230 
activate a tool now you see a different
effect<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.939> because<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.260> linear<00:01:10.530> follow<00:01:10.799> is

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
effect and because the linear follow is

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.670 
effect and because the linear follow is
active<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.990> can<00:01:13.530> change<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.240> interactively

is<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> push<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.900> now<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.439> flare<00:01:22.890> tool<00:01:23.220> is

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
is a push to now the flare tool is

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.850 
is a push to now the flare tool is
actually<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> preset<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> push<00:01:24.960> tool<00:01:25.200> it's

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
actually a preset of the push tool it's

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.920 
actually a preset of the push tool it's
the<00:01:26.100> push<00:01:26.310> tool<00:01:26.549> with<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> linear<00:01:27.150> fall<00:01:27.450> off<00:01:27.630> so

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the push tool with a linear fall off so

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.200 
the push tool with a linear fall off so
what<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.500> did<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.220> do<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.909> one

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
what I just did you can do that in one

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.710 
what I just did you can do that in one
go<00:01:30.390> if<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.780> select<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.770> flare<00:01:32.220> tool<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
go if you select the flare tool in the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
there is my linear fall off and again it

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.760 
there is my linear fall off and again it
will<00:01:43.710> push<00:01:44.430> out<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:45.360> firts<00:01:45.630> along<00:01:46.590> their

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
will push out the firts along their

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.420 
will push out the firts along their
normals<00:01:47.189> with<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.180> linear<00:01:48.540> fall<00:01:48.780> off<00:01:48.960> again

activate the push tool and now it's only
pushing<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:11.380> geometry<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.940> again<00:02:13.330> let's

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
pushing that geometry so again let's

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.500 
pushing that geometry so again let's
skip<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:14.050> space<00:02:14.560> bar<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.190> travel<00:02:15.520> at<00:02:15.580> all<00:02:15.730> escape

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
skip a space bar to travel at all escape

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
scale tool with a linear fall off so

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.690 
scale tool with a linear fall off so
again<00:02:29.080> these<00:02:29.380> are<00:02:29.620> tools<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.520> can

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
again these are tools that you can

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.110 
again these are tools that you can
create<00:02:30.850> yourself<00:02:31.210> by<00:02:32.020> selecting<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:33.120> scale

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
create yourself by selecting the scale

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.410 
create yourself by selecting the scale
tool<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.600> then<00:02:35.520> adding<00:02:36.520> a<00:02:36.640> linear<00:02:36.910> fall<00:02:37.210> off

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
tool and then adding a linear fall off

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.240 
tool and then adding a linear fall off
so<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:39.730> was<00:02:42.180> tapered<00:02:43.180> yes<00:02:43.990> so<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.590> taper<00:02:44.890> tool

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
so I was tapered yes so the taper tool

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.580 
so I was tapered yes so the taper tool
click<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.330> drag<00:02:46.480> in<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.690> viewport<00:02:46.930> let's

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
click and drag in the viewport let's

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.880 
click and drag in the viewport let's
moline<00:02:47.920> your<00:02:48.130> fall<00:02:48.370> off<00:02:48.610> in<00:02:49.060> my<00:02:49.630> handles<00:02:50.050> so

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
moline your fall off in my handles so

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.960 
moline your fall off in my handles so
you<00:02:51.700> can<00:02:51.910> see<00:02:52.440> it's<00:02:53.440> again<00:02:53.860> only<00:02:54.100> linear<00:02:54.520> fall

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
you can see it's again only linear fall

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.900 
you can see it's again only linear fall
off<00:02:55.180> again<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.720> can<00:02:55.930> change<00:02:56.230> this<00:02:56.680> fall<00:02:57.400> off<00:02:57.640> to

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
off again I can change this fall off to

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.940 
off again I can change this fall off to
maybe<00:03:00.600> selling<00:03:01.600> cylindrical<00:03:02.500> fall<00:03:02.740> off

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.229 
handle make it a bit bigger and now I
can<00:04:18.989> scale<00:04:19.200> it<00:04:19.260> so<00:04:19.680> we<00:04:19.769> get<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:20.040> idea<00:04:20.100> a<00:04:20.640> lot<00:04:21.209> of

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
can scale it so we get the idea a lot of

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.820 
can scale it so we get the idea a lot of
