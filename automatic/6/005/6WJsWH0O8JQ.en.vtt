the Pope he has he has proven to be so

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.950 
the Pope he has he has proven to be so
powerful<00:04:35.050> of<00:04:35.410> a<00:04:35.500> figure<00:04:35.860> that<00:04:36.430> he's<00:04:37.330> overcome

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
powerful of a figure that he's overcome

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.110 
powerful of a figure that he's overcome
to<00:04:38.200> the<00:04:38.380> Lapps<00:04:38.650> instincts<00:04:39.430> of<00:04:39.520> looking<00:04:40.000> to

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
to the Lapps instincts of looking to

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.180 
to the Lapps instincts of looking to
tear<00:04:40.360> people<00:04:40.720> down<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:41.320> Pope<00:04:41.590> for<00:04:41.860> instance
