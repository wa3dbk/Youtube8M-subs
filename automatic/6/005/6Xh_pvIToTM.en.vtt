charger and I wanted upgrade to 24 volts
so<00:00:14.049> it<00:00:14.109> originally<00:00:14.469> went<00:00:14.650> about<00:00:14.799> five<00:00:15.039> miles

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:15.279 
so it originally went about five miles

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.130 
so it originally went about five miles
an<00:00:15.520> hour<00:00:15.609> and<00:00:15.939> now<00:00:16.150> we've<00:00:16.420> got<00:00:16.600> to<00:00:16.720> go<00:00:16.840> on<00:00:16.930> eight

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
an hour and now we've got to go on eight

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.040 
an hour and now we've got to go on eight
point<00:00:17.380> seven<00:00:17.650> miles<00:00:18.010> per<00:00:18.189> hour

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050

verified<00:00:20.050> by<00:00:20.320> GPS<00:00:21.039> first<00:00:22.030> thing<00:00:22.240> we<00:00:22.360> did<00:00:22.539> was

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
verified by GPS first thing we did was

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.980 
verified by GPS first thing we did was
add<00:00:23.289> an<00:00:23.650> additional<00:00:24.130> battery<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.840> battery

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
add an additional battery the battery

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.240 
add an additional battery the battery
that<00:00:26.350> we<00:00:26.470> added<00:00:27.000> from<00:00:28.000> a<00:00:28.060> UPS<00:00:28.570> and<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:30.070> in<00:00:30.220> a

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
that we added from a UPS and it's in a

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.950 
that we added from a UPS and it's in a
12<00:00:30.730> volt<00:00:31.289> seven<00:00:32.289> amp<00:00:32.469> hour<00:00:32.680> or<00:00:33.039> greater<00:00:33.100> so<00:00:33.960> we

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
12 volt seven amp hour or greater so we

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.510 
12 volt seven amp hour or greater so we
also<00:00:35.109> have<00:00:35.320> a<00:00:35.350> 12<00:00:35.649> amp<00:00:35.890> hour<00:00:36.070> that<00:00:36.340> works

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
also have a 12 amp hour that works

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.639 
also have a 12 amp hour that works
beautifully<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:40.420> way<00:00:40.570> it<00:00:40.690> actually<00:00:40.899> works<00:00:41.350> is

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
beautifully the way it actually works is

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.319 
beautifully the way it actually works is
you<00:00:41.770> just<00:00:41.800> cut<00:00:42.160> the<00:00:42.340> these<00:00:42.790> are<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.030> original

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
you just cut the these are the original

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:44.850 
you just cut the these are the original
wires<00:00:43.510> coming<00:00:43.870> on<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.050> power<00:00:44.320> bill<00:00:44.500> is<00:00:44.649> just

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
wires coming on the power bill is just

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.430 
wires coming on the power bill is just
cut<00:00:45.040> a<00:00:45.329> negative<00:00:46.329> gets<00:00:46.660> female<00:00:47.850> connector

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
cut a negative gets female connector

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.630 
cut a negative gets female connector
positive<00:00:50.440> gets<00:00:51.570> male<00:00:52.570> connector<00:00:53.079> and<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:54.489> the

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
positive gets male connector and on the

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.729 
positive gets male connector and on the
batteries<00:00:55.090> you<00:00:55.120> do<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:55.540> reverse<00:00:55.840> positive

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
batteries you do the reverse positive

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.660 
batteries you do the reverse positive
gets<00:00:56.950> female<00:00:58.020> negative<00:00:59.020> gets<00:00:59.200> male<00:00:59.469> and<00:00:59.800> this

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
gets female negative gets male and this

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.400 
gets female negative gets male and this
one's<00:01:00.879> hard<00:01:01.090> to<00:01:01.180> see<00:01:01.390> but<00:01:01.540> it<00:01:01.690> is<00:01:01.809> exactly<00:01:02.140> the

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
one's hard to see but it is exactly the

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.319 
one's hard to see but it is exactly the
same<00:01:02.489> negative<00:01:03.489> as<00:01:03.640> male<00:01:04.259> positive<00:01:05.259> as<00:01:05.409> female

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:06.329 
same negative as male positive as female

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:08.850 
same negative as male positive as female
the<00:01:07.329> trick<00:01:07.600> is<00:01:07.750> to<00:01:07.780> it<00:01:08.140> is<00:01:08.260> you<00:01:08.409> can't<00:01:08.680> make<00:01:08.830> a

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
the trick is to it is you can't make a

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.380 
the trick is to it is you can't make a
mistake<00:01:09.310> because<00:01:09.490> you<00:01:09.670> can't<00:01:09.940> connect<00:01:10.270> them

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
mistake because you can't connect them

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.039 
mistake because you can't connect them
in<00:01:10.540> correctly

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
in correctly

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:11.910 
in correctly
well<00:01:11.229> I<00:01:11.260> guess<00:01:11.409> you<00:01:11.530> connect<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:11.860> two

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
well I guess you connect the two

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.230 
well I guess you connect the two
batteries<00:01:12.340> to<00:01:12.460> each<00:01:12.580> other<00:01:12.760> but<00:01:12.970> that<00:01:13.000> one

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
batteries to each other but that one

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.770 
batteries to each other but that one
hurt<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:15.159> you<00:01:15.220> connect<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.940> positive<00:01:16.150> from

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
hurt so you connect the positive from

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.600 
hurt so you connect the positive from
one<00:01:17.020> battery<00:01:17.380> to<00:01:17.409> the<00:01:17.590> positive<00:01:17.619> of<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.340> power

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
one battery to the positive of the power

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.120 
one battery to the positive of the power
wheel<00:01:18.790> the<00:01:19.390> negative<00:01:19.869> of<00:01:20.080> that<00:01:20.290> same<00:01:20.680> battery

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
wheel the negative of that same battery

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.380 
wheel the negative of that same battery
to<00:01:21.400> the<00:01:21.580> positive<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.640> other<00:01:24.640> battery<00:01:25.180> and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
to the positive of the other battery and

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.120 
to the positive of the other battery and
then<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.960> negative<00:01:26.380> from<00:01:26.500> that<00:01:26.680> battery<00:01:27.010> to

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
then the negative from that battery to

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.679 
then the negative from that battery to
the<00:01:27.220> negative<00:01:27.520> of<00:01:27.549> the<00:01:27.610> power<00:01:27.790> wheels<00:01:28.090> so<00:01:28.600> you

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
the negative of the power wheels so you

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.070 
the negative of the power wheels so you
have<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:30.490> sort<00:01:30.790> of<00:01:30.939> thing<00:01:31.000> going<00:01:31.510> into<00:01:31.780> here

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
have this sort of thing going into here

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.200 
have this sort of thing going into here
into<00:01:32.470> here<00:01:32.979> and<00:01:33.430> then<00:01:33.580> back<00:01:33.759> to<00:01:33.880> your<00:01:33.939> power

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
into here and then back to your power

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.440 
into here and then back to your power
wheels<00:01:34.710> that's<00:01:35.710> really<00:01:36.009> it<00:01:36.250> for<00:01:36.939> a<00:01:37.890> conversion

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
wheels that's really it for a conversion

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.789 
wheels that's really it for a conversion
but<00:01:40.450> there's<00:01:40.720> some<00:01:40.840> other<00:01:40.930> changes<00:01:41.500> when<00:01:41.710> you

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
but there's some other changes when you

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.190 
but there's some other changes when you
go<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:41.950> 24<00:01:42.400> volts<00:01:42.790> your<00:01:43.450> motors<00:01:43.750> tend<00:01:43.930> to<00:01:44.049> heat

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
go to 24 volts your motors tend to heat

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.990 
go to 24 volts your motors tend to heat
up<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:48.040> particular<00:01:48.520> power<00:01:48.759> wheels

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
up and this particular power wheels

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.740 
up and this particular power wheels
allow<00:01:49.360> me<00:01:49.540> easy<00:01:50.200> access<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.040> back<00:01:51.750> so

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
allow me easy access to the back so

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.440 
allow me easy access to the back so
here's<00:01:52.930> your<00:01:53.049> two<00:01:53.200> motors<00:01:53.970> they<00:01:54.970> tend<00:01:55.210> to<00:01:55.270> heat

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
here's your two motors they tend to heat

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.510 
here's your two motors they tend to heat
up<00:01:55.479> quite<00:01:55.720> a<00:01:55.780> bit<00:01:56.049> so<00:01:56.290> I<00:01:56.350> bought<00:01:56.590> two<00:01:56.770> PC<00:01:57.220> fans

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
up quite a bit so I bought two PC fans

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.420 
up quite a bit so I bought two PC fans
from<00:01:57.759> Fry's<00:01:58.000> Electronics<00:01:58.030> $5<00:01:59.020> each<00:01:59.140> and<00:01:59.470> they

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
from Fry's Electronics $5 each and they

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.639 
from Fry's Electronics $5 each and they
run<00:02:00.670> out<00:02:00.790> of<00:02:01.000> this<00:02:01.149> 12<00:02:01.450> volt<00:02:01.509> battery<00:02:02.110> which

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
run out of this 12 volt battery which

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.649 
run out of this 12 volt battery which
can<00:02:03.460> run<00:02:03.610> off<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.880> main<00:02:04.030> power<00:02:04.270> if<00:02:04.420> you<00:02:04.479> want

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
can run off the main power if you want

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:05.700 
can run off the main power if you want
to<00:02:04.930> but<00:02:05.140> I<00:02:05.229> decided

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
to but I decided

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.620 
to but I decided
additional<00:02:05.979> diner<00:02:06.159> since<00:02:06.370> I<00:02:06.490> had<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:06.909> this<00:02:07.450> one

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
additional diner since I had it this one

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
I got some Gruber power and it's right

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:19.050 
I got some Gruber power and it's right
here<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:17.160> batteries<00:02:18.160> that<00:02:18.310> have<00:02:18.370> two<00:02:18.730> fans

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
here the batteries that have two fans

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.390 
here the batteries that have two fans
one<00:02:19.360> fan<00:02:19.780> blowing<00:02:20.020> in<00:02:20.319> one<00:02:20.709> fan<00:02:20.950> blowing<00:02:21.220> out

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
one fan blowing in one fan blowing out

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.250 
one fan blowing in one fan blowing out
because<00:02:21.670> when<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:21.970> seat<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:22.270> closed<00:02:22.569> it<00:02:23.080> has<00:02:23.230> a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
because when the seat is closed it has a

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.860 
because when the seat is closed it has a
nice<00:02:23.500> little<00:02:23.680> circulation<00:02:24.580> going<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.600> it's

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
nice little circulation going and it's

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.630 
nice little circulation going and it's
also<00:02:26.080> good<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:28.239> lights<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:29.640> then

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
also good to the lights and then

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.360 
also good to the lights and then
switched<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.530> doesn't<00:02:32.800> drain<00:02:32.980> these<00:02:33.190> will

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
switched so it doesn't drain these will

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.120 
switched so it doesn't drain these will
run<00:02:33.489> for<00:02:33.730> days<00:02:33.910> on<00:02:34.300> that<00:02:35.080> one<00:02:35.230> battery<00:02:35.709> without

the road and actually uh and driving the

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.780 
the road and actually uh and driving the
other<00:03:06.610> benefit<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.209> that<00:03:07.239> is<00:03:08.459> when<00:03:09.459> I<00:03:09.489> go<00:03:09.730> to

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
other benefit to that is when I go to

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.210 
other benefit to that is when I go to
charge<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:11.130> my<00:03:12.130> charger<00:03:13.049> has<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.500> male<00:03:14.950> on<00:03:15.190> the

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
positive a female on the negative so

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.590 
positive a female on the negative so
that<00:03:17.829> way<00:03:17.980> I<00:03:18.010> can<00:03:18.280> take<00:03:18.430> my<00:03:18.610> 12<00:03:19.360> volt<00:03:19.540> charger

batteries<00:03:35.410> it's<00:03:35.590> a<00:03:35.680> six<00:03:35.920> volt<00:03:36.100> charger

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
batteries it's a six volt charger

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.090 
batteries it's a six volt charger
usually<00:03:36.700> just<00:03:36.910> six<00:03:37.329> batteries<00:03:37.900> i<00:03:38.140> hook<00:03:38.860> up<00:03:38.980> a

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
usually just six batteries i hook up a

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.280 
usually just six batteries i hook up a
timer<00:03:39.400> so<00:03:39.910> that<00:03:40.090> way<00:03:40.269> i<00:03:40.480> can<00:03:40.570> just<00:03:40.930> set<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:41.260> to

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
timer so that way i can just set it to

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.650 
timer so that way i can just set it to
be<00:03:41.470> 18<00:03:41.950> hours<00:03:42.340> when<00:03:42.700> it<00:03:42.790> shuts<00:03:43.030> off<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.480> then<00:03:43.540> i

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
be 18 hours when it shuts off and then i

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.630 
be 18 hours when it shuts off and then i
manually<00:03:44.049> turned<00:03:44.260> on<00:03:44.440> so<00:03:44.680> 18<00:03:45.010> hours<00:03:45.310> and<00:03:45.549> it

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
manually turned on so 18 hours and it

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.180 
manually turned on so 18 hours and it
will<00:03:45.730> just<00:03:45.940> shut<00:03:46.120> off<00:03:46.150> automatically<00:03:47.190> so

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
will just shut off automatically so

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.250 
will just shut off automatically so
that's<00:03:48.310> it<00:03:48.459> for<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:48.670> upgrade<00:03:49.079> look<00:03:50.079> at<00:03:50.200> the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
that's it for the upgrade look at the
