kind of just pushing in some blue right
into<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.900> corners<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.470> these<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.280> is

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
into the corners of these and this is

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.510 
into the corners of these and this is
only<00:02:23.670> because<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.690> didn't<00:02:25.320> have<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.650> dark<00:02:26.250> dark

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
only because I didn't have a dark dark

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.480 
only because I didn't have a dark dark
dark<00:02:26.850> blue<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:28.050> go<00:02:28.260> up<00:02:28.410> into<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.740> cuticle<00:02:29.310> area

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
dark blue to go up into a cuticle area

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.000 
dark blue to go up into a cuticle area
when<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.300> just<00:02:30.630> needed<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.050> just<00:02:31.260> put<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.560> tiny

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
when I just needed to just put a tiny

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.760 
when I just needed to just put a tiny
tiny<00:02:32.700> bit<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.390> there's<00:02:33.660> no<00:02:33.900> reason<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.410> use

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
tiny bit in I there's no reason to use

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.280 
tiny bit in I there's no reason to use
such<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.520> huge<00:02:36.330> amount<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.750> color<00:02:36.990> for

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
such a huge amount of color for

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.260 
such a huge amount of color for
something<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:37.800> I'm<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:38.130> using<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.640> tiny<00:02:38.940> bit

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
something that I'm just using a tiny bit

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.690 
something that I'm just using a tiny bit
of<00:02:39.300> color<00:02:39.510> for<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:40.320> I<00:02:40.590> hope<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.400> makes<00:02:41.580> sense

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
of color for so I hope that makes sense

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
medium color and add in just a tiny bit

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.730 
medium color and add in just a tiny bit
of<00:02:45.540> dark<00:02:45.750> than<00:02:45.990> it<00:02:46.110> is<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.380> go<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.590> with<00:02:46.710> a

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
it's gonna be very hard I'm working with

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:08.700 
it's gonna be very hard I'm working with
very<00:04:58.689> thin<00:04:59.110> lines<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:07.229> let<00:05:08.229> me<00:05:08.319> try<00:05:08.560> another

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
very thin lines and let me try another

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.010 
very thin lines and let me try another
one<00:05:08.919> I'm<00:05:09.219> gonna<00:05:09.400> I'll<00:05:09.669> hit<00:05:09.849> my<00:05:09.969> groove<00:05:10.180> that

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
thought that wasn't thin enough so let

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.219 
thought that wasn't thin enough so let
me<00:05:13.629> go<00:05:14.289> in<00:05:14.560> and<00:05:15.279> then<00:05:15.969> start<00:05:16.479> you<00:05:16.749> meet<00:05:16.930> kind<00:05:17.169> of

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
me go in and then start you meet kind of

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.499 
me go in and then start you meet kind of
like<00:05:17.349> a<00:05:17.379> star<00:05:17.800> out<00:05:18.039> on<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:18.400> bottom<00:05:18.610> and<00:05:19.330> then

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
like a star out on the bottom and then

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.920 
like a star out on the bottom and then
pull<00:05:19.870> it<00:05:20.020> with<00:05:20.169> a<00:05:20.199> very<00:05:20.529> thin<00:05:20.650> line<00:05:21.400> down<00:05:21.930> star

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
pull it with a very thin line down star

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.959 
pull it with a very thin line down star
out<00:05:23.580> of<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.759> bottom<00:05:25.349> thin<00:05:26.349> line<00:05:26.650> down<00:05:27.009> then

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:27.969 
out of the bottom thin line down then

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:30.450 
out of the bottom thin line down then
you're<00:05:28.120> gonna<00:05:28.240> make<00:05:28.539> like<00:05:28.900> other<00:05:29.560> lines<00:05:30.189> that

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
you're gonna make like other lines that

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.420 
you're gonna make like other lines that
are<00:05:30.669> coming<00:05:31.000> out<00:05:31.180> from<00:05:31.210> the<00:05:31.629> bottoms<00:05:32.139> that<00:05:33.129> are

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:41.350 
are coming out from the bottoms that are
not<00:05:33.729> attached<00:05:34.539> to<00:05:34.840> any<00:05:34.990> flowers<00:05:37.710> start<00:05:38.710> out

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:48.129 

down<00:05:42.430> start<00:05:43.430> out<00:05:46.419> and<00:05:47.419> then<00:05:47.629> you'll<00:05:47.780> start<00:05:48.020> to

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
down start out and then you'll start to

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.159 
down start out and then you'll start to
see<00:05:48.319> like<00:05:48.469> a<00:05:48.500> pattern<00:05:49.569> emerged<00:05:50.569> where<00:05:51.050> they

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169
