00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.830 
players like van Persie you is good at
holding<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.610> ball<00:01:38.820> up<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.299> we've<00:01:39.659> got<00:01:39.810> a

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
holding the ball up and we've got a

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.240 
holding the ball up and we've got a
player<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.229> Wilson<00:01:40.680> who's<00:01:40.799> got<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.100> much

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
player like Wilson who's got so much

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.710 
player like Wilson who's got so much
pace<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.939> can<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.270> finish<00:01:42.390> from

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
pace and you can just finish from

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.260 
pace and you can just finish from
anywhere<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.290> their<00:01:44.189> two<00:01:44.369> players<00:01:44.909> who<00:01:45.149> are

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
anywhere and their two players who are

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.450

great<00:01:45.509> strikers<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.560> not<00:01:46.770> good<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.220> their
