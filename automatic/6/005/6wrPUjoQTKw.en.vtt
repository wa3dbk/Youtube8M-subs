00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello here one speaks loud city 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.089
 Insert a warm welcome to one 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.710
 little gaming setup video of me 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.540
 I had you as abo special 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.820
 promised and even if it is one 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.990
 came a little later than planned 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.950
 I managed that now 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.089
 to record all 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.010
 I do not have the right one 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.300
 time for found now 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.439
 but my room weekend 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.109
 pretty well cleaned up 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.269
 because I had visited from Bavaria and 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.859
 now that they left again 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.960
 I still have the video, so to speak 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.740
 record what fits me quite well now 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.150
 at the place 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.890
 and yes I actually have to do it in total 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.480
 tell my desk like it 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.430
 pretty good because he is quite tall 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.649
 and you already see it directly 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.640
 couple of old controllers are lying around 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.350
 they do not work anymore I know 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.489
 not exactly what those are but the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.460
 I only use it when 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.960
 friends are there are otherwise 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.480
 actually only more or less then 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.129
 left you can still see my elgato mine 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.629
 feelings or my old hd 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.180
 pvr including a school 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.530
 collection so but I also direct 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.000
 actually here with the desk 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.469
 start or with the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.930
 go through the desk 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.059
 so this is my xbox this elite 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.949
 black xbox came as the exact name 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.659
 with 250 gb hard disk 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.189
 I have thee times in a microsoft 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.790
 sent because the hdmi entrance behind 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.260
 was broken 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.369
 but I have also directly from 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.479
 microsoft a whole new xbox 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.189
 I get sent that pretty much 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.009
 cool place so the right support to 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.180
 every case back there is still captain 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.799
 morgan bottle that still 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.270
 I'm pretty busy, I have to say 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.979
 not as the soft drinks so entirely on 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.299
 and to drink something but really 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.000
 not very common because I too 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.650
 I am traveling a lot by car and from 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.140
 so yes, yes, I rarely come 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.310
 to have something to drink, too 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.960
 i say i need people too though 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.310
 I actually give a party 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.100
 not the type of unconditional alcohol 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.979
 need to have fun after all 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.479
 and there's my old ipod back there 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.189
 but that's pretty much meanwhile 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.960
 broken he has the ordinary cracks 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.189
 happens on a course ride there will 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.220
 I'm going a bit late in the morning 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.409
 I ran to the bus and wanted 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.060
 yes you still catch her , so to speak 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.770
 I have the ipod so fast 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.229
 put in the shirt pocket and only then 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.509
 fell out at the sprint and yes 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.920
 unfortunately it shattered after he 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.780
 it has fallen down so many times before 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.880
 Never what has happened must be 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.590
 Of course someday 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.850
 but sometimes happen and now again into 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.039
 washbasin like the display there 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.890
 looks a bit broken already 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.800
 not from the outside but really 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.970
 inside the display but the music 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.110
 then plays quite well but also if 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.400
 I hardly ever used because 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.080
 I now always say my iphone 5 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.150
 and with whom I am by the way 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.620
 also the video on so I apologize 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.730
 a little the video quality if it is one 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.930
 a bit wobble though the 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.489
 audio quality maybe not like that 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.959
 perfect but otherwise i have 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.849
 simply no possibility of this video 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.470
 take this over there is my 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.760
 Favorite ice cream is the lips 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.010
 sparkling means I actually have 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.080
 a dose because although this was just empty 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.549
 I'll go back tomorrow to a new one 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.080
 way, by the way, a little bit new 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.400
 formation as I love this iced tea 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.810
 easy to gibt's unfortunately 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.010
 bottles which I think is a pity 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.080
 anyway, I've never had that 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.099
 found bottles but the taste really 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.900
 damn good, I have to say 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.130
 next to it is a mw3 and a 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.010
 black ops 2 celik i believe one 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.599
 exorcist lakers 1 in there and then 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.090
 still my favorite dvd kite runner 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.470
 I had in my video too 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.590
 recently said yes to mine 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.329
 favorite film then very important aspect 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.730
 of course my monitor stinks that 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.450
 many are interested that's a 24 inch 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.579
 samsung believed that monitor is called 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.840
 a350 accurate and must say I am 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.959
 pretty happy I used to 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.340
 22 inches must say 22 2 for me 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.200
 actually even better than i like big ones 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.609
 screens are not exactly of 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.739
 socks are small screens a lot 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.030
 better and also from the survey 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.380
 the whole thing just much more pleasant 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.970
 a slightly smaller screen 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.290
 that's why my next one will probably be back 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.459
 So I'm getting a little smaller 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.230
 can really only recommend to anyone 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.579
 That does not want to gamble properly 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.380
 a big tv to do but 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.430
 rather on the small screen and 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.359
 What happens with that ? 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.950
 cool such TV directly 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.750
 integrated so right you see this 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.250
 white cable that is, so to speak 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.470
 Cable TV connection the quality 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.380
 Of course, that's not perfect 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.519
 with cables but yes I look a little 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.139
 Watch TV or in the evening when I go to 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.489
 home comes a little bit I watch 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.620
 any feature films are still running 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.910
 otherwise I'm pretty little anyway 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.350
 Watching on television I have to say because 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.880
 you just do not run anything clever anymore 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.230
 Here you can see a little one 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.519
 memorystick down here by practically 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.109
 my mappacks on it is 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.060
 meanwhile almost full or 16 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.319
 gigabyte has but I can always 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.510
 the mappacks on and off 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.760
 it does not have to be, so to speak 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.620
 delete again from xbox down here 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.500
 a normal standard cable 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.909
 controller thus battery and I know 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.229
 There's no head and shoulders I've got 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.669
 I think if I buy myself but 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.769
 I have not gotten that yet 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.210
 of the same as actually with 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.290
 quite a standard against setup 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.270
 I have to say that I'm not that 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.010
 So the perfect gaming setter 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.169
 needs and a gameplay to earn 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.699
 I have enough controller and one 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.070
 screen and a good internet 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.600
 That's why the whole thing fits 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.310
 So it does not arise at all 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.110
 I know I have 32 now 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.220
 car management until january this year 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.520
 but I had a second one 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.100
 line so yeah I'm not the 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.750
 quite typical connection maria no fun 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.250
 so then here is my headset that is 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.570
 practically the normal standard 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.910
 my headset is still up here 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.320
 turtle beach ex 41 but I have the 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.180
 base station also the whole time 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.100
 Dismantled you can see that too 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.990
 not here on the desk and 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.470
 I also miss the controller 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.090
 work the cable to xp from 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.810
 headset a working cable to 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.110
 controller 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.430
 because that broke and 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.110
 That's why I can only do that anyway 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.910
 theoretically to gamble use 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.919
 no more to chat xbox live party 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.720
 That's why I think that must be unfavorable 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:19.240
 I still have a tweet otto meter 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.699
 I have no idea where that is and from 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.020
 Therefore, Jesus point at which a anyway 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.220
 a little stupid with headsets but 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.419
 he prefers to play with the standard 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.280
 headset where you then why not 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.780
 moves the part on the head so I did 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.849
 I'm not that big fan of stuff like that 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.310
 headsets then that my whether you 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.050
 see I can go here since around the 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.310
 behind is the small part I like 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.780
 pretty good see how long 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.970
 She then stops but I hope 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.660
 at least as long as the hd 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.849
 pvr 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.289
 my laptop here is actually 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.080
 pretty good I have to say of the no 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.460
 Residential dual core i7 processor pretty much 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.229
 much memory good graphics card 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.150
 So that is really a top- wide beings 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.530
 rendert videos like damn fast 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.669
 I 'm pretty good at myself 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.409
 maybe should have picked 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.030
 slow windows 8 draufspielen have 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:00.400
 still windows 7 on it though 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.750
 otherwise, the whole and actually fits 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.340
 I also asked a lot what I for 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.800
 a microphone user that this 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.900
 small parts of logitech costs 25 euro 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.159
 that in the media market so relatively cheap 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.990
 the audio quality that actually quite 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:11.660
 well the only problem I have with 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.280
 this with 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.290
 now it has to stop here on the 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.820
 table with stands and just when the xbox 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.410
 is on or the laptop is too loud 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.730
 you just have to vibrate this or 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.710
 this rushing from the laptop in 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.240
 background what not so perfect that 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.950
 but otherwise this is actually this 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.030
 I still completely satisfy the microphone 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.920
 I already broke 1, I am 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.360
 So this one appeared 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.840
 Stands it was a bit 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.580
 sensitive but year is 25 euros 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.320
 then no big problem 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.640
 Just to get a new one and from 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.560
 Therefore, that's true of the 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.940
 place next to the audio quality 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.500
 still memory stick and one more small 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.450
 notepad in case i have any video 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.370
 have ideas and right next to it 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.780
 Small book from the university should be slow 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.840
 also start to learn again because 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.370
 I write next week's exams yes 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.270
 then take a look here 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.800
 outside 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.510
 I once played soccer there 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.580
 in the garden but yes now 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.950
 not really earlier it was 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.440
 actually quite cool right outside 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:06.080
 the door and then maybe here 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.890
 a thing to my stool for me 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.670
 do not have a desk chair 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.260
 or I actually have 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.430
 already one but he is in the cellar 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.630
 I somehow stayed for a while 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.230
 times at this hawker weight knows too 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.120
 not why I did actually 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.710
 used at all or at all 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.270
 but started the used ones 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.650
 but it's so broken by now 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.700
 that's why there are also towels 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.050
 I have no idea about that 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.970
 used to and now is the 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.520
 actually so my favorite chair can 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.720
 you really say and that's why I think 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.910
 I will not be with you in the near future 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.320
 exchange even if he maybe for 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.180
 back or is not that good 

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.260
 but somehow yes if you look at something 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.090
 then you get used to it somehow 

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.650
 dearest and i hope the whole thing has 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.270
 you then fell in the spot and yes 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.630
 so I just say goodbye to 

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.630
 next time
