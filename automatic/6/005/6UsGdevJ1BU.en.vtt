00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.350
 I do not know how many times they have deleted me from the list 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.225
 and they have left me dead. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.050
 So this ... 

00:00:20.422 --> 00:00:22.732
 it is not new. 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.768
 Bounty hunters. 

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.148
 I've been chasing Riddick for ten years. 

00:00:32.218 --> 00:00:34.360
 He is the most dangerous person we've ever spotted. 

00:00:34.676 --> 00:00:35.834
 The fee doubled. 

00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:38.200
 I came to take your head in a box. 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.361
 Right here. 

00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:40.665
 So, once again, 

00:00:42.012 --> 00:00:43.610
 we play for blood. 

00:00:44.658 --> 00:00:46.447
 He is a man who sees in the dark. 

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:51.299
 So watch out for surprise attacks. 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.490
 What is; 

00:00:58.787 --> 00:00:59.787
 Riddick! 

00:01:00.784 --> 00:01:01.784
 One down. 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:03.890
 Three down. 

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:06.264
 Do you understand I'm going? 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.455
 Again! 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.800
 Keep it down. 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.100
 What happens; 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.584
 End of time. 

00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:51.321
 Let's free him. 

00:02:21.872 --> 00:02:23.757
 You are not afraid of the dark, right?
