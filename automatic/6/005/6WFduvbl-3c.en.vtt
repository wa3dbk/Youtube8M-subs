00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
little just the arms and it could take a

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.990 
little just the arms and it could take a
second<00:03:46.590> your<00:03:46.950> first<00:03:47.220> time<00:03:47.459> but<00:03:47.700> once<00:03:47.880> you

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
second your first time but once you

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.390 
second your first time but once you
start<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.239> get<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.480> hang<00:03:48.660> of<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.840> will<00:03:49.079> be<00:03:49.200> easy

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
start to get the hang of it will be easy

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.640 
start to get the hang of it will be easy
in<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.519> future

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.410 

each<00:03:57.840> color<00:03:58.840> gets<00:03:59.319> in<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.560> way<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.970> just<00:04:01.120> fold

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
each color gets in the way you just fold

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.149 
each color gets in the way you just fold
it<00:04:01.540> so<00:04:01.780> you<00:04:01.840> kind<00:04:02.230> of<00:04:02.260> cover<00:04:02.829> them<00:04:03.010> around

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
it so you kind of cover them around

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.710 
it so you kind of cover them around
almost<00:04:03.400> like<00:04:03.610> a<00:04:03.640> hot<00:04:03.819> dog<00:04:03.849> I<00:04:04.239> guess<00:04:04.360> you<00:04:04.599> can

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
almost like a hot dog I guess you can

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.410 
almost like a hot dog I guess you can
say<00:04:05.010> hold<00:04:06.010> it<00:04:06.370> like<00:04:06.549> that<00:04:06.819> and<00:04:06.879> then<00:04:07.150> push<00:04:07.390> the

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
say hold it like that and then push the

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.210 
say hold it like that and then push the
arms<00:04:08.049> so<00:04:08.590> they're<00:04:08.739> back<00:04:08.860> in<00:04:09.010> their<00:04:09.129> original

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
arms so they're back in their original

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:20.340 
arms so they're back in their original
position<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:16.720> want<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:16.959> pop<00:04:17.229> the<00:04:17.440> collar<00:04:19.350> up

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
position you want to pop the collar up

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.060 
position you want to pop the collar up
I'm<00:04:21.160> gonna<00:04:21.340> pop<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:21.609> collar<00:04:21.759> back<00:04:26.070> stuff

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
I'm gonna pop the collar back stuff

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.360 
I'm gonna pop the collar back stuff
sometimes<00:04:29.039> okay<00:04:30.039> so<00:04:30.520> you<00:04:31.240> should<00:04:32.130> ever<00:04:33.130> use

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
sometimes okay so you should ever use

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.710 
sometimes okay so you should ever use
this<00:04:33.639> kind<00:04:33.820> of<00:04:33.940> construction<00:04:34.210> be<00:04:34.419> very<00:04:34.600> use<00:04:34.690> a

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
this kind of construction be very use a

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.529 
this kind of construction be very use a
different<00:04:35.110> type<00:04:35.289> earlier<00:04:36.300> then<00:04:37.300> you<00:04:37.389> should

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
different type earlier then you should

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.510 
different type earlier then you should
have<00:04:37.570> that<00:04:37.870> then<00:04:38.500> there<00:04:38.710> is<00:04:38.830> clearly<00:04:39.160> a<00:04:39.280> little

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
have that then there is clearly a little

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:50.429 
have that then there is clearly a little
too<00:04:39.820> much<00:04:43.169> fix<00:04:44.169> it<00:04:44.380> up

00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:50.439 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:52.809

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
this is doing this like I it's because

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.360 
this is doing this like I it's because
the<00:05:20.930> arm<00:05:21.110> holes<00:05:21.289> bigger<00:05:21.530> on<00:05:21.680> this<00:05:21.830> side<00:05:22.069> you'll

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
the arm holes bigger on this side you'll

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.550 
the arm holes bigger on this side you'll
notice<00:05:22.430> that<00:05:22.669> this<00:05:22.969> one<00:05:23.300> has<00:05:23.599> a<00:05:24.229> little<00:05:24.409> more

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
notice that this one has a little more

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.529 
notice that this one has a little more
paper<00:05:24.800> coming<00:05:25.129> out<00:05:25.219> and<00:05:25.400> this<00:05:25.669> one<00:05:25.940> you'd<00:05:26.300> see

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
paper coming out and this one you'd see

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:27.999 
paper coming out and this one you'd see
it<00:05:26.629> like<00:05:26.780> that<00:05:26.810> you<00:05:27.379> can<00:05:27.530> see<00:05:27.680> this<00:05:27.830> one

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
it like that you can see this one

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:29.709 
it like that you can see this one
overlaps<00:05:28.520> or<00:05:28.789> this<00:05:28.940> one<00:05:29.090> overlaps<00:05:29.449> a<00:05:29.539> little

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:29.719 
overlaps or this one overlaps a little

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:33.490 
overlaps or this one overlaps a little
more<00:05:30.580> that's<00:05:31.580> a<00:05:31.669> good<00:05:31.789> it's<00:05:32.659> weird<00:05:32.960> for<00:05:33.289> me

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
more that's a good it's weird for me

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.249 
more that's a good it's weird for me
whatever<00:05:33.979> but<00:05:34.940> I<00:05:35.419> think<00:05:35.840> I<00:05:35.900> like<00:05:36.020> me<00:05:36.139> just

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:36.259 
whatever but I think I like me just

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:37.480 
whatever but I think I like me just
because<00:05:36.409> the<00:05:36.650> armhole<00:05:36.919> sides<00:05:37.129> if<00:05:37.310> you<00:05:37.400> know

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
because the armhole sides if you know

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.920 
because the armhole sides if you know
what<00:05:37.580> I<00:05:37.639> mean<00:05:37.789> but<00:05:38.060> if<00:05:38.210> you<00:05:38.300> don't<00:05:38.479> don't<00:05:38.719> even

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
what I mean but if you don't don't even

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.990 
what I mean but if you don't don't even
bother<00:05:39.020> worry<00:05:39.500> about<00:05:39.740> it<00:05:39.860> we<00:05:40.610> will<00:05:40.759> have<00:05:40.879> some

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000
