binoculars his or her vision is going to
be<00:01:06.320> a<00:01:06.350> lot<00:01:06.590> different<00:01:06.620> than<00:01:07.070> yours<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:07.430> the

be a lot different than yours so the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.240 
be a lot different than yours so the
diopter<00:01:08.270> allows<00:01:08.869> you<00:01:09.140> to<00:01:09.259> adjust<00:01:09.890> for<00:01:10.100> those

diopter allows you to adjust for those

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.490 
diopter allows you to adjust for those
differences<00:01:10.640> exactly<00:01:11.479> so<00:01:12.020> let's<00:01:12.110> take<00:01:12.320> them<00:01:12.409> a

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
differences exactly so let's take them a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.260 
differences exactly so let's take them a
little<00:01:12.680> bit<00:01:12.799> through<00:01:13.009> on<00:01:13.159> how<00:01:13.640> to<00:01:13.700> properly

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270

diopter<00:01:43.549> on<00:01:43.759> all<00:01:44.119> of<00:01:44.329> our<00:01:44.450> families<00:01:44.899> of

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
diopter on all of our families of

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.330 
diopter on all of our families of
binoculars<00:01:45.469> is<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:45.619> little<00:01:45.890> bit<00:01:45.979> different

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
binoculars is a little bit different

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.029 
binoculars is a little bit different
through<00:01:46.939> each<00:01:47.060> family<00:01:47.450> with<00:01:47.630> our<00:01:47.810> Al<00:01:48.350> and<00:01:48.649> SLC

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
through each family with our Al and SLC

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.670 
through each family with our Al and SLC
binocular<00:01:49.729> you've<00:01:49.880> got<00:01:50.000> a<00:01:50.030> diopter<00:01:50.530> that<00:01:51.530> the

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
binocular you've got a diopter that the

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.560 
binocular you've got a diopter that the
focus<00:01:52.159> wheel<00:01:52.340> actually<00:01:52.609> pops<00:01:53.030> up<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:53.479> your

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
focus wheel actually pops up and your

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.139 
focus wheel actually pops up and your
diopter<00:01:54.020> setting<00:01:54.049> is<00:01:54.469> just<00:01:54.710> below<00:01:55.009> it<00:01:55.039> on<00:01:55.340> the

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
diopter setting is just below it on the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.690 
diopter setting is just below it on the
e<00:01:56.210> l<00:01:56.479> range<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.140> CL<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:57.740> has<00:01:57.979> individual

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
e l range and the CL it has individual

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.550 
e l range and the CL it has individual
diopter<00:01:59.240> adjustment<00:01:59.270> that's<00:01:59.810> actually<00:02:00.320> still

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
diopter adjustment that's actually still

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.919 
diopter adjustment that's actually still
on<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:01.159> tube<00:02:01.520> itself<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.329> then<00:02:02.719> with<00:02:02.899> our

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
on the tube itself and then with our

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.200 
on the tube itself and then with our
pocket<00:02:03.469> binocular<00:02:03.979> you've<00:02:04.130> got<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.460> diopter

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
pocket binocular you've got the diopter

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.300 
pocket binocular you've got the diopter
adjustment<00:02:05.420> as<00:02:06.079> a<00:02:06.109> little<00:02:06.500> knob<00:02:06.679> just<00:02:06.979> below

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
adjustment as a little knob just below

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.790 
adjustment as a little knob just below
the<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.820> hinge<00:02:08.090> so<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:09.320> might<00:02:09.470> be<00:02:09.500> finding

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
the the hinge so you might be finding

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.110 
the the hinge so you might be finding
them<00:02:10.039> in<00:02:10.160> a<00:02:10.220> little<00:02:10.429> bit<00:02:10.550> different<00:02:10.700> places

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
them in a little bit different places

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.210 
them in a little bit different places
throughout<00:02:11.630> our<00:02:11.990> family<00:02:12.380> of<00:02:12.470> binoculars<00:02:13.010> but

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
throughout our family of binoculars but

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.100 
throughout our family of binoculars but
it's<00:02:13.340> still<00:02:13.640> all<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.360> same<00:02:14.390> process<00:02:15.080> to

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
it's still all the same process to

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.080 
it's still all the same process to
adjust<00:02:15.560> them<00:02:15.710> let's<00:02:15.980> walk<00:02:16.280> through<00:02:16.310> how<00:02:17.030> to

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
adjust them let's walk through how to

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.960 
adjust them let's walk through how to
properly<00:02:17.570> adjust

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
properly adjust

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.330 
properly adjust
the<00:02:18.060> diopter<00:02:18.360> well<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.200> start<00:02:19.500> out<00:02:19.650> first

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
the diopter well you start out first

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.130 
the diopter well you start out first
thing<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.700> want<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.000> do<00:02:21.270> is<00:02:21.510> adjust<00:02:21.720> your<00:02:22.110> eye

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
thing you want to do is adjust your eye

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.260 
thing you want to do is adjust your eye
cups<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:23.070> make<00:02:23.250> sure<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:23.760> have<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:23.940> full

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
cups to make sure that you have a full

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.660 
cups to make sure that you have a full
field<00:02:24.600> of<00:02:24.780> view<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.950> depends<00:02:26.370> if<00:02:26.520> you're

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
field of view and that depends if you're

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.430 
field of view and that depends if you're
wearing<00:02:27.210> eyeglasses<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.900> turn<00:02:28.080> them<00:02:28.230> all<00:02:28.350> the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
wearing eyeglasses you turn them all the

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.550 
wearing eyeglasses you turn them all the
way<00:02:28.530> down<00:02:29.030> no<00:02:30.030> eyeglasses<00:02:30.260> either<00:02:31.260> all<00:02:31.470> the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
way down no eyeglasses either all the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.960 
way down no eyeglasses either all the
way<00:02:31.650> out<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:31.860> there<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.280> an<00:02:32.430> intermediate

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
way out and there is an intermediate

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.070 
way out and there is an intermediate
position<00:02:33.090> as<00:02:34.130> well<00:02:35.180> so<00:02:36.180> turn<00:02:36.750> them<00:02:36.900> all<00:02:36.990> the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
position as well so turn them all the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.220 
position as well so turn them all the
way<00:02:37.200> out<00:02:37.320> in<00:02:37.470> my<00:02:37.560> case<00:02:38.480> pick<00:02:39.480> an<00:02:39.600> object<00:02:39.990> out<00:02:40.110> in

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
way out in my case pick an object out in

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.870 
way out in my case pick an object out in
the<00:02:40.320> field<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:41.040> distance<00:02:41.460> isn't<00:02:41.610> so

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
the field the distance isn't so

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.880 
the field the distance isn't so
important<00:02:42.420> just<00:02:42.600> as<00:02:42.990> long<00:02:43.170> as<00:02:43.320> it's<00:02:43.500> something

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
important just as long as it's something

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.070 
important just as long as it's something
that<00:02:44.070> you<00:02:44.220> can<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.850> can<00:02:44.880> focus<00:02:45.270> in<00:02:45.570> on<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:45.930> and

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
that you can you can focus in on and and

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.200 
that you can you can focus in on and and
have<00:02:46.650> some<00:02:46.860> contrast<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.610> really<00:02:47.850> see<00:02:48.060> that

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
have some contrast to really see that

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.449 
have some contrast to really see that
you've<00:02:48.360> got<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.860> clearest<00:02:49.860> focus<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.340> you

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
you've got the clearest focus that you

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.310 
you've got the clearest focus that you
can<00:02:50.490> one<00:02:51.120> thing<00:02:51.330> to<00:02:51.450> keep<00:02:51.570> in<00:02:51.720> mind<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:52.050> I'd

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
can one thing to keep in mind that I'd

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.690 
can one thing to keep in mind that I'd
make<00:02:52.560> sure<00:02:52.590> it's<00:02:52.890> it's<00:02:53.100> an<00:02:53.250> object<00:02:53.580> with

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
make sure it's it's an object with

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.580 
make sure it's it's an object with
really<00:02:54.030> good<00:02:54.180> contrast<00:02:54.720> because<00:02:54.840> again<00:02:55.380> we're

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
really good contrast because again we're

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.560 
really good contrast because again we're
kind<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:55.950> talking<00:02:56.250> about<00:02:56.459> fine<00:02:56.820> focusing<00:02:57.420> here

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
kind of talking about fine focusing here

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.690 
kind of talking about fine focusing here
and<00:02:57.780> really<00:02:58.080> getting<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.860> binocular<00:02:59.340> fit<00:02:59.550> to

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
and really getting the binocular fit to

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.190 
and really getting the binocular fit to
your<00:02:59.820> vision<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.330> Kazak<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.750> know<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:00.870> usually

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
your vision so Kazak you know I usually

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.960 
your vision so Kazak you know I usually
picked<00:03:01.440> that<00:03:01.590> fifty<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.370> hundred<00:03:02.459> yard

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
picked that fifty to a hundred yard

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.910 
picked that fifty to a hundred yard
range<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.420> lot<00:03:03.990> of<00:03:04.050> times<00:03:04.200> I'll<00:03:04.380> use<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.560> tree

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
range and a lot of times I'll use a tree

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.080 
range and a lot of times I'll use a tree
because<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.459> can<00:03:05.610> really<00:03:05.820> see<00:03:05.970> the

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
because you can really see the

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.090 
because you can really see the
difference<00:03:06.209> in<00:03:06.540> between<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.959> limbs<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.500> it

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
difference in between the limbs and it

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.680 
difference in between the limbs and it
just<00:03:08.310> gives<00:03:08.520> you<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:08.700> fine<00:03:09.120> focusing

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
just gives you that fine focusing

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.360 
just gives you that fine focusing
ability<00:03:09.900> yeah<00:03:10.350> perfect<00:03:10.830> way<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:10.980> do<00:03:11.220> it

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
ability yeah perfect way to do it

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.970 
ability yeah perfect way to do it
perfect<00:03:11.940> so<00:03:12.930> what<00:03:13.080> you<00:03:13.170> want<00:03:13.350> to<00:03:13.410> do<00:03:13.560> is<00:03:13.770> as

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
you're focusing cover the right-hand

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.280 
you're focusing cover the right-hand
barrel<00:03:18.480> because<00:03:18.570> we<00:03:18.720> remember<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.080> right

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
barrel because we remember the right

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.960 
barrel because we remember the right
barrel<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.040> one<00:03:20.190> that<00:03:20.310> has<00:03:20.490> a<00:03:20.520> diopter

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
barrel is the one that has a diopter

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.660 
barrel is the one that has a diopter
adjustment<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.900> for<00:03:22.830> this<00:03:22.950> step<00:03:23.280> we<00:03:23.489> don't

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
adjustment so for this step we don't

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.610 
adjustment so for this step we don't
want<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:24.030> be<00:03:24.390> concerned<00:03:24.780> with<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:25.050> we<00:03:25.380> just

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
want to be concerned with that we just

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.680 
want to be concerned with that we just
want<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:25.890> focus<00:03:26.070> on<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.519> left<00:03:26.790> side<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.420> Rob

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
want to focus on the left side and Rob

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.449 
want to focus on the left side and Rob
makes<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:28.080> great<00:03:28.290> point<00:03:28.530> he's<00:03:28.950> covering<00:03:29.310> the

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
makes a great point he's covering the

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.790 
makes a great point he's covering the
bow<00:03:29.610> with<00:03:29.880> his<00:03:30.030> right<00:03:30.300> hand<00:03:30.480> or<00:03:30.840> even<00:03:31.170> our<00:03:31.470> lens

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
bow with his right hand or even our lens

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.680 
bow with his right hand or even our lens
covers<00:03:32.580> that<00:03:32.760> come<00:03:32.970> with<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.180> binocular<00:03:33.660> a

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
covers that come with the binocular a

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.330 
covers that come with the binocular a
great<00:03:34.019> way<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.230> just<00:03:34.500> cover<00:03:34.739> up<00:03:34.860> that<00:03:35.130> right

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
great way to just cover up that right

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.370 
great way to just cover up that right
side<00:03:35.580> what<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.180> don't<00:03:36.450> want<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.780> do<00:03:36.930> is<00:03:37.140> shut

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
side what you don't want to do is shut

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.720 
side what you don't want to do is shut
your<00:03:37.530> right<00:03:37.739> eye<00:03:37.769> because<00:03:38.100> a<00:03:38.280> lot<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.489> times

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
your right eye because a lot of times

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.860 
your right eye because a lot of times
what<00:03:38.910> happens<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.360> when<00:03:39.510> you're<00:03:39.570> shutting

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
what happens is when you're shutting

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.600 
what happens is when you're shutting
your<00:03:39.930> right<00:03:40.140> eye<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.530> lot<00:03:40.950> of<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.130> muscles<00:03:41.310> in

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
your right eye a lot of the muscles in

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.850 
your right eye a lot of the muscles in
your<00:03:41.640> face<00:03:41.940> just<00:03:42.269> aren't<00:03:42.660> giving<00:03:43.080> your<00:03:43.440> true

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
your face just aren't giving your true

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.350 
your face just aren't giving your true
vision<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.459> you'll<00:03:44.610> typically<00:03:45.180> would<00:03:45.330> have

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
vision that you'll typically would have

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.120 
vision that you'll typically would have
when<00:03:45.660> you're<00:03:45.780> using<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.140> binocular<00:03:46.650> yeah

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
when you're using the binocular yeah

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.770 
when you're using the binocular yeah
really<00:03:47.430> you<00:03:47.610> just<00:03:47.730> end<00:03:47.970> up<00:03:48.060> with<00:03:48.120> eye<00:03:48.360> strain

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
really you just end up with eye strain

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.560 
really you just end up with eye strain
and<00:03:49.110> maybe<00:03:49.470> not<00:03:49.709> adjust<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.190> as<00:03:50.310> optimum<00:03:51.269> as<00:03:51.420> it

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
and maybe not adjust it as optimum as it

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.150 
and maybe not adjust it as optimum as it
could<00:03:51.720> be<00:03:53.720> so<00:03:54.720> we<00:03:54.840> get<00:03:54.989> that<00:03:55.170> left<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.860> left

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
could be so we get that left that left

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.570 
could be so we get that left that left
barrel<00:03:56.580> nice<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:56.970> clear<00:03:58.250> that's<00:03:59.250> our<00:03:59.430> first

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
barrel nice and clear that's our first

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.310 
barrel nice and clear that's our first
step<00:04:01.190> once<00:04:02.190> we've<00:04:02.370> done<00:04:02.549> that<00:04:02.810> we<00:04:03.810> engage<00:04:04.140> the

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
step once we've done that we engage the

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.670 
step once we've done that we engage the
diopter<00:04:04.650> adjustment<00:04:05.510> now<00:04:06.510> when<00:04:07.290> we<00:04:07.380> move<00:04:07.530> the

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
diopter adjustment now when we move the

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.890 
diopter adjustment now when we move the
diopter<00:04:08.010> adjustment<00:04:08.190> we're<00:04:09.090> only<00:04:09.360> going<00:04:09.690> to

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
diopter adjustment we're only going to

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.960 
diopter adjustment we're only going to
move<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.320> lens<00:04:10.560> in<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.010> right<00:04:11.220> hand<00:04:11.489> barrel

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
move the lens in the right hand barrel

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.000 
move the lens in the right hand barrel
this<00:04:12.480> is<00:04:12.690> how<00:04:12.840> we<00:04:12.900> adjust<00:04:13.170> for<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.650> difference

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
this is how we adjust for the difference

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.560 
this is how we adjust for the difference
between<00:04:14.190> our<00:04:14.519> eyes<00:04:14.670> we<00:04:14.940> have<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.209> left<00:04:15.360> eye

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
between our eyes we have the left eye

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.199 
between our eyes we have the left eye
clear<00:04:15.900> now<00:04:16.109> this<00:04:16.650> barrel<00:04:17.010> is<00:04:17.100> adjusted<00:04:17.640> so<00:04:18.060> now

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
clear now this barrel is adjusted so now

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.810 
clear now this barrel is adjusted so now
we're<00:04:18.359> going<00:04:18.479> to<00:04:18.630> adjust<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.620> diopter<00:04:19.859> and

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
we're going to adjust the diopter and

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.039 
we're going to adjust the diopter and
we're<00:04:20.910> going<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.090> cover<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.419> left-hand<00:04:21.840> lens

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
we're going to cover the left-hand lens

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.650 
we're going to cover the left-hand lens
now<00:04:22.919> once<00:04:23.130> you<00:04:23.250> get<00:04:23.400> that<00:04:23.640> clear<00:04:24.120> the

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
now once you get that clear the

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.860 
now once you get that clear the
right-hand<00:04:25.080> barrel

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
right-hand barrel

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.420 
right-hand barrel
push<00:04:27.870> that<00:04:28.050> diopter<00:04:28.590> adjustment<00:04:28.620> back<00:04:29.160> down

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
push that diopter adjustment back down

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.350 
push that diopter adjustment back down
now<00:04:30.150> your<00:04:30.330> focus<00:04:30.540> wheel<00:04:31.340> will<00:04:32.340> only<00:04:32.520> focus<00:04:33.030> it

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
now your focus wheel will only focus it

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.960 
now your focus wheel will only focus it
will<00:04:33.570> not<00:04:33.780> change<00:04:33.810> your<00:04:34.290> diet<00:04:34.470> adjustment<00:04:35.160> one

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
will not change your diet adjustment one

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.879 
will not change your diet adjustment one
thing<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.330> remember<00:04:36.419> if<00:04:36.810> a<00:04:37.200> user<00:04:37.410> out<00:04:37.620> there<00:04:37.800> is

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
thing to remember if a user out there is

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.590 
thing to remember if a user out there is
wearing<00:04:38.280> contact<00:04:38.790> lenses<00:04:38.880> or<00:04:39.360> wearing

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
wearing contact lenses or wearing

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.480 
wearing contact lenses or wearing
eyeglasses<00:04:39.750> typically<00:04:40.650> those<00:04:40.889> lenses<00:04:41.220> are

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
eyeglasses typically those lenses are

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.310 
eyeglasses typically those lenses are
going<00:04:41.639> to<00:04:41.700> correct<00:04:42.030> for<00:04:42.510> any<00:04:42.660> differences<00:04:42.930> in

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
going to correct for any differences in

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.450 
going to correct for any differences in
your<00:04:43.350> eyes<00:04:43.560> so<00:04:43.740> more<00:04:43.980> than<00:04:44.070> likely<00:04:44.250> you're

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
your eyes so more than likely you're

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.580 
your eyes so more than likely you're
going<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.610> be<00:04:44.700> close<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:45.060> zero<00:04:45.600> it's<00:04:45.870> you<00:04:46.500> know

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
going to be close to zero it's you know

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.140 
going to be close to zero it's you know
other<00:04:46.830> situations<00:04:47.550> where<00:04:47.669> you<00:04:47.790> have<00:04:47.910> someone

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
other situations where you have someone

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.550 
other situations where you have someone
who's<00:04:48.330> not<00:04:48.480> using<00:04:48.810> eyeglass<00:04:49.139> wear<00:04:49.380> eyeglasses

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
who's not using eyeglass wear eyeglasses

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.620 
who's not using eyeglass wear eyeglasses
but<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.370> nice<00:04:50.550> thing<00:04:50.760> about<00:04:50.790> it<00:04:51.060> for<00:04:51.090> me<00:04:51.330> is<00:04:51.480> if

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
but the nice thing about it for me is if

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.629 
but the nice thing about it for me is if
you're<00:04:51.750> out<00:04:51.870> in<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.020> field<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:52.530> Rob<00:04:53.400> if<00:04:53.550> you

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
you're out in the field and Rob if you

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:54.920 
you're out in the field and Rob if you
took<00:04:53.790> my<00:04:53.940> binoculars<00:04:54.180> our<00:04:54.540> vision<00:04:54.810> is<00:04:54.870> very

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
took my binoculars our vision is very

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.480 
took my binoculars our vision is very
different<00:04:55.440> and<00:04:55.530> you're<00:04:55.620> a<00:04:55.650> plus<00:04:55.950> two<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:56.400> I'm

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
different and you're a plus two and I'm
