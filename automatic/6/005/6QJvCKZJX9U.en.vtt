they're anodized red this Watson kit
also<00:01:18.850> uses<00:01:19.420> spherical<00:01:19.990> bearings<00:01:20.370> these

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
also uses spherical bearings these

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.760 
also uses spherical bearings these
spherical<00:01:22.030> bearings<00:01:22.510> are<00:01:22.750> pretty<00:01:23.680> much

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
spherical bearings are pretty much

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.070 
spherical bearings are pretty much
technology<00:01:24.190> that's<00:01:24.610> used<00:01:24.729> on<00:01:25.150> pretty<00:01:25.990> much

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
technology that's used on pretty much

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.460 
technology that's used on pretty much
race<00:01:26.530> cards<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:28.600> they<00:01:28.780> offer<00:01:28.960> is<00:01:29.320> the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
race cards and what they offer is the

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.780 
race cards and what they offer is the
precise<00:01:29.860> handling<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:31.030> feel<00:01:31.750> that<00:01:31.960> you<00:01:32.110> get

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
precise handling and feel that you get

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.500 
precise handling and feel that you get
good<00:01:33.790> handling<00:01:34.210> out<00:01:34.390> of<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:36.220> we<00:01:36.520> use<00:01:37.000> that<00:01:37.240> and

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
good handling out of so we use that and

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.840 
good handling out of so we use that and
then<00:01:37.630> we<00:01:37.780> have<00:01:38.280> polyurethane<00:01:39.280> bushings<00:01:39.700> in

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
then we have polyurethane bushings in

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.289 
then we have polyurethane bushings in
here<00:01:40.060> too<00:01:40.299> which<00:01:41.490> take<00:01:42.490> up<00:01:42.700> some<00:01:43.119> of<00:01:43.240> the

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
here too which take up some of the

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.120 
here too which take up some of the
harshness<00:01:43.600> test<00:01:43.990> comes<00:01:44.290> with<00:01:44.650> using<00:01:45.010> these

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
harshness test comes with using these

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.340 
harshness test comes with using these
spherical<00:01:45.549> bushings<00:01:46.119> so<00:01:46.330> in<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:47.020> end<00:01:47.170> you're

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
spherical bushings so in the end you're

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.910 
spherical bushings so in the end you're
getting<00:01:47.680> race<00:01:48.100> car<00:01:48.369> like<00:01:48.610> handling<00:01:49.090> but<00:01:49.990> it's

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
getting race car like handling but it's

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.050 
getting race car like handling but it's
something<00:01:51.070> that<00:01:51.340> can<00:01:51.490> be<00:01:51.520> driven<00:01:51.700> on<00:01:51.970> the

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
something that can be driven on the

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.649 
something that can be driven on the
street<00:01:52.619> we<00:01:53.619> you<00:01:54.040> can<00:01:54.189> also<00:01:54.310> see<00:01:54.820> here<00:01:55.090> as<00:01:55.270> we

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
street we you can also see here as we

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.620 
street we you can also see here as we
changed<00:01:56.159> we're<00:01:57.159> using<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.640> stud<00:01:58.060> in<00:01:58.299> the<00:01:58.360> diff

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
changed we're using a stud in the diff

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.140 
changed we're using a stud in the diff
cover<00:01:58.840> rather<00:01:59.200> than<00:01:59.470> a<00:01:59.500> bolt<00:01:59.799> so<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.850> stud

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
cover rather than a bolt so the stud

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.780 
cover rather than a bolt so the stud
eliminates<00:02:01.810> all<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.080> problems<00:02:02.680> with<00:02:03.159> the

in<00:02:44.390> general<00:02:46.300> one<00:02:47.300> of<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.480> key<00:02:47.960> features<00:02:48.200> are

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
in general one of the key features are

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.580 
in general one of the key features are
the<00:02:48.980> advantages<00:02:49.490> of<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.850> Watts<00:02:50.030> link<00:02:50.300> in

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
the advantages of the Watts link in

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.980 
the advantages of the Watts link in
general<00:02:51.590> over<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.190> panhard<00:02:52.520> rod<00:02:52.700> is<00:02:53.120> that<00:02:53.900> the

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
general over the panhard rod is that the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.070 
general over the panhard rod is that the
panhard<00:02:54.260> rod<00:02:54.410> set<00:02:54.830> up<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.610> axle<00:02:56.060> moves<00:02:56.360> in<00:02:56.720> an

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
panhard rod set up the axle moves in an

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.940 
panhard rod set up the axle moves in an
arc<00:02:57.940> so<00:02:58.940> you're<00:02:59.510> actually<00:02:59.690> be<00:03:00.080> getting<00:03:00.260> some

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
arc so you're actually be getting some

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.910 
arc so you're actually be getting some
lateral<00:03:01.940> movement<00:03:02.780> as<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.560> suspension

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
lateral movement as the suspension

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.760 
lateral movement as the suspension
travels<00:03:04.430> up<00:03:04.610> and<00:03:04.730> down<00:03:04.820> which<00:03:05.570> is<00:03:06.170> not<00:03:06.410> exactly

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
travels up and down which is not exactly

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.350 
travels up and down which is not exactly
good<00:03:07.010> for<00:03:07.720> handling<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:10.250> Watts<00:03:10.430> link<00:03:10.730> allows

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
good for handling the Watts link allows

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.000 
good for handling the Watts link allows
the<00:03:11.660> axle<00:03:11.900> it'll<00:03:12.050> move<00:03:12.140> straight<00:03:12.470> up<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:12.890> down

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
the axle it'll move straight up and down

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.630 
the axle it'll move straight up and down
so<00:03:13.460> as<00:03:13.730> you're<00:03:14.540> breaking<00:03:15.350> or<00:03:15.650> turning<00:03:16.040> in<00:03:16.190> the

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
so as you're breaking or turning in the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.150 
so as you're breaking or turning in the
axle<00:03:17.000> staying<00:03:17.300> planted<00:03:17.930> in<00:03:18.740> the<00:03:18.830> center<00:03:19.130> of

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
axle staying planted in the center of

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.730 
axle staying planted in the center of
the<00:03:19.310> car<00:03:19.490> it's<00:03:19.760> not<00:03:19.940> walking<00:03:20.480> side<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.840> stop<00:03:21.050> so

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
the car it's not walking side to stop so

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.190 
the car it's not walking side to stop so
that's<00:03:21.890> one<00:03:22.040> of<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.220> key<00:03:22.490> advantages<00:03:23.120> of<00:03:23.200> the

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
that's one of the key advantages of the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.390 
that's one of the key advantages of the
Watts<00:03:24.380> line

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.580 

so<00:03:29.670> that's<00:03:30.000> pretty<00:03:30.510> much<00:03:30.629> the<00:03:31.049> general

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
so that's pretty much the general

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.470 
so that's pretty much the general
