and switching between two strums on the
second<00:02:03.260> fret<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:03.500> then<00:02:03.770> two<00:02:03.980> strums<00:02:04.250> on<00:02:04.400> the

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
second fret and then two strums on the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.940 
second fret and then two strums on the
4th<00:02:04.730> fret<00:02:04.909> while<00:02:05.570> we're<00:02:05.780> playing<00:02:05.900> the<00:02:06.470> open<00:02:06.860> a

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
4th fret while we're playing the open a

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.240 
4th fret while we're playing the open a
string<00:02:07.159> as<00:02:07.370> well<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.209> sounds<00:02:08.450> like<00:02:08.569> this

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
string as well so it sounds like this

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:19.709 
string as well so it sounds like this
all<00:02:11.180> downstrokes<00:02:11.840> in<00:02:12.260> right<00:02:12.530> hand

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:19.719 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.300 

so<00:02:20.719> two<00:02:20.780> strums<00:02:21.260> on<00:02:21.500> each<00:02:21.650> with<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.069> swing

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
so two strums on each with the swing

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.190 
so two strums on each with the swing
feel<00:02:22.579> if<00:02:23.329> you're<00:02:23.450> having<00:02:23.629> trouble<00:02:23.989> with<00:02:24.019> the
