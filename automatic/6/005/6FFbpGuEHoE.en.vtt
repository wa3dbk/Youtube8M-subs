00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 so hello and welcome in two 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.140
 more tutorials and today i will 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.910
 First of all, show how to command 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.649
 box bonn can do that with a command 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.360
 blog like ass et lures, for example , I find here 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.830
 press the button then I will here 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.840
 above the command boxsport and as soon as I 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.700
 a button fastener tells me that 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.070
 Command blog or does he give me stones? 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.119
 you see poison coli moniz ton and that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.760
 I then set up as follows 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.470
 the command is a relatively simple and 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.420
 my z block on each at the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.340
 coordinates a command buck can yes 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.260
 we also need 137 for use 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.220
 no further metadata me and there 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.810
 we have only here on the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.340
 curved bracket and here we add 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.320
 then the respective command a simple 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.070
 write in the quotation marks 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.079
 what we want 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.300
 in my case the cs death comolli 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.680
 stone yes and that is a principle that 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.020
 real success recipe 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.280
 the spot of the cabin, so to speak 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.600
 description and thus the video has 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.890
 I'm too short I have more stuff 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.289
 can be prepared and indeed one can 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.239
 user question of netcraft pure and has 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.770
 asked how to spawn the signs 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.899
 Also content do not have two 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.579
 play on the command uphill clique 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.050
 then I am a bit stretched here 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.000
 a bit too with the postponed 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.739
 position and in that the text can be 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.539
 I with a command in any 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.799
 insert text around me that works 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.799
 want us now step by step 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.659
 There is also work now 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.250
 here in the creative mental really only 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.479
 a step forward is basically two 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.670
 different school types in minecraft 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.320
 on the one hand, glue this to the wall 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.750
 the shield that has no foot to say 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.729
 and there is the shield once 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.259
 so to speak, has the foot and on one 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.299
 respective block on it stands between 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.920
 These two types must be in the command 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.450
 to differentiate between blog system and here 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.939
 one begins with the sign one the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.590
 foot bath that has the 63 the other 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.570
 you already know that has already shouldered 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.159
 But the 68 is all about a video 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.290
 description links yes and the shield 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.479
 we can fully implement with z block 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.189
 the respective coordinates 63 and comes 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.630
 I can play here again I can 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.420
 let's just show that now a shield 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.920
 with the metadata 6 that's over here 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.850
 45 degrees angle to our command blog 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.790
 but if we are here now for example 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.500
 one a 3 1 sets then you can see that 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.250
 shield turns a bit first 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.939
 even further and or whichever 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.649
 we use there the more specific 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.450
 Commit the position number seven 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.560
 Inserts you can see the sign will be 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.240
 On and on I think there you can 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.690
 until one day you have the game 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.790
 correct position found 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.980
 it's similar to me here with the students 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.900
 still my text later and later 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.970
 yes there simply have a zb in the 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.280
 coordinates and instead of 63 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.870
 the 68 and here again 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.210
 meta data that matters everything else 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.830
 it is not so important behind it and yes 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.350
 which can be metadata here between 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.730
 two three four and five inserts at 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.640
 all of the metadata is nonsense 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.080
 that you really have to go here 23 45 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.370
 inserts what is not why it 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.690
 begins at the zero or one white 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.820
 I'm not like that, anyway 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.170
 If I now the two sentences then 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.440
 I get a road sign indicating there off 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.030
 then the 3 1 has to stick 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.410
 that is now on one side 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.760
 because that is very tight and so on 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.510
 and so on here 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.910
 the four one will be here then 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.340
 Saved and when I bet the five 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.900
 then it would have to born in my face 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.190
 but also disappear immediately 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.440
 because there is no wall social hand where it 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.000
 then hangs and as soon as blog update 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.010
 takes place then it is removed again 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.330
 but as soon as you have a blog here 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.800
 was able to help the students 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.750
 then everything works and if you are 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.910
 the text has already been seen which 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.230
 show again separately for have 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.790
 just the normal command with 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.750
 two meters data as soon as I am 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.310
 have now, for example to get out here 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.590
 it does not work for us 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.580
 to exhaust the whole number of metadata 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.709
 if I do not use anything there 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.540
 had 0 in and we have here the 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.650
 text for the respective line you can 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.810
 from a video description 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.430
 copy and then we have here for the 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.440
 first line insert the text example 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.570
 Hello Holy Moly and my fashion is one 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.610
 Now you can already see on the sign 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.290
 Hello hello coulibaly and the text can 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.880
 I if I want or in the command 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.150
 Anyway , I could continue to 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.590
 example here is a lot of xr attach 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.300
 and now only once when now 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.800
 you can see that is not quite enough 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.850
 he really has to go now 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.860
 take care that you are not too long now 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.480
 It will be best if you do so 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.320
 the experts do not see because 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.540
 they are too long 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.130
 So the best thing is I would 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.870
 recommend if you protect here now 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.700
 prescribes and tests in front of him 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.540
 the length, so to speak, and then 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.000
 Can you do this in the commander 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.310
 use and you can here for each 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.360
 individual text parts that the next to the 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.760
 should use text everything 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.320
 would work now the text 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.239
 have wilk and want to save space 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.350
 yes, even on the line 3 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.940
 want to give up 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.729
 then I go to here now and then 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.840
 then you can already see it and then see 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.590
 it already recommends parts three 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.940
 Out 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.310
 save a bit of space if you can 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.630
 I really want to say that 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.770
 so not so much memory worth 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.419
 this is certainly sold in 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.740
 proper monument should also as far 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.330
 have been describing to a 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.250
 Last but not least there is the comedy 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.410
 also a description linked and indeed 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.090
 There was a question of men's from the bbi 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.400
 Twelve funds continue to be asked how to do it 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.419
 creates a dispens spawn yes one 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.190
 you have different orientation 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.840
 Everyone already has dispensers 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.860
 different orientation but then have 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.050
 Unfortunately, I have not found a way 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.610
 I have also with various methods 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.820
 Although searched on the internet and also with 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.950
 the netbook structure filter of camping 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.419
 Try dennis pence pores in the command 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.889
 block that has a different orientation 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.290
 Unfortunately I did not succeed and you 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.090
 the dispenser looks no matter what I am here 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.419
 insert metadata here are the rent 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.280
 i need i can test here 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.630
 millimeter data can not change 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.760
 as I would like and I have it unfortunately 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.770
 No way to find out how to do the whole thing 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.789
 team somehow different aligns like that 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.740
 works white or not and I am 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.060
 I'm relatively sure even that 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.740
 probably not yet 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.270
 dispensers in different orientation 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.470
 unfortunately it is possible for me to spawn 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.580
 wanted to have shown despite always 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.660
 but if you still have questions then 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.800
 You are also welcome to leave the comments 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.240
 ask for then you'll see that 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.770
 you have been too far 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.630
 could now learn how to get to the left 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.220
 trick gravity into minecraft 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.229
 Can or could right click for one 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.610
 Video of the challenge in which I am against 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.930
 Schalke compete in ice climbing 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.520
 however, we are also in the 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.389
 Thanks a lot for watching 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.389
 until next time
