00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
creatively as expanded with the

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.770 
creatively as expanded with the
technology<00:04:09.860> so<00:04:10.550> all<00:04:10.850> around<00:04:11.000> it's<00:04:11.360> going<00:04:11.690> to

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
technology so all around it's going to

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.590 
technology so all around it's going to
be<00:04:11.900> a<00:04:11.930> better<00:04:12.620> stronger<00:04:12.980> game<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:14.180> it's<00:04:14.330> not

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600
