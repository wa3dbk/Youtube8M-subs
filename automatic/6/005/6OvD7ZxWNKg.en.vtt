00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.219
 very good to all welcome to the first 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.110
 commented video of the channel in a video 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.570
 previous I taught how to ask for some 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.920
 Free food samples and heim that 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.869
 it was a promotion that there was that 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.730
 moment and in that video I promised 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.400
 show you in a good boxing because I already 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.560
 has arrived and here you have the shipment 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.910
 it took exactly 50 days and 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.109
 sincerely I already thought that I did not 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.820
 nothing would come but finally 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.739
 had arrived 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.810
 inside the envelope have come three 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.910
 two different samples of fresh water and 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.710
 one of marine and they have also included two 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.380
 catalogs with their products but that 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.840
 they come in German 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.700
 The first sample is 4 grams and it is 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.360
 marine and good as we see it is 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.360
 in the form of granules 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.159
 the second samples for fresh water 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.320
 they are 4 grams too and they are in the form of 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.449
 granules and of similar size to the one 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.239
 gives the prawns and finally the 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.820
 third sample is 1.6 grams comes 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.979
 in the form of flakes and with the shipment it has 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.420
 I arrived quite confused I just want 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.229
 add that I liked the food 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.729
 quite the granules is interesting 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.070
 I am amused that they are the same as 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.450
 those of prawns and flakes 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.460
 although at least chafa das has a 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.170
 texture something different than what I 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.509
 would come to be used to me 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.770
 liked but I'm going to try it 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.020
 I'm going to take some vision plans 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.020
 shrimp and let them decide if they like it 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.380
 to 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.520
 i
