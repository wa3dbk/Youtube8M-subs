does<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.010> couple<00:01:51.280> quick<00:01:51.780> tunings<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.050> away<00:01:53.229> you

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
does a couple quick tunings and away you

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.219 
does a couple quick tunings and away you
go<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.830> then<00:01:54.010> you<00:01:54.040> start<00:01:54.670> from<00:01:54.880> there<00:01:55.090> you<00:01:56.050> can

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
go and then you start from there you can

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.469 
go and then you start from there you can
go<00:01:56.350> through<00:01:56.650> take<00:01:57.340> after<00:01:57.520> Auto<00:01:57.820> EQ<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.420> you

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
go through take after Auto EQ and you

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.390 
go through take after Auto EQ and you
can<00:01:58.630> do<00:01:58.810> a<00:01:58.840> little<00:01:59.050> bit<00:01:59.140> of<00:01:59.229> extra<00:01:59.500> control<00:02:00.160> and

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
can do a little bit of extra control and

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.640 
can do a little bit of extra control and
maybe<00:02:00.910> fine-tune<00:02:01.570> what<00:02:01.600> you<00:02:01.930> got<00:02:02.140> after<00:02:02.560> the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
maybe fine-tune what you got after the

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.249 
maybe fine-tune what you got after the
auto<00:02:02.830> it's<00:02:03.700> got<00:02:03.850> a<00:02:03.880> FS<00:02:04.330> automatic<00:02:04.990> feedback

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
auto it's got a FS automatic feedback

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.170 
auto it's got a FS automatic feedback
suppression<00:02:05.950> as<00:02:06.070> you<00:02:06.520> can<00:02:06.670> see<00:02:06.820> here<00:02:07.000> there's

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
suppression as you can see here there's

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.400 
suppression as you can see here there's
a<00:02:07.240> couple<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.600> different<00:02:07.869> modes<00:02:08.050> there's<00:02:08.350> a

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
a couple of different modes there's a

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.680 
a couple of different modes there's a
live<00:02:08.649> mode<00:02:08.950> where<00:02:09.160> it<00:02:09.250> actually<00:02:09.399> uses<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.360> RTA

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
live mode where it actually uses the RTA

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.480 
live mode where it actually uses the RTA
mic<00:02:10.990> that's<00:02:11.200> connected<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:11.770> it<00:02:11.860> listens<00:02:12.340> to

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
mic that's connected and it listens to

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.650 
mic that's connected and it listens to
the<00:02:12.580> frequencies<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.090> are<00:02:13.240> in<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.450> room

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
the frequencies that are in the room

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.580 
the frequencies that are in the room
it's<00:02:14.530> got<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.709> real<00:02:14.980> high<00:02:15.250> level<00:02:15.640> of<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.380> notch

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
it's got a real high level of of a notch

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.350 
it's got a real high level of of a notch
where<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.040> will<00:02:18.190> pick<00:02:18.670> those<00:02:18.850> specifically

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
where it will pick those specifically

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.720 
where it will pick those specifically
spiked<00:02:20.200> frequencies<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.340> will<00:02:21.459> cut<00:02:21.580> those

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
spiked frequencies and it will cut those

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.310 
spiked frequencies and it will cut those
out<00:02:21.910> eliminating<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.630> feedback<00:02:22.989> that<00:02:23.170> are<00:02:23.230> on

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
out eliminating the feedback that are on

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.410 
out eliminating the feedback that are on
those<00:02:23.410> channels<00:02:23.709> or<00:02:24.430> then<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.820> can<00:02:24.940> also<00:02:25.090> have

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
those channels or then you can also have

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.140 
those channels or then you can also have
fixed<00:02:26.260> mode<00:02:26.470> where<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.550> will<00:02:27.580> automatically

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
fixed mode where it will automatically

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.699 
fixed mode where it will automatically
notch<00:02:28.480> out<00:02:28.920> those<00:02:29.920> certain<00:02:30.190> frequencies<00:02:31.709> sub

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
notch out those certain frequencies sub

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.560 
notch out those certain frequencies sub
harmonic<00:02:33.100> synthesis<00:02:33.580> this<00:02:33.880> has<00:02:34.030> been

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
harmonic synthesis this has been

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.270 
harmonic synthesis this has been
standard<00:02:34.750> on<00:02:35.050> all<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.440> dbx<00:02:35.860> drive<00:02:36.220> racks

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
standard on all of the dbx drive racks

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.620 
standard on all of the dbx drive racks
so<00:02:39.280> here's<00:02:39.459> a<00:02:39.519> compressor<00:02:40.000> again<00:02:40.209> it's<00:02:40.480> a

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
so here's a compressor again it's a

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.960 
so here's a compressor again it's a
graphic<00:02:41.410> compressor<00:02:41.860> there's<00:02:42.040> no<00:02:42.220> audio

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
graphic compressor there's no audio

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.880 
graphic compressor there's no audio
coming<00:02:43.390> through<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.750> drive<00:02:43.959> rack<00:02:44.200> PA<00:02:44.440> 2<00:02:44.530> right

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
coming through the drive rack PA 2 right

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.410 
coming through the drive rack PA 2 right
now<00:02:45.070> so<00:02:45.280> you're<00:02:45.790> not<00:02:45.910> seeing<00:02:46.209> anything

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
now so you're not seeing anything

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.509 
now so you're not seeing anything
happening<00:02:47.049> on<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.200> screen<00:02:47.320> but<00:02:47.650> you<00:02:47.920> can<00:02:48.250> see

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
happening on the screen but you can see

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.930 
happening on the screen but you can see
there's

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.610 

so<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.000> have<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.210> graphic<00:02:54.660> representation<00:02:55.440> of

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
so you have a graphic representation of

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.970 
so you have a graphic representation of
that<00:02:55.730> compressor<00:02:56.730> actually<00:02:57.180> functioning<00:02:57.980> and

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
that compressor actually functioning and

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.910 
that compressor actually functioning and
then<00:02:59.850> alignment<00:03:00.270> pre-delay<00:03:00.720> on<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.410> input

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
then alignment pre-delay on the input

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.510 
then alignment pre-delay on the input
stage<00:03:02.190> where<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.060> can<00:03:03.210> set<00:03:03.480> time<00:03:04.020> alignment

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
stage where you can set time alignment

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.950 
stage where you can set time alignment
on<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.580> input<00:03:06.030> side<00:03:06.240> and<00:03:06.270> that<00:03:06.600> can<00:03:06.720> also<00:03:06.840> be

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
on the input side and that can also be

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.790 
on the input side and that can also be
adjusted<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.840> three<00:03:09.840> sets<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.200> stereo<00:03:10.590> out

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
adjusted on the three sets of stereo out

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.220 
adjusted on the three sets of stereo out
so<00:03:11.160> it's<00:03:11.670> two<00:03:11.970> in<00:03:12.180> three<00:03:12.750> out<00:03:12.960> in<00:03:13.140> the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
so it's two in three out in the

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.690 
so it's two in three out in the
configuration<00:03:13.710> that<00:03:13.950> it's<00:03:14.070> set<00:03:14.250> in<00:03:14.370> right<00:03:14.520> now

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
configuration that it's set in right now

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.740 
configuration that it's set in right now
you've<00:03:15.540> got<00:03:15.570> your<00:03:15.810> crossover<00:03:16.200> point<00:03:17.630> lots<00:03:18.630> of

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
you've got your crossover point lots of

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.800 
you've got your crossover point lots of
different<00:03:19.110> crossovers<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.130> are<00:03:20.600> loaded<00:03:21.600> in

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
different crossovers that are loaded in

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.150 
different crossovers that are loaded in
there<00:03:21.930> as<00:03:22.020> presets<00:03:22.380> butterworth<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:23.070> then

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
there as presets butterworth and then

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.030 
there as presets butterworth and then
link<00:03:23.340> betrayal<00:03:23.670> ease<00:03:24.080> and<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.290> can<00:03:25.440> grab<00:03:25.860> the

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
link betrayal ease and you can grab the

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.570 
link betrayal ease and you can grab the
low<00:03:26.160> frequency<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:28.620> change<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.130> low<00:03:29.310> pass

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
low frequency and change that low pass

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
low frequency and change that low pass
point<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:32.760> can<00:03:32.910> see<00:03:33.060> those<00:03:33.180> graphic

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
point and you can see those graphic

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.060 
point and you can see those graphic
representation<00:03:34.350> of<00:03:34.470> everything<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.950> can

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
representation of everything you can

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.240 
representation of everything you can
change<00:03:35.310> amplitude<00:03:36.300> or<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:37.020> volume<00:03:37.920> for<00:03:38.130> each

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
change amplitude or the volume for each

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.420 
change amplitude or the volume for each
one<00:03:38.490> of<00:03:38.580> those<00:03:38.700> as<00:03:38.880> well

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.940 

so<00:03:44.000> lots<00:03:44.390> of<00:03:44.540> control<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.200> then<00:03:45.349> that<00:03:45.500> graphic

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
so lots of control and then that graphic

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.069 
so lots of control and then that graphic
representation<00:03:46.670> makes<00:03:46.849> it<00:03:46.970> very<00:03:47.090> easy<00:03:47.209> to

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
representation makes it very easy to

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.350 
representation makes it very easy to

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
and make sure that the speakers that you

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.650 
and make sure that the speakers that you
purchased<00:04:16.520> sound<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:17.180> best<00:04:17.390> that<00:04:17.570> they

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
purchased sound the best that they

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.610 
purchased sound the best that they
possibly<00:04:17.690> can

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
possibly can

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.440 
possibly can
it's<00:04:19.040> got<00:04:19.220> limiter<00:04:19.580> again<00:04:19.910> it's<00:04:20.030> not<00:04:20.180> doing

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
it's got limiter again it's not doing

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.910 
it's got limiter again it's not doing
anything<00:04:20.570> if<00:04:20.840> there's<00:04:21.050> no<00:04:21.110> audio<00:04:21.500> passing

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
anything if there's no audio passing

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.130 
anything if there's no audio passing
through<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.190> PA<00:04:22.400> -<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:22.910> then<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.690> alignment

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
through the PA - and then the alignment

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.840 
through the PA - and then the alignment
delay<00:04:24.320> and<00:04:24.560> this<00:04:24.650> is<00:04:24.830> really<00:04:25.130> cool<00:04:25.310> so<00:04:25.760> if

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
delay and this is really cool so if

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.510 
delay and this is really cool so if
you're<00:04:25.940> in<00:04:26.030> a<00:04:26.090> situation<00:04:26.660> where<00:04:26.870> your<00:04:27.650> tops

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
you're in a situation where your tops

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.180 
you're in a situation where your tops
are<00:04:28.970> out<00:04:29.780> front<00:04:30.170> of<00:04:30.320> it<00:04:30.440> and<00:04:30.620> you<00:04:30.740> can<00:04:30.860> see<00:04:31.010> here

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
are out front of it and you can see here

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.830 
are out front of it and you can see here
you<00:04:31.310> can<00:04:31.340> either<00:04:31.520> do<00:04:31.910> it<00:04:31.940> in<00:04:32.060> milliseconds<00:04:32.690> if

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
you can either do it in milliseconds if

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.290 
you can either do it in milliseconds if
you<00:04:33.080> are<00:04:33.260> a<00:04:33.290> math<00:04:33.530> wizard<00:04:33.800> or<00:04:34.430> feet<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:35.120> meters

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
you are a math wizard or feet and meters

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.450 
you are a math wizard or feet and meters
so<00:04:36.020> if<00:04:36.170> your<00:04:36.350> tops<00:04:36.770> are<00:04:36.980> out<00:04:37.100> on<00:04:37.250> tripods<00:04:39.460> out

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
so if your tops are out on tripods out

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.980 
so if your tops are out on tripods out
in<00:04:40.640> front<00:04:40.880> of<00:04:40.970> you<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.240> then<00:04:41.390> your<00:04:41.540> sub<00:04:41.810> is

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
in front of you and then your sub is

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.050 
in front of you and then your sub is
back<00:04:42.170> under<00:04:42.410> your<00:04:42.530> table<00:04:42.860> you<00:04:43.370> can<00:04:43.520> actually

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
back under your table you can actually

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.420 
back under your table you can actually
use<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:44.480> drive<00:04:44.720> rack<00:04:44.960> enable<00:04:45.470> these<00:04:45.620> and<00:04:45.890> then

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
use the drive rack enable these and then

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.370 
use the drive rack enable these and then
you<00:04:46.460> can<00:04:46.700> time<00:04:47.060> align<00:04:47.420> to<00:04:47.750> make<00:04:47.930> sure<00:04:48.170> that

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
you can time align to make sure that

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.620 
you can time align to make sure that
when<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:48.740> sound<00:04:49.130> reaches<00:04:49.970> your<00:04:50.120> audience<00:04:50.480> or

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
when the sound reaches your audience or

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.450 
when the sound reaches your audience or
reaches<00:04:50.900> your<00:04:50.990> target<00:04:51.380> destination<00:04:51.620> that

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
reaches your target destination that

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.160 
reaches your target destination that
everything<00:04:52.820> is<00:04:52.940> time<00:04:53.210> aligned<00:04:53.510> and<00:04:53.780> it<00:04:53.900> gets

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
everything is time aligned and it gets

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.760 
everything is time aligned and it gets
to<00:04:54.350> the<00:04:54.470> video<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.760> audience<00:04:56.450> at<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.590> same
