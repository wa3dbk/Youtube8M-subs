00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.550
 the alvinegra nation is alright we are 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.230
 here in the Corinthians arena we are 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.300
 Talking here, let's talk right. 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.610
 Julian marks and will explain news 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.130
 we have today that machine 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.230
 Hi, how are you? 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.140
 explains the Corinthian fan because with 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.020
 sure a fan that vibrates a lot jumps 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.510
 a lot does not have everything to do with this machine 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.579
 this machine that is happening here 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.610
 test question saying that this mark 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.410
 what is doing is good is she doing 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.170
 a dynamic test and forced vibration is 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.670
 this machine is one is the main part of the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.059
 required 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.540
 when it causes it is vibrations in the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.180
 bleach-like bleachers and 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.209
 a crowd that crowds the stadium 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.600
 of corinthians will cause vibrations 

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:12.329
 that the TV machine produced already has it 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.459
 is a test of how many fans - 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:17.159
 daniel and she is being made in the sector 

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:19.590
 energy produced by it in terms of 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.450
 of vibrations is similar to the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.859
 of the sector that is of 5 thousand people 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.579
 Tell us, can you come near? 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:30.240
 do that cup there represent 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:31.590
 it is working through a 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.200
 vibration there 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.840
 the water practically does not move it in the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.060
 stop time as she was 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.619
 fueling generator has now begun to 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.950
 but still at a very high level. 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.869
 down and there we see that heart 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.200
 It has started a movement but realizes 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.270
 It's still good, this is very cool. 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.189
 Thank you for this milestone to talk to 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.690
 agents for this the profile of consumption 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.560
 red 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.560
 the move 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.150
 Oh well, we can see through the sea that 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.520
 explaining the machine there about the 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.390
 Tests performed with the vibration of 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.390
 flat fan 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.930
 and this is a novelty we had there today in 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.930
 sand corinthians 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.470
 hence also check here 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:40.100
 a novelty a good hug 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:45.540
 save the radisson victory to smile 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.520
 You are the pride of the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.940
 Brazil 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.940
 I
