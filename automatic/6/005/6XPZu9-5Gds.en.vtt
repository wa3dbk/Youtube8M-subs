00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.810 
kind of signify that you had to utilize
the<00:06:29.800> ocarina<00:06:30.220> at<00:06:30.280> that<00:06:30.430> point

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820 
the ocarina at that point

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.490 
the ocarina at that point
oh<00:06:30.990> that's<00:06:31.990> horrifying<00:06:32.520> yeah<00:06:33.520> and<00:06:33.820> I<00:06:33.970> think

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
oh that's horrifying yeah and I think

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.050 
oh that's horrifying yeah and I think
what<00:06:35.500> the<00:06:35.650> main<00:06:35.830> thing<00:06:36.099> was<00:06:36.340> is<00:06:36.759> you<00:06:36.940> would

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060 
what the main thing was is you would

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.790 
what the main thing was is you would
stand<00:06:37.270> on<00:06:37.449> that<00:06:37.630> pedestal<00:06:37.900> play<00:06:38.349> the<00:06:38.530> flute

stand on that pedestal play the flute
and<00:06:39.750> it<00:06:40.750> would<00:06:41.319> engage<00:06:42.070> the<00:06:42.340> entire<00:06:42.400> world<00:06:42.909> in
