00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
so we need to create some more extras

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.899 
so we need to create some more extras
and<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:19.619> addition<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.220> we<00:01:20.430> need<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.610> make

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
and in addition to that we need to make

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.030 
and in addition to that we need to make
some<00:01:21.150> animation<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:22.080> those<00:01:22.290> extras<00:01:22.770> and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
these are both things that despite the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.340 
these are both things that despite the
team<00:01:26.130> continually<00:01:27.030> crowing<00:01:27.659> we<00:01:27.930> still<00:01:28.140> don't

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
team continually crowing we still don't

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.609 
team continually crowing we still don't
have<00:01:28.409> time<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:29.390> so<00:01:30.390> very<00:01:30.689> much<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.409> mean

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
have time for so very much so I mean

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.870 
have time for so very much so I mean
there's<00:01:31.860> two<00:01:32.070> aspects<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.610> they<00:01:32.729> will<00:01:32.790> be

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
there's two aspects to it they will be

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.569 
there's two aspects to it they will be
happening<00:01:33.119> simultaneously<00:01:33.390> which<00:01:34.200> is

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
happening simultaneously which is

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.590 
happening simultaneously which is
creating<00:01:35.579> some<00:01:35.790> more<00:01:35.909> extras<00:01:36.270> maybe<00:01:36.479> we

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
creating some more extras maybe we

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.120 
creating some more extras maybe we
should<00:01:36.750> split<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.049> up<00:01:37.460> no<00:01:38.460> now<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.619> then<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
should split it up no now and then the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.429 
should split it up no now and then the
other<00:01:41.310> part<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.850> animating<00:01:42.720> them<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:42.930> if

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
other part is animating them so if

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.050 
other part is animating them so if
making<00:01:43.649> some<00:01:44.009> more<00:01:44.220> animations<00:01:44.729> for<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
making some more animations for the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.179 
making some more animations for the
extras<00:01:45.299> like<00:01:45.420> walking<00:01:45.780> around<00:01:45.869> or<00:01:46.500> showing

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
extras like walking around or showing

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.020

much freedom as you want to I mean if we
get<00:01:57.960> like<00:01:58.079> 10,000<00:01:58.680> walk<00:01:58.799> cycles<00:01:59.159> it's<00:01:59.280> not

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
get like 10,000 walk cycles it's not

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.800 
get like 10,000 walk cycles it's not
getting<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.700> useful<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.090> actually<00:02:00.329> more

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
getting that useful so actually more

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.120 
getting that useful so actually more
creative<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.259> be<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.860> know<00:02:01.920> probably

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
creative you can be you know probably

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.770 
creative you can be you know probably
the<00:02:02.310> better<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.790> more<00:02:02.939> stuff<00:02:03.180> we<00:02:03.479> want<00:02:03.570> some

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
the better the more stuff we want some

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.570 
the better the more stuff we want some
walk<00:02:03.960> cycles<00:02:04.350> but<00:02:04.560> yeah<00:02:04.890> definitely

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
walk cycles but yeah definitely

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.210 
walk cycles but yeah definitely
but<00:02:05.970> yeah<00:02:06.150> just<00:02:06.570> be<00:02:06.720> fun<00:02:06.960> make<00:02:07.440> whatever<00:02:07.740> crazy

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
but yeah just be fun make whatever crazy

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.510 
but yeah just be fun make whatever crazy
animations<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.910> want<00:02:09.090> some<00:02:09.619> thank<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.680> I<00:02:11.070> was

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
animations you want some thank you I was

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.970 
animations you want some thank you I was
thinking<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.850> we<00:02:11.970> could<00:02:12.000> basically<00:02:12.300> start

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
thinking that we could basically start

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.820 
thinking that we could basically start
was<00:02:13.980> around<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.910> same<00:02:14.970> time<00:02:15.150> as<00:02:15.660> last<00:02:15.830> sprint

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
was around the same time as last sprint

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.330 
was around the same time as last sprint
which<00:02:17.340> was<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.550> think<00:02:17.760> one<00:02:18.330> or<00:02:18.510> two<00:02:18.740> p.m.<00:02:19.740> our

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
which was I think one or two p.m. our

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.480 
which was I think one or two p.m. our
time<00:02:20.400> on<00:02:20.790> saturday<00:02:21.290> but<00:02:22.290> instead<00:02:22.710> of<00:02:22.860> limiting

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
time on saturday but instead of limiting

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.510 
time on saturday but instead of limiting
it<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:23.970> an<00:02:24.360> eight<00:02:24.540> hour<00:02:24.720> thing<00:02:25.250> we<00:02:26.250> could<00:02:26.370> just

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
it to an eight hour thing we could just

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.710 
it to an eight hour thing we could just
gonna<00:02:26.700> make<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.880> whole<00:02:27.060> week's<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.330> long<00:02:27.420> time

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
gonna make a whole week's a long time

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.350 
gonna make a whole week's a long time
yeah<00:02:28.110> animation<00:02:28.710> is<00:02:28.830> time<00:02:29.580> consuming<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:30.060> its

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
yeah animation is time consuming so its

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.820 
yeah animation is time consuming so its
modeling<00:02:30.660> actually<00:02:35.450> so<00:02:36.450> will<00:02:37.020> be<00:02:37.260> popping<00:02:37.560> in

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
modeling actually so will be popping in

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.610 
modeling actually so will be popping in
and<00:02:38.100> out<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:39.350> of<00:02:40.400> IRC<00:02:42.260> all<00:02:43.260> throughout<00:02:43.560> the
