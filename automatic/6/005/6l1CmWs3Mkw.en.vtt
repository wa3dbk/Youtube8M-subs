00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.630
 finances health in private 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.630
 today we will see how to launch a 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.550
 stone in leather for a pendant first 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.160
 We passed the chosen design to the skin with 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.750
 an opener or similar by pressure in this 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.750
 case say salty grafts 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.170
 Second, we cut the motives 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.730
 with a scalpel or blade always 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.350
 trying to make the cut as much as possible 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.350
 strong in drawing possible to the skin 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.100
 after having the two pieces 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.840
 climbs we adapt them to the skin in 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.330
 this case we help with tail of 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.950
 contact since the skin is a nurse 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.950
 oiled and admits few scares 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.450
 we cut the piece with a shape 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.620
 circular and we make the holes 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.620
 necessary for sewing 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.670
 and there is already a house on the corner where 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.670
 they are going to give 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.420
 and finally we only have to sew and 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.140
 We use the Spanish point to finish 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.140
 well the edges 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.040
 I burned myself
