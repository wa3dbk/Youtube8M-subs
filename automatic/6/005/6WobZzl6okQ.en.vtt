00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.680
 First of all tell me from the basics of Dengeki Bunko fighting climax 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.810
 Please give me 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:23.760
 ok Well, first of all, it's from the selection of characters 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:27.530
 I wonder if trying to anyone I choose the character to operate by moving the cursor in the First lever 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.530
 When decided, it decides with the button 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:35.390
 So N'until the difference is this time 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.390
 Next, choose a character that will support battle 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:51.430
 To start like partner So what scared rail Not what to you this in the game 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.430
 Then let's look at the basic operation of the character 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.859
 Advanced N and defeat before the Everglades 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.090
 It will take turns when defeated behind 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:17.050
 When put on the lever on Jan' 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.050
 If you put it diagonally, you can do it well forward and backward. 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.500
 And before twice quickly Taut dash 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.310
 You can take a distance in the back step if you knock it back twice quickly 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.590
 The following is Tougeki - Super Battle Opera ne 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.590
 Ugh quick's Koihi in a button 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.270
 It looks different with 3 fireflies 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.960
 Sakai-machi attack on the mountain 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:56.740
 Even in character squat the state and put the lever down 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.740
 We can play the brain play of each weak middle strong 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.670
 If you're jumping while you're jumping, you'll be able to attack 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.670
 Hmm 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:27.610
 While pushing down the lever in the designed state 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.610
 c It becomes a throwing attack with the button 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:37.000
 If you hit the lever back, you can guard the opponent's attack 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:41.580
 It will be an important operation to prevent damage 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.580
 The squatting attack is adopted by the person hunting guard 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:51.060
 How do you call land support characters 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.510
 You can call it press the support button 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:59.520
 Mainly defensive support with only the support button 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:03.180
 Us to the main aggressive support that it while down in front of the lever 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.650
 Because it helps a lot according to the chosen character and does a code 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.650
 Let's find morning character for yourself 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.590
 Let's try a quick combination of this game 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.590
 Hmm 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.340
 Isn't this flashy skill difficult ? 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:27.420
 There is no such thing 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.340
 This quick combination is triggered only by linking English words 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.530
 half way 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.480
 me 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.590
 Think also deaf at the beginning 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.810
 It is 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.030
 The Swiss combination can be triggered even from squatting attacks 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:47.960
 Ne Please be stuffy even in such a situation 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:54.140
 Out the combination attack and press to pop Ponpon and order me abc to other 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:56.510
 The combination law is also true from the squat state 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:01.020
 Basic operation is abnormal 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:05.810
 You may not be able to learn at once, but you should be able to wear it right away 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:10.420
 I have enough fight waiting hopefully for the time being only this 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.420
 I try for the first time in humans First Play
