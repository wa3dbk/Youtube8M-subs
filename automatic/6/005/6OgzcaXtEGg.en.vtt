00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.640
 who killed her 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.020
 the small wifi antennas because the map has 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.380
 wifi 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.320
 the 13 salsa cable sites 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.310
 we like or we like 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.320
 right here 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.360
 the receiver 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.360
 morn in debt 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.700
 and finally different tracks the installation 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.070
 that's basically going on right after the motherboard here we are 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.980
 now above our motherboard motherboard who was 17 years old 17 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.160
 cents for a hand is a little bigger 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.360
 on this motherboard we can not find a 24-pin connector twice 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.270
 by m adorned with gold to deport two usb 3 ports at the front of the case 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.530
 gold harper for 2 usb 2 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.370
 on the back of the case this time

 115 as well as the pine quest connector for the cpu 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.980
 to beaublanc too different connectors for me 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.410
 for levy power debt also the same hotel a habit 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.819
 800 shields 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.400
 here the wifi card in just with his two grandchildren who leave the father 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:30.000
 the antennas the two ports ddr3 3 1866 megahertz years wish it does it 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:31.179
 to fear 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:36.419
 the pci port express 16x not the standard two points 0 other connectors for 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:38.429
 different features 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:42.259
 we now go to the back story to discover the connectivity 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:46.659
 who come to us with aps two men two usb of points 0 by a 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:47.679
 eternal thousand 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:48.999
 since May 6 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:54.269
 three points 0 worries biosynex or in plain words what do you want the 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.389
 everything rings two zero point players new signs from him 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:02.949
 a device for pear related antennas wifi a crime an exit 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:07.229
 optic a hdmi output of a displayport output p the bottom in five points 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:10.859
 between the analog for now we could read from this motherboard 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:15.409
 for the outline of a motherboard that will be proposed by his lawyer 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.999
 too much 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.699
 which could be added because at six at least 8 with rates that are more 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:20.040
 early 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.940
 acceptable especially if we are only 10 gigas ddr3 in urban buses on a 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.830
 machine that will ask about 250 euros 270 euros is almost 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.910
 complete and therefore more than a small hard drive we will finish as always 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.919
 with a turn a little closer 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.579
 different components history that you can appreciate 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.089
 in more detail the motherboard and that its various components 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:45.129
 with the radiator 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.959
 the different connectors sata the wifi card 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.659
 the carpet placed underneath 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.319
 pigs ddr3 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.759
 the quest ceo 

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:55.989
 fm 1 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.320
 the gold port 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.659
 pci express 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.429
 think about it 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:02.249
 the different connectors 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:05.249
 rear panel 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:08.529
 and we will finish as always with 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:11.779
 a close up on the reference of this model 

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:14.779
 See you soon for a new video presentation 

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:16.459
