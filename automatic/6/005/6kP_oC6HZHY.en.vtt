00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
 Good day today I'll show you how to do it 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.840
 tie in twinity tie knot 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:15.750
 first fold your collar 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:20.880
 Put your tie on the top 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.680
 right place so that's enough 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.449
 fabric have to form around the knot 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.010
 can 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.470
 do not hesitate to do this several times 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.050
 Try to start the broad 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.160
 long to come together and music 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.420
 to place under her neck 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.730
 now join in with the narrow one 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.500
 a simple bend and pull it 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:52.730
 then behind him through the knot 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:52.730
 once over then back through again 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.130
 because once around the knot 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.220
 and again through the upper loop 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:17.920
 then they lead the narrow one 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.920
 partly through this loop 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:43.229
 and then you put in the narrow one 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.550
 behind the wide ones they let in 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.740
 you can take a seat 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.350
 not too tight for now is the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.009
 narrow part through this upper bend 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.009
 passed 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.710
 so they contain this tripartite 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:17.120
 typical shape of the knot they are now 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:19.489
 Trace something else can lead to it 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.100
 you now the narrow part behind the 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:33.760
 neck sleep through and in this 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:33.760
 finished down so straight down 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.910
 so now you can knot a trinity 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.910
 tie
