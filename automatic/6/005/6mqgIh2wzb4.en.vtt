00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
up i'll have to put a to put this one on

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.160 
up i'll have to put a to put this one on
here<00:00:22.890> tied<00:00:23.550> up<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.090> then<00:00:24.210> continue<00:00:24.689> layer<00:00:24.930> by

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
here tied up and then continue layer by

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.320 
here tied up and then continue layer by
layer<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:26.070> going<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.279> look<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.580> lot<00:00:26.760> like<00:00:26.820> this

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
layer it's going to look a lot like this

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.509 
layer it's going to look a lot like this
one<00:00:27.570> but<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> reason<00:00:28.830> why<00:00:29.070> i<00:00:29.099> didn't<00:00:29.400> like

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
one but the reason why i didn't like

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.189 
one but the reason why i didn't like
this<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:29.789> as<00:00:30.090> much<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.539> because<00:00:30.720> it's<00:00:30.929> left

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
this one as much is because it's left

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.979 
this one as much is because it's left
too<00:00:31.740> big<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.309> gaps<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:33.000> between<00:00:33.030> here<00:00:33.570> i<00:00:33.600> try<00:00:33.930> to

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
too big of gaps in between here i try to

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.290 
too big of gaps in between here i try to
even<00:00:34.200> cutting<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.649> down<00:00:34.730> but<00:00:35.730> i<00:00:35.760> still<00:00:36.030> didn't

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
even cutting it down but i still didn't

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.030 
even cutting it down but i still didn't
like<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.020> I'm<00:00:37.350> going<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.530> start<00:00:37.649> off<00:00:37.980> with

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
like it so I'm going to start off with

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.420 
like it so I'm going to start off with
smaller<00:00:38.640> diameter<00:00:39.649> ones<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.920> see<00:00:41.070> how<00:00:41.219> this

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
smaller diameter ones and see how this

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.630 
smaller diameter ones and see how this
works<00:00:41.670> out<00:00:42.710> I'll<00:00:43.710> update<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.250> as<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
works out I'll update you as the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.720 
works out I'll update you as the
progress<00:00:45.059> goes<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:46.280> decided<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.520> use<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
progress goes I decided to use the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.810 
progress goes I decided to use the
bottom<00:00:48.329> portion<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.350> basket<00:00:49.829> had<00:00:50.610> already

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
bottom portion of the basket had already

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.660 
bottom portion of the basket had already
worked<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.739> put<00:00:52.920> way<00:00:53.100> too<00:00:53.129> much<00:00:53.309> work

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
worked on I just put way too much work

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.779 
worked on I just put way too much work
and<00:00:53.910> notching<00:00:54.539> out<00:00:54.660> all<00:00:54.870> everything<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.190> I

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
and notching out all everything so I

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.599 
and notching out all everything so I
went<00:00:57.360> ahead<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.690> took<00:00:58.289> some<00:00:59.420> twine<00:01:00.420> and

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
went ahead and took some twine and

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.789 
went ahead and took some twine and
compressed<00:01:02.609> those<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.629> take<00:01:03.930> away<00:01:04.199> any<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
compressed those to take away any of the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.000 
compressed those to take away any of the
gaps<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.790> there<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.299> that'll<00:01:06.570> work<00:01:06.689> out<00:01:06.930> well<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
gaps in there so that'll work out well a

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.950 
gaps in there so that'll work out well a
lot<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.060> tight<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.630> got<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.869> use

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
lot of it's so tight that I got to use

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.060 
lot of it's so tight that I got to use
this<00:01:10.110> bone<00:01:10.380> all<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.010> made<00:01:12.590> but<00:01:13.590> i'll<00:01:13.799> give

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
this bone all that I made but i'll give

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.780 
this bone all that I made but i'll give
you<00:01:14.189> an<00:01:14.310> update<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.700> little<00:01:15.060> bit<00:01:15.210> later<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.540> that

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
you an update a little bit later on that

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:24.680 
you an update a little bit later on that
got<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> little<00:01:18.030> more<00:01:18.270> progress<00:01:18.810> here

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.260 

a<00:01:26.510> little<00:01:27.510> more<00:01:27.690> progress<00:01:28.730> this<00:01:29.730> is<00:01:29.910> becoming

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
a little more progress this is becoming

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.200 
a little more progress this is becoming
rather<00:01:30.750> tedious<00:01:31.200> but<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:32.880> want<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.090> get

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
rather tedious but you want to get

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.790 
rather tedious but you want to get
primitive<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.870> guess<00:01:34.050> that's<00:01:34.290> what<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.590> got<00:01:34.770> to

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
primitive I guess that's what you got to

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.330 
primitive I guess that's what you got to
do<00:01:35.900> okay<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.930> got<00:01:37.350> everything<00:01:37.830> shored<00:01:38.190> up

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
do okay I got everything shored up

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.820 
do okay I got everything shored up
pretty<00:01:38.970> good<00:01:39.210> I've<00:01:40.020> been<00:01:40.170> working<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.620> this

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
pretty good I've been working on this

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.970 
pretty good I've been working on this
off<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.340> for<00:01:41.370> a<00:01:41.670> couple<00:01:41.730> days<00:01:42.410> as<00:01:43.410> you<00:01:43.830> can

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
off and on for a couple days as you can

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.510 
off and on for a couple days as you can
see<00:01:44.280> there's<00:01:44.970> not<00:01:45.120> really<00:01:45.300> any<00:01:45.600> room<00:01:46.140> for

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
see there's not really any room for

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.520 
see there's not really any room for
maybe<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.610> squirrel<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.420> get<00:01:48.570> out<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:52.350> only

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
maybe a squirrel to get out the only

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.400 
maybe a squirrel to get out the only
thing<00:01:52.740> left<00:01:53.010> to<00:01:53.190> do<00:01:53.370> is<00:01:53.400> to<00:01:53.910> put<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> top<00:01:55.170> on

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
thing left to do is to put the top on

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.070 
thing left to do is to put the top on
and<00:01:56.160> i'm<00:01:56.640> going<00:01:56.760> to<00:01:56.820> use<00:01:57.000> larger<00:01:57.570> sticks<00:01:57.900> for

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
and i'm going to use larger sticks for

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.200 
and i'm going to use larger sticks for
that<00:01:58.260> I'll<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.740> place<00:01:59.010> them<00:01:59.220> in<00:01:59.550> order<00:01:59.880> side

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
that I'll just place them in order side

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.770 
that I'll just place them in order side
by<00:02:00.420> side<00:02:01.760> so<00:02:02.760> I'm<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.210> work<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.570> that

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
by side so I'm going to work on that

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.190 
by side so I'm going to work on that
right<00:02:04.080> now<00:02:04.820> well<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.850> got<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.300> last<00:02:06.510> little<00:02:06.870> bit

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
right now well I got the last little bit

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.160 
right now well I got the last little bit
i<00:02:07.530> got<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.860> top<00:02:08.100> on<00:02:08.310> now<00:02:08.880> i<00:02:08.910> got<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.179> just<00:02:09.420> throw

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
i got the top on now i got to just throw

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.700 
i got the top on now i got to just throw
a<00:02:10.200> couple<00:02:10.470> zigzags<00:02:11.130> in<00:02:11.910> here<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:13.020> make<00:02:13.680> a

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
a couple zigzags in here to make a

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.320 
a couple zigzags in here to make a
little<00:02:14.040> more<00:02:14.130> structurally<00:02:14.760> sound<00:02:14.970> so<00:02:15.240> they

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
little more structurally sound so they

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.220 
little more structurally sound so they
can't<00:02:15.570> move<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.930> around<00:02:17.060> then<00:02:18.060> go<00:02:18.630> finish<00:02:19.020> some

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
can't move it around then go finish some

worked<00:02:44.130> out<00:02:44.370> good<00:02:44.640> primitive<00:02:45.600> that's<00:02:46.050> what<00:02:46.260> it

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380
