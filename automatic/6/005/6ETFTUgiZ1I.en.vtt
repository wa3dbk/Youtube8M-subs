00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.119
 would like to transport some luggage 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.609
 unfortunately, with a very 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.029
 clear model offer satisfied 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.310
 give 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.320
 many fans are just clones of 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.659
 eponymous transporter and this 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.650
 then spray more commercial vehicle charms 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:34.810
 as a car flair 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.399
 not so at the citroën jumpy partie space 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.329
 Although he has his roots in the 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.100
 transport essential 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.620
 but citroën has the bow of 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.990
 transporter to the family van well curious 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.970
 the whole vehicle shines in one 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.970
 trendy metallic paint 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.440
 At the front, the big ones dominate 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.440
 headlights with the fog lights 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.230
 the huge radiator grille makes for a 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.900
 good air intake the height of the johnny 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.750
 German is a meter 98 its 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.910
 length of five meters 13 does not help 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.470
 just when parking the windshield 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.000
 and the fully glazed sliding doors 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.000
 let a lot of light inside 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.299
 Overall, the citroën jumpy makes one 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.790
 very good impression the chassis is 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.770
 a little soft but not too spongy one 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.580
 flaws may be a bit loose 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.159
 armrests 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.350
 his steering is precise and keeps that 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.899
 quite big vehicle safely in the lane 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.290

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.380
 what disturb when entering or leaving 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.840
 Could it be a little bit easier to get in 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.840
 and 50 cm have to be overcome 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.660
 our tested model comes with the 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.170

 Loading volume of almost 4000 liters that 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.480
 Already enough for a middle move 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.090
 however, the sentences are relatively heavy 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.330
 what the removal and installation not easy 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.330

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.310
 mix of different plastics 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.920
 The fittings are simple but 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.920
 arranged in a functional and clear way 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.709
