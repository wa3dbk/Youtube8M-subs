it's not Brett Connolly maybe it's a

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.029 
it's not Brett Connolly maybe it's a
veteran<00:00:44.109> right<00:00:44.289> but<00:00:44.440> you<00:00:44.530> go<00:00:44.680> out<00:00:44.769> there<00:00:44.980> and

doesn't play that well well the guys

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.420 
doesn't play that well well the guys
still<00:01:39.909> a<00:01:39.939> sixth<00:01:40.780> overall<00:01:41.079> pick<00:01:41.380> from<00:01:41.530> 2010

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
still a sixth overall pick from 2010

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.069 
still a sixth overall pick from 2010
right<00:01:42.670> so<00:01:42.850> there's<00:01:43.240> still<00:01:43.479> some<00:01:43.659> building<00:01:43.990> to

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
right so there's still some building to

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.319 
right so there's still some building to
do<00:01:44.200> there<00:01:44.409> and<00:01:44.590> he<00:01:44.890> has<00:01:45.040> done<00:01:45.250> well<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.789> AHL

team<00:01:46.360> for<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.869> Tampa<00:01:47.079> Bay<00:01:47.229> Lightning<00:01:47.500> but<00:01:47.920> so

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
team for the Tampa Bay Lightning but so

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.340 
team for the Tampa Bay Lightning but so
far<00:01:48.549> in<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.729> NHL<00:01:49.119> he's<00:01:49.329> yet<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:49.869> be<00:01:50.049> able<00:01:50.170> to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
far in the NHL he's yet to be able to

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.080 
far in the NHL he's yet to be able to
find<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.680> spot<00:01:50.890> and<00:01:50.920> really<00:01:51.250> make<00:01:51.490> a<00:01:51.520> mark<00:01:51.969> in

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
find a spot and really make a mark in

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.149 
find a spot and really make a mark in
the<00:01:52.210> NHL<00:01:52.689> right<00:01:52.869> so<00:01:52.990> that's<00:01:53.140> why<00:01:53.320> I<00:01:53.619> think<00:01:53.890> it's

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
the NHL right so that's why I think it's

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.679 
the NHL right so that's why I think it's
a<00:01:54.219> desperation<00:01:54.579> trade<00:01:54.909> for<00:01:55.090> Boston<00:01:55.450> man<00:01:55.570> this

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
a desperation trade for Boston man this

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.330 
a desperation trade for Boston man this
could<00:01:55.810> be<00:01:55.930> hit<00:01:56.079> or<00:01:56.110> miss<00:01:56.229> and<00:01:56.530> they<00:01:57.130> know<00:01:57.310> what

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
could be hit or miss and they know what

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.130

Tampa Bay wins this trade absolutely it

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.270 
Tampa Bay wins this trade absolutely it
could<00:03:13.870> end<00:03:14.140> up<00:03:14.320> being<00:03:14.380> that<00:03:14.740> Conley<00:03:15.010> is<00:03:15.250> a

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
could end up being that Conley is a

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.070 
could end up being that Conley is a
fantastic<00:03:15.790> winger<00:03:16.300> and<00:03:16.330> he<00:03:16.510> fits<00:03:16.720> in<00:03:16.930> on

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
fantastic winger and he fits in on

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.870

Boston<00:03:17.590> with<00:03:17.950> guys<00:03:18.100> like<00:03:18.310> Patrice<00:03:18.670> Bergeron

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
Boston with guys like Patrice Bergeron

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.250 
Boston with guys like Patrice Bergeron
David<00:03:19.480> Krejci<00:03:19.660> could<00:03:19.930> have<00:03:20.020> a<00:03:20.050> bounce-back

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
David Krejci could have a bounce-back

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.080 
David Krejci could have a bounce-back
year<00:03:20.530> or<00:03:20.920> start<00:03:21.400> to<00:03:21.490> turn<00:03:21.610> it<00:03:21.790> on<00:03:21.880> in<00:03:22.000> the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
playoffs right so I'm not saying it's a

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.880 
playoffs right so I'm not saying it's a
bad<00:03:24.310> trade<00:03:24.760> for<00:03:24.970> Boston<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.600> just<00:03:26.020> feel<00:03:26.200> it's<00:03:26.740> an

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
bad trade for Boston I just feel it's an

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.860 
bad trade for Boston I just feel it's an
unknown<00:03:27.310> desperation<00:03:28.180> trade<00:03:28.450> because<00:03:28.660> Brett

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
unknown desperation trade because Brett

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.420 
unknown desperation trade because Brett
Connolly<00:03:29.110> could<00:03:29.380> end<00:03:29.500> up<00:03:29.650> being<00:03:29.770> nothing<00:03:30.040> and

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
Connolly could end up being nothing and

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.160 
Connolly could end up being nothing and
we<00:03:30.790> know<00:03:31.000> what<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.270> two<00:03:31.420> second-round<00:03:31.930> picks

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
in the minors in the AHL but until you

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.630
