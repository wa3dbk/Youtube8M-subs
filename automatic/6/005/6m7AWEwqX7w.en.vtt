00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
started the process really early which

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.300 
started the process really early which
I'm<00:02:49.959> really<00:02:50.170> glad<00:02:50.290> because<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:51.040> lot<00:02:51.280> of

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
I'm really glad because a lot of

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.390 
I'm really glad because a lot of
students<00:02:51.820> wait<00:02:52.030> apparently<00:02:52.720> until<00:02:53.400> September

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
students wait apparently until September

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.070 
students wait apparently until September
and<00:02:54.670> then<00:02:54.820> there's<00:02:55.030> lots<00:02:55.209> of<00:02:55.330> lineups<00:02:55.810> and

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.229 
and then there's lots of lineups and
xenia<00:02:56.500> health<00:02:56.950> clinic<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.580> people<00:02:58.180> are

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
trying to get their vaccinations done

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.690 
trying to get their vaccinations done
and<00:03:00.820> it's<00:03:01.030> really<00:03:01.420> late<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:02.440> there's<00:03:03.250> lineups

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
and it's really late and there's lineups

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.759 
and it's really late and there's lineups
but<00:03:04.000> um<00:03:04.360> yeah<00:03:05.019> so<00:03:05.140> I'm<00:03:05.470> ready<00:03:05.620> for<00:03:05.739> that<00:03:06.989> so<00:03:07.989> the

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
but um yeah so I'm ready for that so the

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.979 
but um yeah so I'm ready for that so the
first<00:03:09.010> part<00:03:09.430> of<00:03:09.610> clinicals<00:03:10.090> from<00:03:10.480> my

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
first part of clinicals from my

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.580 
first part of clinicals from my
understanding<00:03:11.019> is<00:03:11.799> going<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.100> be<00:03:12.220> in<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.640> lab

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
understanding is going to be in the lab

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.080 
understanding is going to be in the lab
so<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.650> guess<00:03:15.070> it's<00:03:15.100> not<00:03:15.370> going<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.579> be<00:03:15.670> that<00:03:15.700> bad

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
so I guess it's not going to be that bad

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.020 
so I guess it's not going to be that bad
like<00:03:16.360> after<00:03:16.780> three<00:03:16.989> weeks<00:03:17.140> go<00:03:17.829> right<00:03:18.190> back<00:03:18.370> go

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
like after three weeks go right back go

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.640 
like after three weeks go right back go
right<00:03:19.360> out<00:03:19.390> into<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.870> hospital<00:03:20.019> that<00:03:20.380> would

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
right out into the hospital that would

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.940 
right out into the hospital that would
be<00:03:20.739> really<00:03:20.950> stressful<00:03:22.320> but<00:03:23.320> no<00:03:23.530> it's<00:03:23.739> going<00:03:23.890> to

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
be really stressful but no it's going to

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.199 
be really stressful but no it's going to
be<00:03:24.100> in<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.459> school<00:03:25.410> learning<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:27.010> way<00:03:27.250> then

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
be in the school learning that way then

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.690 
be in the school learning that way then
after<00:03:29.049> seven<00:03:29.620> weeks<00:03:29.769> I<00:03:29.980> think<00:03:30.010> in<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.459> school

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
after seven weeks I think in the school

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
then um if i'm not mistaken by check my

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.680 
then um if i'm not mistaken by check my
paper<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:36.459> paint<00:03:36.700> then<00:03:36.880> we<00:03:37.030> go<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.420> med

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
paper and paint then we go to a med

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.360 
paper and paint then we go to a med
search<00:03:37.959> rotation<00:03:40.019> i'm<00:03:41.019> not<00:03:41.230> sure<00:03:41.500> exactly

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
search rotation i'm not sure exactly

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
thing I think it's like 2,000 pages this

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.260 
thing I think it's like 2,000 pages this
is<00:05:24.470> just<00:05:24.590> one<00:05:24.860> textbook<00:05:27.640> you<00:05:28.640> see<00:05:28.820> that<00:05:29.000> I

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
is just one textbook you see that I

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.480 
is just one textbook you see that I
picked<00:05:29.810> it<00:05:29.930> out<00:05:30.050> because<00:05:30.530> it<00:05:30.740> was<00:05:30.890> like<00:05:31.160> only

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
picked it out because it was like only

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.800 
picked it out because it was like only
thirty<00:05:32.060> dollars<00:05:32.540> um<00:05:33.350> and<00:05:34.060> I<00:05:35.060> think<00:05:35.210> this<00:05:35.600> is

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
thirty dollars um and I think this is

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.500 
thirty dollars um and I think this is
going<00:05:36.080> to<00:05:36.169> be<00:05:36.290> one<00:05:36.440> of<00:05:36.470> my<00:05:36.680> textbooks<00:05:37.040> um<00:05:37.550> this

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
going to be one of my textbooks um this

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.350 
going to be one of my textbooks um this
is<00:05:38.750> a<00:05:38.870> slightly<00:05:39.350> older<00:05:39.530> version<00:05:40.280> i<00:05:40.460> hope<00:05:41.150> that

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
is a slightly older version i hope that

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.650 
is a slightly older version i hope that
i<00:05:41.390> can<00:05:41.479> get<00:05:41.810> away<00:05:41.930> with<00:05:42.140> it<00:05:42.320> if<00:05:43.100> I<00:05:43.460> can't<00:05:43.760> it's

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
i can get away with it if I can't it's

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.779 
i can get away with it if I can't it's
still<00:05:44.990> probably<00:05:45.289> going<00:05:45.770> to<00:05:45.830> be<00:05:45.919> useful<00:05:46.340> to<00:05:46.610> me

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:46.789
