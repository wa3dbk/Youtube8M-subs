00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
did this plane wind up in the South

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.830 
did this plane wind up in the South
Indian<00:04:01.700> Ocean<00:04:01.820> in<00:04:02.120> a<00:04:02.209> very<00:04:02.420> remote<00:04:02.780> location

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
Indian Ocean in a very remote location

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.539 
Indian Ocean in a very remote location
man<00:04:03.560> it<00:04:03.680> looks<00:04:03.860> like<00:04:04.010> they<00:04:04.100> had<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:04.250> massive

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
man it looks like they had a massive

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.370 
man it looks like they had a massive
electrical<00:04:05.209> failure<00:04:05.780> and<00:04:05.989> this<00:04:06.110> is<00:04:06.260> all

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
electrical failure and this is all

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.199 
electrical failure and this is all
speculation<00:04:06.829> on<00:04:07.010> my<00:04:07.040> part<00:04:07.160> guys<00:04:07.519> looks<00:04:08.090> like

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
speculation on my part guys looks like

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.880 
speculation on my part guys looks like
they<00:04:08.299> had<00:04:08.420> a<00:04:08.450> massive<00:04:08.750> electrical<00:04:09.320> failure<00:04:09.709> on

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
they had a massive electrical failure on

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.560 
they had a massive electrical failure on
that<00:04:09.950> plane<00:04:10.549> where<00:04:11.030> they<00:04:11.150> just<00:04:11.360> lost

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
that plane where they just lost

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.240 
that plane where they just lost
navigation<00:04:12.260> they<00:04:12.380> lost<00:04:12.620> lights<00:04:12.920> and<00:04:13.130> they

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
navigation they lost lights and they

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.710 
navigation they lost lights and they
were<00:04:13.340> just<00:04:13.489> off<00:04:13.610> they're<00:04:13.790> flying<00:04:14.120> blind<00:04:14.450> I

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
were just off they're flying blind I

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.180 
were just off they're flying blind I
mean<00:04:14.870> yeah<00:04:15.380> out<00:04:15.530> in<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.709> middle<00:04:15.860> of<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:15.980> ocean

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
mean yeah out in the middle of the ocean

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.370 
mean yeah out in the middle of the ocean
there's<00:04:16.579> no<00:04:16.760> lights<00:04:17.090> anywhere<00:04:17.239> you<00:04:18.200> don't

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
there's no lights anywhere you don't

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.259 
there's no lights anywhere you don't
have<00:04:18.530> any<00:04:18.739> navigation<00:04:19.370> of<00:04:19.489> any<00:04:19.669> lights<00:04:19.970> on<00:04:20.150> the

have any navigation of any lights on the
plane<00:04:20.510> you're<00:04:21.320> just<00:04:21.500> out<00:04:21.650> there<00:04:21.680> flying<00:04:22.160> and

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
plane you're just out there flying and

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.710 
plane you're just out there flying and
eventually<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:22.910> plane<00:04:23.150> probably<00:04:23.360> just<00:04:23.599> ran

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
eventually the plane probably just ran

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.320 
eventually the plane probably just ran
out<00:04:23.840> of<00:04:23.870> fuel

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
out of fuel

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.879 
out of fuel
just<00:04:24.479> boom<00:04:24.689> plummeted<00:04:25.229> into<00:04:25.379> the<00:04:25.530> ocean<00:04:25.770> and

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
just boom plummeted into the ocean and

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.320 
just boom plummeted into the ocean and
that<00:04:25.919> was<00:04:26.129> it<00:04:26.280> that<00:04:26.400> was<00:04:26.430> a<00:04:26.520> wrap<00:04:26.759> and<00:04:27.120> I'll

that was it that was a wrap and I'll

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.460 
that was it that was a wrap and I'll
tell<00:04:27.479> you<00:04:27.539> guys<00:04:27.569> something<00:04:27.930> right<00:04:28.139> now<00:04:28.259> man
