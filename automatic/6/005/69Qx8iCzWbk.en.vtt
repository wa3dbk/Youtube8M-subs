actually by the one that Criterion's
making<00:04:59.120> I<00:04:59.240> thought<00:04:59.450> criteria<00:05:00.020> were<00:05:00.110> making<00:05:00.380> a

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
making I thought criteria were making a

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.480 
making I thought criteria were making a
different<00:05:00.830> one<00:05:00.950> but<00:05:01.070> they're<00:05:01.250> actually

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
different one but they're actually

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.790 
different one but they're actually
making<00:05:01.940> the<00:05:02.270> world<00:05:02.780> online<00:05:02.990> need<00:05:03.590> for<00:05:03.770> speed
