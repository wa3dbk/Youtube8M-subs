00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.650
 Anyway, I 'm stuck with the lowdown 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.650
 s decided on style 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.980
 me 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.820
 Today, I attached the house case hipermax s style to my car Elgrand 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.180
 ing 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:30.220
 Mr. Taniguchi who came to Nobuteru Taniguchi 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:35.440
 It is Hyper Max S-style, but how is it used to come to work? 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:39.130
 That I guess after all the car than there is wind castle I mean contains low better is 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:43.810
 So I 'm wearing this s style 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:49.870
 In such a large-diameter wheel from the design stage but is Well s style 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.560
 Has been designed towards the spring rate Toka is the damping force toward the user who say that you want to and the vehicle height 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.070
 Because 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.430
 Well I am also just like it is perfect for such situations 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.090
 It is just right 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.400
 Yes 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.530
 But if you just want to scale or drop 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:10.340
 I don't care if it's an air book 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:12.590
 Certainly, the air suspension has the advantage of being able to adjust the vehicle height from within the company, but there is a price 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.890
 Because it will be very high 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:24.090
 Handy is more of these types of harmonic drive 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:25.380
 It seems to think like this, I can keep Iguchi even in the state where the direction of the later ride was dropped 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.069
 I may say 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.610
 See Well pointed Oh 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:34.330
 So if a little is bad Iguchi mouth Ono 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:40.220
 Even if it is socialized or dropped with this suspension 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:43.680
 Hobochi great So is further cheap and when it is secured 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.340
 In Kedomo I'm a person of meeting the actual running 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:52.470
 My elgrand of my ah, but the car height is falling 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:57.630
 It is very good at all without even worrying about rubbing whether this on the ground aero 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:01.950
 That's right from the stage of design in consideration of the kind of things we set towards the spring rate damping force 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:06.030
 When I what a typical person may have to or ran such a place in the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:10.080
 The tire that aero hits is said to hit the fender , but it still holds 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:15.510
 It is made in consideration of all that 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:19.110
 Of me not just that Well actual styling cheek after all of its running of star 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.730
 After all cornering performance or something like that is important 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:27.409
 Well I quite to in such side 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:30.350
 Because they set the firm Shi I know I'm bend quite feeling well I also Toka cornering 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:34.460
 Not even in such side 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:37.550
 I do not have to worry about rubbing ar, I do not have to worry about coming to Taiping Gakuen 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.100
 And then it seems like it's good that the year is wrong 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.590
 It feels so good 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:48.660
 You and different from the other car harmonic'll have this 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.410
 It's a bit short and short, and the case length etc. is also set a little short 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.420
 I wonder 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:58.360
 The part that strokes is already left when it loses because it is long because of the usual car harmonics 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:02.800
 A little sweet now stone without 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:06.400
 It's not good delicious even as vehicle height at perfectly delicious to shorten the sides 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:10.400
 It's about making it so short that you can use it in Toko . 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.610
 a of such a length of the meeting design and then again called the charge color 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.239
 In part to say 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.840
 I think that I can secure even if I dropped the ride 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:23.190
 The Fu in a responsible expression say 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.620
 Then you can use it in a low place where you will not lose your ride 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.840
 And cheap 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:32.110
 It is not the best or not Hyper is telling you the savior Thank you so much I also 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.660
 I use it 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:42.880
 I do so not dropped Bettari hit it Yeah Well Admit my car But 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:44.560
 It's a fair degree, but it 's much lower for this s-style design 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.460
 I can talk to you 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.569
 Dattari tire and fender clearance of or was the sound clearance of the e ground 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.949
 Perhaps 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:56.259
 I think that those who really blame will come to all schools in milli units, but that's all this 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.160
 Once was doing through it is within the allowable range 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:02.400
 Then in the case of me 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:05.940
 I also want cornering performance 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.000
 We use in the slightly raised ne vehicle height only a little 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:15.620
 Inheritance is short or full length adjustment type 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.620
 For those who really want to lower it still it is possible to respond
