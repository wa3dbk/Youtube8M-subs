00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.100 
issue I'm finding out where I should
have<00:00:45.539> figured<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.050> out<00:00:46.200> before<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:47.870> think<00:00:48.870> I

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
blind so that might have hid been the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.539 
blind so that might have hid been the
issue<00:01:35.189> too<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:36.299> uh<00:01:36.740> here<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:37.979> here's<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.280> case

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
issue too but uh here so here's the case

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.899 
issue too but uh here so here's the case
it<00:01:38.820> came<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.740> here's<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.950> actual<00:01:41.310> series

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
it came in and here's the actual series

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.569 
it came in and here's the actual series
so<00:01:42.689> as<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.110> see<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.380> has<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> little<00:01:43.770> lanyard

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
so as you see it has a little lanyard

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.700 
so as you see it has a little lanyard
I<00:01:44.610> believe<00:01:45.360> that's<00:01:45.450> what<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.720> call<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.590> I

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
I believe that's what you call and I

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.950 
I believe that's what you call and I
never<00:01:46.920> use<00:01:47.130> these<00:01:47.310> but<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.549> might<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.030> then<00:01:48.659> you

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
never use these but I might and then you

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.069 
never use these but I might and then you
got<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> actual<00:01:49.619> case<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:51.180> what's<00:01:51.930> this

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
got the actual case here and what's this

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.039 
got the actual case here and what's this
case<00:01:52.490> you<00:01:53.490> see<00:01:53.820> there's<00:01:54.060> actually<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.420> plastic

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
case you see there's actually a plastic

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.859 
case you see there's actually a plastic
covering<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.860> her<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.969> can<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
covering on her and you can you see the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.590 
covering on her and you can you see the
reflection<00:01:58.020> here<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.670> installment<00:02:00.479> of

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
reflection here so the installment of

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.819 
reflection here so the installment of
this<00:02:00.780> case<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.409> fairly<00:02:01.649> simple<00:02:03.680> so<00:02:04.680> what

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
this case is fairly simple so what

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.160 
this case is fairly simple so what
you're<00:02:04.920> gonna<00:02:05.040> do<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.670> pop<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.689> off<00:02:06.899> real

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
you're gonna do is pop this off real

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.089 
you're gonna do is pop this off real
quick<00:02:09.080> gotta<00:02:10.080> be<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.319> little<00:02:10.560> careful<00:02:10.830> because

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
quick gotta be a little careful because

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.570 
quick gotta be a little careful because
it<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.640> kind<00:02:12.209> of

so<00:02:28.900> no<00:02:29.790> your<00:02:30.790> mommy<00:02:31.210> I<00:02:34.110> remember<00:02:35.110> having<00:02:35.260> a

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
so no your mommy I remember having a

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.590 
so no your mommy I remember having a
little<00:02:35.650> trouble<00:02:35.890> is<00:02:36.160> this<00:02:36.340> it's<00:02:36.850> it's<00:02:37.120> secure

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
little trouble is this it's it's secure

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.690 
little trouble is this it's it's secure
so<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.840> guess<00:02:38.050> that's<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.470> positive<00:02:39.370> of<00:02:39.400> this

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
so I guess that's the positive of this

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.780 
so I guess that's the positive of this
being<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.030> little<00:02:40.240> difficult<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:41.470> I'm<00:02:42.100> come<00:02:42.520> in

very simple it's a plastic and then you

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.190 
very simple it's a plastic and then you
have<00:03:06.220> this<00:03:06.580> foam<00:03:06.880> here<00:03:07.180> cushioned<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.810> iPod

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
I'll see that dent you can see it better

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.990 
I'll see that dent you can see it better
right<00:03:23.140> there<00:03:23.320> so<00:03:23.890> we're<00:03:24.190> gonna<00:03:24.310> put<00:03:24.640> this<00:03:24.790> in

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
right there so we're gonna put this in

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.920 
right there so we're gonna put this in
it's<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.269> quite<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.290> simple<00:03:27.209> process<00:03:28.209> here<00:03:28.750> and

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
it's a quite a simple process here and

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.320 
it's a quite a simple process here and
you<00:03:29.680> see<00:03:29.860> you<00:03:30.070> also<00:03:30.250> have<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.610> camera<00:03:31.060> space

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
you see you also have the camera space

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.540 
you see you also have the camera space
and<00:03:31.630> see<00:03:32.410> what<00:03:32.620> I<00:03:32.650> was<00:03:32.800> having<00:03:33.100> trouble<00:03:33.220> is

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
and see what I was having trouble is

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.670 
and see what I was having trouble is
there's<00:03:33.760> three<00:03:34.150> clips<00:03:34.540> on<00:03:34.720> this<00:03:34.840> side<00:03:35.080> three

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
there's three clips on this side three

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.500 
there's three clips on this side three
clips<00:03:35.950> then<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:36.730> believe<00:03:37.060> there's<00:03:37.269> a<00:03:37.330> clip

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
clips then I believe there's a clip

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
clips then I believe there's a clip
right<00:03:37.660> here<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.050> a<00:03:38.110> clip<00:03:38.320> up<00:03:38.470> here<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:46.530> there

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
right here and a clip up here and there

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.380 
right here and a clip up here and there
we<00:03:47.769> go

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
we go

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.009 
we go
now<00:03:49.390> this<00:03:49.660> clip<00:03:50.019> on<00:03:50.110> that<00:03:50.170> side<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:52.150> it's<00:03:52.750> very

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
now this clip on that side and it's very

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:59.430 
now this clip on that side and it's very
secure<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:55.860> clean<00:03:57.480> yeah<00:03:58.480> so<00:03:58.840> I<00:03:58.870> should<00:03:59.140> have

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
secure and clean yeah so I should have

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.810 
secure and clean yeah so I should have
wiped<00:03:59.620> off<00:03:59.860> the<00:04:00.010> screen<00:04:00.250> I'm<00:04:00.370> probably<00:04:00.700> have

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
wiped off the screen I'm probably have

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.030 
wiped off the screen I'm probably have
to<00:04:00.940> do<00:04:01.120> that<00:04:01.330> that's<00:04:01.840> captain<00:04:02.320> janeway<00:04:02.709> Star

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.430 
to do that that's captain janeway Star
Trek<00:04:03.280> Voyager<00:04:03.459> so<00:04:04.330> then<00:04:04.930> you're<00:04:05.080> just<00:04:05.230> gonna

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
Trek Voyager so then you're just gonna

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.310 
Trek Voyager so then you're just gonna
simply<00:04:06.420> pop<00:04:07.420> that<00:04:07.690> on<00:04:08.580> here<00:04:09.900> it's<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:11.049> little

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
simply pop that on here it's a little

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.259 
simply pop that on here it's a little
difficult<00:04:11.769> to<00:04:11.830> get<00:04:12.070> on<00:04:12.160> this<00:04:12.340> so<00:04:13.030> you're<00:04:13.150> gonna

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
difficult to get on this so you're gonna

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.150 
difficult to get on this so you're gonna
put<00:04:13.690> this<00:04:13.870> in<00:04:14.590> a<00:04:14.650> bit

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
put this in a bit

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.530 
put this in a bit
you're<00:04:15.430> gonna<00:04:15.660> configure<00:04:16.660> it<00:04:16.810> in<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.440> bit<00:04:18.540> close

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
you're gonna configure it in a bit close

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.110 
you're gonna configure it in a bit close
out<00:04:19.720> a<00:04:19.750> bit<00:04:19.989> push<00:04:20.950> it<00:04:21.130> in<00:04:21.280> it's<00:04:21.789> a<00:04:21.880> little

out a bit push it in it's a little

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.120 
out a bit push it in it's a little
complicated<00:04:22.510> but<00:04:23.260> it's<00:04:23.320> good<00:04:23.680> because<00:04:23.860> it's

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
complicated but it's good because it's

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.610 
complicated but it's good because it's
protecting<00:04:24.669> your<00:04:25.120> iPod

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
so kind of push that in a bit and there
