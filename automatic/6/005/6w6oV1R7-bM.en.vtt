 I have my lice ecaflip and you can 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.940
 to see that in front there is still very 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:40.670
 very big level advantage composition and 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:42.260

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.610
 show off the dock or so I hesitated 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.620
 I hesitated I saw that he had 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.870
 abandoned I hesitated in Paris 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.870
 rope but hey we do not care is the game 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:05.380
 so we're going already I'm going to make sure 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:07.100
 not to waste enough good I rock 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.479
 it's street what am I going to succeed 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.979
 to rock where are I not going 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.710
 succeed in rock it's good I succeed in 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.080
 rock to show you a max of dope 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.159
 where we're going to do back elbow elbow at 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.380
 elbow there is still so what has that 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.110
 risk not being very very powerful 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.759
 I want to say so we're still going 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.219
 to make the compo teams so my 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.859
 side I have a double fear to riom du 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:33.530
 farl server and another skull from 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:37.090
 auto server but pay so yes that 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.799
 called country you found a great name 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.450
 is that too the one there in front 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.850
 had brought the teacher that there has 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.070
 really given that loose and in the face we have 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.320
 learned a fact catiches it from the server 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.570
 domain 999 11.5 not a lot of 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.700
 vitality and the image of the server 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.409
 silhouette period of a hundred not a lot 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.090
 vitality either above him 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:01.280
 rox to quantify very very very badly 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.850
 and maybe judgment the acquis that makes 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.850
 big damage 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.479
 the question is is it 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:12.069
 I will be able to do both 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.390
 but the answer is yes I 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.760
 will be able to go to the dock 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.379
 or simply because he has 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.610
 very well placed so I hesitate either 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:23.019
 to type on the fact that oneself on the iop 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.670
 knowing that the fact that is a little more 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.310
 boring that's what it's going to take and 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.170
 Ben absolutely typing I wonder 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.310
 if the pass or jean hymus i will go 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.290
 check his no and not worry mu and the 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.459
 iop is not subject have no more moment 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.360
 where they will quickly understand their pain 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.140
 so the fact that he is really 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.000
 whoever really has the least 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.530
 vitality a small wheel is 58 good 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.060
 Okay 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.470
 from the shot past the one we are really going 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.959

 go hop the end of the dock or back end 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.819

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.530
 here it is just to show 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:19.450

 the rooster rats time and made arrows 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.480
 explosive that you still need enough 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.500
 malignant of the 200 in areas or appreciate abl

 the iop who will be able to do me when

 even maybe very very badly here it goes 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.440
 I type 500 1438 there against that 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.940
 becomes something else it becomes even 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.410
 limit of a game for me and that's the 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.900
 very high very good care and peace 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.170
 Luxem celestial region of millet samaa tv 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.280
 1600 so it's a little my mua me 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.489
 I want to say it's my is my 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.489
 mimi 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.100
 I'll just be able to go 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.100
 gang bang 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:36.080
 the cra is smart and ten countries 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:39.150
 have months to the right 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.349
 stp we 'll say that because hey bah he has 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:46.560
 disputed kg 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:48.930
 it's good too, it's good it's good 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.759
 played on his part and suddenly we go 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.650
 able to go even back blow 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.229
 from elbow to elbow at elbow to elbow hop 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:02.870
 or there against the claw she makes me 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:04.800
 afraid enough it could hurt us 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:10.319
 in addition to handing us that she his 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:14.569
 intelligence it does not laugh anymore we go 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:20.699
 go and slap on the mouth 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:22.949
 in this case and we will go all 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:26.310
 just get a kick back for 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:28.319
 survive the next turn and blow 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.189
 so here we go we will protect ourselves 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:31.319
 get out of this leaf 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:32.879
 Hence the fact that taking from the 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:36.210
 big loose poisoned two flashes 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:38.729
 poisoned 190 and 200 4 74 was made 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.620
 a total of 600 564 and there the fact that 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.449
 which is more than 248 points 10 I think 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.069
 that there would have been the bordering opposite 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.659
 and well just would be was 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:47.839
 completely to our fight we would have 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:51.449
 taken more expensive we would have blunders 

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:53.759
 of ideas in routing and serra do not have too much 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.379

00:05:55.379 --> 00:06:01.110
 it's the game of the atalante eca flip 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.650
 and that's the fact that whoever succumbs to his 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.419
 injuries and that 's going to be long for 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.460
 the yap a lay up here it is it takes 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:13.050
 explosive flashes at least 4 158 of 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.159

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.689

 something here are swords it's up to 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.570
 279 barely or the most boosted is 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:28.040
 remember hop I think 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:31.170
 and who may be able to finish it 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.940
 there he makes me hurried he goes to me 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.550

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:52.940
 to be able to do much p &amp; p are going to us

 dream but that makes the month without 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:07:00.810
 why not an isotope of flashes 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.390
 slowing down you have another one 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:06.180
