00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
that you're actually promoting more root

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.130 
that you're actually promoting more root
growth<00:01:50.310> by<00:01:50.909> ripping<00:01:51.270> off<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.659> established

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
growth by ripping off the established

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.510 
growth by ripping off the established
roots<00:01:52.350> all<00:01:52.649> these<00:01:52.920> other<00:01:53.100> roots<00:01:53.340> are<00:01:53.430> gonna

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
roots all these other roots are gonna

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.100 
roots all these other roots are gonna
say<00:01:53.729> oh<00:01:53.759> no<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.240> need<00:01:54.360> more<00:01:54.420> roots<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:54.990> they

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
say oh no we need more roots so they

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.660 
say oh no we need more roots so they
start<00:01:55.320> growing<00:01:55.590> right<00:01:55.740> away<00:01:55.920> okay

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
start growing right away okay
