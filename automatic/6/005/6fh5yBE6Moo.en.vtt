hello everybody in this video I'm going

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.519 
hello everybody in this video I'm going
to<00:00:02.820> show<00:00:03.000> how<00:00:03.210> we<00:00:03.270> can<00:00:03.389> move<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.959> shape<00:00:04.290> or<00:00:04.470> a

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
to show how we can move a shape or a

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.410 
to show how we can move a shape or a
picture<00:00:04.920> or<00:00:05.100> an<00:00:05.430> object<00:00:05.580> in<00:00:05.879> Microsoft<00:00:06.270> Excel

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
picture or an object in Microsoft Excel

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.930 
picture or an object in Microsoft Excel
using<00:00:07.230> VBA<00:00:07.410> programming<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:08.309> I'll<00:00:08.730> give<00:00:08.849> you

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
using VBA programming and I'll give you

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.459 
using VBA programming and I'll give you
a<00:00:09.000> real<00:00:09.210> quick<00:00:09.240> demonstration<00:00:09.510> on<00:00:10.080> how<00:00:10.110> I'm

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
a real quick demonstration on how I'm

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.089 
a real quick demonstration on how I'm
going<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.620> do<00:00:10.740> that

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
going to do that

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.370 
going to do that
I'm<00:00:11.219> going<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.429> run<00:00:11.580> this<00:00:11.700> macro<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.750> we'll

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
I'm going to run this macro and we'll

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.770 
I'm going to run this macro and we'll
see<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:13.769> object<00:00:13.950> rotate<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.059> enlarge<00:00:15.630> at

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
see this object rotate and enlarge at

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.750 
see this object rotate and enlarge at
the<00:00:15.870> same<00:00:16.020> time<00:00:16.260> while<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.710> comes<00:00:16.949> towards<00:00:17.609> the

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
the same time while it comes towards the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.640 
the same time while it comes towards the
right<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.109> something<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:19.439> you're

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
right so this is something that you're

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.750 
right so this is something that you're
interested<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:20.010> doing<00:00:20.130> please<00:00:20.520> stick<00:00:20.730> around

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
interested in doing please stick around

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.670 
interested in doing please stick around

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
and watch this video and let me going to

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.960 
and watch this video and let me going to
show<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.890> how<00:00:22.980> we<00:00:23.039> can<00:00:23.279> get<00:00:23.400> started<00:00:23.580> on<00:00:23.850> this

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
show you how we can get started on this

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.000 
show you how we can get started on this
code<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.289> first<00:00:25.529> thing<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.680> we're<00:00:25.890> going

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
code so the first thing that we're going

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.240 
code so the first thing that we're going
to<00:00:26.070> want<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.250> do<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:27.500> insert<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.859> shape<00:00:29.070> or

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
to want to do is insert the shape or

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.200 
to want to do is insert the shape or
object<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.580> you're<00:00:29.760> going<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.939> be<00:00:30.029> working

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
object that you're going to be working

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.120 
object that you're going to be working
with<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.990> case<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.470> worked<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
with in this case I worked with the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.639 
with in this case I worked with the
shape<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.750> I<00:00:33.750> put<00:00:33.930> smiley<00:00:34.260> face<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:35.210> and<00:00:36.649> of

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
shape and I put smiley face in and of

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.440 
shape and I put smiley face in and of
course<00:00:37.829> format<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.640> your<00:00:38.820> preference<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
course format it to your preference the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.420 
course format it to your preference the
only<00:00:39.780> thing<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:39.989> did<00:00:40.140> online<00:00:40.410> was<00:00:40.649> just<00:00:40.950> change

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
only thing I did online was just change

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.790 
only thing I did online was just change
it<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.640> yellow<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.200> I<00:00:43.200> did<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> shape<00:00:43.620> outline

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
it to yellow and I did a shape outline

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.270 
it to yellow and I did a shape outline
is<00:00:44.070> being<00:00:44.250> automatic<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.890> position<00:00:47.219> I

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
is being automatic and the position I

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.470 
is being automatic and the position I
mean<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.579> anywhere<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.969> want<00:00:48.180> but

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
mean it can be anywhere you want but

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.639 
mean it can be anywhere you want but
what<00:00:48.690> I'm<00:00:48.780> going<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.260> go<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.469> my

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
what I'm going to do is go to my

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.369 
what I'm going to do is go to my
developers<00:00:50.160> tab<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.730> go<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.420> Visual<00:00:51.780> Basic

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
developers tab and go to Visual Basic

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.080 
developers tab and go to Visual Basic
the<00:00:53.010> very<00:00:53.340> first<00:00:53.550> thing<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.820> needed<00:00:53.969> to

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
the very first thing that I needed to

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.229 
the very first thing that I needed to
set<00:00:54.239> up<00:00:54.270> was<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.960> timeout<00:00:55.350> or<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:56.399> sleep<00:00:57.000> function

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
set up was a timeout or a sleep function

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.000 
set up was a timeout or a sleep function
which<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.320> case<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.620> built<00:00:58.800> right<00:00:58.949> here

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
which in this case I built right here

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.369 
which in this case I built right here
sub<00:00:59.460> timeout<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.120> I'm<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.930> go<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.170> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
sub timeout and I'm going to go on and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.910 
sub timeout and I'm going to go on and
just<00:01:02.750> start<00:01:03.750> from<00:01:03.870> scratch<00:01:03.930> on<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> code<00:01:04.559> but

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
just start from scratch on the code but

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.750 
just start from scratch on the code but
the<00:01:05.159> timeout<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:06.119> part<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.659> very<00:01:06.720> important

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
the timeout this part is very important

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.039 
the timeout this part is very important
all<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.479> procedure<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.990> I

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
all this is just a procedure that I

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.990 
all this is just a procedure that I
created<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.590> where<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.070> sleeps<00:01:11.520> for<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
created to where it sleeps for the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.910 
created to where it sleeps for the
duration<00:01:12.299> milliseconds<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.380> establish

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
duration milliseconds that you establish

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.850 
duration milliseconds that you establish
so<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:15.150> do<00:01:15.680> timeout<00:01:17.360> that's<00:01:18.360> going<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.570> be

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.020 

really<00:01:22.860> when<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.250> milliseconds<00:01:23.729> heck<00:01:23.939> if

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
really when you do milliseconds heck if

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.940 
really when you do milliseconds heck if
your<00:01:24.180> put<00:01:24.360> point<00:01:24.689> zero<00:01:25.470> one<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:25.799> going<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
your put point zero one it's going to

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.380 
your put point zero one it's going to
see<00:01:26.100> four<00:01:26.280> points<00:01:26.610> your<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:26.939> milliseconds

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
see four points your one milliseconds

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.149 
see four points your one milliseconds
then<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.659> will<00:01:27.750> do<00:01:28.409> what<00:01:28.590> hour<00:01:28.710> procedure<00:01:28.860> you

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
then it will do what hour procedure you

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:37.490 
then it will do what hour procedure you
want<00:01:31.400> I'm<00:01:32.400> going<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.759> do<00:01:34.280> five<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:36.380> I'm<00:01:37.380> going

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
want I'm going to do five and I'm going

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.550 
want I'm going to do five and I'm going
to<00:01:37.560> play<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:37.890> out<00:01:38.180> macro<00:01:39.180> run<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.380> run

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
to play this out macro run so if I run

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.350 
to play this out macro run so if I run
it<00:01:40.710> you're<00:01:41.310> going<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.460> wait<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:41.729> 5<00:01:41.880> l<00:01:42.030> pause

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it you're going to wait for 5 l pause

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.230 
it you're going to wait for 5 l pause
for<00:01:42.570> 5<00:01:42.689> seconds<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.520> then<00:01:44.520> eventually<00:01:44.909> I'll

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
for 5 seconds and then eventually I'll

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.260 
for 5 seconds and then eventually I'll

work<00:02:07.150> with<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:08.050> left<00:02:08.460> I'm<00:02:09.460> going<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.670> put<00:02:09.820> this

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
work with the left I'm going to put this

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.670 
work with the left I'm going to put this
as<00:02:10.119> a<00:02:10.150> single<00:02:10.900> quote<00:02:11.140> so<00:02:11.320> that<00:02:11.440> it's<00:02:11.560> not

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
as a single quote so that it's not

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.920 
as a single quote so that it's not
executable<00:02:12.250> code<00:02:12.570> we're<00:02:13.570> going<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.720> work<00:02:13.840> with

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
executable code we're going to work with

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.120 
executable code we're going to work with
the<00:02:14.020> left<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:15.250> top<00:02:16.770> we're<00:02:17.770> going<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:17.920> work

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
the left the top we're going to work

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:30.160 
the left the top we're going to work
with<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.520> height<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:25.210> width

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.890 

all<00:02:30.740> right<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:30.920> we<00:02:31.010> have<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.250> left<00:02:31.460> top<00:02:31.900> height

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
all right so we have the left top height

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.690 
all right so we have the left top height
and<00:02:33.140> with<00:02:33.620> where<00:02:34.069> they're<00:02:34.250> going<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.459> need<00:02:34.640> to

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
and with where they're going to need to

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.940 
and with where they're going to need to
do<00:02:35.090> also<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.840> rotation<00:02:41.140> now<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.200> way<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.500> did

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
do also the rotation now the way I did

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.150 
do also the rotation now the way I did
the<00:02:43.040> video<00:02:43.160> is<00:02:43.990> all<00:02:44.990> I<00:02:45.020> do<00:02:45.170> is<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.350> created<00:02:45.920> a

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
the video is all I do is I created a

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.060 
the video is all I do is I created a
repetition<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.990> and<00:02:47.990> I<00:02:48.050> did<00:02:48.230> 4<00:02:48.470> rep<00:02:48.680> is<00:02:48.830> equal

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
repetition of and I did 4 rep is equal

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.310 
repetition of and I did 4 rep is equal
to<00:02:49.220> 1<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.459> 400<00:02:49.810> there's<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.900> couple<00:02:51.110> of<00:02:51.260> ways

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
to 1 to 400 there's a couple of ways

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.010 
to 1 to 400 there's a couple of ways
that<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.620> can<00:02:51.740> do<00:02:51.830> this<00:02:54.910> just<00:02:55.910> for<00:02:56.450> this<00:02:56.660> video

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
that you can do this just for this video

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.750 
that you can do this just for this video
I'm<00:02:57.170> just<00:02:57.260> going<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.560> put<00:03:00.550> rep<00:03:01.550> count<00:03:03.580> is<00:03:04.580> equal

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
I'm just going to put rep count is equal

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.320 
I'm just going to put rep count is equal
to<00:03:04.940> 0<00:03:05.330> I'm<00:03:05.540> going<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.810> create<00:03:05.959> a<00:03:06.020> do<00:03:06.200> loop<00:03:06.380> do<00:03:07.330> do

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
to 0 I'm going to create a do loop do do

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.570 
to 0 I'm going to create a do loop do do
events<00:03:08.690> is<00:03:08.780> important<00:03:09.260> do<00:03:09.769> events<00:03:10.070> what<00:03:10.430> this

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
events is important do events what this

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.120 
events is important do events what this
does<00:03:10.790> this<00:03:11.030> allows<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:12.320> visual<00:03:13.070> basic

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
does this allows the visual basic

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.100 
does this allows the visual basic
environment<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.940> complete<00:03:14.510> all<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.840> events

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
environment to complete all the events

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.900 
environment to complete all the events
that<00:03:15.230> you've<00:03:15.380> asked<00:03:15.680> for<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.580> that<00:03:16.730> way<00:03:16.820> you

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
that you've asked for and that way you

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.570 
that you've asked for and that way you
can<00:03:17.030> see<00:03:17.300> it<00:03:17.360> on<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.510> screen<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:18.550> if<00:03:19.550> you

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
can see it on the screen and if you

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.340 
can see it on the screen and if you
weren't<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.090> have<00:03:20.269> a<00:03:20.300> do<00:03:20.570> events<00:03:21.019> and<00:03:21.230> you're

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
weren't to have a do events and you're

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.940 
weren't to have a do events and you're
just<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.650> finish<00:03:21.830> your<00:03:22.070> loop<00:03:22.190> like<00:03:22.370> this<00:03:23.950> loop

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
just to finish your loop like this loop

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.949 
just to finish your loop like this loop
until<00:03:26.830> rep<00:03:27.830> count<00:03:28.160> let's<00:03:28.820> say<00:03:28.970> is<00:03:29.150> equal<00:03:29.840> to

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
until rep count let's say is equal to

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.500 
until rep count let's say is equal to
300<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:33.459> of<00:03:34.459> course<00:03:34.730> we're<00:03:34.940> going<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.120> add<00:03:35.450> a

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
300 and of course we're going to add a

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.319 
300 and of course we're going to add a
rep<00:03:35.780> count<00:03:36.579> rep<00:03:37.579> count<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:37.910> give<00:03:38.030> our<00:03:38.120> town

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
rep count rep count to give our town

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.819 
rep count rep count to give our town
plus<00:03:38.540> one<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:38.989> that<00:03:39.110> way<00:03:39.230> we're<00:03:39.410> counting<00:03:39.739> up

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
plus one so that way we're counting up

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.220 
plus one so that way we're counting up
to<00:03:39.920> 300<00:03:40.400> but<00:03:41.120> without<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.450> do<00:03:41.570> events<00:03:41.840> you

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
to 300 but without the do events you

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.110 
to 300 but without the do events you
won't<00:03:42.410> be<00:03:42.590> able<00:03:42.709> to<00:03:42.890> see<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.549> application

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
won't be able to see the application

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.940 
won't be able to see the application
process<00:03:44.329> these<00:03:44.690> events<00:03:45.079> right<00:03:45.260> here<00:03:45.470> and<00:03:45.650> see

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
process these events right here and see

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.319 
process these events right here and see
it<00:03:46.040> on<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.220> screen<00:03:46.489> so<00:03:46.670> very<00:03:46.940> important<00:03:47.299> that

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
it on the screen so very important that

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.850 
it on the screen so very important that
you<00:03:47.570> have<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:48.049> do<00:03:48.170> events<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:50.680> here<00:03:51.680> what

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
you have the do events and here what

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.390 
you have the do events and here what
I'll<00:03:51.950> do<00:03:52.100> is<00:03:52.310> now<00:03:52.760> make<00:03:52.940> this<00:03:53.140> executable<00:03:54.140> and

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
I'll do is now make this executable and

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.780 
I'll do is now make this executable and
we'll<00:03:55.400> put<00:03:55.610> rep<00:03:55.850> count<00:03:57.519> now<00:03:58.519> I'll<00:03:58.610> show<00:03:58.760> you

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
we'll put rep count now I'll show you

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.949 
we'll put rep count now I'll show you
how<00:03:58.940> you<00:03:59.000> can<00:03:59.180> change<00:03:59.299> this<00:03:59.450> in<00:03:59.570> a<00:03:59.660> bit<00:03:59.810> but

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
how you can change this in a bit but

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.890 
how you can change this in a bit but
that<00:04:00.140> way<00:04:00.290> we<00:04:00.470> can<00:04:00.680> get<00:04:01.610> to<00:04:01.790> start<00:04:02.090> it<00:04:02.239> let's

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
that way we can get to start it let's

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.750 
that way we can get to start it let's
try<00:04:03.049> running<00:04:03.200> this<00:04:03.440> macro<00:04:03.860> we've<00:04:04.459> got<00:04:04.579> to<00:04:04.670> put

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
try running this macro we've got to put

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.360 
try running this macro we've got to put
a<00:04:04.790> timeout<00:04:05.470> I'm<00:04:06.470> going<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:06.739> say<00:04:06.920> recommend

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
a timeout I'm going to say recommend

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.060 
a timeout I'm going to say recommend
point<00:04:07.610> zero<00:04:07.970> one<00:04:08.180> and<00:04:08.650> let's<00:04:09.650> just<00:04:09.799> run<00:04:09.950> this

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
point zero one and let's just run this

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:16.720 
point zero one and let's just run this
code<00:04:11.739> macro<00:04:12.739> run

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.120 

and<00:04:17.510> you<00:04:17.690> see<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.020> smiley<00:04:18.320> face<00:04:18.560> rotating

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
and you see the smiley face rotating

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.080 
and you see the smiley face rotating

able to change this to your likings to
your<00:04:25.100> preference<00:04:25.490> let's<00:04:26.420> say<00:04:26.630> I<00:04:26.660> didn't<00:04:26.960> want

to keep either I wanted to keep the
height<00:04:28.580> consistent<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.360> I<00:04:29.540> wanted<00:04:29.750> to<00:04:29.810> keep

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
height consistent and I wanted to keep

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.160 
height consistent and I wanted to keep
it<00:04:30.200> not<00:04:30.560> to<00:04:30.680> hide<00:04:30.830> I'm<00:04:30.950> sorry<00:04:31.160> at<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.430> top<00:04:32.170> top

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
is where it's positioned on the

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.970 
is where it's positioned on the
spreadsheet<00:04:37.700> so<00:04:38.320> top<00:04:39.320> and<00:04:39.500> left<00:04:39.590> will<00:04:39.740> be<00:04:39.830> your

high bet at the top level let me go on

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.470 
high bet at the top level let me go on
to<00:04:56.150> change<00:04:56.330> this<00:04:56.480> for<00:04:56.630> up<00:04:56.690> to<00:04:56.810> 400<00:04:58.300> Mac<00:04:59.300> I'm

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
to change this for up to 400 Mac I'm

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:06.100 
to change this for up to 400 Mac I'm
going<00:04:59.600> to<00:04:59.660> run<00:04:59.750> that

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.980 

so<00:05:06.830> of<00:05:06.919> course<00:05:07.159> you'll<00:05:07.849> be<00:05:07.879> able<00:05:08.030> to<00:05:08.419> if<00:05:08.780> you

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
so of course you'll be able to if you

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.490 
so of course you'll be able to if you
want<00:05:09.199> to<00:05:09.830> set<00:05:10.129> up<00:05:10.159> different<00:05:10.340> variables<00:05:11.500> let's

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
want to set up different variables let's

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.830 
want to set up different variables let's
say<00:05:12.620> you<00:05:12.680> wanted<00:05:12.860> a<00:05:12.949> width<00:05:13.159> variable<00:05:16.840> which

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
say you wanted a width variable which

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.589 
say you wanted a width variable which
you<00:05:17.870> should<00:05:18.229> do<00:05:18.379> is<00:05:18.590> before<00:05:18.979> the<00:05:19.580> loop<00:05:19.819> put

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
you should do is before the loop put

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:22.300 
you should do is before the loop put
with<00:05:20.780> variable<00:05:21.379> to<00:05:21.680> the<00:05:21.860> amount<00:05:22.069> that<00:05:22.099> you

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
with variable to the amount that you

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.290 
with variable to the amount that you
want<00:05:22.460> this<00:05:22.879> case<00:05:23.090> you<00:05:23.270> want<00:05:23.479> it<00:05:23.599> to<00:05:23.750> be<00:05:24.020> ten<00:05:24.830> and

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
want this case you want it to be ten and

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.179 
want this case you want it to be ten and
you're<00:05:26.300> going<00:05:26.449> to<00:05:26.509> want<00:05:26.659> it<00:05:26.719> to<00:05:26.979> get<00:05:27.979> rather

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:28.189 
you're going to want it to get rather

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:30.279 
you're going to want it to get rather
wide<00:05:28.460> quickly<00:05:28.879> you<00:05:29.120> do<00:05:29.240> with<00:05:29.509> variable<00:05:30.169> is

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
wide quickly you do with variable is

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:32.409 
wide quickly you do with variable is
equal<00:05:30.379> to<00:05:30.530> with<00:05:31.009> variable<00:05:31.460> plus<00:05:31.639> and<00:05:32.090> say

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
equal to with variable plus and say

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.339 
equal to with variable plus and say
three<00:05:32.960> and<00:05:34.240> change<00:05:35.240> the<00:05:35.539> width<00:05:35.750> instead<00:05:36.050> of<00:05:36.259> it

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:36.349 
three and change the width instead of it

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:37.959 
three and change the width instead of it
being<00:05:36.379> rep<00:05:36.680> count<00:05:36.949> it's<00:05:37.250> going<00:05:37.400> to<00:05:37.460> be<00:05:37.639> with

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:37.969 
being rep count it's going to be with

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:39.760 
being rep count it's going to be with
variable<00:05:38.539> of<00:05:39.229> course<00:05:39.349> you're<00:05:39.500> gonna<00:05:39.590> have<00:05:39.680> a

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
variable of course you're gonna have a

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.040 
variable of course you're gonna have a
very<00:05:39.919> stretched<00:05:40.280> out<00:05:40.430> object<00:05:41.060> but<00:05:41.270> let's<00:05:41.840> say

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
very stretched out object but let's say

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.020 
very stretched out object but let's say
this<00:05:42.199> is<00:05:42.319> what<00:05:42.440> you<00:05:42.530> want<00:05:42.680> to<00:05:42.740> do<00:05:42.860> let's<00:05:43.819> run

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
this is what you want to do let's run

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.770 
this is what you want to do let's run
the<00:05:44.150> macro<00:05:44.949> click<00:05:45.949> run<00:05:46.240> is<00:05:47.240> getting<00:05:47.569> wider

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
the macro click run is getting wider

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.740 
the macro click run is getting wider
very<00:05:48.080> quick<00:05:51.069> but<00:05:52.069> I'll<00:05:52.610> let<00:05:52.879> you<00:05:53.090> mess<00:05:53.719> around

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
very quick but I'll let you mess around

the<00:05:55.909> same<00:05:56.949> the<00:05:57.949> same<00:05:58.129> principle<00:05:58.490> that<00:05:58.580> we<00:05:58.729> use

00:05:58.869 --> 00:05:58.879 
the same the same principle that we use

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:00.379 
right here you can use it on pictures

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:02.769 
right here you can use it on pictures
just<00:06:01.099> when<00:06:01.279> working<00:06:01.520> with<00:06:01.909> the<00:06:02.419> shapes<00:06:02.659> so

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:02.779 
just when working with the shapes so

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.689 
just when working with the shapes so
make<00:06:03.080> sure<00:06:03.110> you<00:06:03.409> change<00:06:03.740> the<00:06:03.949> name<00:06:04.370> of<00:06:04.400> the

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699 
make sure you change the name of the

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.550 
make sure you change the name of the
shape<00:06:04.909> to<00:06:05.389> the<00:06:05.870> name<00:06:05.990> of<00:06:06.139> the<00:06:06.229> object<00:06:06.500> that

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
shape to the name of the object that

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.929 
shape to the name of the object that
you're<00:06:06.710> working<00:06:06.860> with<00:06:07.009> I<00:06:07.310> hope<00:06:07.729> you<00:06:07.849> all
