 Rescued your gourmet product as the course different flavors

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.410
 to begin with and even in the pot there's no way 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.390
 The water is even hot in the mouth. 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.630

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.900

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.340
 the brigadeiro won the Oscar that the ones of foodstuffs the candy puts the 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.940
 hand in the mass since the six years of age learned with the grandmother by

 Brazil I am a journalist and I left a profession 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.290
 the tremor of this joke 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.320
 so people would talk, but how would you open a tin and a half each? 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.340
 brother out of broadband everything to make british trade clear 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.160
 as any business was a difficult thing because there is no such thing 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.880
 gourmet brigadeiro concept 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.190
 it was worth it 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.400
 Up to 16,000 brigadeiros are produced here. 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.470
 everything to supply a very loyal clientele marked the tombs of 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.960
 brigadeiro that the custom of doing much at home 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.260
 but the one that is sensational type 1 she likes both who indicated up to the 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.950
 spouse friends already work too 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.730
 and I said yes 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.110
 I have for myself that I would not waste much time 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.030
 it is practically possible to resist so many delights 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.110
 food 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.090
 It's never too late to try. 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.990
 the complete work 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.990
 from now on my goal I do not have 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.080
 they wait on the side is not the first time the grass is scanty for the ship in 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.190
 The way the preparation is the main secret of the gourmet brigadeiro the 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.580
 ingredients are selected here for example of this is the palatine pop is a 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.720
 imported french balboa swiss chocolat mix 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.420
 and the most important is the care at the time of preparation 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 totally handcrafted 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.420
 It's the best German work of passion. 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.669
 a lot of people do not know but the brigadeiro is a genuinely Brazilian candy 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:17.099
 was created in the 40's to honor the Brigadier Eduardo Gomes 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.579
 then candidate for the presidency of the republic this chub that ended 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.949
 losing the elections but this is another point they are holding for life in 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.489
 yellow-green preference 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.290
 all this brazilianness of the Brigadier is not only in the emergence of the north not 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.930
 just take a look here our shop people find brigadeiro de cocada 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:38.779
 the winner stops 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:44.829
 sweet delight to mineira and even from paçoquinha I think the Greek paçoca a 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.519
 different thing a thing of edith brazil even the brigadeiro 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.479
 understood above him I think I did not stay there had a game 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.889
 specialized stores are a trend that has come to stay 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.810
 with new flavors the traditional fate of chocolat they rescue the 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.879
 taste of childhood has several references to sex 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:09.770
 memory of the people in it 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.819
 everyone remembers the importance of the house in the back 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.059
 little by little appropriate to the population she was already a very happy way
