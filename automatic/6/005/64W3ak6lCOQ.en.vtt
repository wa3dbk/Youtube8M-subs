00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:04.360
 me everyone 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.169
 w 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:11.359
 such 

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:12.559
 afp 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.939
 perhaps 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:16.139
 all is said 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.329
 ap 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.539
 ap bah 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.519
 several projects if the title of the album 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.079
 which means you say but it is because we have 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.560
 that is to say, I know how to do I know that others 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.560
 for me I would say one who says who knows how to solve 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.430
 % and series knows the solution without problems e it's bacon 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.170
 it was someone already he is in August 10 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.520
 because yes 6 riders search could reach 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.850
 and you 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.730
 finally I believe I believe 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.730
 we can do everything 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.950
 so we are a human being gig we have two feet of poaching a 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.690
 head for currency effect a brain yet one morning we know how to read and 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.770
 to write 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.770
 so for the bunkers for blow for trouble everywhere 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.760
 because we can not do all the others we can not get to everything 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.510
 make 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.680
 so that's a fight and 2 August 8th album 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.840
 for the time being 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.840
 between rap the slam she was on the ground 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.730
 so today it's simple project for the next album I'm inspired by it 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.170
 all the strokes of new musical streams of disciples from elsewhere 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.410
 discuss mali in africa this africa 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.359
 for 100 m2 between Asia and everywhere 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:35.150
 all over 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.950
 because their alarm is no limit 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.950
 the map ali mitha meals teeth in a tempting country 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.980

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.360
 and so that's not 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.320
 pme 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.120
 the code officer of the road but it remains celestial 2016 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.040
 especially since the day before 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.040

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.780
