 and then taking a little that matter of 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.849
 about design wanted to talk a little about 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.239

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.680
 difference that makes a car beautiful and the

 what makes a car is beautiful 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.739

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:31.090
 Good, I have this car here for who 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:34.700
 You do not know twingo renault released in 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:38.630
 mid 90's is a very strange car 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.700
 at first glance I would call ugly 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.430
 I thought it was very beautiful, I think it 's 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.340
 done but it's a very interesting car 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.310
 that I wanted to show you is in 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.370
 issue design terms 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.740
 he is a car that I learned a lot and 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.980
 like him and the first thing just because 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:02.510
 within I do not know if you can see 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.720
 exactly here but proposing a car was 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.780
 launched in the mid-1990s is a 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.460
 Well car was great fun. 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.159
 the concept that is very high today 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:18.200
 with the Czech with the sudden audi a1 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.840
 they are small cars and really 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.569
 fun he has a proposal 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.639
 differentiated and at the time it was 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:27.049
 reissued in solo released in colors 

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:30.319
 garish 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:33.560
 this is a model that is yellow 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:36.859
 the yellow buttons the panel is yellow o 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:41.600
 has a fabric that has some 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:43.459
 yellow parts is the day said gautam 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.479
 so at the time it was a car that did not 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:50.029
 sold well was criticized but if you 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.310
 to think well is to be part of the 

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:53.630
 car is a fun guy your car 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.149
 different 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.310
 another very cool thing about him is just the 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.270
 reclining seats, especially the 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.810
 rear 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.200
 Can you come back and train? 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.720
 enough behind you lose 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.090
 space in the trunk but it is a 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.360
 very spacious car 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.129
 I wanted to get there and it's a beautiful car. 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.209
 well I do not think it's a very car 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.400
 pretty 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.550
 I think you think so too, but there are people. 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.629
 You may think it's a beautiful thing. 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.690
 relative is very sieve 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:33.200
 personal is you can find your beautiful 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.890
 neighbor can find the level is one more 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.940
 Robot thing, because it 's a car. 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.900
 beautiful that was done in a good way 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.299
 thought out 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:50.000
 his project is it includes many 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.560
 parts fit so it was thought 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.200
 to be a different car the albertinho 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.920
 different colors on the inside of it 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.879
 different 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.200
 soon the modulation of the banks is made of 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.180
 a different way 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.379
 so it 's a very well thought out car 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:09.620
 structured forth a certain audience 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:12.379
 is this the main difference of a car 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.250
 beautiful car or your car is not there 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:21.079
 Something beautiful is a beautiful thing. 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.450
 the beautiful is totally and relative to 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.819
 person who is there now beautiful or 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.030
 you can not prove you can 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:32.510
 explain you can do another 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.940
 person to arrive at the project the car is 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.160
 there is what is bel 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.880
 so this is what I wanted to talk about today 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.769
 for you explained a little more 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.769
 in these design terms 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:49.430
 I hope it has become clear is that 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:51.410
 He wrote something down Comments 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.190
 I'll go there and then sign up for 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:59.560
 favorite jewelry channel to help and is 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.560
