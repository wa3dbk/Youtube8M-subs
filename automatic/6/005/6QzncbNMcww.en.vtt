 that Central American migrants 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.200
 continue climbing the train known as 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.450
 the beast with the purpose of arriving 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.010
 until American territory many 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.990
 of them have died in the attempt and 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.570
 others have suffered serious accidents 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.529
 joaquin sources tell us what are the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.529
 announced measures 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.520
 Anguish and fear of suffering more violence 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.470
 are the two feelings that worry 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.420
 thousands of migrants after the announcement of the 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.950
 Mexican government of not allowing them 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.610
 re-use the train called the beast 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.610
 to cross Mexico we will let 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.650
 which is the rise of so many migrants 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.010
 a week in 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.010
 trip 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.090
 in arriaga chiapas migrants see 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.920
 greater dangers and this decision is put 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.240
 in practice 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.680
 wilfrido travels from Honduras with his 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.410
 two children to try to make them arrive 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.120
 even his relatives in Colorado despite 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.650
 of the announcement of the Mexican government affirms 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.490
 that will continue trying to reach the 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.770
 USA 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.660
 the news that supposedly no longer 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.820
 will accept I do not know there are some who are 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.190
 coming back well for your country with all 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.720

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.940
 alternative to make paddle before and 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.830
 for specialists and defenders of the 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.360
 migrants will increase violence 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.400
 if the migrants can not get on the train 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.950
 and they are forced to use other 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.860
 means of transport is not a panorama 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.680
 nothing optimistic 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.890
 to begin with, how soon will they arrive? 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.810
 how many are trafficked to where they go and if 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.610

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.020
 they are going to be going to work they go 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.430
 to study once again the train that travels 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.410
 from the southeast of Mexico to the 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.870
 border with the united states and by 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.610
 where thousands of Central Americans arrive 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.740
 even the different hostels have 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.200
 left stranded with what is qualified 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.640
 this as a humanitarian tragedy the 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.410
 Mexican government will announce in 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.000

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.160
 stop the use of the train as a means of 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.560
 transport and achieve greater control in the 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.900
