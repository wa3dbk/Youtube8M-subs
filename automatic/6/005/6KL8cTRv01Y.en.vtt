00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
people are buying more and more rigid

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.140 
people are buying more and more rigid
shoes<00:01:12.130> because<00:01:13.130> of<00:01:13.310> their<00:01:13.400> deadlifts<00:01:14.000> and

because of their squatting they feel
rigid<00:01:16.040> is<00:01:16.160> better<00:01:16.970> than<00:01:17.150> a<00:01:17.210> soft<00:01:17.540> shoe<00:01:17.780> and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
rigid is better than a soft shoe and

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.820 
rigid is better than a soft shoe and
when<00:01:20.030> you're<00:01:20.180> going<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:21.050> buy<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.260> shoe<00:01:21.620> you

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
when you're going to buy the shoe you

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.470 
when you're going to buy the shoe you
put<00:01:22.010> your<00:01:22.190> foot<00:01:22.340> in<00:01:22.520> this<00:01:22.610> metal<00:01:23.000> plate<00:01:23.270> you're

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
put your foot in this metal plate you're

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.110 
put your foot in this metal plate you're
usually<00:01:23.630> sitting<00:01:24.170> down<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:24.830> when<00:01:25.790> you're<00:01:25.910> sit

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
usually sitting down and when you're sit

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.400 
usually sitting down and when you're sit
down<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:26.390> put<00:01:26.570> your<00:01:26.720> foot<00:01:26.870> and<00:01:26.990> metal<00:01:27.200> crate

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
down you put your foot and metal crate

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.590 
down you put your foot and metal crate
them<00:01:27.620> to<00:01:28.070> measure<00:01:28.340> it<00:01:28.580> we<00:01:29.210> call<00:01:29.390> that<00:01:29.420> the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
them to measure it we call that the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.680 
them to measure it we call that the
resting<00:01:30.110> state<00:01:30.140> so<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.680> foot<00:01:30.890> is<00:01:31.040> actually

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
resting state so the foot is actually

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.570 
resting state so the foot is actually
sitting<00:01:32.690> just<00:01:33.140> still<00:01:33.650> not<00:01:33.920> doing<00:01:34.130> anything

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
sitting just still not doing anything

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.880 
sitting just still not doing anything
it's<00:01:35.150> not<00:01:35.270> really<00:01:35.750> expanded<00:01:36.290> in<00:01:36.380> any<00:01:36.560> way<00:01:36.740> or

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
it's not really expanded in any way or

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.310 
it's not really expanded in any way or
form<00:01:37.120> but<00:01:38.120> then<00:01:38.360> we<00:01:38.690> go<00:01:38.810> ahead<00:01:38.870> and<00:01:38.960> we<00:01:39.050> take<00:01:39.290> a

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
form but then we go ahead and we take a

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.580 
form but then we go ahead and we take a
step<00:01:39.710> down<00:01:40.070> we<00:01:40.670> bend<00:01:40.940> at<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.120> knee<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:42.140> we<00:01:42.380> put

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
step down we bend at the knee and we put

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.380 
step down we bend at the knee and we put
load<00:01:42.890> on<00:01:43.130> that<00:01:43.310> foot<00:01:43.520> now<00:01:43.730> we<00:01:43.790> call<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.120> the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
load on that foot now we call that the

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.000 
load on that foot now we call that the
working<00:01:44.810> state<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.440> foot<00:01:45.620> actually

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
working state and the foot actually

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.890 
working state and the foot actually
spreads<00:01:46.610> apart<00:01:47.350> so<00:01:48.350> resting<00:01:48.920> stayed<00:01:49.160> close

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
spreads apart so resting stayed close

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.810 
spreads apart so resting stayed close
working<00:01:50.900> state<00:01:51.440> it<00:01:51.680> spreads<00:01:52.220> apart<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.730> it

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
working state it spreads apart and it

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.400 
working state it spreads apart and it
can<00:01:52.940> be<00:01:52.970> as<00:01:53.150> much<00:01:53.300> as<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.540> half<00:01:53.810> inch<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.200> an<00:01:54.320> inch

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
can be as much as a half inch to an inch

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.010 
can be as much as a half inch to an inch
depending<00:01:54.680> on<00:01:54.980> a<00:01:55.010> person's<00:01:55.250> foot<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:56.690> you<00:01:56.780> can

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
depending on a person's foot so you can

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.320 
depending on a person's foot so you can
imagine<00:01:57.110> you<00:01:57.680> you<00:01:58.160> buy<00:01:58.400> a<00:01:58.430> shoe<00:01:58.880> you<00:01:59.090> stick

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
imagine you you buy a shoe you stick

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.510 
imagine you you buy a shoe you stick
your<00:01:59.480> foot<00:01:59.690> and<00:01:59.810> it<00:01:59.930> feels<00:02:00.170> comfortable<00:02:00.520> but

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
your foot and it feels comfortable but

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.130 
your foot and it feels comfortable but
then<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:01.790> start<00:02:02.060> working<00:02:02.510> out<00:02:02.660> that<00:02:02.870> foot

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
then you start working out that foot

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.500 
then you start working out that foot
swells<00:02:03.470> up<00:02:03.800> blood<00:02:04.610> starts<00:02:04.940> getting<00:02:05.210> in<00:02:05.330> there

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
swells up blood starts getting in there

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.660 
swells up blood starts getting in there
and<00:02:05.630> what<00:02:06.320> ends<00:02:06.560> up<00:02:06.620> happening<00:02:06.680> is<00:02:07.190> there's<00:02:07.490> no

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
and what ends up happening is there's no

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.729 
and what ends up happening is there's no
room<00:02:07.940> for<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.269> five<00:02:08.479> metatarsal<00:02:09.229> heads<00:02:09.440> at

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
room for the five metatarsal heads at

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.729 
room for the five metatarsal heads at
the<00:02:10.310> top<00:02:10.489> of<00:02:10.519> your<00:02:10.910> foot<00:02:11.420> there<00:02:11.480> so<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.590> five

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
the top of your foot there so the five

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:13.860 
the top of your foot there so the five
minute<00:02:13.069> or<00:02:13.219> so<00:02:13.370> heads<00:02:13.549> can

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
minute or so heads can

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.259 
minute or so heads can
I move<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:15.610> they<00:02:15.760> end<00:02:15.879> up<00:02:16.000> banging

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
I move and so they end up banging

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.080 
I move and so they end up banging
together<00:02:16.690> they<00:02:17.140> actually<00:02:17.500> just<00:02:18.129> get<00:02:18.700> crushed

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
together they actually just get crushed

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.660 
together they actually just get crushed
and<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:20.290> they<00:02:20.500> have<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.769> either<00:02:20.860> move<00:02:21.310> planner

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
and so they have to either move planner

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.149 
and so they have to either move planner
or<00:02:22.000> door<00:02:22.299> sleep<00:02:22.629> so<00:02:23.379> the<00:02:23.500> bones<00:02:23.709> can<00:02:23.920> get<00:02:24.069> out

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
or door sleep so the bones can get out

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.250 
or door sleep so the bones can get out
of<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.310> way<00:02:24.459> right<00:02:24.959> this<00:02:25.959> causes

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
of the way right this causes

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.309 
of the way right this causes
inflammation<00:02:27.180> also<00:02:28.180> causes<00:02:28.659> a<00:02:28.690> Titan<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.260> the

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
inflammation also causes a Titan of the

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.059 
inflammation also causes a Titan of the
tissue<00:02:29.590> or<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.640> fasciae<00:02:31.180> that's<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.799> lies

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
tissue or the fasciae that's that lies

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.949 
tissue or the fasciae that's that lies
around<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.549> muscle<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:36.420> what<00:02:37.420> we<00:02:37.629> recommend

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
around the muscle so what we recommend

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.710 
around the muscle so what we recommend
doing<00:02:38.560> is<00:02:39.129> and<00:02:39.640> i'm<00:02:40.090> going<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.269> show<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.480> here

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
doing is and i'm going to show you here

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.020 
doing is and i'm going to show you here
on<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.900> board<00:02:41.140> is<00:02:41.489> understanding<00:02:42.489> how<00:02:42.640> to

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
on the board is understanding how to

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.270 
on the board is understanding how to
make<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.659> flexible<00:02:44.319> again<00:02:44.680> how<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:44.950> make<00:02:45.129> the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
make that flexible again how to make the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.030 
make that flexible again how to make the
fasciae<00:02:45.940> more<00:02:46.390> fluid<00:02:46.870> in<00:02:46.989> nature<00:02:47.319> so<00:02:47.829> it's<00:02:47.980> not

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
fasciae more fluid in nature so it's not

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.460 
fasciae more fluid in nature so it's not
so<00:02:48.370> tight<00:02:48.609> it's<00:02:48.849> not<00:02:49.030> these<00:02:49.480> micro<00:02:49.959> tears<00:02:50.230> are

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
so tight it's not these micro tears are

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.759 
so tight it's not these micro tears are
not<00:02:50.500> happening<00:02:51.010> in<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.280> tissue<00:02:51.489> itself<00:02:51.940> and

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
not happening in the tissue itself and

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.280 
not happening in the tissue itself and
in<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:54.519> explanation<00:02:55.209> that<00:02:55.359> I<00:02:55.390> like<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.079> give

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
in the explanation that I like to give

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.899 
in the explanation that I like to give
on<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.950> board<00:02:57.190> here<00:02:57.459> is<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:59.709> spine<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.280> the

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
on the board here is the spine and the

we know that the foot has 26 bones in it
right<00:03:06.489> you<00:03:07.209> have<00:03:07.329> seven<00:03:07.750> tarsals<00:03:08.260> five

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
right you have seven tarsals five

the Fae lynxes the spine tube has 26
bones<00:03:14.730> all<00:03:15.730> right<00:03:15.879> you've<00:03:16.030> got<00:03:16.060> seven

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
bones all right you've got seven

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.599 
bones all right you've got seven
cervical<00:03:16.930> 12<00:03:17.319> thoracic<00:03:17.530> five<00:03:18.099> lumbar<00:03:18.430> the

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
cervical 12 thoracic five lumbar the

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.879 
cervical 12 thoracic five lumbar the
sacrum<00:03:19.180> Cox<00:03:19.419> of<00:03:19.599> jail<00:03:19.780> these<00:03:20.380> are<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.680> bones

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
sacrum Cox of jail these are the bones

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.670 
sacrum Cox of jail these are the bones
of<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.250> spine<00:03:21.340> in<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.819> foot<00:03:22.060> now<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:23.380> whole

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
of the spine in the foot now the whole

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.650 
of the spine in the foot now the whole
idea<00:03:23.919> of<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.430> spine<00:03:24.730> you<00:03:25.000> guys<00:03:25.180> know<00:03:25.419> this

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
idea of the spine you guys know this

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.770 
idea of the spine you guys know this
because<00:03:26.319> it<00:03:26.650> isn't<00:03:26.980> an<00:03:27.069> S<00:03:27.250> formation<00:03:27.910> is<00:03:28.329> to

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
because it isn't an S formation is to

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.289 
because it isn't an S formation is to
absorb<00:03:29.019> load<00:03:29.349> so<00:03:30.280> every<00:03:30.459> time<00:03:30.489> you<00:03:30.669> jump<00:03:31.180> up

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
absorb load so every time you jump up

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.629 
absorb load so every time you jump up
and<00:03:31.629> down<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:32.200> spine<00:03:32.919> acts<00:03:33.250> like<00:03:33.489> a<00:03:33.519> shock

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
and down that spine acts like a shock

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.360 
and down that spine acts like a shock
absorber<00:03:34.019> okay<00:03:35.019> and<00:03:35.260> if<00:03:35.799> you<00:03:35.889> have<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.069> strong

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
absorber okay and if you have a strong

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.470 
absorber okay and if you have a strong
muscular<00:03:36.940> system<00:03:37.329> that<00:03:37.900> also<00:03:38.200> helps<00:03:38.919> with<00:03:39.069> the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
muscular system that also helps with the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.909 
muscular system that also helps with the
stabilization<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:41.019> transferring<00:03:41.799> of

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
stabilization and the transferring of

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.180 
stabilization and the transferring of
load<00:03:42.190> properly<00:03:42.579> throughout<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.419> body<00:03:44.190> but

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
load properly throughout the body but

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.979 
load properly throughout the body but
what<00:03:45.340> people<00:03:45.639> do<00:03:45.760> not<00:03:45.879> realize<00:03:46.419> is<00:03:46.629> the<00:03:46.750> foot

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
what people do not realize is the foot

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.740 
what people do not realize is the foot
does<00:03:47.199> the<00:03:47.379> exact<00:03:47.739> same<00:03:47.769> thing<00:03:48.419> we've<00:03:49.419> heard<00:03:49.599> of

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
does the exact same thing we've heard of

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.689

you can feel it moving up and down that
is<00:04:13.359> absorbing<00:04:13.959> load<00:04:14.519> so<00:04:15.519> now<00:04:15.699> let's<00:04:16.000> say<00:04:16.150> we

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
is absorbing load so now let's say we

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.379 
is absorbing load so now let's say we
decide<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:16.989> get<00:04:17.079> an<00:04:17.199> orthotic<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.880> we<00:04:19.000> put<00:04:19.269> it

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
decide to get an orthotic and we put it

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.990 
decide to get an orthotic and we put it
in<00:04:19.510> that<00:04:19.690> transverse<00:04:20.199> arch<00:04:20.470> or<00:04:21.430> we<00:04:21.760> wear<00:04:21.969> a

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
in that transverse arch or we wear a

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.540 
in that transverse arch or we wear a
real<00:04:22.300> rigid<00:04:22.599> shoe<00:04:23.050> what<00:04:23.860> we've<00:04:24.039> effectively

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
real rigid shoe what we've effectively

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.080 
real rigid shoe what we've effectively
done<00:04:24.849> is<00:04:25.030> what

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
done is what

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.030 
done is what
we<00:04:27.150> stop<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.720> function<00:04:28.199> of<00:04:28.380> this<00:04:28.560> foot<00:04:28.830> from

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
we stop the function of this foot from

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.909 
we stop the function of this foot from
absorbing<00:04:29.340> load<00:04:29.760> now<00:04:30.630> it's<00:04:30.840> just<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:31.169> stump

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
absorbing load now it's just a stump

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.700 
absorbing load now it's just a stump
just<00:04:32.550> a<00:04:32.639> hard<00:04:32.910> stump<00:04:33.360> that<00:04:33.600> we're<00:04:34.169> standing<00:04:34.590> up

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
just a hard stump that we're standing up

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.800 
just a hard stump that we're standing up
and<00:04:34.860> down<00:04:35.040> and<00:04:35.430> these<00:04:35.940> muscles<00:04:36.360> are<00:04:36.479> not<00:04:36.630> being

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
and down and these muscles are not being

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.620 
and down and these muscles are not being
exercised<00:04:37.500> at<00:04:37.800> all<00:04:37.949> they're<00:04:38.880> not<00:04:38.970> exercising

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
exercised at all they're not exercising

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.629 
exercised at all they're not exercising
they're<00:04:40.110> not<00:04:40.229> articulating<00:04:41.070> they're<00:04:41.430> not

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
they're not articulating they're not

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.070 
they're not articulating they're not
moving<00:04:41.880> I<00:04:42.120> think<00:04:42.300> that's<00:04:42.449> why<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.600> Indians

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
moving I think that's why the Indians

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.870 
moving I think that's why the Indians
had<00:04:43.260> it<00:04:43.380> so<00:04:43.560> good<00:04:43.590> then<00:04:44.340> we're<00:04:44.580> a<00:04:44.610> thin

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
had it so good then we're a thin

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.879 
had it so good then we're a thin
moccasin<00:04:45.540> over<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:45.780> foot<00:04:45.990> so<00:04:46.380> if<00:04:46.470> they<00:04:46.620> walked

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
moccasin over the foot so if they walked

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.920 
moccasin over the foot so if they walked
up<00:04:47.070> and<00:04:47.250> down<00:04:47.280> hillsides<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:48.210> foot<00:04:48.750> would

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
up and down hillsides that foot would

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.710 
up and down hillsides that foot would
move<00:04:49.229> around<00:04:49.530> like<00:04:49.770> our<00:04:49.919> hand<00:04:50.160> does<00:04:50.540> it<00:04:51.540> would

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
move around like our hand does it would

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.260 
move around like our hand does it would
open<00:04:52.080> up<00:04:52.199> those<00:04:52.410> heads<00:04:53.130> of<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.790> bones<00:04:54.000> would

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
open up those heads of the bones would

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.909 
open up those heads of the bones would
open<00:04:54.479> up<00:04:54.540> that<00:04:54.720> blood<00:04:54.990> flow<00:04:55.260> go<00:04:55.470> right<00:04:55.680> up<00:04:55.830> to

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
open up that blood flow go right up to

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.830 
open up that blood flow go right up to
the<00:04:56.040> tips<00:04:56.280> of<00:04:56.400> their<00:04:56.490> toes<00:04:56.729> but<00:04:57.570> they<00:04:57.780> were

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
the tips of their toes but they were

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.110 
the tips of their toes but they were
protected<00:04:58.560> for<00:04:58.680> maybe<00:04:58.860> cut<00:04:59.160> on<00:04:59.280> a<00:04:59.310> rock<00:04:59.610> or<00:04:59.639> a

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
protected for maybe cut on a rock or a

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.740 
protected for maybe cut on a rock or a
spur<00:05:00.540> or<00:05:00.720> something<00:05:00.990> like<00:05:01.080> that<00:05:02.150> so<00:05:03.150> a<00:05:03.450> tight

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
spur or something like that so a tight

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.750 
spur or something like that so a tight
shoe<00:05:04.020> we're<00:05:04.620> going<00:05:04.770> to<00:05:04.830> lose<00:05:05.010> the<00:05:05.070> mobility

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
shoe we're going to lose the mobility

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.760 
shoe we're going to lose the mobility
we're<00:05:06.479> going<00:05:06.600> to<00:05:06.660> lose<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:06.960> energy<00:05:07.590> that's

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
we're going to lose the energy that's

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.860 
we're going to lose the energy that's
needed<00:05:08.190> for<00:05:08.220> building<00:05:08.790> muscles<00:05:09.210> in<00:05:09.389> our<00:05:09.570> faith

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
needed for building muscles in our faith

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.610 
needed for building muscles in our faith
they<00:05:10.200> will<00:05:10.229> grow<00:05:10.620> they<00:05:10.919> get<00:05:11.130> strong<00:05:11.570> okay<00:05:12.620> so

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
they will grow they get strong okay so

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.800 
they will grow they get strong okay so
what<00:05:13.800> I<00:05:13.830> recommend<00:05:13.919> is<00:05:14.610> trying<00:05:15.000> to<00:05:15.210> squat

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
what I recommend is trying to squat

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.560 
what I recommend is trying to squat
barefoot<00:05:16.410> then<00:05:16.680> let<00:05:16.919> the<00:05:16.950> barefoot<00:05:17.520> or<00:05:17.760> run

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
barefoot then let the barefoot or run

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.930 
barefoot then let the barefoot or run
barefoot<00:05:19.080> as<00:05:19.260> much<00:05:19.590> as<00:05:19.860> you<00:05:20.010> possibly<00:05:20.190> can<00:05:20.760> now

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
barefoot as much as you possibly can now

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.940 
barefoot as much as you possibly can now
that's<00:05:21.210> winter<00:05:21.479> here<00:05:21.810> obviously<00:05:22.740> we're<00:05:22.889> not

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
that's winter here obviously we're not

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.320 
that's winter here obviously we're not
going<00:05:23.010> to<00:05:23.160> go<00:05:23.250> out<00:05:23.280> on<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.669> ice<00:05:23.700> with<00:05:24.030> our<00:05:24.180> bare

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
going to go out on the ice with our bare

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.140 
going to go out on the ice with our bare
feet<00:05:24.360> not<00:05:24.810> good<00:05:25.100> but<00:05:26.100> as<00:05:26.280> much<00:05:26.490> barefoot<00:05:26.940> work

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
feet not good but as much barefoot work

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.360 
feet not good but as much barefoot work
as<00:05:27.300> we<00:05:27.449> possibly<00:05:27.690> can<00:05:28.110> do<00:05:28.320> then<00:05:28.979> we'll<00:05:29.160> start

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
as we possibly can do then we'll start

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.300 
as we possibly can do then we'll start
to<00:05:29.490> see<00:05:29.520> a<00:05:29.699> lessening<00:05:30.240> of<00:05:30.360> this<00:05:30.570> fasciitis<00:05:31.050> and

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
to see a lessening of this fasciitis and

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.310 
to see a lessening of this fasciitis and
we'll<00:05:32.310> start<00:05:32.520> to<00:05:32.669> see<00:05:32.700> the<00:05:33.229> improvement<00:05:34.229> of

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
we'll start to see the improvement of

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.170 
we'll start to see the improvement of
your<00:05:34.500> squats<00:05:34.830> go<00:05:35.039> up<00:05:35.250> your<00:05:35.430> strength<00:05:35.789> will<00:05:35.970> go

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
your squats go up your strength will go

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.909 
your squats go up your strength will go
up<00:05:36.300> and<00:05:36.450> you<00:05:36.870> know<00:05:36.990> what<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.200> sensory<00:05:37.680> nerves

with surface improves where you're at
your<00:05:51.479> awareness<00:05:52.039> not<00:05:53.039> only<00:05:53.099> just<00:05:53.400> muscular
