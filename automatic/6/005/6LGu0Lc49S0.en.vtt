00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.950
 hi here I am still here third video that 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.719
 load I'm even doing even 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.620
 the habit of speaking alone with the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.910
 camera and you could n't be that crazy 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.539
 in short, even on this front we will have to 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.390
 still work on this video vi 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.070
 I speak of measures do not eliminate stops 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.060
 of the fact that in my life it is necessary 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.550
 weigh everything here is what you already have 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.399
 saying out of boredom are indeed in the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.050
 just your own guaranteed fun 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.129
 in short, he did other things to amuse me 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:46.440
 however reduced and therefore we do it 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.390
 let's do it some so I have to think 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.660
 even the oil this would seem 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.690
 indeed there are actually some authors 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.940
 tricks depends on the day anyway 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.710
 I always have a 20 30 thousand liters of oil and 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.949
 clearly I repeat it with the scale 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.939
 how do my weight books with the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.680
 teaspoon 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.860
 in the sense that I know a teaspoon 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.710
 I am 5 mm so it will be good for ministers 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.630
 I know that in a day or 4 that's from 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.689
 distribute as I wish then a 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.570
 small hole and I am 5 mm and one that I am 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.540
 ten the same applies to milk in 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.350
 car home want me to put it 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.710
 in a search 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.650
 maybe instead of having 250 mornings 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.500
 I had a little less I drink 150 and then 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.000
 maybe I can use it to cook because 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.100
 no since they can distribute 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.750
 foods we try to cook so 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.430
 something to eat disagreements including 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:47.100
 between my theory and then 10 milliliters the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.159
 spoon 5 the teaspoon 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.579
 other thing is the morning I do n't know I have it 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:57.270
 bed but in basic in my sheet of 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.979
 diet or brioche with a hood yes 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.620
 part well his name does not wake up and 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.740
 glad no 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.540
 if I want to replace it with other foods 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.119
 I can do it because we have tables 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.900
 conversion always provided by 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.480
 dietician and so you can convert 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.670
 foods in those that do 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.220
 Today they prefer not to spinach 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.650
 more want because I ate week 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.140
 last do not make me more I want the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.210
 lettuce I am crazy but admits that 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.000
 I want the toga I can convert 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.250
 will change the weight and ok, enough to 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.430
 always stay on the weight and denied 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.050
 Belgian parade and you can do so if I 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.600
 I want to change really big in 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.850
 cereal i can do it i know why i have it 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.950
 already rewarded more times than the brioche 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.250
 corresponds to 45 to 40 grams of 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.890
 celebrate cereal that bores you but weigh them 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.440
 right revolt but not because I know 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.450
 that my 40 grams that I'm in here 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.070
 I will put the video away immediately 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.960
 because they can't go as below 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.790
 I leave you this morning I am a 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.700
 glass like this, fill it with mine 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.310
 full every morning if I want to 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.100
 I fill this cereal with what it has 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.709
 obviously counting to answer is enough 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:18.239
 that you do it the first time I know I can 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:20.130
 tell you a little general line that state 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.130
 happy real 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.850
 otherwise from greens under the nose and behold 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.340
 made that a pack of butter e 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.770
 present those tiny ones of the verb for 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.860
 say they are 10 15 grams right for 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:39.739
 understand each other and a bottle of sugar 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.920
 of the bar are five grams a glass 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.310
 of wine about 100 mm 1 enough that 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.080
 the offense once that is with a measuring cup 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.989
 perilli then just check one 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.580
 time that glass weighs 100 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.560
 milliliters however he on life 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.629
 market or generally, that a 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.330
 glass of wine is 100 milliliters a 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:02.269
 glass of those from you a song a 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.840
 head for a glass of water not 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.760
 the fullest are 200 in the sense that a 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.970
 glass of water like this duty 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.220
 real threats so far more or less so 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.010
 that is 200 milliliters so if instead 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.209
 leprosy hood i want milk and i can 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.209
 clearly replace it 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.960
 I know how much milk I can drink without having to 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.360
 each time measuring can weigh the 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.720
 foods that we know are a break 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.440
 then these are some ideas 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.530
 in general to avoid weighing 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.980
 whenever it is missing it makes us boring 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.650
 waste time e 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.840
 not even so much desire to do so if 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.510
 you want some other idea some other 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.550
 replacement in something that avoids me 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:52.310
 break pedal and let me know either 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:55.310
 I thank you if we don't talk to you once 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.310
 Hello
