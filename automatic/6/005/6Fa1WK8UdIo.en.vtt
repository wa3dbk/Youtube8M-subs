00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.900
 find we have 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:15.889
 just like said very good performance of the film valve india 125 ccfallhe 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.369
 who wrote as the individual 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.609
 and ultimately even all is good and post videos 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.460
 this turf of the vreg 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.430
 and then there is again at the head of that says henk van mierlo 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.429
 van mierlo who ran into problems 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.429
 that guy is the motto during the course 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.800
 technical problems everyone kept their heart on the job 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.700
 van mierlo is a trophy rider view the new on the road and as you pass the 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.629
 side then the cook just lodges 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.420
 And then I would take a chance 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.420
 Prophet team that is completely lost 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.340
 he wanted to sail 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.800
 commercial runs that is the advantage of light 125 meters sleeps 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.520
 anyway 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.570
 then the country has already left 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.570
 it is not an explanation 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.240
 that is why grass is still included 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.330
 but all eyes were on henk van mierlo that he could not come otherwise 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.220
 namely too many free feet 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.220
 compromises 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.800
 the finish flag 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.130
 Van Mierlo knows that all the happiness in the world is 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.009
 after a sixth place to ride he does not at least finish with the heels over 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.480
 the ditch 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.480
 and there he was very happy in the end 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.590
 the trophy 10 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.930
 not in danger 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.930
 tonight of ireland finish 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.650
 there comes applause 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.170
 Brewer I hear I'm honest in Breda you would also run a nice price 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.679
 a criminal case with excelsior million euros 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:15.849
 there you can do with your life 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.459
 with it you can do what you want if you as the tenants know we are the man the 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.230
 to report a bicycle 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.230
 that is the last twenty years 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:27.329
 the 250 points then earn it 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.560
 arjan brouwer in focus on the past few days 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.159
 or the saliva test set great times 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.319
 of the four the favorite 15 schalkwijk 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.659
 schalkwijk one of the surprises of these six-day hilversumbers 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:47.249
 according to the summer for five hits 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:51.769
 those two suspects are a big competitor less 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.969
 they assisted these bastards 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:59.229
 second place individual classification in the class 250 cubic centimeters 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:06.009
 are not posted 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:10.169
 put everything on everything you should not take a risk he grabs the head feed I have 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.179
 people and the Englishman 

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:14.359
 the factory is that with the swede 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.450
 the tip that goes to the Frenchman and of course Jan Postma and no other 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.379
 that because the German Nazi had fallen 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:24.490
 the teams try 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.090
 to play as well as possible tracks this year when it is really down to 25 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:33.809
 he must try to get close to schalkwijk 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:37.680
 In fact, he must try to get past Sunday as possible 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:38.470
 mean 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.739
 that it could take over the management 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.739
 infiniti or classification in the class the 250cc 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.349
 don't get involved 9 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:51.659
 tenth position 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.369
 chased 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:54.719
 he hopes by one 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.719
 the GDR driver in eleventh place 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:00.109
 joost posthuma 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.910
 postma who eventually takes over the lead 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.799
 but I am in Schalkwijk 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.799
 or think you are especially for your own audience 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.879
 he was allowed to pass it 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.879
 from martin schalkwijk 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.459
 ms schalkwijk just needed to consolidate a head start 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.719
 posthumously 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:28.639
 then it will turn out to be people 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.419
 grembergen who climbs to and ninth place and 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.270
 by a deep tenth 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.810
 while peter van den nieuwenhof has now become the bulk of the man 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:37.710
 driven 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.129
 being one of the East Germans 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.129
 van den nieuwenhof one of the four from the permanent team 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.729
 then its admittedly 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:52.249
 the costs but on the rear wheel across the finish 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.840
 for schalkwijk 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.710
 and the drama of one of them 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.779
 East Germans 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:03.629
 he says 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:06.629
 bet shows again this week 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:11.029
 if, as trophies, you were out of the chance at that time, GDP was 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.559
 at the head of the rankings 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:15.630
 so he pushes a motorcycle 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.309
 across the line 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:21.789
 the ddr regime is still in charge 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.789
 and falls exhausted beside the man 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.060
 later I have it all for nothing 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.110
 28 seconds ahead ap at that moment the team of the ddr 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.740
 on the steam of the netherlands it should have been fought in the 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.300
 class 560 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.059
 you feel a bit safe but i think 

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:52.969
 with a terrible accident that he was behind last year too 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:54.589
 terrible 

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:56.710
 but in schalkwijk after the contributed 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.740
 he could finish 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.710
 these men had to fight that out 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.819
 for this is the friends of the band 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:06.319
 for the individual rankings who did not would become world champions and those 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:09.050
 impossible 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.169
 taking advantage 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.169
 the absolute top whether he is in the field of 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:18.599
 the race over 50 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:20.430
 28 they are following the bus 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.300
 mouscron dutch professional clubs 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.960
 on the ddr 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.960
 also go home as a profit team with the world title 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:31.930
 an innocent fall 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.539
 newspaper all eyes were on yes yes i and ii 53 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.439
 and the 173 youth ships 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:41.330
 the bdp cooler again 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.080
 reason very handsome after falling off the road 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.449
 on one the seventh and on a 9 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:50.400
 late and that meant that this man henk gate and terribly hard on 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.289
 to pull 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:56.289
 the increase on that difference 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.139
 28 seconds 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:02.139
 it will be a good thing to start with 

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:05.059
 he had support but then 

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:06.759
 now the big drama is happening 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:08.419
 then falls is bad 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:10.550
 one of the ddr 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.550
 he seems to break his legs 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:19.229
 look what a drama 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.789
 because not alone 

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:29.780
 in the game it is off course but there is also every opportunity from the dwm team 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:35.860
 on the world title you get the world title in the netherlands due to this situation 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.379
 shot thrown 

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:41.099
 maybe an hour that the swedish anderson 

00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:42.719
 who will say 

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:45.719
 in any case, it is not decided the world title 

00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:50.779
 and that while henk for the club is still tight in the game 

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:52.599
 owns 

00:07:52.599 --> 00:07:55.610
 and then camp is no match 

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.580
 of the ven that puppet show 

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.539
 this man at the end of September
