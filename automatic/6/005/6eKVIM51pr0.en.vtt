00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
poured a little bit just enough to cover

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.949 
poured a little bit just enough to cover
the<00:02:32.320> onions<00:02:32.890> okay<00:02:36.540> okay<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.660> then<00:02:37.750> I'm<00:02:37.930> just

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
the onions okay okay and then I'm just

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.470

gonna<00:02:38.260> add<00:02:38.470> some<00:02:38.500> of<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.100> ground<00:02:39.310> up<00:02:39.640> perilla

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
gonna add some of the ground up perilla

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.930 
gonna add some of the ground up perilla
seeds<00:02:40.900> or<00:02:41.380> perilla<00:02:41.890> seed<00:02:42.160> powder<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.670> guess

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
seeds or perilla seed powder I guess

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.400 
seeds or perilla seed powder I guess
it's<00:02:43.120> easier<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.480> say<00:02:43.690> perilla<00:02:43.989> seed<00:02:44.200> powder

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
it's easier to say perilla seed powder

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:55.130 
it's easier to say perilla seed powder
and<00:02:45.600> just<00:02:46.600> mix<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.080> in<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.290> little<00:02:47.739> bit<00:02:47.920> yeah

so<00:03:41.650> then<00:03:41.770> I<00:03:41.860> remember<00:03:42.160> I<00:03:42.220> forgot<00:03:42.490> to<00:03:42.610> put<00:03:42.730> in

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
so then I remember I forgot to put in

so then I remember I forgot to put in
garlic<00:03:43.120> in<00:03:43.390> salt<00:03:43.690> before<00:03:44.050> I<00:03:44.260> put<00:03:44.500> it<00:03:44.560> in<00:03:44.650> the

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
garlic in salt before I put it in the

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.650 
garlic in salt before I put it in the
zucchini<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.280> shrimp<00:03:45.580> but<00:03:45.790> anyway<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:46.210> add

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
zucchini and shrimp but anyway so add

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.410 
zucchini and shrimp but anyway so add
1/4<00:03:47.080> of<00:03:47.710> a<00:03:47.800> tablespoon<00:03:48.160> of<00:03:48.610> garlic<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:51.420> then

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
1/4 of a tablespoon of garlic and then

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.570 
1/4 of a tablespoon of garlic and then
add<00:03:52.660> salt<00:03:53.110> to<00:03:53.260> taste<00:03:53.500> it<00:03:53.980> just<00:03:54.010> depends<00:03:54.520> on

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
add salt to taste it just depends on

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.600 
add salt to taste it just depends on
your<00:03:54.640> taste<00:03:55.120> I<00:03:55.360> like<00:03:55.660> things<00:03:55.930> not<00:03:56.260> so<00:03:56.770> salty<00:03:57.520> I

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
your taste I like things not so salty I

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.190 
your taste I like things not so salty I
like<00:03:57.820> the<00:03:57.940> natural<00:03:58.270> flavor<00:03:58.480> of<00:03:58.630> it<00:03:58.750> so<00:03:58.840> I<00:03:58.870> tend

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
like the natural flavor of it so I tend

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.290 
like the natural flavor of it so I tend
to<00:03:59.350> not<00:03:59.470> add<00:03:59.680> so<00:03:59.920> much<00:04:00.040> salt<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.520> then<00:04:01.060> now<00:04:01.270> I

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
to not add so much salt and then now I

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:08.880 
to not add so much salt and then now I
just<00:04:01.450> boil<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:02.110> for<00:04:02.290> 15<00:04:02.709> to<00:04:03.640> 20<00:04:04.030> minutes<00:04:07.890> okay

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
just boil it for 15 to 20 minutes okay

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.310 
just boil it for 15 to 20 minutes okay
so<00:04:08.920> it's<00:04:09.310> finished<00:04:09.820> I<00:04:09.970> really<00:04:10.360> love<00:04:10.600> perilla

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
so it's finished I really love perilla
