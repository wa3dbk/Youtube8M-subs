00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.000

 Main for the different pieces here must be extended 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.660

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.630
 all the before the media 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.630

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.449
 and 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.779
 Top ten 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:07.779
 so violent that women are a bit stupid 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:13.529

 with more 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.869

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:17.479
 on background background information 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.530
 but this vocation must go the statute of Nostromo - the Catholic 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.529
 and the post office 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:31.039
 to all in the team that is of course very nice meanwhile one finds todayadays 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.169
 Also do not outweigh the foil or blu-ray box that one bothers

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.870
 these boxes 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.689
 in the future can be very complete nonsense 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:15.490
 35 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.800

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:43.819
 this classic film series 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:47.300
 while here maybe did not just have to have valuable box like 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.370
 said to cost around accordingly 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.449
