um<00:00:00.089> I<00:00:00.570> was<00:00:00.930> wanted<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.290> ask

00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:01.689 
um I was wanted to ask

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:03.689 
um I was wanted to ask
question<00:00:01.900> of<00:00:01.989> what<00:00:02.230> is<00:00:02.379> mucoid<00:00:02.920> plaque<00:00:02.949> and

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:03.699 
question of what is mucoid plaque and

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:05.760 
question of what is mucoid plaque and
have<00:00:04.330> any<00:00:04.480> of<00:00:04.660> your<00:00:04.779> fasteners<00:00:05.170> expelled<00:00:05.649> it

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:05.770 
have any of your fasteners expelled it

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:14.600 
have any of your fasteners expelled it
at<00:00:05.890> the<00:00:06.070> retreat

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.760 

yeah<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:17.770> could<00:00:17.950> plaque<00:00:18.250> is<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:20.529> know<00:00:20.619> I'll

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
yeah you could plaque is you know I'll

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.769 
yeah you could plaque is you know I'll
say<00:00:21.279> it's<00:00:21.460> this<00:00:21.670> theoretical<00:00:22.270> thing<00:00:22.509> because

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
say it's this theoretical thing because

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.660 
say it's this theoretical thing because
medicine<00:00:23.529> says<00:00:23.740> it<00:00:23.890> doesn't<00:00:24.160> exist<00:00:24.430> right

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
medicine says it doesn't exist right

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.429 
medicine says it doesn't exist right
medicine<00:00:25.180> says<00:00:25.360> no<00:00:25.570> there's<00:00:25.840> no<00:00:25.960> such<00:00:26.140> thing

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
medicine says no there's no such thing

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.070 
medicine says no there's no such thing
you<00:00:27.009> know<00:00:27.099> the<00:00:27.220> people<00:00:28.090> who<00:00:28.119> do<00:00:28.270> colonoscopies

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
you know the people who do colonoscopies

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.569 
you know the people who do colonoscopies
and<00:00:29.110> cetera<00:00:29.770> they<00:00:29.890> go<00:00:30.009> in<00:00:30.160> there<00:00:30.369> and<00:00:30.460> they

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
and cetera they go in there and they

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.450 
and cetera they go in there and they
says<00:00:30.759> nothing<00:00:31.149> in<00:00:31.270> there<00:00:31.419> but<00:00:32.460> theoretically

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
says nothing in there but theoretically

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.260 
says nothing in there but theoretically
we<00:00:33.820> won't<00:00:34.030> link<00:00:34.270> up<00:00:34.360> with<00:00:34.390> this<00:00:34.660> hard-coding

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
we won't link up with this hard-coding

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.440 
we won't link up with this hard-coding
inside<00:00:37.270> the<00:00:37.570> intestines<00:00:38.200> and<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:42.340> would<00:00:42.790> if<00:00:43.000> it

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
inside the intestines and it would if it

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.029 
inside the intestines and it would if it
existed<00:00:43.960> it<00:00:44.200> would<00:00:44.489> dramatically<00:00:47.039> negatively

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
existed it would dramatically negatively

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:49.770 
existed it would dramatically negatively
impact<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.609> body's<00:00:48.879> ability<00:00:49.000> to<00:00:49.329> assimilate

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
impact the body's ability to assimilate

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.229 
impact the body's ability to assimilate
nutrients<00:00:50.769> at<00:00:51.100> least<00:00:51.399> through<00:00:51.609> that<00:00:51.820> section

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
nutrients at least through that section

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.419 
nutrients at least through that section
of<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:52.780> intestine<00:00:53.260> we<00:00:53.890> got<00:00:54.039> lots<00:00:54.309> of

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
of the intestine we got lots of

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.819 
of the intestine we got lots of
intestines<00:00:54.969> I<00:00:55.059> mean<00:00:55.210> we're<00:00:55.359> 32<00:00:56.320> feet<00:00:56.589> from

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
intestines I mean we're 32 feet from

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.299 
intestines I mean we're 32 feet from
mouth<00:00:57.160> to<00:00:57.429> anus<00:00:57.899> roughly<00:00:58.899> 10<00:00:59.140> meters<00:00:59.620> there's

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
mouth to anus roughly 10 meters there's

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.220 
mouth to anus roughly 10 meters there's
a<00:01:00.399> lot<00:01:00.670> of<00:01:00.850> small<00:01:01.210> intestine<00:01:01.719> they're<00:01:01.870> mostly

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
a lot of small intestine they're mostly

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.959 
a lot of small intestine they're mostly
the<00:01:02.350> large<00:01:02.530> intestine<00:01:03.039> is<00:01:03.100> something<00:01:03.730> under

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
the large intestine is something under

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.020 
the large intestine is something under
two<00:01:04.239> meters<00:01:04.390> five<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:05.110> six<00:01:05.350> feet<00:01:05.440> roughly<00:01:06.030> you

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
two meters five to six feet roughly you

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.480 
two meters five to six feet roughly you
know<00:01:07.090> once<00:01:07.900> we<00:01:08.050> get<00:01:08.230> the<00:01:08.409> esophagus<00:01:09.070> stomach

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
know once we get the esophagus stomach

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.090 
know once we get the esophagus stomach
and<00:01:10.000> then<00:01:10.600> we<00:01:10.870> start<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.170> small<00:01:11.470> intestine<00:01:11.950> so

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
and then we start the small intestine so

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.990 
and then we start the small intestine so
there's<00:01:12.729> a<00:01:12.850> lot<00:01:13.240> of<00:01:13.510> tube<00:01:14.110> there<00:01:14.530> and<00:01:14.909> even<00:01:15.909> if

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
there's a lot of tube there and even if

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.360 
there's a lot of tube there and even if
the<00:01:16.120> whole<00:01:16.240> not<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.479> whole<00:01:16.720> thing<00:01:17.050> is<00:01:17.370> coated

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
the whole not the whole thing is coated

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.400 
the whole not the whole thing is coated
it's<00:01:18.820> gonna<00:01:18.970> be<00:01:19.150> a<00:01:19.180> problem<00:01:19.420> but<00:01:20.110> you<00:01:20.320> know

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
it's gonna be a problem but you know

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.400 
it's gonna be a problem but you know
much<00:01:20.710> of<00:01:20.740> what<00:01:20.950> what<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.960> research<00:01:22.960> looks<00:01:23.290> at

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
much of what what the research looks at

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.290 
much of what what the research looks at
is<00:01:23.620> the<00:01:23.830> colon<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.310> large<00:01:24.520> intestine<00:01:25.090> that's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
is the colon the large intestine that's

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.690 
is the colon the large intestine that's
what<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.450> colonoscopy<00:01:25.840> is<00:01:26.260> looking<00:01:26.560> at<00:01:26.710> it

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
what a colonoscopy is looking at it

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.550 
what a colonoscopy is looking at it
occurs<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.120> me<00:01:28.240> that<00:01:28.270> this<00:01:28.840> stuff<00:01:29.110> is<00:01:29.290> much

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
occurs to me that this stuff is much

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.960 
occurs to me that this stuff is much
more<00:01:29.740> likely<00:01:30.010> to<00:01:30.130> wind<00:01:30.370> up<00:01:30.490> in<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:30.670> small

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
more likely to wind up in the small

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.810 
more likely to wind up in the small
intestine<00:01:31.540> and<00:01:31.660> the<00:01:31.720> large<00:01:31.780> intestine

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
intestine and the large intestine

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.010 
intestine and the large intestine
because<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:33.940> small<00:01:34.180> intestine<00:01:34.690> is<00:01:34.780> much

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
because the small intestine is much

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.130 
because the small intestine is much
longer<00:01:35.290> it's<00:01:36.100> narrower<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:37.030> it's<00:01:37.450> acylated

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
longer it's narrower and it's acylated

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.500 
longer it's narrower and it's acylated
like<00:01:38.410> a<00:01:38.440> vacuum<00:01:38.770> cleaner<00:01:38.980> house<00:01:39.430> and<00:01:40.180> so<00:01:40.390> it'd

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
like a vacuum cleaner house and so it'd

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.970 
like a vacuum cleaner house and so it'd
be<00:01:40.660> much<00:01:40.780> more<00:01:40.840> likely<00:01:41.320> for<00:01:41.470> stuff<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.830> get

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
be much more likely for stuff to get

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.360 
be much more likely for stuff to get
stuck<00:01:42.220> there<00:01:42.460> do<00:01:43.120> we<00:01:43.240> see<00:01:43.450> this<00:01:43.630> happening

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
stuck there do we see this happening

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.060 
stuck there do we see this happening
most<00:01:45.370> of<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.670> time<00:01:46.560> there's<00:01:47.560> a<00:01:47.650> lot<00:01:47.950> of

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
most of the time there's a lot of

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.590 
most of the time there's a lot of
evidence<00:01:48.400> that<00:01:48.820> people<00:01:48.970> are<00:01:49.210> breaking<00:01:49.420> down

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
evidence that people are breaking down

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.270 
evidence that people are breaking down
stuff<00:01:50.050> in<00:01:50.200> their<00:01:50.320> their<00:01:50.560> colon<00:01:50.890> and<00:01:51.010> the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
stuff in their their colon and the

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.760 
stuff in their their colon and the
greatest<00:01:51.640> evidence<00:01:52.090> is<00:01:52.240> that<00:01:52.450> as<00:01:53.320> I'm<00:01:53.590> sure

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
greatest evidence is that as I'm sure

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.920 
greatest evidence is that as I'm sure
you<00:01:53.920> know<00:01:54.070> as<00:01:54.220> a<00:01:54.250> fruitarian<00:01:54.700> when<00:01:55.510> you<00:01:55.690> eat

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
you know as a fruitarian when you eat

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.160 
you know as a fruitarian when you eat
let's<00:01:56.860> say<00:01:57.070> just<00:01:57.490> papaya<00:01:57.940> you<00:01:58.630> know<00:01:58.750> you<00:01:58.810> let's

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
let's say just papaya you know you let's

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.990 
let's say just papaya you know you let's
say<00:01:59.290> you'd<00:01:59.440> only<00:01:59.590> papaya<00:02:00.010> today<00:02:00.340> you're<00:02:00.820> about

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
say you'd only papaya today you're about

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.880 
say you'd only papaya today you're about
your<00:02:01.180> next<00:02:01.330> bowel<00:02:01.540> movement<00:02:01.930> is<00:02:02.020> gonna<00:02:02.260> be

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
your next bowel movement is gonna be

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.000

incredibly<00:03:52.810> painful<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.349> pass<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:53.940> he<00:03:54.940> said

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
incredibly painful to pass and he said

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:56.610 
incredibly painful to pass and he said
that<00:03:55.569> came<00:03:55.780> out<00:03:55.900> of<00:03:55.989> my<00:03:56.049> body<00:03:56.230> today

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
that came out of my body today

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.319 
that came out of my body today
now<00:03:57.130> that<00:03:57.430> doesn't<00:03:57.730> happen<00:03:57.880> very<00:03:58.030> often

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
now that doesn't happen very often

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.479 
now that doesn't happen very often
because<00:03:58.569> most<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.049> time<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.889> body<00:04:00.099> breaks

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
because most the time the body breaks

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.089 
because most the time the body breaks
this<00:04:00.730> stuff<00:04:01.030> down<00:04:01.269> rather<00:04:02.200> than<00:04:02.349> passing<00:04:03.010> it

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
this stuff down rather than passing it

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.640 
this stuff down rather than passing it
hole<00:04:03.359> so<00:04:04.359> a<00:04:04.389> lot<00:04:04.720> of<00:04:04.750> people<00:04:04.900> are<00:04:05.109> passing<00:04:05.560> this

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
hole so a lot of people are passing this

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.080 
hole so a lot of people are passing this
stuff<00:04:05.859> it's<00:04:06.040> not<00:04:06.130> usually<00:04:06.459> past<00:04:06.700> hole<00:04:06.910> this

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
stuff it's not usually past hole this

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.659 
stuff it's not usually past hole this
way<00:04:07.269> yeah<00:04:08.230> that's<00:04:08.500> when<00:04:09.099> you<00:04:09.190> see<00:04:09.340> pictures

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
way yeah that's when you see pictures

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.190 
way yeah that's when you see pictures
online<00:04:09.849> a<00:04:10.030> mucoid<00:04:10.480> plaque<00:04:10.510> that's<00:04:10.989> what<00:04:11.109> you

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
online a mucoid plaque that's what you

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.509 
online a mucoid plaque that's what you
see<00:04:11.410> it's<00:04:11.560> like<00:04:12.359> saturated<00:04:13.359> there's<00:04:13.870> sort<00:04:14.169> of

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
see it's like saturated there's sort of

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.890 
see it's like saturated there's sort of
ripple<00:04:15.519> expelling<00:04:16.479> tubes<00:04:16.930> of<00:04:17.229> rubber<00:04:17.769> stuff

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
ripple expelling tubes of rubber stuff

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.750 
ripple expelling tubes of rubber stuff
yeah<00:04:19.900> yeah<00:04:20.289> so<00:04:20.739> yes<00:04:21.010> I<00:04:21.190> mean<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:21.370> does<00:04:21.549> happen

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
yeah yeah so yes I mean it does happen

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.820 
yeah yeah so yes I mean it does happen
sometimes<00:04:21.970> that<00:04:22.750> was<00:04:23.349> the<00:04:23.440> most<00:04:23.590> recent

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
sometimes that was the most recent

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:35.260 
sometimes that was the most recent
example<00:04:24.490> I've<00:04:24.610> seen<00:04:25.060> a<00:04:25.120> bit<00:04:25.830> interesting

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270
