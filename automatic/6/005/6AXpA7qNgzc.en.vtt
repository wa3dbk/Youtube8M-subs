00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.130
 hello everyone and good day it hosts reserve and well a week well 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.710
 hectic on the financial markets the list of countries for inter finger 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.570
 by the rating agencies is only getting longer after greece and italy 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.120
 ireland but also the united states the united states which could moreover 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.790
 to lose their triple to sometime and that that would risk creating a 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.250
 unprecedented new crisis on a global scale upon arrival in 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.310
 not there at all to judge the work of the rating agencies a lot 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.649
 others charge themselves they are besides many auctions then 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.760
 why such a cabal against these institutions to the first thing we 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.480
 criticized their ability because in fact the models that 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.260
 they make their decisions among other degradation right now 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.770
 are very little known very little known outside then they are criticized 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.480
 also conflicts of interest because in fact it is the issuers 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.250
 what game that pays them so we see a little worry and on the other hand these 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.680
 last ten years a significant part of their turnover 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.089
 which has produced consulting activity with banks is precisely to 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.589
 advice in the securitization of the types of claims gold it is these famous 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.369
 claims that led to the crisis in Prague and therefore we understand that 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.070
 agencies have not seen coming this crisis 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.940
 and besides as some previous crises she had not seen no 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.540
 more the real estate crisis of the 90s nor the Asian crisis of 98 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.420
 and their children they are reproached to the site a possible domino effect in their 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.710
 announcement because we fear each time they degrade the rating of a country the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.540
 contagion among others to the rest of europe in fact to accentuate a little the 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.470
 crisis exactly so sometimes we talk about creation precisely to limit 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.470
 a little bit of all this from a big European rating agency 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.120
 so that does not empower things so it's true that the three 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.940
 main agencies that exist to know fitch tells us is in narbonne 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.640
 pause 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.280
 its American origin now create a European agency would not 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.740
 maybe not the solution in that ultimately sixteen of 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.670
 reproduce the same problems should be evoked namely a lack 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.909
 of transparency a complacent conflict of interest this button is a 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.380
 bet alaska other solutions and several tracks celebrate them 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.160
 market regulators could force agencies to be a bit more 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.190
 transparent to communicate more and why not even to undergo audits 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.240
 internal finally the records that would be the Swedish and American model since 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.860
 united states we have the congressional budget office which is an institute that broadcast 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.140
 figures from the model statistics of scenario forecasts and 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.850
 in fact it allows other economic actors to make themselves 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.570
 their own idea of ​​judging the economic health and zetas there was 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.550
 three takes and so it's a little losing their predominance to the agencies of 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.080
 rating and his beautiful claimed will have by some economic actors 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.019
 emilie de mercy is in any case for now 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.379
 there is silence in fact about all this on the banking sector since the 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.340
 banks are very exposed to the debts of different states by the way if we 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.030
 look sector indices reborn bank on trip collapsed 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:40.439
 since its February high of more than 25% so that's pretty important and we 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.259
 sees the terrible risk on the banking sector 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:46.829
 cantalou I thank you for your attention and your loyalty even in this 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.349
 summer period to see you soon in a future makes it worth
