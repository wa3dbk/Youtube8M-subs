00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:08.889
 When I was abroad in my first walk in space, I was on the dark side of the world during 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:15.440
 The Indian Ocean and all the lights in my clothes were closed to allow my eyes to adjust. 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.210
 As I said we came to South Australia in the dark, we passed through the southern lights and was .. 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.410
 There was such a liquid down my feet and you could see all the colors from it, I mean .. 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.590
 I have seen the twilight of the earth, but to be among them, indeed 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.899
 To be directly part of this interaction between the sun, the atmosphere and the magnetic range 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.530
 Everything there is seen by the naked eye like a prism, rainbow or something, 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.749
 It was a real test of how everything is connected and how the sun's energy and protection 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:53.149
 Its atmosphere and concentration of the magnetic field and its work all at once. 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.209
 It showed me that this is the system. This is the planetary system. This applies to all time and most of the time 

00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:02.279
 Although we do not see it, but this happens constantly, all the time, 

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:04.750
 How all these things work together. Translation: _AboodJtx @ 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.530
 From orbit you get this kind or perspective. You actually see that system 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.240
 Complex and subject to many influences, which are carried out all the time. 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.960
 One of the influences that affect the earth itself, of course, are the organisms that live on it. 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.600
 Eruption of volcanoes, and also plant life and animal life. 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.200
 And more than 100 years ago, I mean, my God, our numbers have reached seven billion! 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.850
 They all eat food and breathe at the same time and light the lights of our house 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.210
 We start to operate the engines in our cars. It obviously has an impact on the planet 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.270
 Among all those other things that happen. 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.799
 You can see some of those effects from space. You can see with your naked eye. 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:56.229
 If you come across Mexico or Beijing, you can see pollution from space. 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:03.359
 Similar to an ugly gray spot on the surface of the world. This means that humans have changed the local climate. 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:08.830
 If I come across Asia ... On my first trip there was a great mystical sea called the Aral Sea. 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.400
 It was still relatively sound of water in the early 1990s. But during 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.909
 But over the past 20 years due to agricultural policies and irrigation policies 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.260
 The Aral Sea has been transformed from being the fourth largest sea on Earth, to being virtually non-existent. 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.989
 It has dried up. We did it deliberately as a species. We made a conscious decision to allow 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.819
 For the fourth largest sea in the world to turn it into a small stinking pond. 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.909
 What was to be the beach now has empty sands and the remains of the fertilizer that dried up 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.510
 On that sea for decades. It is clear that we are changing the climate at the global level. 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.810
 The key is: Who will be the person 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.790
 Who will decide to change something? We can not wait for someone else to change it. 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.760
 They did not have to do it, especially if there was someone we could elect. 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.120
 If elected, this is only a representative and a real catalyst for us 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.180
 And to each of us separately. This is what he has to change. You can not tell them either 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.120
 His or her. It is us or me or me to make this change. 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.159
 And it would not be perfect and people would get a bit of embarrassment and really 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:29.049
 They will feel enough pain or enough remorse to change the reality of what they are doing. 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.549
 Things will get worse before they get better. But I am sure that this is not 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.110
 But I am confident that this is not the end of the world. This is just a problem we are facing change 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.579
 Things, but we will have to learn the means to deal with them. 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.939
 &gt;&gt; I just ... 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:49.829
 &gt;&gt; Got enough light? 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.230
 &gt;&gt; Yes, I wonder if the sunset is parked there. 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.439
 &gt;&gt; We can clean ... 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:53.979
 &gt;&gt; I ... 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:57.590
 &gt;&gt; The sun has not just determined us.
