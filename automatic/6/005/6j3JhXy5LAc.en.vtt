00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
to get less due to the fact that it was

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.840

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.070 
really really good I think few minor

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.100 
really really good I think few minor
tweaks<00:06:55.430> to<00:06:55.610> the<00:06:55.640> head<00:06:55.880> and<00:06:56.090> Hasbro<00:06:56.780> well<00:06:56.960> I've

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
tweaks to the head and Hasbro well I've

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.050 
tweaks to the head and Hasbro well I've
got<00:06:57.320> their<00:06:57.560> definitive<00:06:57.890> Anakin<00:06:58.490> Skywalker

and<00:06:59.510> as<00:07:00.380> I<00:07:00.470> said<00:07:00.530> it's<00:07:00.830> just<00:07:00.920> the<00:07:01.250> face<00:07:01.490> is<00:07:01.730> just

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.030 
and as I said it's just the face is just

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.690 
and as I said it's just the face is just
a<00:07:02.090> tiny<00:07:02.450> bit<00:07:02.750> too<00:07:02.930> chubby<00:07:03.230> in<00:07:03.410> my<00:07:03.560> opinion<00:07:03.950> but

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:04.700 
a tiny bit too chubby in my opinion but

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.270 
a tiny bit too chubby in my opinion but
it's<00:07:04.970> not<00:07:05.150> a<00:07:05.180> massive<00:07:05.540> problem<00:07:06.100> so<00:07:07.100> there<00:07:07.220> we
