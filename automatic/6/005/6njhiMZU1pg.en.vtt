00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
I really always worked on here is that

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.570

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
gate is to wait until you're telling

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:42.720

which<00:05:55.930> relates<00:05:56.290> to<00:05:56.380> a<00:05:56.530> bit<00:05:56.680> of<00:05:56.800> displacement

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
which relates to a bit of displacement

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.370 
which relates to a bit of displacement
you<00:05:58.150> can<00:05:58.270> see<00:05:58.480> that<00:05:58.630> straight<00:05:58.900> after<00:05:59.290> already

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
you can see that straight after already
