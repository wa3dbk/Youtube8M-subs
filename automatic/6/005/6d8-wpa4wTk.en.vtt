 gift, so what are we going to do? 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.540
 we headed the pokemon center 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.570
 I have seen the lumia I have not downloaded it 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.790
 but I've seen it and the green does not look 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.800
 it really always has knock down 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.180
 that until it evolves to metán but 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.909
 this forgiveness has special attacks 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.909
 let's go directly into the center 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.950
 here we are guys here is the 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.390

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.990
 for you here you have received the betlem and 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.579
 it's a pretty curious pattern because 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.860
 as we can see here here we have it 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:12.730
 this bitumen you have mercy that a 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.780
 attack that is like false smack head 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.580
 iron 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.170
 we started hitting hard an attack the 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.810
 medium stronger than it usually has for 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.630
 to be heads or are also to be and 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.350
 Fair defense that I know perfectly 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.960
 changeable 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.060
 it seems that nature is changing 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.560
 because I have seen others and is affable not me 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.660
 interest here for the defense and its 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.420
 great special attack could have me 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.010
 been something else but good here is the 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.330

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.600

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.820

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.070
