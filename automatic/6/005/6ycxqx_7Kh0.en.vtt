00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.330
 educator I deal with consulting 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.180
 pedagogical in the facilities for the first 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.980
 nursery kindergartens nursery schools 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.840
 and parenting consultancy 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.090
 today it is home to the giant dwarf or school 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.070
 of childhood in the area today 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.580
 we will reflect together on which toys 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.449
 and what fun proposals to offer children 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.449
 when it's raining outside 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.800
 entertain children at home when 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.230
 it's raining outside it's definitely not easy 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.969
 but if we know how to offer them the right ones 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.070
 fun activities will be able to live 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:50.030
 this moment in the best way 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.799
 an extremely fun proposal for 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.159
 children could be the business of 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:57.049
 manipulation we can manipulate pasta 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.699
 of bread we can manipulate pasta of 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:00.769
 salt or simple pasta 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:05.570
 mouldable purchasable also in 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:07.520
 stationery a toy store la 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.970
 manipulation has great power 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.649
 cathartic in directs much energy 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.479
 frustrations, fears and excess 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.460
 so let's say about children 's energies 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.770
 therefore it is extremely important 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.330
 in a moment of difficult containment 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.909
 like when it's raining outside offer to 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.250
 child to manipulate another 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.810
 very fun activity for children 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.250
 could be the business with 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.770
 watercolors dirty little and help a lot 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.140
 children to have a commitment 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.140

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.140

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.570
 busy on a rainy day 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.120
 another timeless proposal is 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.690
 definitely a wonderful memory 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.030
 society game that really accompanies 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.480

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.430
 very important cognitive activities that 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.280

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.150
 adult help because it is important 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.430
