the<00:01:19.359> fact<00:01:19.539> that<00:01:19.600> you<00:01:19.750> can<00:01:20.020> catch<00:01:20.350> large<00:01:20.770> fish

the fact that you can catch large fish

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.099 
the fact that you can catch large fish

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
intentionally it's not just a case of

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.950 
intentionally it's not just a case of
chance<00:01:23.619> and<00:01:23.979> then<00:01:24.789> I<00:01:24.820> suppose<00:01:25.180> aside<00:01:25.600> from<00:01:25.780> him

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
chance and then I suppose aside from him

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.810 
chance and then I suppose aside from him
I<00:01:26.049> got<00:01:26.200> into<00:01:26.409> carp<00:01:26.649> fishing<00:01:26.890> very<00:01:27.189> much<00:01:27.369> and<00:01:27.670> at

I<00:01:42.810> think<00:01:43.810> it's<00:01:43.929> unfinished<00:01:44.229> business<00:01:44.530> if<00:01:44.890> you

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
I think it's unfinished business if you

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.249 
I think it's unfinished business if you
set<00:01:45.219> yourself<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.670> challenge<00:01:45.880> it's<00:01:46.840> it's

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
set yourself a challenge it's it's

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.050 
set yourself a challenge it's it's
difficult<00:01:47.469> to<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:47.920> walk<00:01:48.429> away<00:01:48.579> from<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:48.999> and

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
very few outsiders go to and you won't

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:59.489 
very few outsiders go to and you won't
find<00:01:58.450> you<00:01:58.719> know<00:01:58.780> other<00:01:58.929> people<00:01:59.289> there<00:01:59.439> you

00:01:59.489 --> 00:01:59.499 
find you know other people there you

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:01.260 
find you know other people there you
know<00:01:59.590> it's<00:01:59.920> just<00:02:00.009> very<00:02:00.100> hard<00:02:00.369> work<00:02:00.729> traveling

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
know it's just very hard work traveling

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.569 
know it's just very hard work traveling
there<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:02.109> the<00:02:02.979> first<00:02:03.189> time<00:02:03.340> I<00:02:03.429> went

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
there and and the first time I went

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:04.830 
there and and the first time I went
there<00:02:03.670> I<00:02:03.850> was<00:02:04.090> there<00:02:04.270> for<00:02:04.390> two<00:02:04.509> months<00:02:04.780> I

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
there I was there for two months I

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.420 
there I was there for two months I
didn't<00:02:05.049> catch<00:02:05.200> anything<00:02:05.409> at<00:02:05.590> all

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
didn't catch anything at all

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.560 
didn't catch anything at all
so<00:02:08.430> there's<00:02:08.580> one<00:02:08.700> part<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.000> me<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.210> just

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
so there's one part of me that just

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.670 
so there's one part of me that just
wants<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.930> wash<00:02:10.110> my<00:02:10.260> hands<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.650> whole

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
wants to wash my hands of the whole

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.470 
wants to wash my hands of the whole
thing<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.040> never<00:02:11.160> go<00:02:11.340> back<00:02:11.580> but<00:02:11.850> then<00:02:12.000> you

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
thing and never go back but then you

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.940 
thing and never go back but then you
know<00:02:12.570> I<00:02:12.600> can<00:02:12.810> only<00:02:12.870> really<00:02:13.230> do<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.620> once<00:02:13.800> I've

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
know I can only really do that once I've

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.620 
know I can only really do that once I've
got<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.220> fish<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.580> it's<00:02:14.730> like<00:02:14.850> next<00:02:15.180> time<00:02:15.390> I

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
got the fish so it's like next time I

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.660 
got the fish so it's like next time I
think<00:02:15.810> it's<00:02:16.170> it's<00:02:16.380> quite<00:02:16.650> similar<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.250> you

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
think it's it's quite similar to you

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.980 
think it's it's quite similar to you
know<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.060> don't<00:02:18.240> like<00:02:18.360> admitting<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.750> it's<00:02:18.930> a

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
know I don't like admitting this it's a

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.570 
know I don't like admitting this it's a
bit<00:02:19.110> it's<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.320> bit<00:02:19.350> like<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> gambler<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.490> know

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
bit it's a bit like a gambler you know

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.850 
bit it's a bit like a gambler you know
you<00:02:20.640> throw<00:02:20.880> away<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.180> lot<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.360> money<00:02:21.650> I've<00:02:22.650> got

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
you throw away a lot of money I've got

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.900 
you throw away a lot of money I've got
to<00:02:22.950> go<00:02:23.010> back<00:02:23.160> tomorrow<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.490> win<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.640> money

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
to go back tomorrow and win that money

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.030 
to go back tomorrow and win that money
back<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.360> know<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.440> it's<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:25.980> think

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
back you know and so it's it's I think

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.270 
back you know and so it's it's I think
it's<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.280> similar<00:02:26.610> kind<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.880> thing<00:02:27.090> going<00:02:27.300> on

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
it's a similar kind of thing going on

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.590 
it's a similar kind of thing going on
how<00:02:29.280> come<00:02:29.490> you<00:02:29.610> always<00:02:29.820> seem<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:30.240> crack<00:02:30.450> the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
how come you always seem to crack the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.570 
how come you always seem to crack the
code<00:02:30.810> with<00:02:31.080> every<00:02:31.470> predator<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.130> fish<00:02:32.340> for

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
code with every predator you fish for

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.820 
code with every predator you fish for
how<00:02:33.570> do<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.750> get<00:02:33.900> into<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.170> mind<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.590> fish

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
how do you get into the mind of the fish

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.090 
how do you get into the mind of the fish
what's<00:02:35.640> your<00:02:35.850> secret<00:02:36.060> well<00:02:36.710> I<00:02:37.710> think<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:38.070> think

I<00:02:38.580> think<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.300> important<00:02:39.870> if<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.170> if<00:02:40.380> you

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
I think it is important if you if you

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.290 
I think it is important if you if you
are<00:02:40.590> an<00:02:40.830> angler<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.580> imagine<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.180> you

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
eyesight very much it's a completely

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.960 
eyesight very much it's a completely
different<00:02:46.680> way<00:02:46.950> they<00:02:47.130> have<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.310> experiencing

the<00:02:48.060> world<00:02:48.240> you<00:02:48.960> know<00:02:49.050> often<00:02:49.230> has<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.350> lot<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.620> do

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
the world you know often has a lot to do

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
with touch and scent and vibrations and

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.740 
with touch and scent and vibrations and
maybe<00:02:52.230> even<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.590> electric<00:02:53.370> currents<00:02:53.760> but<00:02:54.570> you

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
maybe even a electric currents but you

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.180 
maybe even a electric currents but you
know<00:02:54.870> but<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:55.350> all<00:02:55.440> comes<00:02:55.650> down<00:02:55.740> to<00:02:56.010> food

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
know but it all comes down to food

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.590 
know but it all comes down to food
really<00:02:56.550> where<00:02:56.850> are<00:02:56.940> they<00:02:57.030> gonna<00:02:57.150> find<00:02:57.450> food

for<00:02:57.840> them<00:02:58.230> for<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.470> minimum<00:02:58.950> amount<00:02:59.070> of

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
for them for the minimum amount of

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.800 
for them for the minimum amount of

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
effort and yeah when I'm fishing

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.710 
effort and yeah when I'm fishing
normally<00:03:04.290> it's<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.440> case<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.630> sort<00:03:06.630> of

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
normally it's the case that I sort of

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.960 
normally it's the case that I sort of
know<00:03:06.780> if<00:03:07.350> I've<00:03:08.160> got<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.430> good<00:03:08.610> chance<00:03:08.760> of

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
know if I've got a good chance of

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.670 
know if I've got a good chance of
getting<00:03:09.060> something<00:03:09.390> I'm<00:03:09.600> confident<00:03:10.140> that

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
getting something I'm confident that

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.610 
fish they're coming along there are
times<00:03:15.450> when<00:03:15.690> I'm<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.959> bit<00:03:16.170> sort<00:03:16.380> of<00:03:16.410> who<00:03:16.500> knows

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
times when I'm a bit sort of who knows

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.420 
times when I'm a bit sort of who knows
know<00:03:16.739> something<00:03:17.040> doesn't<00:03:17.100> feel<00:03:17.370> right

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
know something doesn't feel right

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.160 
know something doesn't feel right
doesn't<00:03:17.790> feel<00:03:18.000> right<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.209> go<00:03:18.360> change<00:03:18.660> then<00:03:19.110> I

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
doesn't feel right I go change then I

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.590 
doesn't feel right I go change then I
change<00:03:19.440> something<00:03:20.390> doing<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.480> on<00:03:21.540> camera

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
change something doing it on camera

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.350 
change something doing it on camera
though<00:03:21.959> adds<00:03:22.170> extra<00:03:22.620> pressure<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.180> sort

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
though adds extra pressure and it sort

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.699 
though adds extra pressure and it sort
of<00:03:24.390> concentrates<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.930> mind<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.410> think<00:03:25.590> the

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
of concentrates the mind and I think the

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.560 
of concentrates the mind and I think the
fact<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:25.980> we<00:03:26.160> we<00:03:26.610> tend<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:26.910> shoot<00:03:27.180> for<00:03:27.450> about

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
fact that we we tend to shoot for about

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.290 
fact that we we tend to shoot for about
two<00:03:28.110> weeks<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:29.489> that<00:03:29.730> you<00:03:29.790> know<00:03:30.120> maybe

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
two weeks and of that you know maybe

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.170 
two weeks and of that you know maybe
only<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.600> few<00:03:30.660> days<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.260> fishing<00:03:31.380> so<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.640> means

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
only a few days of fishing so it means

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.520 
only a few days of fishing so it means
that<00:03:33.300> you<00:03:33.480> have<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.840> do<00:03:33.959> it<00:03:34.020> in<00:03:34.080> a<00:03:34.170> very<00:03:34.290> focused

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
that you have to do it in a very focused

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.050 
that you have to do it in a very focused
way<00:03:34.830> I<00:03:35.160> mean<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.459> know<00:03:35.519> I'd<00:03:35.640> like<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.790> go

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
way I mean I you know I'd like to go

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.400 
way I mean I you know I'd like to go
somewhere<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:36.510> actually<00:03:36.750> find<00:03:37.019> my<00:03:37.200> way

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
somewhere and actually find my way

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.120 
somewhere and actually find my way
around<00:03:37.640> but<00:03:38.640> because<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.390> time<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:39.720> short<00:03:40.130> it

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
around but because the time is short it

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.759 
around but because the time is short it
you<00:03:41.989> you<00:03:42.989> know<00:03:43.080> there's<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.260> limit<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.530> how<00:03:43.680> much

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
you you know there's a limit to how much

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.590 
you you know there's a limit to how much
of<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:43.980> shortcut<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.550> can<00:03:44.700> take<00:03:44.910> but<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.450> but

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
of a shortcut you can take but it but

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.949 
of a shortcut you can take but it but
you<00:03:45.660> know<00:03:45.720> there's<00:03:45.870> pressure<00:03:46.590> on<00:03:46.800> so<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.959> it

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
you know there's pressure on so it it

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.570 
you know there's pressure on so it it
focuses<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.800> mind<00:03:49.830> that<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.250> know<00:03:50.340> that

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
focuses the mind that you know that

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.280 
focuses the mind that you know that
intellectual<00:03:51.180> challenge<00:03:51.570> it<00:03:51.750> rids<00:03:51.989> sort<00:03:52.200> of

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
intellectual challenge it rids sort of

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.750 
intellectual challenge it rids sort of
you<00:03:52.560> know<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:52.769> steps<00:03:53.010> up<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.190> pace<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.610> that

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
you know it steps up the pace of that

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.820 
you know it steps up the pace of that
possibly<00:03:54.150> well<00:03:54.870> we<00:03:55.019> were<00:03:55.140> out<00:03:55.290> fishing<00:03:55.560> this

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
possibly well we were out fishing this

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.710 
possibly well we were out fishing this
morning<00:03:55.890> you<00:03:56.640> told<00:03:56.880> me<00:03:57.000> that<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.239> big<00:03:57.480> fish

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
morning you told me that the big fish

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.259 
morning you told me that the big fish
often<00:03:57.989> stays<00:03:58.470> at<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.860> same<00:03:59.070> place<00:03:59.340> the<00:04:00.060> hot

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
often stays at the same place the hot

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.050 
often stays at the same place the hot
spot<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:00.870> also<00:04:01.530> talked<00:04:01.950> about<00:04:02.070> energy<00:04:02.850> being

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
spot you also talked about energy being

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.050 
spot you also talked about energy being
a<00:04:03.150> currency<00:04:03.660> how's<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:04.500> yeah<00:04:05.459> any<00:04:05.670> any<00:04:05.910> any

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
a currency how's that yeah any any any

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.750 
a currency how's that yeah any any any
wild<00:04:06.660> animal<00:04:07.050> has<00:04:07.709> to<00:04:07.739> feed<00:04:08.070> itself<00:04:08.430> but<00:04:09.269> it<00:04:09.810> it

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
wild animal has to feed itself but it it

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.430 
wild animal has to feed itself but it it
you<00:04:11.760> know<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:12.090> less<00:04:12.269> energy<00:04:12.510> it<00:04:12.810> can<00:04:12.959> expand

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
you know the less energy it can expand

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.610 
you know the less energy it can expand
doing<00:04:13.950> that

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
doing that

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.190 
doing that
the<00:04:14.950> better<00:04:15.160> yeah<00:04:15.760> so<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.600> more<00:04:16.900> energy

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
the better yeah so the more energy

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.420 
the better yeah so the more energy
surplus<00:04:17.380> it's<00:04:17.709> got<00:04:17.889> that<00:04:18.070> they<00:04:18.220> are<00:04:18.370> the

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
surplus it's got that they are the

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.590 
surplus it's got that they are the
bigger<00:04:18.639> it's<00:04:18.820> going<00:04:19.000> to<00:04:19.060> be<00:04:19.150> able<00:04:19.209> to<00:04:19.329> grow

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
bigger it's going to be able to grow

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.960 
bigger it's going to be able to grow
therefore<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:20.799> more<00:04:20.919> likely<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:21.400> is<00:04:21.489> you<00:04:21.910> know

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
therefore the more likely it is you know

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.150 
therefore the more likely it is you know
to<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.270> get<00:04:22.419> to<00:04:22.660> get<00:04:22.870> into<00:04:23.080> those<00:04:23.320> you<00:04:23.680> know<00:04:24.040> all

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
to to get to get into those you know all

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.330 
to to get to get into those you know all
fish<00:04:24.400> are<00:04:24.520> sort<00:04:24.700> of<00:04:24.730> competing<00:04:25.270> for

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
fish are sort of competing for

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.950 
fish are sort of competing for
particularly<00:04:27.340> in<00:04:27.430> a<00:04:27.460> river<00:04:27.669> you<00:04:27.940> can<00:04:28.660> just<00:04:28.840> sit

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
particularly in a river you can just sit

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.270 
particularly in a river you can just sit
in<00:04:29.080> a<00:04:29.169> spot<00:04:29.380> and<00:04:29.590> let<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.770> river<00:04:29.919> bring<00:04:30.160> the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
in a spot and let the river bring the

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.220 
in a spot and let the river bring the
fish<00:04:30.430> to<00:04:30.610> you<00:04:30.760> so<00:04:31.389> I<00:04:31.419> bring<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.750> food<00:04:31.780> to<00:04:32.110> you

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
fish to you so I bring the food to you

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.980 
fish to you so I bring the food to you
here<00:04:32.940> but<00:04:33.940> that's<00:04:34.060> where<00:04:34.300> everybody<00:04:34.660> wants<00:04:34.930> to

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
here but that's where everybody wants to

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.540 
here but that's where everybody wants to
be<00:04:35.200> so<00:04:35.410> if<00:04:35.530> you're<00:04:35.650> a<00:04:35.710> big<00:04:35.950> fish<00:04:36.130> you're<00:04:36.430> going

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
be so if you're a big fish you're going

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.740 
be so if you're a big fish you're going
to<00:04:36.610> be<00:04:36.669> able<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:36.880> sort<00:04:37.060> of<00:04:37.120> muscle<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.510> others

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
to be able to sort of muscle the others

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.690 
to be able to sort of muscle the others
out<00:04:37.930> but<00:04:38.350> but<00:04:38.560> you<00:04:38.919> know<00:04:39.010> you<00:04:39.070> need<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.370> become

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
out but but you know you need to become

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.900 
out but but you know you need to become
a<00:04:39.730> big<00:04:39.970> fish<00:04:40.180> first<00:04:40.990> in<00:04:41.980> your<00:04:42.220> book<00:04:42.430> River

way has that shaped you into being the

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.379 
way has that shaped you into being the
angler<00:04:49.570> you<00:04:49.690> are<00:04:49.780> today<00:04:50.700> yeah<00:04:51.700> I<00:04:51.729> wonder<00:04:52.180> if

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
angler you are today yeah I wonder if

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.870 
angler you are today yeah I wonder if
that<00:04:52.660> has<00:04:53.139> shaped<00:04:53.979> me<00:04:54.190> I<00:04:54.220> think<00:04:54.340> it<00:04:54.580> probably

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
that has shaped me I think it probably

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.730 
that has shaped me I think it probably
has<00:04:54.970> I<00:04:55.450> think<00:04:55.479> you<00:04:55.900> know<00:04:56.020> part<00:04:56.290> of<00:04:56.440> that<00:04:56.500> whole

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
has I think you know part of that whole

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.740 
has I think you know part of that whole
condition<00:04:57.370> is<00:04:59.790> it's<00:05:00.790> sort<00:05:01.030> of<00:05:01.060> an<00:05:01.180> extension

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
condition is it's sort of an extension

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.469 
condition is it's sort of an extension
of<00:05:01.870> it<00:05:02.050> of<00:05:02.229> attention<00:05:02.680> to<00:05:02.830> detail<00:05:03.360> you<00:05:04.360> know<00:05:04.450> I

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
of it of attention to detail you know I

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.500 
of it of attention to detail you know I
tend<00:05:04.780> to<00:05:05.400> when<00:05:06.400> I<00:05:06.430> have<00:05:06.639> time<00:05:06.880> anyway<00:05:07.240> oh

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
tend to when I have time anyway oh

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.870 
tend to when I have time anyway oh
really

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
really

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.370 
really
things<00:05:09.880> like<00:05:10.030> tying<00:05:10.300> a<00:05:10.450> knot<00:05:10.630> you<00:05:10.930> know<00:05:11.229> it

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
things like tying a knot you know it

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.900 
things like tying a knot you know it
sounds<00:05:11.680> very<00:05:11.800> simple<00:05:12.100> but<00:05:12.370> you<00:05:12.430> know<00:05:12.580> I<00:05:12.610> want

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
sounds very simple but you know I want

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.860 
sounds very simple but you know I want
that<00:05:12.970> not<00:05:13.330> to<00:05:13.600> be<00:05:13.720> perfect<00:05:14.760> if<00:05:15.760> it's<00:05:16.300> not<00:05:16.540> you

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
that not to be perfect if it's not you

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.180 
that not to be perfect if it's not you
know<00:05:16.990> even<00:05:17.260> if<00:05:17.350> it's<00:05:17.470> just<00:05:17.530> a<00:05:17.680> very<00:05:17.889> small

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
know even if it's just a very small

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.830 
know even if it's just a very small
percentage<00:05:18.640> chance<00:05:21.419> you<00:05:22.419> know<00:05:22.479> that<00:05:22.660> that

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
percentage chance you know that that

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.540 
percentage chance you know that that
fish<00:05:23.020> yeah<00:05:23.470> that<00:05:23.800> fish<00:05:23.979> could<00:05:24.190> actually<00:05:24.310> get

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
fish yeah that fish could actually get

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.320 
fish yeah that fish could actually get
away<00:05:25.020> and<00:05:26.020> so<00:05:26.680> so<00:05:27.039> what<00:05:27.160> I'm<00:05:27.310> doing<00:05:27.340> I'm<00:05:27.820> sort

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
away and so so what I'm doing I'm sort

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.750 
away and so so what I'm doing I'm sort
of<00:05:28.390> I'm<00:05:28.950> maximizing<00:05:29.950> the<00:05:30.039> percentages<00:05:30.520> so<00:05:30.729> I

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
of I'm maximizing the percentages so I

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.460 
of I'm maximizing the percentages so I
think<00:05:30.880> that<00:05:31.090> does<00:05:31.240> make<00:05:31.479> a<00:05:31.510> difference<00:05:31.600> you

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
think that does make a difference you

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.850 
think that does make a difference you
know<00:05:32.590> if<00:05:32.710> you're<00:05:33.010> a<00:05:33.039> little<00:05:33.190> bit<00:05:33.340> careless

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
know if you're a little bit careless

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.130 
know if you're a little bit careless
then<00:05:36.270> there's<00:05:37.270> more<00:05:37.510> chance<00:05:37.840> that

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
then there's more chance that

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.510 
then there's more chance that
something's<00:05:38.530> going<00:05:38.650> to<00:05:38.680> happen<00:05:38.890> and<00:05:39.250> the<00:05:39.340> fish

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
something's going to happen and the fish

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.340 
something's going to happen and the fish
that<00:05:39.669> you<00:05:39.729> know<00:05:40.270> you've<00:05:40.419> waited<00:05:40.630> so<00:05:40.990> long<00:05:41.200> to

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
that you know you've waited so long to

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.900 
that you know you've waited so long to
get<00:05:41.440> on<00:05:41.560> the<00:05:41.680> end<00:05:41.770> of<00:05:41.830> your<00:05:41.919> line<00:05:42.130> just<00:05:42.550> you

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
get on the end of your line just you

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.490 
get on the end of your line just you
know<00:05:43.030> them<00:05:43.240> something<00:05:43.870> happens<00:05:44.200> that<00:05:44.260> not

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
know them something happens that not

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.000 
know them something happens that not
fails<00:05:44.800> or<00:05:45.190> whatever<00:05:45.789> so<00:05:46.479> it's

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
fails or whatever so it's

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.730 
fails or whatever so it's
yeah<00:05:48.820> in<00:05:49.300> a<00:05:49.390> sense<00:05:49.660> I've<00:05:49.900> sort<00:05:50.170> of<00:05:50.230> harnessed

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
yeah in a sense I've sort of harnessed

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.660 
yeah in a sense I've sort of harnessed
that<00:05:50.920> it's<00:05:51.190> you<00:05:51.310> know<00:05:51.340> because<00:05:51.580> that's

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:51.670 
that it's you know because that's

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.160 
that it's you know because that's
something<00:05:51.910> that<00:05:52.150> you<00:05:52.240> can<00:05:52.390> you<00:05:52.570> can<00:05:52.600> waste<00:05:52.930> a

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
something that you can you can waste a

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.630 
something that you can you can waste a
lot<00:05:53.200> of<00:05:53.410> it<00:05:53.500> you<00:05:53.530> know<00:05:53.650> you<00:05:53.800> can<00:05:54.160> we<00:05:54.310> can<00:05:54.340> waste

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
lot of it you know you can we can waste

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.100 
lot of it you know you can we can waste
a<00:05:54.850> lot<00:05:54.880> of<00:05:55.000> your<00:05:55.090> energy<00:05:55.240> and<00:05:55.720> what<00:05:55.810> I<00:05:55.840> try<00:05:56.080> to

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
a lot of your energy and what I try to

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.470 
a lot of your energy and what I try to
do<00:05:56.380> is<00:05:56.530> actually<00:05:56.710> channel<00:05:57.640> this<00:05:57.760> into

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480 
do is actually channel this into

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.350 
do is actually channel this into
something<00:05:58.660> as<00:05:58.900> far<00:05:59.110> as<00:05:59.200> possible
