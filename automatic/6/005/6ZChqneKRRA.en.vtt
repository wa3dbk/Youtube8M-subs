00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
you this Fiat electric accent LED bulb

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.610 
you this Fiat electric accent LED bulb
this<00:00:06.150> is<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.330> G<00:00:07.140> 25<00:00:07.980> globe<00:00:08.910> bulb<00:00:09.330> all<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.260> LEDs

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
this is a G 25 globe bulb all the LEDs

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.799 
this is a G 25 globe bulb all the LEDs
are<00:00:10.800> down<00:00:10.950> in<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.219> bottom<00:00:11.580> so<00:00:11.790> this<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.509> globe

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
are down in the bottom so this the globe

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.990 
are down in the bottom so this the globe
part<00:00:13.139> up<00:00:13.290> here<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.769> full<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.460> air<00:00:14.700> there's<00:00:14.940> no

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
part up here is full of air there's no

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.260 
part up here is full of air there's no
LEDs<00:00:15.990> coming<00:00:16.440> up<00:00:16.560> or<00:00:16.740> anything<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:18.119> quite

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
LEDs coming up or anything so it's quite

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.580 
LEDs coming up or anything so it's quite
interesting<00:00:18.330> you'll<00:00:18.960> see<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.230> when<00:00:19.350> it's

other LED bulbs too which I'll show on

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.550 
other LED bulbs too which I'll show on
some<00:00:28.859> other<00:00:29.010> videos<00:00:29.810> anyway<00:00:30.810> here<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.439> have

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
here the different styles of course you

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.220 
here the different styles of course you
don't<00:00:59.910> show<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> Glo<00:01:00.420> bulb<00:01:00.719> because<00:01:01.050> that's

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
don't show the Glo bulb because that's

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.289 
don't show the Glo bulb because that's
what<00:01:01.410> we<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:02.039> did<00:01:02.850> get<00:01:03.530> this<00:01:04.530> one<00:01:04.670> in<00:01:05.670> Fiat

take the bulb screw it in here and I'll

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.950 
take the bulb screw it in here and I'll
plug<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.530> into<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:26.009> extension<00:01:26.580> cord<00:01:27.060> you

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.210 
plug it into this extension cord you
have<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.200> plug<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> right<00:01:28.799> way<00:01:28.829> of

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
have to plug it in the right way of

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.289 
have to plug it in the right way of
course<00:01:30.079> there<00:01:31.079> we<00:01:31.170> go<00:01:31.729> let<00:01:32.729> me<00:01:32.820> turn<00:01:33.000> off<00:01:33.090> these

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
course there we go let me turn off these

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.100 
course there we go let me turn off these
lights<00:01:33.360> here<00:01:33.780> quick<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.770> there<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.040> go

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
lights here quick and there we go

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.530 
lights here quick and there we go
it's<00:01:37.110> very<00:01:37.350> nice<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:37.920> not<00:01:38.100> too<00:01:38.970> bright<00:01:39.240> at

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
it's very nice it's not too bright at

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.050 
it's very nice it's not too bright at
all<00:01:39.920> down<00:01:40.920> there<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> bottom<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:41.880> see

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
all down there in the bottom you can see

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.310 
all down there in the bottom you can see
the<00:01:42.210> LEDs<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:44.210> believe<00:01:45.210> there's<00:01:45.450> ten<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.840> them

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.200 

so<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.280> tell<00:01:50.340> they're<00:01:50.790> all<00:01:50.909> at<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
so as you can tell they're all at the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.679 
so as you can tell they're all at the
bottom

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
bottom

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.960 
bottom
none<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:51.990> them<00:01:52.170> are<00:01:52.380> up<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.100> globe<00:01:53.369> itself

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
none of them are up in the globe itself

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.569 
none of them are up in the globe itself
they're<00:01:54.869> all<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.049> stationed<00:01:56.040> at<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.250> bottom

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
they're all just stationed at the bottom

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.370 
they're all just stationed at the bottom
now<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.299> think<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.899> would<00:01:57.990> put<00:01:58.140> them<00:01:58.229> up

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
now you think that you would put them up

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.289 
now you think that you would put them up
higher<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.890> then<00:01:59.070> put<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> heat<00:01:59.579> sink<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.119> there

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
higher and then put a heat sink in there

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.569 
higher and then put a heat sink in there
or<00:02:00.420> something<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.990> help<00:02:01.140> distribute<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.250> heat

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
or something to help distribute the heat

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.300 
or something to help distribute the heat
but<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.320> don't<00:02:04.320> know<00:02:04.409> if<00:02:04.530> I'll<00:02:04.649> use<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:05.070> bulb

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
but I don't know if I'll use this bulb

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.949 
but I don't know if I'll use this bulb
or<00:02:05.430> not<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:05.850> we'll<00:02:06.030> see<00:02:06.409> how<00:02:07.409> its<00:02:07.619> life<00:02:07.979> goes

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
or not but we'll see how its life goes

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.160 
or not but we'll see how its life goes
well<00:02:09.959> because<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.129> fact<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.819> heat

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
well because of that fact of heat

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.610 
well because of that fact of heat
anyway<00:02:14.170> I'd<00:02:14.830> say<00:02:15.070> it<00:02:15.250> equals<00:02:15.670> about<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:16.290> 15<00:02:17.290> watt

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
anyway I'd say it equals about a 15 watt

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.370 
anyway I'd say it equals about a 15 watt
incandescent<00:02:18.250> bulb<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.870> it's<00:02:19.990> not<00:02:20.140> very

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
incandescent bulb so it's not very

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.260 
incandescent bulb so it's not very
bright<00:02:20.590> at<00:02:20.830> all<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.280> don't<00:02:21.520> know<00:02:21.640> what<00:02:21.850> they<00:02:22.030> set

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
bright at all I don't know what they set

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.060 
bright at all I don't know what they set
it<00:02:22.420> equal<00:02:22.540> on<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.260> package<00:02:23.710> let<00:02:24.610> me<00:02:24.730> look<00:02:24.970> here

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
it equal on the package let me look here
