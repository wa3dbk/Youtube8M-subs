blackhead they made and you know I think
that's<00:01:12.510> maybe<00:01:12.720> why<00:01:13.020> North<00:01:13.409> reasons<00:01:13.710> why<00:01:13.770> I

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
that's maybe why North reasons why I

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.070 
that's maybe why North reasons why I
enjoy<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.490> look<00:01:14.610> at<00:01:14.790> me<00:01:14.909> get<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.750> point<00:01:15.960> out

enjoy the look at me get to point out

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.070 
enjoy the look at me get to point out
it's<00:01:16.500> fair<00:01:17.100> shake<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.479> limited

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
it's fair shake like that the limited

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.350 
it's fair shake like that the limited
and<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.259> was<00:01:19.470> quite<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.100> it's<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.759> little<00:01:20.909> easier

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
and I was quite so it's a little easier

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.040 
and I was quite so it's a little easier
transition<00:01:21.750> into<00:01:22.380> this

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
transition into this

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.520 
transition into this
was<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:23.980> red<00:01:24.160> it's<00:01:24.430> a<00:01:24.520> difficult<00:01:24.970> loss<00:01:25.600> as

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
was the red it's a difficult loss as

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.890 
was the red it's a difficult loss as
well<00:01:26.710> as<00:01:26.830> things<00:01:27.040> that<00:01:27.130> could<00:01:27.460> just<00:01:27.700> get<00:01:28.630> out

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
well as things that could just get out

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.730 
well as things that could just get out
to<00:01:29.110> pretty<00:01:29.350> quickly<00:01:29.590> yeah<00:01:30.300> did<00:01:31.300> you<00:01:32.200> know<00:01:32.260> the

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
to pretty quickly yeah did you know the

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.400 
to pretty quickly yeah did you know the
shapes<00:01:33.010> were<00:01:33.660> traditional<00:01:34.660> golf<00:01:34.780> shapes<00:01:35.140> the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
shapes were traditional golf shapes the

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.460 
shapes were traditional golf shapes the
end<00:01:35.920> up<00:01:36.460> having<00:01:37.090> an<00:01:37.240> untraditional<00:01:37.900> color<00:01:38.410> i

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
end up having an untraditional color i

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.520 
end up having an untraditional color i
think<00:01:39.160> really<00:01:39.250> not<00:01:39.490> especially<00:01:39.880> after<00:01:40.530> we

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
think really not especially after we

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.140 
think really not especially after we
play<00:01:41.770> with<00:01:41.950> against<00:01:42.370> guys<00:01:42.520> are<00:01:42.730> using<00:01:42.910> white

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
play with against guys are using white

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.500 
play with against guys are using white
drivers<00:01:43.600> yeah<00:01:43.840> great<00:01:44.290> drivers<00:01:44.800> and<00:01:45.070> so<00:01:45.510> you

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
drivers yeah great drivers and so you

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.330 
drivers yeah great drivers and so you
kind<00:01:46.660> of<00:01:46.780> expect<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.470> unexpected<00:01:47.590> knows<00:01:48.070> all

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
kind of expect the unexpected knows all

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.970 
kind of expect the unexpected knows all
right<00:01:48.850> so<00:01:49.300> how<00:01:49.630> else<00:01:49.810> is<00:01:49.960> your<00:01:50.020> game<00:01:50.290> the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
right so how else is your game the

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.120 
right so how else is your game the
