00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:03.899
 Now we want to take you to the north of the state of Sinaloa for you 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.930
 know the validation of a very strategic crop for the generation of 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.940
 energy, particularly from biodiesel, is treated for the cultivation of the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.379
 jatropha that in different countries has proven to be an alternative 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.880
 ecological very functional for the purpose of generating fuel for mexico this 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.390
 culture could be the most strategic for analysis purposes with oscar you 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.610
 what it is doing in that region of sinaloa that is a pioneer in the 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.610
 jatropha research 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.460
 the cultivation of energy plants 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.720
 It is a theme that now spreads throughout different parts of the world as a 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.120
 alternative to generate fuels of vegetable origin 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.120
 replacing fossil-derived hydrocarbons 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.370
 the sinaloa 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.269
 for second consecutive Year 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.679
 the cultivation of jatropha is evaluated 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.740
 for the production of biodiesel 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.740
 is a proposal of agriculture for marginalized areas 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.249
 Jatropha is a plant native to Mexico and Central America 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.260
 but it grows in the tropical and subtropical environments of all the countries that 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.760
 they share this characteristic 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.560
 the most commercially exploited species 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.160
 is the one known by its botanical name as Castro faculties 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.049
 and now for the diversity of the use of biofuels 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.570
 It is grown in Central and South America 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.570
 Southeast Asia India and Africa 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.030
 the cultivation of this oleaginous plant 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.770
 is evaluated for the second year in a row in the experimental field of sinaloa 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.270
 leyva in the municipality of sinaloa 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.020
 to the north of the state of the same name 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.170
 During the first evaluation of this crop very good results were obtained 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.289
 flattering 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.020
 that sets a precedent for viability 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.600
 of the production of this plant among the marginalized in the high regions 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.210
 where traditional agriculture 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.259
 it's not profitable 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.219
 The initiative is developed at the request of individuals and is supported by 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.709
 foundation produces sinaloa 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.469
 in the devaluation lot 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:23.319
 is testing the behavior of four genotypes that currently 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.589
 they are in commercial exploitation 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:31.459
 in the country of india the initiative seeks in the first place to promote a 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.069
 productive reconversion for the benefit of farmers in marginalized areas in 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.869
 the sinaloa highs 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:43.079
 and thereby promote the generation of biofuels as required by the 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.349
 operational coordinator of foundation produces sinaloa 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.419
 North Zone 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.419
 engineer rafael careaga angle 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.959
 prepare an issue 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.429
 11 ep an important support for producers 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:04.129
 in other options 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.369
 dedyn diverse because here in the 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:09.499
 the mountain area 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:11.809
 the most difficult one 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:13.619
 plant 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:16.359
 corn bean chickpea wheat 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.019
 but these areas 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.709
 where they asked us to foundation produces we have created by a 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.780
 producer group c that we helped them validate 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.069
 if it is viable 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.859
 the production of 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.049
 she works 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.529
 to accelerate 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:34.659
 in these areas 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.959
 a lot of manpower and take advantage 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.179
 land 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:41.359
 that at present they are not taking advantage 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.949
 for me a crop 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.409
 see you 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.609
 very good alternative 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.979
 for 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.979
 produce biofuels 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.049
 the jatropha curcas 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.749
 it is a perennial plant 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:08.199
 whose productive cycle say that it extends to about 45 to 50 years 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.719
 Offers fast growth and normal height of two to three meters 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:18.439
 but under optimal conditions can grow more than double 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:24.379
 the thickness of the trunk is about 20 centimeters and from it different 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:26.400
 connotations of branches 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.790
 As part of this validation the study of four is being considered 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.340
 jatropha genotypes in different production conditions 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:37.400
 under drip irrigation conditions 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.900
 gravity irrigation 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.650
 and without risk fuck you coastal 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.550
 During the first year of evaluation in 2007, very good results were obtained 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.330
 encouraging above those obtained in India and other countries of 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.400
 reference 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.350
 the engineer josé guadalupe félix moreno technician of the center of 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.400
 validation and after the loss of the technology of sinaloa responsible for the project of 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.479
 jatropha comments on some characteristics of the crop 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.009
 in the north of sinaloa 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.440
 I expected the first harvest at 18 months 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.110
 percent taking out advancing goal the harvest at 10 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.990
 months development 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.330
 percent 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.370
 and with an average omp talking more or less in Greek dripping 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.469
 we have around 700 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:36.719
 80 kilograms on average the four clones 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:38.240
 i and in 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.150
 and the truth 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.150
 we have an average of 6 170 kilograms 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:50.509
 and in temporary percent he got an approximate yield of 480 kilograms 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:52.139
 l this 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.269
 neces per encomque by people by the people of biodisel industries 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.469
 more or less than 200 to 250 kilograms 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:03.360
 that was the first harvest 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.960
 and it can not be 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.059
 Expectations were exceeded 

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:14.249
 irurita antero we are around 12 months mix tala where she demos 

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:20.289
 already with some flowering
