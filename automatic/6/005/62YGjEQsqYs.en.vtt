like<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.290> wasn't<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.830> we<00:00:14.190> there<00:00:14.670> were<00:00:14.759> periods

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
like it wasn't it we there were periods

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.630 
like it wasn't it we there were periods
where<00:00:15.330> we<00:00:15.420> were<00:00:15.509> excellent<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:17.460> have

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
where we were excellent and and we have

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.950 
where we were excellent and and we have
definitely<00:00:18.000> got<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> collection<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.660> attacking

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
definitely got a collection of attacking

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.660 
definitely got a collection of attacking
players<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.619> somewhere<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.220> there<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.640> a

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
players that somewhere in there is a

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.779 
players that somewhere in there is a
devastating<00:00:21.029> unit<00:00:21.830> not<00:00:22.830> on<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> pitch<00:00:23.310> yet

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
devastating unit not on the pitch yet

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.990 
devastating unit not on the pitch yet
but<00:00:24.480> somewhere<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.140> mix<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.590> mean<00:00:25.880> when<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
but somewhere in the mix I mean when the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.790 
but somewhere in the mix I mean when the
team<00:00:27.180> sheet<00:00:27.390> was<00:00:27.480> announced<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.560> think

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
team sheet was announced and you think

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.140 
team sheet was announced and you think
you<00:00:28.890> know<00:00:29.010> what's<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> system<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.849> lot<00:00:30.029> of

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
you know what's the system is a lot of

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.820 
you know what's the system is a lot of
different<00:00:30.390> things<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.660> could<00:00:30.810> have<00:00:30.929> been<00:00:31.080> it's

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
different things it could have been it's

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.790 
different things it could have been it's
essentially<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.550> 4-5-1<00:00:33.260> with<00:00:34.260> Janna<00:00:34.469> Zion

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
essentially like a 4-5-1 with Janna Zion

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.940 
essentially like a 4-5-1 with Janna Zion
one<00:00:35.010> flank<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:36.380> DeMaria<00:00:37.380> on<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.590> other<00:00:37.739> flank

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
one flank and DeMaria on the other flank

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.250 
one flank and DeMaria on the other flank
and<00:00:38.160> Van<00:00:38.940> Persie<00:00:39.120> up<00:00:39.360> front<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.840> some<00:00:40.050> ways

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
and Van Persie up front and in some ways

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.350 
and Van Persie up front and in some ways
that's<00:00:41.129> looking<00:00:41.579> close<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> sort<00:00:42.300> of

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
that's looking close to the sort of

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.540 
that's looking close to the sort of
4-3-3<00:00:42.750> system<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.440> we<00:00:43.500> think<00:00:43.710> maybe<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
4-3-3 system that we think maybe is a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.639 
4-3-3 system that we think maybe is a
long<00:00:44.850> term<00:00:45.090> option<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.660> van<00:00:45.809> Gaal<00:00:46.020> but<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
long term option for van Gaal but the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.400 
long term option for van Gaal but the
personnel<00:00:47.039> aren't<00:00:47.190> quite<00:00:47.430> there<00:00:47.610> yet<00:00:47.750> I<00:00:48.750> mean

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
personnel aren't quite there yet I mean

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.690 
personnel aren't quite there yet I mean
I<00:00:49.500> know<00:00:49.590> you're<00:00:49.800> not<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.980> big<00:00:50.160> fan<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.370> Yama's

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
I know you're not a big fan of Yama's

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.639 
I know you're not a big fan of Yama's
eyes<00:00:50.820> wide<00:00:51.449> forward<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.079> think<00:00:52.289> he's<00:00:52.440> got

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
eyes wide forward but I think he's got

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.260 
eyes wide forward but I think he's got
some<00:00:53.070> think<00:00:53.370> there<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.820> could<00:00:53.969> contribute

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
some think there that could contribute

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.319 
some think there that could contribute
not<00:00:54.840> as<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> wing<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.320> think<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.070> 4-3-3<00:00:56.520> that

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
not as a wing I think in the 4-3-3 that

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.110 
not as a wing I think in the 4-3-3 that
sorry<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.410> butt<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:58.949> family<00:00:59.609> in<00:01:00.030> a

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
sorry to butt in on your family in a

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.209 
sorry to butt in on your family in a
4-3-3<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.840> Louie<00:01:00.989> van<00:01:01.199> ha<00:01:01.350> once<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.829> play<00:01:01.980> as

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
4-3-3 that Louie van ha once to play as

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.219 
4-3-3 that Louie van ha once to play as
an<00:01:02.609> inverted<00:01:02.969> winger<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.539> think<00:01:03.809> he<00:01:03.870> would<00:01:04.019> work

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
an inverted winger I think he would work

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.380 
an inverted winger I think he would work
but<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.920> think<00:01:05.159> when<00:01:05.820> we're<00:01:05.909> playing<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.240> like

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
but I think when we're playing it's like

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.050 
but I think when we're playing it's like
four<00:01:06.689> one<00:01:06.990> two<00:01:07.320> one<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.890> he's<00:01:08.040> further<00:01:08.729> out

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
four one two one and he's further out

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.090 
four one two one and he's further out
like<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:10.020> Dean<00:01:10.229> said<00:01:10.470> earlier<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.799> his<00:01:10.890> fan

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
like like Dean said earlier on his fan

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.730 
like like Dean said earlier on his fan
cam<00:01:11.310> has<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.000> cut<00:01:12.150> into<00:01:12.390> cross<00:01:12.689> or<00:01:13.110> he<00:01:13.590> has<00:01:13.710> to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
cam has to cut into cross or he has to

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.070 
cam has to cut into cross or he has to
rely<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> overlap<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> winger<00:01:15.659> be<00:01:16.049> a

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
rely on the overlap to be a winger be a

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.050 
rely on the overlap to be a winger be a
fallback<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:17.250> not<00:01:17.490> happening<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:17.939> him

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
fallback and it's not happening for him

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.450 
fallback and it's not happening for him
and<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.689> think<00:01:18.869> he<00:01:18.960> needs<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.200> be<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:20.189> final

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
and I think he needs to be in that final

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.030 
and I think he needs to be in that final
third<00:01:20.850> or<00:01:21.509> getting<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> receiving<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.890> ball

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
third or getting the receiving the ball

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.859 
third or getting the receiving the ball
would<00:01:23.220> space<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.759> front<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.060> him<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.299> run<00:01:24.570> unto

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
would space in front of him to run unto

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.810 
would space in front of him to run unto
it<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.650> feel<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:25.950> when<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.460> defenders

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
it I just feel like when the defenders

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.010 
it I just feel like when the defenders
in<00:01:26.909> front<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.180> him<00:01:27.270> he<00:01:27.330> hasn't<00:01:27.479> got<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.689> know<00:01:27.780> I

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
in front of him he hasn't got you know I

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.080 
in front of him he hasn't got you know I
think<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.710> might<00:01:29.189> be<00:01:29.220> valid<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.939> also

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
think that might be valid but I also

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.580 
think that might be valid but I also
think<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.450> might<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.720> very<00:01:30.840> early<00:01:31.170> days<00:01:31.350> yet

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
think it might be very early days yet

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.350 
think it might be very early days yet
because<00:01:31.950> here's<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.460> player<00:01:32.700> who<00:01:32.850> exploded

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
onto the scene looked electrifying

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.219 
onto the scene looked electrifying
looked<00:01:35.880> her<00:01:35.970> best<00:01:36.000> attacking<00:01:36.810> player<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
whole of last season whenever he played

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.080 
whole of last season whenever he played

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
and then he's his position in the side

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.760 
and then he's his position in the side
is<00:01:42.240> very<00:01:42.420> uncertain<00:01:42.780> now<00:01:43.110> everything's

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
is very uncertain now everything's

is very uncertain now everything's
changed

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
changed

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.069 
changed
the<00:01:44.759> managers<00:01:45.180> changed<00:01:45.509> whatever<00:01:45.750> we<00:01:45.899> think

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
the managers changed whatever we think

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.109 
the managers changed whatever we think
of<00:01:46.290> noise<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:47.070> januzaj<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.759> player<00:01:48.000> that

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
of noise for januzaj that player that

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.429 
of noise for januzaj that player that
he's<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.450> manager<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.020> brought<00:01:49.170> them<00:01:49.320> into

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
he's the manager that brought them into

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.590 
he's the manager that brought them into
the<00:01:49.649> side<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.130> maybe<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.790> means<00:01:50.909> something<00:01:51.509> I

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the side so maybe that means something I

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.440 
the side so maybe that means something I
don't<00:01:51.810> know<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.159> so<00:01:53.159> yeah<00:01:53.549> that's<00:01:54.090> not<00:01:54.299> been

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
don't know and so yeah that's not been

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.510 
don't know and so yeah that's not been
exciting<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:54.930> go<00:01:55.259> back<00:01:55.470> by<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.649> way<00:01:55.860> very

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
exciting we go back by the way very

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.560 
exciting we go back by the way very
clear<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.979> so<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.009> think<00:01:59.430> that<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.450> to

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
clear and but so I think that we have to

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.819 
clear and but so I think that we have to
be<00:02:00.659> careful<00:02:00.930> about<00:02:01.049> our<00:02:01.110> expectations<00:02:01.740> but

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
be careful about our expectations but

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.200 
be careful about our expectations but
anyway<00:02:02.100> when<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.250> saw<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.520> team<00:02:02.820> sheet<00:02:03.060> and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
anyway when I saw the team sheet and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.609 
anyway when I saw the team sheet and
you're<00:02:03.360> seeing<00:02:03.570> am<00:02:03.689> as<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.930> am<00:02:03.960> van<00:02:04.200> persie<00:02:04.530> up

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.429 
you're seeing am as I am van persie up
front<00:02:04.890> starting<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.549> think<00:02:05.719> that<00:02:06.719> there<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.229> a

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
front starting to think that there is a

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.990 
front starting to think that there is a
kind<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.009> recipe<00:02:08.369> for<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.550> lack<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.729> fluency

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
kind of recipe for a lack of fluency

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.360 
kind of recipe for a lack of fluency
there<00:02:09.390> there's<00:02:09.599> also<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:10.200> recipe<00:02:10.800> potential

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
there there's also a recipe potential

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.890 
there there's also a recipe potential
enormous<00:02:11.730> success<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.150> could<00:02:12.330> go<00:02:12.540> very<00:02:12.780> well

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
enormous success it could go very well

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.550 
enormous success it could go very well
but

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
but

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.839 
but
kind<00:02:13.770> of<00:02:13.860> went<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.099> other<00:02:14.160> way<00:02:14.370> I'm<00:02:14.670> van

equaliser<00:03:00.569> against<00:03:00.870> West<00:03:01.080> Brom<00:03:01.230> shout<00:03:01.470> what

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
equaliser against West Brom shout what

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.289 
equaliser against West Brom shout what
West<00:03:02.099> Bromwich<00:03:02.280> Albion<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:02.849> that's<00:03:03.090> not<00:03:03.269> a

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
West Bromwich Albion and that's not a

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.960 
West Bromwich Albion and that's not a
great<00:03:03.540> thing<00:03:03.569> is<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.110> we<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:05.069> know<00:03:05.190> we<00:03:05.610> should

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
great thing is it we you know we should

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.180 
great thing is it we you know we should
be<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.150> better<00:03:06.360> sight<00:03:06.569> than<00:03:06.780> them<00:03:06.989> but<00:03:07.620> tonight

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
be a better sight than them but tonight

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.160 
be a better sight than them but tonight
we<00:03:08.370> weren't<00:03:08.580> maybe<00:03:09.150> marginally<00:03:09.810> but<00:03:10.019> you

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
we weren't maybe marginally but you

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.020 
we weren't maybe marginally but you
couldn't<00:03:10.440> say<00:03:10.680> they<00:03:11.220> didn't<00:03:11.489> deserve<00:03:11.880> at

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
couldn't say they didn't deserve at

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.240 
couldn't say they didn't deserve at
least<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.299> drill<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:13.620> work<00:03:13.799> in<00:03:14.010> progress

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
least the drill the work in progress

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.210 
least the drill the work in progress
that<00:03:14.459> they<00:03:14.819> slew<00:03:15.030> even<00:03:15.299> our<00:03:15.450> side<00:03:15.900> is

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
that they slew even our side is

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.710 
that they slew even our side is
absolutely<00:03:17.220> because<00:03:17.549> if<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:18.030> look<00:03:18.269> at<00:03:18.480> what's

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
absolutely because if you look at what's

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.720 
absolutely because if you look at what's
been<00:03:18.900> addressed<00:03:19.290> in<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.560> summer<00:03:19.799> it's<00:03:20.549> an

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
been addressed in the summer it's an

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.220 
been addressed in the summer it's an
enormous<00:03:21.150> percentage<00:03:21.329> of<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.870> things<00:03:22.049> that

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
enormous percentage of the things that

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.050 
enormous percentage of the things that
we<00:03:22.350> needed<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.680> have<00:03:23.190> addressed<00:03:23.549> considering

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
we needed to have addressed considering

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.270 
we needed to have addressed considering
it's<00:03:24.150> only<00:03:24.299> one<00:03:24.480> summer<00:03:24.750> but<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.769> is<00:03:25.799> only<00:03:26.070> one
