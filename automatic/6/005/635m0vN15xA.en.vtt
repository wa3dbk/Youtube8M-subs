made<00:01:04.900> me<00:01:05.050> his<00:01:05.410> tires<00:01:05.680> up<00:01:05.890> a<00:01:05.980> little<00:01:06.190> bit<00:01:06.310> trying

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
made me his tires up a little bit trying

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.220 
made me his tires up a little bit trying
to<00:01:06.700> get<00:01:07.090> down<00:01:07.270> in<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.510> corner<00:01:07.870> a<00:01:07.900> little<00:01:07.990> bit

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
to get down in the corner a little bit

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.410 
to get down in the corner a little bit
hard<00:01:08.440> any<00:01:08.620> there's<00:01:09.340> only<00:01:09.460> got<00:01:09.640> six<00:01:09.880> laps<00:01:10.090> to<00:01:10.300> go

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
hard any there's only got six laps to go

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.150 
hard any there's only got six laps to go
so<00:01:10.720> guess<00:01:11.230> this<00:01:11.380> might<00:01:11.500> as<00:01:11.590> well<00:01:11.620> use<00:01:11.890> them<00:01:12.010> up

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160
