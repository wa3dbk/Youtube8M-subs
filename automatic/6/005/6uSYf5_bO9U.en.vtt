00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
 fish are already many and you get into the cabin to record 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.650
 and quickie because time is money 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.399
 I think a good learning that your baby can take out this week 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.570
 What I feel like I have is that I'm too 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.570
 because the time you were going to have to prepare your song 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.210
 Finally 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.980
 five days four days a day because for example your song is 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.039
 rode on thursday 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.140
 they had less time for this habit alone had good 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.570
 I think it's a lot like on board was studying a clear song that 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.500
 The more time you have, the quieter you are, and the better you will come out. 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.109
 all to all if I to mine a song to study took it to 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.739
 study already knowing how to talk the viagra the better left that took long two 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.820
 times and he sang it that's normal 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.090
 but tokyo is to start working 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.370
 with a mentality as we want more speed 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.530
 to learn the choreography to learn from the strokes 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.360
 to learn what variations on the streets 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.149
 to turn on the letter of the song 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.150
 so then 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.900
 your hotel that want to put your work rhythm more more percent more means 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.950
 finally had and I mentioned the answers to the signs here and you're 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.430
 working well 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.790
 and every time you are moving forward and moving forward 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.690
 sometimes a little slower than I think you would like too 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.920
 but finally you keep moving forward and that's good 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.900
 yes I think what if you put a little more speed to that path that 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.900
 these finally moving forward and that's what's important 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.260
 as it says our very well to the best is that it is a question of a mac 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.070
 more time but here finally you continue to pepper this follow exquisite 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.320
 Advanced that is a little bit is good for you in your life and your personal career 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.590
 regardless of the competence of civil mission luxe I put you that this 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.810
 week with the song that you touch the edges with a mindset of working what 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.870
 faster 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.040
 for what if you already know it if only half the work done if you do not 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.160
 you know you have to work faster thinking what would happen if tomorrow I have 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.930
 to sing how I do to learn the fastest so then you 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.710
 Optimist is your time and what does it matter to me that they are five desserts or 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:11.499
 two 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:14.909
 and that you can learn from a song and that's going to be a very learning 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.219
 important for your career because really, very rarely are you going to have 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:19.370
 enough time 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.319
 for study 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.940
 dad is a song to light cloth so I can check it on how it happens 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.939
 here even not even though it was the montage this 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.219
 have a little more 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.389
 of intuition to tackle it with more speed and that's going to be a good 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.389
 learning for you 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.599
 chilectra canaria 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.599
 chain 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:46.059
 everyone would like 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.870
 past 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.839
 Question 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.889

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:55.839
 you did not come to win 11 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:03:00.009
 Sincerely, he does not believe that he will be reduced, so why not 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.769
 you entered the conservatory of almeria I would like to say I am crazy academy of 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.829
 sincerely I believe that better voices 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.100
 I thank you for the simple answer 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.850
 you want to win yes yes I would like but poseidon be very simple bazalar 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.850
 Question is very simple answer want to win 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.109
 yes I would like it 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.109
 I want to be if you do not win the finalists 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.619
 have you seen soccer 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:33.519
 what type led 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.489
 to the Mexican national team 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.119
 because you go to chivas 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:39.849
 Women of Guadalajara 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.869
 flaws and the people's face-to-face 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:44.759
 although unsuccessful 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.779
 another of the things that is criticized the most football 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:49.579
 to the national 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.779
 especially the shock 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:55.299
 we play a lot of sport although it seems that only football can be 

00:03:57.649 --> 00:04:00.299
 many times the selection 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.099
 or the atlas or any other equipment 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.379
 goes out on the field when defending 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.439
 inactivity 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.159
 I happen to bol 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.519
 because they come out and nothing more common from one place to another from one side to the other 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.190
 one side to another and is that having 2% down the ball 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.140
 i thought 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.130
 nothing they will need more than to see 22 people 23 with the referee in the middle 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.039
 court 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:38.400
 I say good it seems that they go to study bath anything else to me 

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:41.399
 that's why I like the American because every move closed 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:49.180
 Each move advances 4 inches nor the full yard eduar list 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.680
 I think that consumption 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.439
 because many times they come out 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:56.439
 only to pilot 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.199
 stop rallying not 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.999
 heap therapy 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:04.259
 yasky 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.259
 t are divided 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.289
 current as far as it has arrived 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:12.830
 for whatever reason 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.979
 I'm not going to judge him 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.129
 fiat how far it has come and how far it has come with endorsements and 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.610
 so 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.020
 I suddenly what I feel is that you are very afraid not to be totally 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.620
 protected 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.069
 in the sense of the perfect montage the choreography that yes or 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:37.090
 I'm so scared and we demand so much of please take better care take me up 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:40.089
 where they have to go please solution on edge 

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:44.749
 and you notice you want to die 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:47.999
 you do not throw 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:49.330
 once 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.759
 please 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:53.249
 good is unfair 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:54.469
 once 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:57.520
 before you leave, it does not matter when you leave 

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:01.119
 marmoset 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:02.909
 alomejor fallas 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:05.960
 but at least it says the sea 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.660
 all in the same organ in a trap maybe you have a very good goalkeeper 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.139
 something does not come 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.139
 but at least I saw you 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.979
 of course well another Turkish t√ºrkoglu
