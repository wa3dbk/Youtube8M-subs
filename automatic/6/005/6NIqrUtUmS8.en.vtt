00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.630 
because in the middle of summer I knew I
knew<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.479> didn't<00:01:51.960> want<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.860> trust<00:01:53.250> anyone

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
knew that I didn't want to trust anyone

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.749 
knew that I didn't want to trust anyone
or<00:01:53.939> anything<00:01:54.240> for<00:01:55.049> my<00:01:55.200> future<00:01:55.530> or<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:56.549> my

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
or anything for my future or for my

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.190 
or anything for my future or for my
career<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.530> thought<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.689> turning<00:02:00.689> towards

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
career so I thought of turning towards

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.850 
career so I thought of turning towards
God<00:02:01.439> as<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> way<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:03.259> showing<00:02:04.259> myself<00:02:04.409> or

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
God as a way of showing myself or

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.920 
God as a way of showing myself or
convincing<00:02:05.250> myself<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:06.240> don't<00:02:06.780> need

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
convincing myself that I don't need

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.630 
convincing myself that I don't need
anyone<00:02:07.380> or<00:02:07.409> anything<00:02:07.740> from<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.250> world

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
anyone or anything from this world

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.730 
anyone or anything from this world
when<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.030> started<00:02:09.390> praying<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.960> was<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.530> was<00:02:10.619> my

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
when I started praying it was it was my

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.540 
when I started praying it was it was my
biggest<00:02:10.979> secret<00:02:11.310> no<00:02:12.000> one<00:02:12.210> knew<00:02:12.500> I<00:02:13.550> would

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
biggest secret no one knew I would

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.280 
biggest secret no one knew I would
always<00:02:14.700> make<00:02:14.819> up<00:02:15.060> excuses<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.630> go<00:02:15.900> pray<00:02:16.140> my

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
always make up excuses to go pray my

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.650 
always make up excuses to go pray my
prayers<00:02:16.530> on<00:02:16.740> time<00:02:17.240> absolutely<00:02:18.240> no<00:02:18.360> one<00:02:18.480> knew

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
prayers on time absolutely no one knew

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.170 
prayers on time absolutely no one knew
neither<00:02:19.050> my<00:02:19.260> friends<00:02:19.740> no<00:02:19.890> my<00:02:20.040> parents

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
neither my friends no my parents

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.880 
neither my friends no my parents
it<00:02:21.480> was<00:02:21.630> unspoken<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:23.330> it<00:02:24.330> was<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:25.560> was<00:02:25.740> really

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
it was unspoken of it was it was really

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.160 
it was unspoken of it was it was really
it<00:02:26.400> was<00:02:26.490> strange<00:02:27.090> for<00:02:27.330> me<00:02:27.360> because<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.840> was

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
it was strange for me because I was

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.420 
it was strange for me because I was
afraid<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.740> was<00:02:28.830> just<00:02:29.100> going<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.310> be<00:02:29.400> a

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
afraid that it was just going to be a

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.330 
afraid that it was just going to be a
phase<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.810> was<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.410> going<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.770> get<00:02:31.980> over

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
phase that I was just going to get over

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.270 
phase that I was just going to get over
eventually<00:02:32.700> because<00:02:33.709> turning<00:02:34.709> towards<00:02:35.070> God

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
eventually because turning towards God

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.520 
eventually because turning towards God
for<00:02:35.580> help<00:02:35.790> or<00:02:36.090> praying<00:02:36.720> towards<00:02:37.050> God<00:02:37.230> was<00:02:37.350> not

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
for help or praying towards God was not

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.949 
for help or praying towards God was not
really<00:02:37.980> part<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.250> my<00:02:38.310> life<00:02:38.550> before<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.300> so<00:02:39.630> in

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
really part of my life before and so in

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.290 
really part of my life before and so in
in<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.470> beginning<00:02:40.590> my<00:02:40.980> fourth<00:02:41.280> year<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.580> wanted

healthy
I'd<00:03:57.870> say<00:03:58.079> healthy<00:03:58.530> and<00:03:59.900> my<00:04:00.900> grades<00:04:01.230> were

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
I'd say healthy and my grades were

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.160 
I'd say healthy and my grades were
gradually<00:04:01.890> getting<00:04:02.010> better<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.880> it<00:04:03.660> was<00:04:03.780> very

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
gradually getting better and it was very

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.599 
gradually getting better and it was very
very<00:04:04.470> gradual<00:04:05.570> consistently<00:04:06.570> increasing<00:04:07.109> and

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
very gradual consistently increasing and

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.460 
very gradual consistently increasing and
now<00:04:08.609> my<00:04:08.820> grades<00:04:09.090> are<00:04:09.359> good<00:04:09.420> enough<00:04:10.019> for<00:04:10.200> me<00:04:10.350> to

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
now my grades are good enough for me to

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.870 
now my grades are good enough for me to
apply<00:04:10.980> for<00:04:11.280> med<00:04:11.400> school

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880
