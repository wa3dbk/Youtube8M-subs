00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.810
 cannot have the performances of 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.690
 launch of the top ones 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.610
 otherwise if we were able to do the 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.660
 rest 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.720
 carbon a little cheap we would be 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.960
 state of the genes however in fishing 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.600

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.470
 and they are rods in three pieces that anyway 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.350
 allow to launch easily 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.830

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.990
 classic good components and 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:47.860
 however it is all treated against saltiness 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.080
 and will not give any problem to finish it 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.950
 a rubber knob and a socket 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:58.420
 ergonomic very well manageable even with 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:02.340
 wet hands while sister who 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:06.240
 we have long cast lightning is 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.760

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:40.810
 both rods, however, I want to 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:46.150
 specify that they are very manageable and 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:50.799
 a top is of the carbon type 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:53.739
