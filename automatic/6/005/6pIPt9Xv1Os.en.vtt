there's student before athlete and what

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.370 
there's student before athlete and what
I<00:02:39.500> always<00:02:39.590> say<00:02:39.740> is<00:02:40.180> sometimes<00:02:41.180> kids<00:02:42.020> forget

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.060 
that there's a scholar and scholarship
and<00:02:44.270> so<00:02:44.780> we<00:02:44.930> make<00:02:45.140> sure<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.410> our<00:02:45.680> kids

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
and so we make sure that our kids

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.710 
and so we make sure that our kids
understand<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:46.910> when<00:02:47.000> they<00:02:47.090> come<00:02:47.270> back<00:02:47.300> or
