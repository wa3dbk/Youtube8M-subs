 her the three turns as possible 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.110
 liquid in a row so that performs 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.989
 you have a fluid movement sequence 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.269
 generates first takes the ball with the 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.010

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.979
 both drag a change of direction 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.899
 outside with an outside instep then 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:02.140
 led a normal elastic

 by then bringing the ball back with you 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.449
 the inside in the other direction 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.449
 steers past 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.070
 June 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.140
 with the help of this trick you can do the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.219
 ball at yourselves and your 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.219
 to move opponents 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.070
 to get the ball up you turn 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.670
 Start with your strong foot first 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.640
 The ball then rolls with his foot 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.380
 front over the ball and then stomps forward 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.380
 the ball on the ground so the ball 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:56.600
 rolls against your hoe and flies high 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.259
 then you click the ball then 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.670
 with the hoe from other feet over 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:15.440
 over there if the ball then in the 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:17.180
 air is in this trick is it 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.010
 It is a combination of one 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.360
 double climbers and one 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.250
 Body delusion , you go first 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.080
 your left foot over the at and you 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.269
 such a run-away to the left to which the 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.980
 same then right after with yours 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.680
 right foot around twice the climber 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.200
 then you still go with it 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.780
 a left foot a body illusion 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.010
 So a failure step to the left and 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.310
 then leads the ball with the right one 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.600
 AuÃŸenrist past a opponent 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.459
 the side is trying a torso 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.760
 possible great incorporate the movement 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.450
 to let and the overcomers possible 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.450
 run fast 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.530
 This trick is a composition 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.050
 from a roll over a climber 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.100
 and a sculptures 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.470
 At first he wanted to get the ball in one 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.670
 direction and then goes straight into 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.090
 the same movement already one 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.110
 climbers around the ball and then 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.720
 He then takes the ball with the 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.640
 inside of the other foot with and 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.090
 then turn on during the ball 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.890
 your inside sticks with it 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.120
 You can then sculpt a relatively 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:44.650
 big and above all fast 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:45.750
 We are hoping for a change of direction 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.450
 we were able to do this tutorial 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:54.520
 help and of course you too 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:56.380
 The tricks casually we would practice ourselves 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.410
 over a thumb up over 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.530
 comments and about an abo on your part 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.370
