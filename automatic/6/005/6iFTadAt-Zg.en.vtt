00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hi girls I hope you go 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.600
 well today we find ourselves for 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.849
 make a little doubt on stage and 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.710
 today it is a jar in 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.719
 done to see your smoothies 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.719
 drinks for the summer you will see 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.920
 it's super end is really economical 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.350
 I leave you right away with the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.449
 next to start you're going to have 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.130
 need a glass jar that you 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.099
 can take whatever you want me 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.820
 personally I got a pot of 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.039
 Ratatouille 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.689
 I thought the template was perfect 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.630
 and at least I stay a little bit in 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.940
 this spirit of recycling so at the beginning it 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.100
 had a lid that was not very 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.340
 beautiful it was green and suddenly I 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.870
 recovered a jam cover you 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.719
 know it's good mom jams 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.270
 and here it is pink and white and I 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.180
 think it's perfect to do the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.920
 jars of this type 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.539
 you will also need a fault 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.699
 so the best is to learn it 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.590
 matched to the lid you will have 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.960
 found and then you will need 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.940
 of a drill so to make the hole 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.860
 in the lid so here it is a 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.299
 little lullaby from ikea who is 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.760
 very easy to use 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.000
 if you do not have one you can do 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.030
 the hole directly with a nail and the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.549
 grow as you go 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.369
 hole I'm going to take my lid 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.340
 and put me on my pot to have a 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.439
 kind of hand 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.060
 1 and I will come breakthrough actually 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.460
 really in the center 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.469
 you will see on the jars of jam 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.299
 like that where does not matter how much you have like 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:34.119
 a small middle circle that will serve you 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.340
 I use years in a first 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.579
 time a wick actually that is very 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:47.560
 fine to come breakthrough so I want 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:49.450
 take my landmark so that I 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.390
 take a little when it loses this because 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.369
 so it's going to be fair so that's where 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.049
 it has the small hole which is well 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.569
 middle so of course there he is too 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.520
 small for the straw I chose 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.159
 as I told you if you do not have 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.959
 drill you will just need a nail 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.319
 and a hammer to come and do this 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:10.479
 first hole and to come to enlarge the 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.780
 hole I have a tip like that in 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.049
 made 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.370
 round finally with ledges or in order 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.590
 this is what we use to 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.120
 possible jewelry so it is 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.790
 found in all leisure stores 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.579
 creative and so I'm going to come 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.480
 she shut up that way and I'm going 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:30.310
 to grow my hole as I go 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.769
 so that the hole is really 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.690
 round especially the turn must be that the 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:39.880
 clip turn fully as and when 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.870
 measure we will come to see if the straw 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.299
 can go inside so there is 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.480
 good for me the hole is really 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.919
 nickel and that's it already finished for 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.560
 this little do it yourself 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:55.900
 you have your little garden tips 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.510
 your worries I find it really cool to 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.790
 do apart from the drill you have 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.700
 just to find a nice lid and a 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.010
 jar with a template that suits you 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.230
 and of course the most important thing is 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.980
 you make nice drinks for 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.980
 summer so for me 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.379
 the habit of drinking isp at nahd so 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:20.209
 I put some ice cubes 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:29.269
 slices of organic lemon and I reach 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:31.730
 add cold water and I have 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:37.040
 more than to come put my lid 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:39.049
 with my little straw I really hope 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.329
 that this little tutorial will have pleased you and that 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.120
