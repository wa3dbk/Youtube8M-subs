00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.170
 There were people here youtube rolled him 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.690
 good about we're in a new one in 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.350
 good tutorial where it shows you a 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.880
 anime wallpaper that is from minecraft 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.250
 as we can see here in the background 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.849
 we see the different icons that move 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.589
 and good as we can have this is 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.390
 very simple first of all I want to say 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.699
 which of the minecraft this is the best 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.550
 that found and good in the most father 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.960
 but well let's see this common and if 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.480
 the wallpaper all that the 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.790
 options and good as we can find 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.590
 a store in then good first thing 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.470
 what we have to do is go to the 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.080
 place bull and look for this here that's 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.210
 flame craft your live wallpaper craft a 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.490
 your life is this one that has the symbol 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.520
 like diamond is free so good 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.810
 we are going to give it and well obviously 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.860
 you can see here in the images 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:58.850
 that of pumpkins here meat and good 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.800
 golden armor and so on 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.660
 day if you want to see the opinions 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.290
 of the users because here they are like 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.490
 were have 4.7 which is almost excellent and 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.330
 well then and what they have to 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.910
 do is 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.920
 install it and you will be able to be a 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.920
 icon that would be like this from here below 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.960
 and well then this let's see what 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.370
 has this wallpaper by default what 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.360
 will appear is a background like the same 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:31.450
 blue color but you will have this as 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.600
 pieces of iron and the occasional 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.930
 sword over here I'm like turning around and not 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.390
 good how can we change that and 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.630
 configure it so very simple we can 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.070
 follow us here directly or and define 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.350
 wallpaper or we can 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.240
 let him chop and also define the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.710
 wallpaper is the same good 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.620
 then here we give you on screen 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.720
 start animated backgrounds here I have several 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.850
 that I'll show you later that 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.600
 it seems very good and good here 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.520
 we have to attend what would be 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.440
 as we have it right now but remember 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.590
 that's not how it came by default here I 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.120
 configure it but well here we have what 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.120
 that would be to select the design 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.629
 who can see that there are different 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.219
 for example we have a candy carnivore 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.739
 these are already predetermined 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:26.120
 until it comes with meat is gold 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.980
 how did you see the images that come to 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.139
 time to look for the application if this one 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.719
 they want it more personalized they can 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.939
 see icon number I recommend them 75 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.049
 since they get consumption a little bit more 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:39.489
 Of battery 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.930
 but hey 75 the good thing here we can see 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.889
 all the things that are in minecraft 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.090
 almost like 70 80 percent of all 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:49.189
 the materials that the man graph are 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.659
 here at least the important and your 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.030
 selection is what you want to appear 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.859
 the screen in this case I chose then 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.930
 which we can see in the background here 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:59.389
 we can this choose the brightness level 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.030
 that I have, it feels like it's like 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:04.310
 it's good for him so that he does not consume 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.569
 so much battery we can also have the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:13.099
 transparency that it's good that 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:15.260
 objects are more transparent here 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.900
 what it says red green and blue good network 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.340
 it's like the combinations for the color 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.250
 of the fund in this case I have as a 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.040
 small makes a combined with green 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.140
 good wear the person looks good here 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.540
 we can see what will be wallpaper square 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.180
 link that is for the sticks to move 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.069
 how the figurines are going but good 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.670
 I have it like that 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:40.129
 and well we go to the minor and we can already 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.930
 see our great background then good already 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.700
 you know what it's called 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.950
 it's called kropff your life the symbol and 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.079
