00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.460
 Hey, people, youtube or more. 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:11.849
 A video lesson for you is what happens. 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.410
 I created a first program 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.910
 His classic I mean the following I 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.730
 I'm not a hacker. 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.850
 and another thing has a 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.180
 some still on facebook on facebook 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.220
 also on youtube that puts in some 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.840
 little thing already says that wrong that puts the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.660
 name, seed, so-and-so 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.200
 lie is everything lie wrong thing 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.360
 no one is a malicious person who is 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.170
 search the internet how to put a 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.910
 neighbor and places a program 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.399
 download 11 11 the text proposes the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.500
 user who is lay there and open and 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.620
 to damage a little something 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.300
 on the computer and still ask them to 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.829
 disable anti-virus right because it's incredible 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.449
 there what happens but do not miss that 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.170
 Nothing because first erring 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.949
 who does not say who is is is the person stays 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.430
 anonymous 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.189
 the person nor a taste that would make in 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.430
 that she is what they mention and what 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.850
 It happens then I work a little bit 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.009
 with programming and I was able to do some 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.250
 things here using ddm fest is a 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.409
 really cool problem is that we use and 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.540
 I'm going to show you a little something that 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.880
 has a business in which the new general TV 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.030
 daily plan 800 points 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.460
 has a shape that you put on and power me 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.890
 fest to accept that you win it at 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.040
 your daily newsletter you earn is 200 eu 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.880
 I think it 's the normal diary, you go. 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.159
 800 and that's a 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.720
 Bit boring and doing but it's another 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.840
 video lesson that I'm going to do I'll teach 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.460
 How to do that , it's good in this video. 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.229
 class that did not like you a problem 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.570
 that I created that is the tac or the adm fest 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.149
 point generator 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.329
 It generates points for you but it is the 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.150
 next you can only use it is not 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.620
 everyday 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:14.050
 and you can use it and have to vary 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.120
 not if you use every day of party going 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.830
 end up taking away your account 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.320
 Then I'll show you how 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.780
 It will make it easier for me not to be there. 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.460
 because I 'll be there, it's okay, I'll go 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:30.910
 open here the program here for you 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:32.200
 see how it works and lets it work 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.250
 opening here then I do not think 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.990
 You other thing has a browser already 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.120
 opened here the program is also 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.040
 asking me to put that serial 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.950
 Let de minimis here speak until the 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.660
 browser called ice dragon that bravo 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.550
 that it is a good 11 there firefox the same 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.500
 It's only a little bit faster 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.330
 and it 's a little better if it can be done 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.510
 some settings on it that do not speak 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.270
 strong is not how it is for example you already 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.310
 can leave the browser is is with your 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.800
 password you program it as a browser 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:10.150
 you leave your saved password from the 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.320
 facebook ooo your login and password or 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.970
 ddm fest 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.310
 leaves it as the default browser when 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.260
 You open the browser, he already logged in. 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.170
 You do not have to put it there. 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.380
 always yours, your new password is yours 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.540
 mail again, it does not already open on the page 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.000
 you saved for example save this 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.790
 page that is my good daily when 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.220
 flash in the browser here and I opened it 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.110
 again he already saw as a navigator 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.510
 standard on this page 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.670
 already the lawyer he gets the system logged 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.410
 even if you turn off the computer 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.970
 the same as you close the browser much 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.130
 cool, I'll leave the browser 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.340
 Also the link in the description for you 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.070
 download but come on what matters is 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.610
 that the program of fast carpet in the 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:57.040
 cereal or put here is here 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.070
 instructions opens the mg program in the 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.040
 serial number is this teaching point 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.320
 here and get six points but remember if the 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.310
 process can only be done 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.310
 every three days 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.620
 so your account will not be banned on ddm 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.130
 fest every three days and can not 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.110
 use every day if not you 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.660
 will lose the account the school has to 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.910
 open another quota at last is older 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.350
 Worth using the new pronoun. 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.130
 cool but you'll have to keep creating 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.570
 account 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.220
 You'd better stop being the eye. 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:34.730
 large and used every three days as 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.680
 Show me what I put into it. 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.370
 do this will thirst and close normal 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:48.490
 without creating accounts it is good that it is the 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:48.490
 serial here will be a works 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.930
 the forgiveness 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:05.580
 here I put the give 1 continue to open the 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.569
 program I 'm stirring baby not 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.229
 I'm done, and the process of 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:13.169
 reprogramming 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:16.919
 only I have already managed to generate up to 150 thousand 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:21.960
 points you can read here the 150 thousand 530 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:28.069
 thousand and 5 thousand and 70 thousand to 12 thousand 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:34.440
 150,000 trying to train him for 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:37.229
 put it to generate up to 300 thousand points 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.129
 It's difficult but I believe I go. 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.680
 get 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:45.150
 so I'll put here the 150,000 can 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:47.430
 I have used and already has already has four 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.770
 days 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.810
 I put the good that they do not need to 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.580
 put your crime path party until 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.099
 because like I said I'm not fast 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.889
 that she rachel in a single job with 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:01.159
 programming and here you do not need 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:04.349
 to vote just so put your e- mail 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:05.639
 We chose the point you want to generate will 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:09.060
 choose the maximum 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.949
 you will add the points click here 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.710
 and is already adding if you 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:15.240
 tries again but usually does not 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.440
 It's not a mistake, because I'm doing it. 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.120
 well done here 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.990
 let's wait for lau added points 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.380
 successfully 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.330
 Okay, and you're not going to stop six points. 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:33.029
 you have to close the web browser again 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:36.900
 then you close the program closes your 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:47.009
 browser you open again left 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:49.620
 open here o generated 176 1,087 points i 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:52.169
 had 26,087 nÃ© 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.650
 I made 150 thousand more, there's the problem I 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:57.900
 I'll leave my contact there for you. 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.129
 anything came to facebook on facebook 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.680
 I wanted another pro here too. 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:04.889
 that generates those dots is not so many 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.000
 points but I had some contacts in the 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:08.340
 Facebook 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.770
 I think the tour of 14 or 15 programs 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:14.130
 of those people are satisfied if 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:19.050
