much a maverick Strada

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.470 
much a maverick Strada
so<00:00:54.300> also<00:00:55.289> bought<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> body<00:00:55.949> just<00:00:56.390> stick<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
so also bought the body just stick the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.310 
so also bought the body just stick the
decals<00:00:57.930> on<00:00:58.140> there<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:59.930> I'll<00:01:00.930> show<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.170> it

when<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.559> done<00:01:02.239> also<00:01:03.239> I've<00:01:03.359> taken<00:01:03.629> out<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
when it's done also I've taken out the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.810 
when it's done also I've taken out the
the<00:01:04.739> old<00:01:04.860> motor<00:01:05.159> out<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.360> HSP<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.490> actually

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the old motor out the HSP so actually

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.730 
the old motor out the HSP so actually
blew<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> magnets<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.110> if<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.409> see<00:01:10.560> that

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
blew the magnets and if you can see that

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.990 
blew the magnets and if you can see that
they're<00:01:10.979> making<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.430> there<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:11.850> all

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
they're making it in there it's all

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.539 
they're making it in there it's all
shattered<00:01:12.560> miss<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> internals<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> old

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
shattered miss the internals of the old

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.990 
shattered miss the internals of the old
brushless<00:01:14.939> motor<00:01:15.409> so<00:01:16.409> replace<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.130> with

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
brushless motor so replace that with

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.140 
brushless motor so replace that with
this<00:01:18.360> new<00:01:18.600> brushless<00:01:18.900> motor<00:01:20.360> also<00:01:21.360> broke<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
this new brushless motor also broke the

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.170 
this new brushless motor also broke the
speed<00:01:24.150> controller<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.869> well<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.500> HSP<00:01:26.189> as<00:01:27.060> you

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
speed controller as well the HSP as you

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.359 
speed controller as well the HSP as you
can<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:28.560> doesn't<00:01:28.799> seem<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.189> work<00:01:29.310> too

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
can see that doesn't seem to work too

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.719 
can see that doesn't seem to work too
great<00:01:29.850> anymore<00:01:32.479> our<00:01:33.479> despair<00:01:34.280> monster<00:01:35.280> member

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
great anymore our despair monster member

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.840 
great anymore our despair monster member
speed<00:01:36.689> controls<00:01:37.110> are<00:01:37.259> sitting<00:01:37.470> around<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.130> I'm

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
speed controls are sitting around so I'm

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.310 
speed controls are sitting around so I'm
gonna<00:01:39.000> put<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.479> there<00:01:39.689> as<00:01:39.780> well<00:01:39.960> just

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
gonna put that in there as well just

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.240 
gonna put that in there as well just
need<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.280> sort<00:01:41.520> all<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.700> out<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:43.070> I'm<00:01:44.070> gonna

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
need to sort all this out and I'm gonna

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.310 
need to sort all this out and I'm gonna
run<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.780> free<00:01:45.780> s<00:01:46.399> Lippo<00:01:47.869> so<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.110> should

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
run it on a free s Lippo so you should

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.530 
run it on a free s Lippo so you should
be<00:01:49.439> pretty<00:01:49.590> good<00:01:49.740> all<00:01:50.460> go<00:01:50.729> away<00:01:50.790> for<00:01:51.149> now<00:01:51.329> is

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
be pretty good all go away for now is

be pretty good all go away for now is
just<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.840> get<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> edge<00:01:52.170> all<00:01:52.439> Mavericks

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
just to get the edge all Mavericks

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.700 
just to get the edge all Mavericks
through<00:01:53.159> our<00:01:53.220> wheels<00:01:53.750> but<00:01:54.750> as<00:01:54.930> for<00:01:55.200> time<00:01:55.439> now

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
through our wheels but as for time now

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.310 
through our wheels but as for time now
that<00:01:56.130> would<00:01:56.310> do<00:01:56.460> okay

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
that would do okay

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.940 
that would do okay
so<00:01:58.320> I'll<00:01:58.590> show<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.950> when<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.159> done<00:02:00.950> okay

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
so I'll show you it when it's done okay
