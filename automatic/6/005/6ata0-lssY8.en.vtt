00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.789
 Y 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.420
 hello welcome to the online drawing the 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.160
 today we are going to make a simple 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.459
 practice about the last topic that 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.280
 we saw about proportion is close 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.980
 of the male ratio and the 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.260
 female proportion in elementary form 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.330
 let's do a very simple practice 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.790
 in which we will emphasize an aspect 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:32.149
 which is that when we complain 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:33.680
 female figures let's look for that from the 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.350
 skeleton the movements look 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.329
 female and are male figures from 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.070
 the skeleton the figures look for 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.590
 masculine also here we have to 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.080
 comment on a fundamental issue 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.910
 which is that many people start to 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.610
 draw your characters sometimes for the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.330
 eyes or the head and for this reason 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.000
 when they finish their drawing they usually do not 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.850
 they fit on the sheet or on occasion 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.609
 draw more than one character 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.930
 on a sheet that is two or three 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.470
 characters like what we 're doing 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.930
 at this moment and now the feet 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.030
 are not aligned are people are left 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.710
 larger than the other one or one 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.600
 series of problems because we want to say 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.399
 also emphasis on that we should always 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.619
 to search draw first whenever 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.000
 we draw complete figures first 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.560
 what we should do is a line of 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.850
 proportion for us to make sure that 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.830
 our figure is centered on the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.600
 top part and bottom part 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.729
 for we make sure that if man 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.100
 be taller than women and that is 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.690
 we draw women in a scene so that 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.940
 let's also make sure that the little ears 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.610
 here of our sheet be well 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.590
 focused these kinds of practices being 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.440
 first the proportion lines go to 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.000
 be very useful so that everything remains 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.130
 well centered as I said many 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.869
 begin to be drawings and begin to 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.420
 times by the eyes then draw on the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.039
 head after drawing the shoulder and in 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.289
 many times the head is left for them 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.909
 here they do not fit this hand the other 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.590
 hand came out big the body no longer 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.119
 could complete because it's a very practice 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.100
 healthy when we draw figures 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.360
 complete always draw first the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.680
 lines of proportion also so that 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.250
 we are left the relative heights 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.020
 correctly as in this case 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.570
 the male figure and two small 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.550
 female figures that we are going to draw 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.710
 well we draw our line of 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.930
 proportion we divide in half in each 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.190
 one of the lines as we have been 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.800
 doing and as we said make a 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.690
 practice in which Figures 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.040
 men have male movements 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.990
 from the skeleton and the figures 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.570
 women who have movements 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.770
 welcome from the skeleton well the 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.910
 for example in this case we are going to 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.080
 try to do 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.080
 a female movement 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:42.549
 something like that since the skeleton is remarkable 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.610
 that the movement is female also in 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:54.069
 this case here we have the line of 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.280
 curved movement towards the front let's 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.980
 to do it a little bit we are going to bend the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.720
 back then we'll talk about movement and 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.720
 we will detail about these issues 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.530
 is to say something like that cuts anything else from 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.110
 very simple way 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.200
 as you can see we can talk a 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.600
 little bit simpler 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.380
 as you can see 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.930
 from the sketch the figures look 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:27.540
 female and this figure we are going to do 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.540
 that looks with more masculine 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.870
 very well now we will begin to fill 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.910
 the bodies as we have been 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.670
 doing remembering the principles that 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.530
 they go making them come either the 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.240
 ankles or wrists and that the body 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.740
 in the case of man be wide in 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.290
 the shoulders and in the case of women 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:05.690
 the widest part is emphasized in the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.690
 hip and also emphasize the waist 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:17.350
 well finally let's make a drawing 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:21.010
 using a slightly transparent sheet 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.140
 we are going to make a proposal so that 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.920
 see more or less what to do 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.920
 with this sketch 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.570
 well in this way we terminate 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.240
 this exercise remember what is important in 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.270
 this exercise was fundamentally 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.740
 observe that the lines of proportion are 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.020
 respect to make several figures in 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.400
 the same scene and they matter in this 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.110
 case was also add movements or 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.970
 vials be more masculine more 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.620
 women to know in advance that 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.190
 our figures will look like us 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.680
 we wish good no more we wish you 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.190
 keep having fun practicing until 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.190
 the next
