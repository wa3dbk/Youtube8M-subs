00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.630
 hi everyone today as promised i want 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.300
 show the movement mechanism 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.240
 extra has become made for 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.210
 my milling machine 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.920
 since I didn't plan for pressure 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.840
 traditional parallel stop it 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.900
 functions can replace any even 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.420
 bar with a sample under the mill and for work 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.189
 unrelated to an angle of 90 degrees and and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.199
 can be fixed on physics in any 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.199
 position on the additional table 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.980
 then the presence of a smooth horizontal 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:46.050
 the drive has become help to accurately establish 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.360
 cutter in relation to the workpiece height 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.719
 cutters can be changed by moving the carriage with 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.719
 frezerom 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.730
 for making this drive i 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.609
 used a stud diameter of 12 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.449
 three millimeters nuts 2 ordinary and one 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.180
 elongated 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.590
 steel ball bearing piece 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.430
 corner as well as the bearing which with 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.140
 a small gap 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.780
 wore a hairpin cut off the corner and 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.840
 filtered hole a little more than 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.490
 stud diameter also planted hole 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.650
 center and mounting bracket 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.869
 additional became 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.650
 tighten the elongated nut on the stud 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.560
 also clamping a corner between two nuts 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.049
 welded corner mount bracket 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.659
 additional became after this 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.549
 picked up an elongated nut took off 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.659
 brackets regarding everything welded in 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.490
 vise drilled a small recess 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.649
 about 3 millimeter in the center of the stud 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.009
 which will be inserted later 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.570
 steel ball bearing 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.780
 painted parts and assembled mechanism 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.850
 additional drive became one 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.740
 side hairpin twisted into a long 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.509
 nut and in the other hand through the ball 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.050
 rests on the mounting bracket 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.460
 additional became 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.610
 the minimum clearance is adjustable 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:17.010
 two nuts between the nuts corner 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.050
 nested washer as an extra 3 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.200
 points of support for the stud used 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.940
 pre-cooked bearing for 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.930
 him at the bottom of the table and made 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.430
 groove about three millimeters out 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.130
 metal strips 2 millimeters thick 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.340
 manufactured bearing clamp to 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.340
 the table 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.930
 secure the bearing 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.060
 from the strip made a pen that can be for 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.060
 to touch any place of the stud 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.020
 the result was a smooth mechanism 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.080
 moving the table in horizontal 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.080
 plane 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.930
 but 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.540
 thank you for your attention bye 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.709
 and
