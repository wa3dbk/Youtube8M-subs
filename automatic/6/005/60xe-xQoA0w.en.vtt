00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:26.830 

[Laughter]

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.450 

so<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.960> way<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.080> make<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> ring<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.010> get<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
so the way I make a ring is I get the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.840 
so the way I make a ring is I get the
inside<00:00:29.849> size<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.840> want<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.470> then<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.309> just

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
inside size that I want and then I just

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.090 
inside size that I want and then I just
go<00:00:33.030> around<00:00:33.230> like<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.380> get<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.620> up<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.800> little<00:00:34.890> bit

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
go around like to get it up a little bit

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.590 
go around like to get it up a little bit
so<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.520> got<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> little<00:00:36.090> bit<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.329> spreading

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
so it's got a little bit of spreading

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.650 
so it's got a little bit of spreading
fit<00:00:36.950> go<00:00:37.950> over<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.370> metal<00:00:38.520> penetration<00:00:39.120> and

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
fit go over the metal penetration and

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.049 
fit go over the metal penetration and
what<00:00:39.809> you'll<00:00:39.930> end<00:00:40.020> up<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:41.059> something

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
what you'll end up with is something

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.700 
what you'll end up with is something
that's<00:00:42.210> fairly<00:00:42.540> round<00:00:44.809> perfect<00:00:45.809> ring<00:00:46.079> there

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
that's fairly round perfect ring there

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.930 
that's fairly round perfect ring there
we<00:00:46.800> go

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.810 

so<00:00:52.540> well<00:00:52.900> the<00:00:53.170> ring<00:00:53.320> on<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:53.590> inside<00:00:54.070> it's<00:00:54.520> just

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
so well the ring on the inside it's just

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.020 
so well the ring on the inside it's just
welds<00:00:55.120> on<00:00:55.210> like<00:00:55.360> that<00:00:57.480> all<00:00:58.480> right<00:00:58.840> there<00:00:59.170> it<00:00:59.320> is

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
welds on like that all right there it is

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.590 
welds on like that all right there it is

it<00:02:25.640> right<00:02:25.790> probably<00:02:26.360> so<00:02:26.990> I<00:02:27.050> just<00:02:27.200> hooked<00:02:27.380> this

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
it right probably so I just hooked this

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.080 
it right probably so I just hooked this
up<00:02:27.650> it's<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:27.920> little<00:02:28.130> bit<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.370> extra<00:02:28.610> jet<00:02:28.880> ski

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090

exhaust hose I had laying around
hopefully<00:02:30.980> it'll<00:02:31.100> hold<00:02:31.220> up<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.490> little<00:02:31.670> better

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
hopefully it'll hold up a little better

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.980

than<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:32.060> let<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.480> little<00:02:32.600> more<00:02:32.780> air<00:02:32.959> through

it<00:05:43.050> but<00:05:43.650> it<00:05:43.919> was<00:05:44.040> a<00:05:44.100> good<00:05:44.220> one<00:05:44.370> I<00:05:44.550> mean<00:05:44.699> this

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
it but it was a good one I mean this

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.129 
it but it was a good one I mean this
thing<00:05:45.000> was<00:05:45.030> totally<00:05:45.479> useless<00:05:45.600> anyway<00:05:45.990> you

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
thing was totally useless anyway you

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:47.390 
thing was totally useless anyway you
know<00:05:46.229> I<00:05:46.260> got<00:05:46.440> it<00:05:46.560> for<00:05:46.680> free<00:05:46.860> it<00:05:47.130> was<00:05:47.190> already

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
know I got it for free it was already

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.980 
know I got it for free it was already
leaking<00:05:47.850> all<00:05:48.180> over<00:05:48.240> the<00:05:48.750> damn<00:05:48.960> place

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
leaking all over the damn place

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.230 
leaking all over the damn place
combustion<00:05:49.830> chamber<00:05:50.220> I<00:05:50.370> think<00:05:50.610> that<00:05:50.760> was<00:05:50.910> you

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
combustion chamber I think that was you

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.770 
combustion chamber I think that was you
know<00:05:51.360> a<00:05:51.600> success<00:05:52.520> except<00:05:53.520> for<00:05:53.760> obviously<00:05:54.330> the

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
know a success except for obviously the

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.629 
know a success except for obviously the
gas<00:05:55.080> is<00:05:55.260> coming<00:05:55.500> out<00:05:55.590> or<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:55.740> bit<00:05:55.919> too<00:05:56.070> hot<00:05:56.280> so

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
gas is coming out or a bit too hot so

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.670 
gas is coming out or a bit too hot so
I'm<00:05:56.850> gonna<00:05:56.970> have<00:05:57.150> to<00:05:57.330> go<00:05:57.449> ahead<00:05:57.570> and<00:05:57.960> drill

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
I'm gonna have to go ahead and drill

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.560 
I'm gonna have to go ahead and drill
some<00:05:58.740> larger<00:05:59.220> holes<00:05:59.490> in<00:05:59.790> the<00:06:00.180> bottom<00:06:00.449> of<00:06:00.540> that

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
some larger holes in the bottom of that

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.810 
some larger holes in the bottom of that
flame<00:06:00.900> tube<00:06:01.139> larger<00:06:01.680> diffuser<00:06:02.010> holes<00:06:02.250> so<00:06:02.790> a

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
flame tube larger diffuser holes so a

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.790 
flame tube larger diffuser holes so a
bit<00:06:03.150> more<00:06:03.389> of<00:06:03.600> that<00:06:03.690> cool<00:06:03.990> air<00:06:04.020> can<00:06:04.530> get<00:06:04.680> in

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
bit more of that cool air can get in

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.370 
bit more of that cool air can get in
there<00:06:04.979> and<00:06:05.010> mix<00:06:05.310> with<00:06:05.550> the<00:06:05.610> gases<00:06:06.260> you<00:06:07.260> know

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
there and mix with the gases you know

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.379 
there and mix with the gases you know
after<00:06:07.650> the<00:06:07.740> burn<00:06:07.919> so<00:06:08.490> it'll<00:06:09.000> cool<00:06:09.150> it<00:06:09.300> off

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
after the burn so it'll cool it off

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.420 
after the burn so it'll cool it off
better<00:06:09.660> this<00:06:09.900> I<00:06:10.200> mean<00:06:10.530> it<00:06:10.620> worked<00:06:10.830> but<00:06:11.190> there's

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
better this I mean it worked but there's

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.710 
better this I mean it worked but there's
just<00:06:11.580> no<00:06:11.760> thrust<00:06:12.180> you<00:06:12.389> know<00:06:12.479> I<00:06:12.510> was<00:06:12.690> thinking

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
just no thrust you know I was thinking

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.629 
just no thrust you know I was thinking
about<00:06:12.990> putting<00:06:13.229> it<00:06:13.320> on<00:06:13.380> a<00:06:13.440> surfboard<00:06:13.650> or<00:06:14.130> like

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
about putting it on a surfboard or like

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.969 
about putting it on a surfboard or like
a<00:06:14.669> back<00:06:14.910> of<00:06:15.030> a<00:06:15.090> bike<00:06:15.300> but<00:06:16.050> it's<00:06:16.169> just<00:06:16.410> really<00:06:16.620> I

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
a back of a bike but it's just really I

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:18.260 
a back of a bike but it's just really I
mean<00:06:17.280> these<00:06:17.400> things<00:06:17.460> don't<00:06:17.820> have<00:06:17.910> my<00:06:18.060> any

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
mean these things don't have my any

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.909 
mean these things don't have my any
thrust<00:06:18.540> at<00:06:18.660> all<00:06:18.750> the<00:06:18.900> diameter<00:06:19.380> the<00:06:19.470> wheels<00:06:19.680> is

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
thrust at all the diameter the wheels is

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:22.340 
thrust at all the diameter the wheels is
tiny<00:06:20.190> and<00:06:20.430> like<00:06:20.880> all<00:06:21.120> the<00:06:21.389> air<00:06:21.570> goes<00:06:21.600> around

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
tiny and like all the air goes around

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.650 
tiny and like all the air goes around
and<00:06:22.800> through<00:06:23.130> and<00:06:23.340> back<00:06:23.490> in<00:06:23.760> this<00:06:24.000> there's<00:06:24.539> no

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
and through and back in this there's no

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.469 
and through and back in this there's no
flow<00:06:24.990> to<00:06:25.050> it<00:06:25.410> you<00:06:25.560> know<00:06:25.680> it's<00:06:26.039> really<00:06:26.340> I<00:06:26.550> don't

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 
flow to it you know it's really I don't

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:29.240 
flow to it you know it's really I don't
like<00:06:27.630> them<00:06:27.870> that<00:06:27.900> much<00:06:28.229> but<00:06:28.500> it<00:06:28.680> works<00:06:28.889> and

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
like them that much but it works and

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.340 
like them that much but it works and
it's<00:06:29.340> a<00:06:29.430> jet<00:06:29.610> engine<00:06:29.910> and<00:06:30.030> now<00:06:30.870> I<00:06:30.900> got<00:06:31.110> to<00:06:31.229> get

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
it's a jet engine and now I got to get

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.050 
it's a jet engine and now I got to get
rid<00:06:31.500> of<00:06:31.560> all<00:06:31.680> this<00:06:31.800> oil<00:06:32.039> I<00:06:32.460> think<00:06:32.789> I'm<00:06:33.000> just

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
rid of all this oil I think I'm just

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.690 
rid of all this oil I think I'm just
gonna<00:06:33.180> burn<00:06:33.539> it
