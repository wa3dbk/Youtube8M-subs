00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.580
 we are here in citaro 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:18.560
 new vehicle with euro 6 engine us 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.989
 have new electronics concept we have 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.020
 other powertrains and for that 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:25.879
 our vehicles with great effort and 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.739
 a lot of trouble adjusting that too 

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:30.320
 continue in the usual quality 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:33.939
 all red worth and driving situations with 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.939
 a load condition are manageable 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.770
 a system we test here is the 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.160
 new angle control for the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.530
 steered the kink angle control is 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.110
 a mercedes benz own development 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.000
 we come up with it from steering behavior 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.519
 the same level as a solo vehicle 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.220
 but have just the possibility if that 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.410
 vehicle is moved very dynamically 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.170
 due to the demand-based damping 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.420
 tre of the joint at all times to 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.979
 to stay on course and with that too 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.580
 in the German competition 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.580
 out down 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.800
 which we have seen very nice here 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.930
 that the assurance of the 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.750
 driving dynamics so we get in the 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.100
 need case because the attenuation of the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.980
 procedure and the vehicle's damping 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.290
 vice versa will let driver and 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.660
 vehicle as possible 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.220
 mobility and agility around the 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.790
 curves volatility of the vehicle 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.790
 ensure
