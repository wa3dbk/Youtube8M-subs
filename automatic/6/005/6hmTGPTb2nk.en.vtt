00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
probably either built up or you can just

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.060 
probably either built up or you can just
use<00:00:30.630> only<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.840> few<00:00:30.990> components<00:00:31.260> hand<00:00:31.860> Tony

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
little Tim package and then we've got

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.070 
little Tim package and then we've got
the<00:00:45.420> really<00:00:46.170> cheap<00:00:46.409> CCD<00:00:47.210> hobbyking<00:00:48.210> sony

camera<00:00:49.470> on<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.650> front<00:00:49.769> the<00:00:50.430> little

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
camera on the front the little

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.140 
camera on the front the little
cloverleaf<00:00:51.360> antenna<00:00:51.930> here<00:00:52.229> and<00:00:52.970> then<00:00:53.970> I've

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
cloverleaf antenna here and then I've

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.660 
cloverleaf antenna here and then I've
got<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.360> little<00:00:54.540> 5<00:00:54.839> volt<00:00:55.170> ubique<00:00:55.799> here<00:00:56.129> which

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
got the little 5 volt ubique here which

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.969 
got the little 5 volt ubique here which
basically<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.120> chops<00:00:58.110> down<00:00:58.229> the<00:00:58.379> 12<00:00:58.680> volts

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
basically just chops down the 12 volts

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:01.130 
basically just chops down the 12 volts
to<00:00:59.220> the<00:00:59.370> right<00:00:59.489> voltage<00:00:59.670> for<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.269> this<00:01:00.930> new

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
to the right voltage for the this new

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.469 
to the right voltage for the this new
board<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.530> board<00:01:01.739> I've<00:01:01.920> made<00:01:02.070> here<00:01:02.479> because

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
board this board I've made here because

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:05.299 
board this board I've made here because
if<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.870> put<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> regulator<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.100> board

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
if we just put a regulator on that board

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.789 
if we just put a regulator on that board
that<00:01:05.760> bent<00:01:06.060> from<00:01:06.210> 12<00:01:06.479> volts<00:01:06.750> down<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.260> 3.3

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
that bent from 12 volts down to the 3.3

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.469 
that bent from 12 volts down to the 3.3
volts<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.159> eat<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.729> get<00:01:08.820> too<00:01:08.970> hot<00:01:09.150> these

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
volts and eat you get too hot these

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.210 
volts and eat you get too hot these
switched-mode<00:01:09.810> regulators<00:01:10.380> these<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.979> Bix

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
switched-mode regulators these you Bix

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.920 
switched-mode regulators these you Bix
specs<00:01:11.760> are<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.150> good<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.600> use<00:01:12.750> one<00:01:12.900> of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
specs are really good so we use one of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.270 
specs are really good so we use one of
those<00:01:13.020> there<00:01:13.229> are<00:01:13.290> only<00:01:13.350> five<00:01:13.770> dollars<00:01:14.159> or

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
those there are only five dollars or

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.920 
those there are only five dollars or
something<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.610> expensive<00:01:14.940> so<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.750> total

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
something not expensive so the total

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.360 
something not expensive so the total
cost<00:01:16.260> you<00:01:16.530> looks<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:16.800> twenty<00:01:17.040> dollars<00:01:17.280> of

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
cost you looks like twenty dollars of

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.120 
cost you looks like twenty dollars of
the<00:01:17.430> camera<00:01:17.840> twenty<00:01:18.840> dollars<00:01:19.110> for<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:19.980> module

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the camera twenty dollars for the module

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.760 
the camera twenty dollars for the module
maybe<00:01:20.520> ten<00:01:20.760> dollars<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.210> board<00:01:21.480> and

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
maybe ten dollars for that board and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.170 
maybe ten dollars for that board and
five<00:01:22.770> dollars<00:01:23.040> they're<00:01:23.220> pretty<00:01:23.580> cheap<00:01:23.640> all<00:01:24.030> up

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180

course you can just velcro this receiver

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.619 
course you can just velcro this receiver
to<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.650> side<00:03:31.949> of<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.129> visor<00:03:32.400> good<00:03:33.209> antennas

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
to the side of the visor good antennas

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.509 
to the side of the visor good antennas
high<00:03:33.780> enough<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.079> be<00:03:34.199> out<00:03:34.230> of<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.530> way<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:35.250> you

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
high enough to be out of the way and you

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.710 
high enough to be out of the way and you
get<00:03:35.669> not<00:03:35.849> quite<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.209> same<00:03:36.359> range<00:03:36.599> but

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
get not quite the same range but

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.210 
get not quite the same range but
certainly<00:03:37.049> more<00:03:37.319> than<00:03:37.560> enough<00:03:37.799> it<00:03:37.919> means<00:03:38.129> you

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220
