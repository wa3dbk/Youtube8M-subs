00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.490
 that when youtube how are you guys 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.410
 but you do not very well and we go with 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.419
 out of them I bring you another tutorial and 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.089
 good more than more than tutorials like 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:13.980
 another review of mode but good the day of 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:16.440
 today I decided to put my face to show you 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.560
 how to visit in this way because good 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.150
 with the title we say to run but it's 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.220
 an improved mode because this one does not 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.980
 distorts in comparison view 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.620
 the other and he has brought me and apart 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.570
 this very guys can be installed and 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.489
 obviously we have to have jailbreak 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.329
 but it can be installed even if we have 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.089
 the original minecraft of authors 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.070
 and well, this benefits us a lot 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:43.460
 because maybe many knots know no 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.190
 it can be downloaded by pirate minecraft and 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.809
 Well, this is also very good because 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.129
 I tell you that the mode is very very father 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.739
 and then we will enter with the tutorial 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:57.290
 well they're going to go like this dayz guys 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.930
 you know as always 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.010
 and good they hope that they finish loading like 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.640
 they know and if it's too slow 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.500
 so let's wait a little bit 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.510
 here you can see the screen 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.010
 my side I will put it as well as in the 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.659
 previous video 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.630
 good 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.409
 Once here in Syria, see you 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.109
 typical city do not add a source 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.390
 fountains avoid were going to reveal saturday 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:25.130
 and good they are going to put this one that is here 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.539
 all inhabited will be appearing 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.369
 on the screen the republic is more not 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.640
 the repo will be appearing on the screen 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.719
 what is it so that you can put it on 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.840
 but good if we have here the 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:41.229
 can see is if I'm ready more 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.000
 rich space.com diagonal cities diagonal 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.429
 good once we settled this the 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.780
 speak and here they will appear several 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.930
 things 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.570
 and well, minecraft is here 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.940
 patch and then it's going to be from minecraft and 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.850
 springsteen and then they're going to open they're going to 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.400
 download that is the michael and spring and 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.229
 good agility and here in his name then 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.930
 appears to you appears normally 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.940
 install they give in install and they are made 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.789
 your respect and cos and it would be ready 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.930
 will totally work the mod and good 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.239
 it's just a matter of going to 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.310
 minecraft and it's going to work 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.980
 so well I'm going to the minecraft and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.739
 right now I see them 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.890
 and well, you guys already here once 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:28.420
 inside the minecraft as well as they can 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:32.060
 notice the view is not good if in itself the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.040
 the picture is not affected at all and 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.530
 because if they realize when 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.739
 walk then if I squeeze normal well the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.780
 I'm going to walk normally as if 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.540
 we would not have so you would be 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.250
 you will be asking 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.590
 then how the mode is activated as it is 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.890
 very easy guys it's just a matter of 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.260
 double tap on the little arrow 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.629
 up then if you can see let me 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.660
 go here a little flatter part 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:02.290
 well there I am doing a tap and now 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.790
 look there is a tap and two tapas there 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.129
 begins to run is the same as in the 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.260
 computer guys this is fine 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.359
 who wear it will add as a 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.370
 minecraft functionality because the 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.859
 truth is very good and then as you see 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.049
 I'm running or is stopped going left 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:21.079
 we coordinate squeeze once because I'm going 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.930
 slowly and well already if the corral squeezed 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.430
 twice the truth is very very well and 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.650
 I love bringing it to me 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.120
 because well now say that already 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.470
 we can do things faster and 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.800
 all 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.520
 and also this also does not affect the 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.920
 view that's what I like a lot to me 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.300
 that does not affect anything in sight because if 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.220
 they went the other way that I had 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.070
 brought from running because the truth looked 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.520
 very bad and it would be very ugly at the time of 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.200
 run 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.140
 good not only at the time of running 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.720
 but all the time it looked very ugly and 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.280
 Well, in this one, do not look, do not just be 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.620
 see how we are walking a bit more 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.470
 fast and well yes guys in itself that's 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.990
 everything in the mode and well this one I hope not 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.760
 be you the video you already know subscribe 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.670

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.230
 I do not think that Sunday or the 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.870
 Monday rather well so good for all 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.140

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:27.780

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:31.080
 there I go running with the 3d style and 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.700
 I go slowly and I'm running the truth 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.160
