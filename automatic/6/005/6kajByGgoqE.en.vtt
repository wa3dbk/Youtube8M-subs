00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 good evening my name is Oleg ptuhi i am you 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.849
 I will show qigong gymnastics so that you 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.690
 could always be vigorous and energetic in 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.849
 First of all you need to take your life 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.580
 correct position in the body of the foot should 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.760
 be parallel and on the width of your pelvis 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.990
 somewhere in the middle of your thigh passes 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:30.869
 line which is through the foot 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:35.280
 makes your legs parallel a little 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.660
 need to move the pelvis forward and feel the lung 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.710
 tension in the buttocks 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.930
 as if you sat on the chair and planochki 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.989
 this feeling lowers yours a little 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.680
 sacrum and slightly pulls the lower back 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.379
 the crown should reach for the sky this is 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.210
 top of the head and pulls out 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.680
 spine in the neck and chest 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.449
 up the sacrum pulls the lower back down and 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.229
 It turns out such a slight stretching of the body 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.470
 up down catch the balance between 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.630
 left and right sides and it will give you 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.270
 certain balance and stability 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.549
 for some time you are in balance 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.470
 hands should be free 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.119
 free straight fingers without tension 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.509
 when you feel the balance you can 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.130
 go to breath breathing free as 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.460
 it turns out well 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.460
 the most important function in this 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.100
 breathing is a diaphragm movement while doing 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.189
 the belly is not involved in breathing bulging 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.860
 squeezing only lowering the diaphragm 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.140
 down and raising her up arms 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.119
 fingered forward and you 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.939
 feel with your palms as if you are 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.409
 touch the ground actually in 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.000
 this moment you have the opportunity 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.329
 feel the energy of the earth 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.909
 now you grab your hands on inhale and 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:01.500
 raise to face 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:06.090
 and on the exhale spend in the sky from the sky you 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.130
 take energy dropping down your head and on 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.890
 exhale carry it to the ground 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.370
 at this moment your inner attention 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.850
 follows the body to the left and right in 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:21.030
 trunk from trunk to arms to heaven from 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.660
 the sky passes the energy in the torso and 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.850
 through the legs into the ground the whole cycle 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.820
 respiration you spend energy so 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.880
 manner and observe the inner attention 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.580
 how well do you do it if 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.240
 somewhere energy happens to delay this 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.070
 says that there is a small 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.830
 hitch this energy how would she 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.170
 stops therefore there is 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.190
 some kind of barrier that needs to be pro 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.980
 breathe that way the moment of the outer 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.500
 control arm movements one hand 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.930
 a little hurry another is catching up with it 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.890
 says that one part is more 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.660
 body is active the second part is less active 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.330
 just as well in your internal attention 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.850
 going on inside the body and you commit 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.320
 these cycles of breathing one after another without 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:18.240
 stops without pauses inhale torso exhale 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.730
 from the body to the sky trunk breath exhalation 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.470
 from body to ground 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.740
 The first time a breath goes through many 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.140
 torso exhale through the arms into the sky second 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:35.570
 once you breathe in through your arms to your body 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:40.850
 exhale through the torso and legs into the ground inhale 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.850
 exhale inhale exhale 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.620
 Now I will not speak in order to 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.650
 you heard the rhythm of breathing 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.530
 I'm gonna breathe loudly 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.980
 that you understood you must breathe 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.650
 calm and easy breathing drives 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.060
 brush movement 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.060
 brush moves to breathe 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.120
 she is 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.320
 getting a balance left and right at you 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.200
 going on the front middle back 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.290
 median line occurs occurs 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.530
 such a glue between two sides of the body and 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.870
 is discovered 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.060
 the line that matches your 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.000
 breathing in the front among us channel 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.100
 responsible for your strength and back 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.730
 the median channel is in charge of your 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.130
 control of this force inhales 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.530
 front among the flour tops 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.110
 and arms go straight to heaven exhale 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:10.510
 falls all the way to the ground 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:12.970
 get breath exhale when you 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.350
 make exhalation the end of this exhalation 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:19.960
 turns in the middle of your belly 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.840
 from the inside as from the coccyx falls into 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.600
 the area where you have a natural battery 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.340
 lower dantian in chinese in this 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.770
 natural battery it as a sphere 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.950
 this energy accumulates and with each 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:35.230
 inhale and and there becomes more with 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.380
 with each breath it becomes more and more 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:41.890
 released on May and filled with a sense of how 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.870
 if the center of gravity is enhanced as the 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:47.110
 like you're rooting 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.300
 and become more confident in the body when you 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.700
 you can breathe in and out 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.040
 end 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:58.000
 your exhale last reaches not for you 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:00.310
 raise your hands to the stomach impose them 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.950
 right palm on the stomach left palm 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.500
 top right hand and keep 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.780
 several cycles of breathing carefully 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.530
 collecting energy in the lower dantian 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:13.840
 taking all the sweat away from the skin all that 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:17.070
 could go outside the skin 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.070
 inward to lower dantian 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:27.520
 feeling the heat and weight down 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:32.849
 dantyane you seal your work 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:37.599
 clutching hands to stomach making three turns 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:40.659
 clockwise stretch right 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:45.189
 left right left right left 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:47.740
 smearing sealing wax you wash your hands 

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:52.389
 face combing hair 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:54.460
 and take your ears off the ground with 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.030
 places are very important site because the body 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.550
 remembers 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.469
 binding to the place of work you need 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.690
 seal to energy 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:05.259
 stayed inside and didn't dissipate after 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:07.750
 qigong and you signal the body 

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:09.580
 that qigong dantesom finished and now 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:13.810
 the body must again be protected from external 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:17.639
 phenomena like cold drafts and strangers 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.639
 emotions to health
