00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.300 
and away we go I didn't manage these
strawberries<00:03:11.090> at<00:03:11.210> all<00:03:11.420> last<00:03:11.780> year<00:03:11.960> I<00:03:12.350> just<00:03:13.160> let

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
strawberries at all last year I just let

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.810 
strawberries at all last year I just let
them<00:03:13.490> do<00:03:13.910> their<00:03:14.090> own<00:03:14.150> thing<00:03:14.630> man<00:03:14.960> and

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
them do their own thing man and

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.540 
them do their own thing man and
apparently<00:03:17.290> they<00:03:18.290> only<00:03:18.590> really<00:03:18.920> give<00:03:19.130> decent

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
apparently they only really give decent

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.790 
apparently they only really give decent
fruit<00:03:19.760> for<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:19.970> first<00:03:20.210> three<00:03:20.480> years<00:03:20.620> but<00:03:21.620> he's

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
fruit for the first three years but he's

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.370 
fruit for the first three years but he's
not<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.040> problem<00:03:22.550> because<00:03:22.810> if<00:03:23.810> you've<00:03:23.990> ever<00:03:24.170> had

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
not a problem because if you've ever had

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.770 
not a problem because if you've ever had
strawberries<00:03:25.100> you'll<00:03:26.000> know<00:03:26.240> that<00:03:26.480> they<00:03:26.600> put

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
strawberries you'll know that they put

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.530 
strawberries you'll know that they put
these<00:03:27.020> runners<00:03:27.320> out<00:03:27.850> here's<00:03:28.850> an<00:03:28.970> example<00:03:29.270> of<00:03:29.450> a

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
these runners out here's an example of a

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.810 
these runners out here's an example of a
runner<00:03:29.750> a<00:03:30.080> little<00:03:30.860> plant<00:03:31.130> on<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.430> end<00:03:31.580> of<00:03:31.730> it

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
runner a little plant on the end of it

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.690 
runner a little plant on the end of it
so<00:03:32.140> why<00:03:33.140> would<00:03:33.350> I<00:03:33.380> do<00:03:33.560> this<00:03:33.590> year<00:03:34.160> because<00:03:34.520> I

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
so why would I do this year because I

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.630 
so why would I do this year because I
don't<00:03:34.910> know<00:03:35.060> how<00:03:35.240> old<00:03:35.270> these<00:03:35.780> plants<00:03:36.200> are<00:03:36.640> it's

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
don't know how old these plants are it's

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.690 
don't know how old these plants are it's

while I'm over here I'm going look at

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.440 
while I'm over here I'm going look at
this<00:04:00.530> gooseberry<00:04:01.010> bush<00:04:01.220> this<00:04:02.060> is<00:04:02.239> what<00:04:02.420> I

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
this gooseberry bush this is what I

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.229 
this gooseberry bush this is what I
transplanted<00:04:03.200> last<00:04:04.040> year<00:04:04.370> from<00:04:04.580> another<00:04:04.910> part

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
transplanted last year from another part

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.970 
transplanted last year from another part
of<00:04:05.420> the<00:04:05.570> garden<00:04:05.780> and<00:04:06.170> I<00:04:06.290> wasn't<00:04:06.620> entirely

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
of the garden and I wasn't entirely

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.449 
of the garden and I wasn't entirely
convinced<00:04:07.670> as<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:07.910> survived<00:04:08.330> to<00:04:09.290> me<00:04:09.530> it<00:04:10.430> just

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
convinced as it survived to me it just

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.660 
convinced as it survived to me it just
looked<00:04:11.030> dead<00:04:11.450> I<00:04:11.690> really<00:04:12.200> can't<00:04:12.500> see<00:04:12.800> any<00:04:13.190> sign

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
looked dead I really can't see any sign

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.830 
looked dead I really can't see any sign
of<00:04:13.700> life<00:04:14.180> at<00:04:14.360> all<00:04:14.590> no<00:04:15.590> buds<00:04:16.269> now<00:04:17.269> compare<00:04:17.810> that

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
of life at all no buds now compare that

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.440

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
with this young gooseberry bush you can

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.690 
with this young gooseberry bush you can
see<00:04:20.600> all<00:04:20.810> sorts<00:04:21.320> of<00:04:21.440> little<00:04:21.590> new<00:04:21.980> growth<00:04:22.340> and

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
see all sorts of little new growth and

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.800 
see all sorts of little new growth and
shoots<00:04:24.190> so<00:04:25.190> I<00:04:25.220> think<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.820> time<00:04:26.030> has<00:04:26.300> come<00:04:26.330> the

year but it certainly looks like the

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:32.109 
year but it certainly looks like the
chance<00:05:30.080> of<00:05:30.229> me<00:05:30.379> having<00:05:30.409> some<00:05:30.830> blueberries<00:05:31.399> and
