00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
bit less than that to be honest and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.660 
bit less than that to be honest and
we're<00:00:53.010> about<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.250> go<00:00:53.340> into<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.550> physical

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
we're about to go into the physical

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.850

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
attributes and you'll see why he is very

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.920 
attributes and you'll see why he is very
weak<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.219> game<00:00:56.370> he's<00:00:56.520> got<00:00:56.640> 49<00:00:57.059> strength<00:00:57.510> which
