00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.039
 try 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.640
 It is bothersome that everyone is surprised that the first power section in the deputy 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.820
 34 people died in that scene There is also a speech Japan in the Indian Parliament 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.619
 Is it 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.810
 Ebisawa Chairman Yamaoka and his unusual Santa and Mr. Santa from beginning to end 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.320
 It is said that we are discussing 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.270
 What seems to be the oil pump brain of the gearbox 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.649
 There is but this weekend 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:31.189
 It would be nice to say India to the former Defense Secretary but the member's bank 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.600
 You are surprised 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.650
 As there is not quite in car regular city assembly that footsteps make 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.180
 Highest output 480 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.260
 Silent 66 people 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.520
 Got into intense 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.800
 In the opening mode, most car-mounted devices and deputies are decelerating 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.220
 Is it kun 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.120
 From wherever you step 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.770
 Because the over came 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.230
 In the news, there is also a feeling that sales are not related to sales abroad such as Asia 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.390
 I will 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.720
 After training gt-r is actually my personal owner, but it was a picture roll 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.380
 We purchase late for last year 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.580
 I like these things and it was Yokosuka deployment in August this year 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.550
 I was troubled for a long time, but I was in my 20s who was suffering from rice 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.960
 I was worried about my width and 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.950
 That sound 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.140
 I use it when there was a cheating. 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.530
 Well, 26 minutes in the first half of personnel at the circuit- 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.150
 There are a lot of difficult parts in the king 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.570
 But I already agreed 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.200
 It can be said that gt-r can be run faster 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.840
 Information is great 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.010
 It is true that it is with Britain and has Babahart of Turkey 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.340
 The other party did not feel the same thing more 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.060
 I think the speed zone is also high speed zone 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.900
 I think it was possible to experience it in the rain and it was the same as other people 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.290
 If you have the experience, it's still a little bit 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.740
 Already 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.310
 Seems to be a bit more extreme, but as early as expected 72 people in March 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.710
 It is called 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.680
 I thought it was so good 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.170
 After all the face after all 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.050
 Yonezawa city November 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.080
 I've been buying Stearns since I knew it, and I am 4000 kilometers now 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.539
 Do you still throw away 100% 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:16.349
 I am not impressed by almost 100% 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.869
 Lol 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:22.699
 As for the person who has a good mood 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:25.129
 It is a great engineering college ride 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.579
 In fact, it is a car that does not advance so much for 4 weeks 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.069
 I think that there was a fact that it was 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.449
 That 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:39.309
 It is really that when it takes a lot of trouble like three people 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.969
 Deploy 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.499
 When I'm going ahead 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:45.939
 Everything is selected as you feel comfortable 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.929
 So is the engine as a car and the suspension is also a body 

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:50.659
 Rigidity is also everything 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.099
 So you usually do anything 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.859
 As usual speaking, the face of the space is within 16 degrees of speed limit 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.139
 It feels like I can run and somehow I get stressed 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.720
 It is good to move some good stuff 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:07.760
 I have a sense of satisfaction but I think all 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.200
 I do not come and go 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.989
 There is a place that 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.669
 But let's run in a pass that lets you use that 50 system instead 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:20.839
 The other staff members are actually in the middle of the day 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:23.539
 I also think that of course ordinary driving skills 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:26.290
 I need to realize the characteristics of this gt-r 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.459
 Gardening torque split with front engine and now with 4wd 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.969
 Run a car called safe during the game 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:37.120
 There is a woman 30 for the purpose of keeping up with it 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.370
 I think it's a very enjoyable moment 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:42.790
 Stretching ger 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.520
 It was often said about this, but it's a comparison with a phantom store, especially on holidays 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.189
 Will be 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.329
 100 has been the best element and has many from summer 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.139
 I'm a US pancake 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.719
 The facts of canal 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.319
 I like all of them, and I compare them with the ones that are fulfilling to me now 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.859
 It seems that there was a problem but what is the main difference? 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.549
 Speaking of you 11 is Nagano 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.679
 Any speed range 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:11.469
 Military modularizing Fernando 42 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.629
 I have a lot of troubles to come 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.949
 The purpose of the certified car is extremely clear and constant 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.039
 I'm saying that the focus is on one 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.710
 Run in the back run 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.510
 There may be some pressure in February 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.229
 People who always pull out their cars and so on 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.059
 The fun car eyes 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:36.599
 Transmission growth rate too stressful 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:42.050
 In Japan, we plan to improve the top plate site of manufacturing and put it on the car. 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.729
 Toyota's driver's problem is important but let me 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.979
 Minus 32 from the day before 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.839
 Running at Vocabulary Winding Road at an appropriate pace 

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:55.659
 It is not about the expansion of the floor 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.259
 I said that I wanted to step on the opening 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.800
 If the capsule frustrations were still 7
