00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
had with it so far it seems to resolved

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.580 
had with it so far it seems to resolved
after<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.369> couple<00:01:44.579> uses<00:01:45.140> can't<00:01:46.140> really<00:01:46.350> see<00:01:46.560> it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
after a couple uses can't really see it

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.550 
after a couple uses can't really see it
that<00:01:46.710> well<00:01:47.119> is<00:01:48.119> right<00:01:48.540> here<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.170> look<00:01:49.350> at

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
that well is right here if you look at

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.789 
that well is right here if you look at
this<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.640> kind<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.000> see<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.450> guess<00:01:51.799> that

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
this you can kind of see it I guess that

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.370 
this you can kind of see it I guess that
there<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.329> plastic<00:01:54.570> Pete<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
there is one of the plastic Pete the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.620 
there is one of the plastic Pete the
plastic<00:01:55.799> edge<00:01:55.979> from<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.549> sun<00:01:57.240> protection

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
plastic edge from this sun protection

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.560 
plastic edge from this sun protection
that<00:01:57.960> comes<00:01:58.200> down<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.939> that<00:01:59.939> thing<00:02:00.180> would<00:02:00.329> rub

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
that comes down and that thing would rub

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.639 
that comes down and that thing would rub
against<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.880> inside<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.939> my<00:02:03.090> thumb<00:02:03.619> after<00:02:04.619> a

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
against the inside of my thumb after a

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.410 
against the inside of my thumb after a
while<00:02:04.920> especially<00:02:05.520> when<00:02:06.030> playing<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.329> puck

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
while especially when playing the puck

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.859 
while especially when playing the puck
but<00:02:08.229> like<00:02:09.130> I<00:02:09.190> said<00:02:09.250> so<00:02:09.670> far<00:02:09.849> no<00:02:10.300> more<00:02:10.479> problems

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
but like I said so far no more problems

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.290 
but like I said so far no more problems
with<00:02:10.990> that<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.410> seems<00:02:11.770> to<00:02:12.010> have<00:02:12.099> worked<00:02:12.400> itself

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
with that it seems to have worked itself

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.540 
with that it seems to have worked itself
