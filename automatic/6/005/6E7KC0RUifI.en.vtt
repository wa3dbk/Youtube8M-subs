slightly each time but first time around

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.639 
slightly each time but first time around
we're<00:01:21.710> going<00:01:21.799> to<00:01:21.890> start<00:01:22.189> by<00:01:22.340> playing<00:01:22.549> an<00:01:22.700> a<00:01:23.649> B

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
and we play c ec e AC a I'll do that

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:45.130 
and we play c ec e AC a I'll do that
again<00:01:38.409> next<00:01:39.409> we're<00:01:39.770> gonna<00:01:39.860> play<00:01:40.330> g<00:01:41.950> cg<00:01:42.950> c<00:01:44.140> and

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
again next we're gonna play g cg c and

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.850 
again next we're gonna play g cg c and
we're<00:01:45.380> gonna<00:01:45.500> play<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.920> D<00:01:46.190> twice<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:48.200> then

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
we're gonna play the D twice and then

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.850 
we're gonna play the D twice and then
the<00:01:48.890> G<00:01:49.340> once

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
the G once

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:02.060 
the G once
so<00:01:51.860> do<00:01:52.039> that<00:01:52.069> again

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.320 

okay<00:02:03.070> so<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.370> second<00:02:03.760> time<00:02:03.880> around<00:02:03.910> is<00:02:04.180> going

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
okay so the second time around is going

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.520 
okay so the second time around is going
to<00:02:04.420> be<00:02:04.480> slightly<00:02:04.810> different

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
to be slightly different

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.030 
to be slightly different
we<00:02:05.800> start<00:02:06.130> off<00:02:06.250> exactly<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.910> same<00:02:07.150> way<00:02:11.040> but

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
we start off exactly the same way but

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.320 
we start off exactly the same way but
this<00:02:12.280> time<00:02:12.550> before<00:02:13.150> playing<00:02:14.010> GC<00:02:15.010> GC<00:02:15.330> we're

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
this time before playing GC GC we're

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.960 
this time before playing GC GC we're
going<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.540> quickly<00:02:16.870> play<00:02:17.290> an<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.770> thirst<00:02:18.220> so

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
going to quickly play an a thirst so

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:28.170 
going to quickly play an a thirst so
it's<00:02:19.090> gonna<00:02:19.240> sound<00:02:19.510> like<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:26.730> now<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:27.940> time

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
it's gonna sound like this now this time

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.930 
it's gonna sound like this now this time
we're<00:02:28.300> going<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.450> play<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.810> D<00:02:29.050> once<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:30.430> the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
we're going to play the D once and the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.020 
we're going to play the D once and the
GE<00:02:31.240> twice<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:33.010> before<00:02:33.310> when<00:02:33.430> we<00:02:33.580> played<00:02:33.790> this

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
GE twice so before when we played this

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.150 
GE twice so before when we played this
twice<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.720> this<00:02:34.810> once<00:02:35.080> but<00:02:35.290> this<00:02:35.710> time<00:02:35.950> round

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
twice and this once but this time round

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.350 
twice and this once but this time round
we<00:02:36.220> play<00:02:36.460> the<00:02:36.610> D<00:02:36.790> once<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.900> GE<00:02:38.160> twice<00:02:39.360> so

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
we play the D once and the GE twice so

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:50.480 
we play the D once and the GE twice so
the<00:02:40.480> second<00:02:40.870> time<00:02:41.020> round<00:02:41.050> sounds<00:02:41.620> like<00:02:41.770> this

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.740 

the<00:02:51.490> third<00:02:51.730> time<00:02:51.760> round<00:02:52.240> is<00:02:52.450> going<00:02:52.570> to<00:02:52.660> be

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
the third time round is going to be

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:02.210 
the third time round is going to be
exactly<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.470> same<00:02:53.800> as<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.130> first<00:02:54.370> time<00:02:54.610> round

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.800 

and<00:03:03.220> now<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.520> fourth<00:03:03.970> time<00:03:04.270> around<00:03:04.420> we're

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
and now the fourth time around we're

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.810 
and now the fourth time around we're
gonna<00:03:04.870> have<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.140> slight<00:03:05.470> variation<00:03:06.070> again<00:03:06.310> so

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
gonna have a slight variation again so

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.670 
gonna have a slight variation again so
again<00:03:06.940> we<00:03:07.239> start<00:03:07.300> of<00:03:07.690> exactly<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.290> same<00:03:08.320> way

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
again we start of exactly the same way

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.570 
again we start of exactly the same way
but<00:03:11.680> this<00:03:11.950> time<00:03:12.220> instead<00:03:12.459> of<00:03:12.700> playing<00:03:13.200> AC<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.580> we

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
but this time instead of playing AC a we

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.400 
but this time instead of playing AC a we
are<00:03:15.700> gonna<00:03:15.790> play<00:03:16.090> AC<00:03:17.310> AC<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.550> so<00:03:19.390> we're<00:03:20.290> adding

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
are gonna play AC AC a so we're adding

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.790 
are gonna play AC AC a so we're adding
an<00:03:20.770> extra<00:03:21.160> C<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.700> an<00:03:21.850> extra<00:03:22.270> a<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:23.560> I'll<00:03:23.620> do

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
an extra C and an extra a so I'll do

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.950 
an extra C and an extra a so I'll do
that

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.880 

then<00:03:28.960> we<00:03:29.140> played<00:03:29.410> GC<00:03:30.340> GC<00:03:30.640> as<00:03:31.360> before<00:03:31.840> and<00:03:32.110> then

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
then we played GC GC as before and then

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.620 
then we played GC GC as before and then
we're<00:03:33.040> going<00:03:33.130> to<00:03:33.190> play<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.580> D<00:03:33.850> twice<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.510> the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
we're going to play the D twice and the

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.090 
we're going to play the D twice and the
G<00:03:34.810> once<00:03:37.020> so<00:03:38.020> the<00:03:38.140> fourth<00:03:38.410> time<00:03:38.680> around<00:03:38.710> it

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
G once so the fourth time around it

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:49.140 
G once so the fourth time around it
sounds<00:03:39.400> like<00:03:39.550> this<00:03:47.550> right<00:03:48.550> so<00:03:48.760> I<00:03:48.790> know<00:03:48.970> there's

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
sounds like this right so I know there's

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.670 
sounds like this right so I know there's
quite<00:03:49.390> a<00:03:49.450> lot<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.750> that<00:03:50.110> and<00:03:50.260> it's<00:03:50.380> a<00:03:50.500> bit

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
quite a lot to that and it's a bit

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.470 
quite a lot to that and it's a bit
tricky<00:03:51.100> so<00:03:51.670> what<00:03:51.820> I'm<00:03:51.910> going<00:03:52.120> to<00:03:52.150> do<00:03:52.240> is<00:03:52.330> I'm

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
tricky so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.060 
tricky so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:03:52.600> to<00:03:52.660> go<00:03:53.020> through<00:03:53.320> all<00:03:53.590> of<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.890> right

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
going to go through all of the right

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.320 
going to go through all of the right
hand<00:03:54.310> and<00:03:54.400> I'm<00:03:54.520> gonna<00:03:54.610> do<00:03:54.820> it<00:03:54.850> really<00:03:55.210> really

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
hand and I'm gonna do it really really

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.780 
hand and I'm gonna do it really really
slowly<00:03:55.870> so<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:56.650> can<00:03:56.710> notice<00:03:57.250> this<00:03:57.460> like

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
slowly so you can notice this like

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.500 
slowly so you can notice this like
variation

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
variation

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:29.990 
variation
each<00:03:58.780> time<00:03:59.140> we<00:03:59.290> play<00:03:59.440> it

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.670 

okay<00:04:31.000> so<00:04:31.060> what<00:04:31.330> I'm<00:04:31.419> gonna<00:04:31.570> do<00:04:32.080> now<00:04:32.260> is<00:04:32.290> go

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
okay so what I'm gonna do now is go

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.200 
okay so what I'm gonna do now is go
through<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:33.280> left<00:04:33.490> hand<00:04:33.760> and<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.000> right<00:04:34.030> hand

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
through the left hand and the right hand

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.330 
through the left hand and the right hand
together<00:04:34.570> very<00:04:35.020> slowly<00:04:35.410> because<00:04:35.919> I<00:04:36.070> know<00:04:36.130> the

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
together very slowly because I know the

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.550 
together very slowly because I know the
right<00:04:36.520> hand<00:04:36.760> is<00:04:36.850> a<00:04:36.880> little<00:04:37.090> complicated<00:04:37.960> but

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
right hand is a little complicated but

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.900 
right hand is a little complicated but
I'm<00:04:38.650> going<00:04:38.830> to<00:04:38.890> include<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.280> left<00:04:39.460> hand<00:04:39.700> so<00:04:39.820> we

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
I'm going to include the left hand so we

00:04:39.910 --> 00:05:10.149 
I'm going to include the left hand so we
can<00:04:40.060> see<00:04:40.270> how<00:04:40.510> they<00:04:40.660> interact

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:10.159 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:12.409 

and<00:05:11.159> that's<00:05:11.309> all<00:05:11.550> there<00:05:11.699> is<00:05:11.759> to<00:05:12.089> it

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
and that's all there is to it

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.540 
and that's all there is to it
