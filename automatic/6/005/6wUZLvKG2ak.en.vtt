00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
drive this and I think he was quite

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.979 
drive this and I think he was quite
astonished<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:53.129> how<00:00:53.670> modern<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.390> drive<00:00:54.750> this

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.290 
car was I think even he was amazed I
think<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.680> criminal<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> car<00:00:59.550> but<00:00:59.879> her<00:01:00.030> I

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
think in criminal of a car but her I

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.540 
think in criminal of a car but her I
just<00:01:00.840> think<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.530> car<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.829> people<00:01:02.430> are

missing<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.090> think<00:01:03.120> their<00:01:03.510> failings

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
missing and I think their failings

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.410 
missing and I think their failings
realise<00:01:04.650> how<00:01:04.920> historically<00:01:05.790> important<00:01:06.270> this

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420

to motor in longer as a whole and I

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.969 
to motor in longer as a whole and I
think<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.479> does<00:01:12.689> catch<00:01:12.990> people<00:01:13.350> now<00:01:13.500> now

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.690 
I'm gauging of a few of those when
values<00:01:58.500> were<00:01:58.680> not<00:01:59.100> quite<00:01:59.340> what<00:01:59.520> they<00:01:59.640> were

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
values were not quite what they were

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.440 
values were not quite what they were
worst<00:01:59.820> day<00:02:00.120> they<00:02:00.810> were<00:02:01.290> rusty<00:02:02.280> dreadfully

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
worst day they were rusty dreadfully

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.010 
worst day they were rusty dreadfully
due<00:02:03.870> to<00:02:03.900> lack<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.619> care<00:02:05.330> now<00:02:06.330> of<00:02:06.540> course<00:02:06.690> a<00:02:06.869> lot

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
due to lack of care now of course a lot

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.600 
due to lack of care now of course a lot
of<00:02:07.140> rust<00:02:07.320> proofing<00:02:07.650> techniques<00:02:08.100> and<00:02:08.280> having

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
of rust proofing techniques and having

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.969 
of rust proofing techniques and having
the<00:02:08.759> people<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.660> love<00:02:09.840> them<00:02:10.080> as<00:02:10.500> people<00:02:10.920> that

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
the people that love them as people that

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.070 
the people that love them as people that
care<00:02:11.220> these<00:02:11.880> problems<00:02:12.270> can<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.480> eliminated

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
care these problems can be eliminated

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.890 
care these problems can be eliminated
now<00:02:13.260> but<00:02:13.890> they<00:02:14.520> will<00:02:14.790> unlock<00:02:15.209> did<00:02:15.540> disappear

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
now but they will unlock did disappear

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.520 
now but they will unlock did disappear
and<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.530> think<00:02:16.790> this<00:02:17.790> one<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.480> probably<00:02:19.290> one<00:02:19.500> of

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
and I think this one is probably one of

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.380 
and I think this one is probably one of
the<00:02:19.620> best<00:02:19.860> real<00:02:20.100> point<00:02:20.370> no<00:02:20.880> Paulie<00:02:21.120> just

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
the best real point no Paulie just

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.900 
the best real point no Paulie just

those<00:03:49.840> seats<00:03:50.110> don't<00:03:50.350> look<00:03:50.530> like<00:03:50.650> standard

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
those seats don't look like standard

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.480 
those seats don't look like standard

well<00:03:52.090> I<00:03:52.120> suppose<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.720> a<00:03:52.750> lot<00:03:53.020> of<00:03:53.170> people<00:03:53.440> this

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
well I suppose to a lot of people this

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.500 
well I suppose to a lot of people this
doesn't<00:03:53.890> look<00:03:53.950> like<00:03:54.010> a<00:03:54.130> standard<00:03:54.700> 5<00:03:55.060> Series

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
doesn't look like a standard 5 Series

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.470 
doesn't look like a standard 5 Series
inside<00:03:55.840> each<00:03:56.020> well<00:03:56.290> 5<00:03:56.530> Series<00:03:57.010> but<00:03:57.640> I<00:03:58.090> suppose

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
inside each well 5 Series but I suppose

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.630 
inside each well 5 Series but I suppose
this<00:03:58.630> is<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.900> birth<00:03:59.140> of<00:03:59.350> BMW<00:03:59.920> making<00:04:00.280> super

fourth<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:35.620> fifth<00:04:36.990> this<00:04:37.990> was<00:04:38.139> a<00:04:38.199> wonderful

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
fourth and fifth this was a wonderful

fourth and fifth this was a wonderful
gearbox<00:04:39.010> and<00:04:39.220> then<00:04:39.310> went<00:04:39.520> on<00:04:39.699> to<00:04:39.850> feature<00:04:40.060> in

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
gearbox and then went on to feature in

all the e30 m3 s as well partly because
