theory of screenwriter witches I often
compare<00:00:22.570> the<00:00:23.110> way<00:00:23.260> we<00:00:23.410> get<00:00:23.910> first<00:00:24.910> of<00:00:25.000> all<00:00:25.060> a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
compare the way we get first of all a

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.750 
compare the way we get first of all a
script<00:00:25.480> and<00:00:25.720> then<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:27.600> cut<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.980> how<00:00:30.520> you<00:00:30.580> make

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
script and then a cut to how you make

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.760 
script and then a cut to how you make
chicken<00:00:30.789> stock<00:00:31.360> which<00:00:31.539> is<00:00:31.720> you<00:00:32.320> add<00:00:32.439> lots<00:00:32.649> of

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
chicken stock which is you add lots of

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.740 
chicken stock which is you add lots of
ingredients<00:00:32.920> and<00:00:33.520> it<00:00:33.610> looks<00:00:33.760> massive<00:00:34.210> but

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
ingredients and it looks massive but

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.689 
ingredients and it looks massive but
then<00:00:34.899> you<00:00:35.050> reduce<00:00:35.590> it<00:00:35.800> to<00:00:35.860> their<00:00:36.190> kind<00:00:36.399> of<00:00:36.489> the

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
then you reduce it to their kind of the

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.790 
then you reduce it to their kind of the
bare<00:00:36.879> essence<00:00:37.359> and<00:00:38.079> then<00:00:38.260> you<00:00:38.409> add<00:00:38.530> more

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
bare essence and then you add more

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.410 
bare essence and then you add more
ingredients<00:00:38.980> till<00:00:39.579> it<00:00:39.640> gets<00:00:39.789> massive<00:00:40.059> again

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
ingredients till it gets massive again

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.689 
ingredients till it gets massive again
and<00:00:40.629> they<00:00:40.719> reduce<00:00:41.050> that<00:00:41.289> and<00:00:41.859> add<00:00:42.309> and

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
and they reduce that and add and

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.189 
and they reduce that and add and
reducing<00:00:43.149> at<00:00:43.239> each<00:00:43.359> stage<00:00:43.690> along<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.079> way

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
reducing at each stage along the way

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:45.540 
reducing at each stage along the way
that's<00:00:44.440> what<00:00:44.589> we<00:00:44.710> do<00:00:44.920> we<00:00:45.129> come<00:00:45.309> up<00:00:45.399> with<00:00:45.429> a

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
that's what we do we come up with a

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.299 
that's what we do we come up with a
story<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.870> we<00:00:46.960> elaborate<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.649> story<00:00:47.949> and

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
story and we elaborate the story and

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.779 
story and we elaborate the story and
take<00:00:48.729> the<00:00:49.350> plot<00:00:50.350> thread<00:00:50.859> the<00:00:51.280> different

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
take the plot thread the different

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:52.860 
take the plot thread the different
elements<00:00:51.940> of<00:00:52.210> the<00:00:52.300> story<00:00:52.449> in<00:00:52.629> different

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
elements of the story in different

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.629 
elements of the story in different
directions<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:53.350> see<00:00:53.530> where<00:00:53.679> they<00:00:53.739> go<00:00:53.769> and<00:00:54.550> it

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:54.639 
directions to see where they go and it

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:56.189 
directions to see where they go and it
becomes<00:00:54.819> an<00:00:54.969> unwieldy<00:00:55.269> mess<00:00:55.659> so<00:00:55.929> I<00:00:55.989> then

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
becomes an unwieldy mess so I then

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.289 
becomes an unwieldy mess so I then
trying<00:00:56.829> to<00:00:56.920> simplify<00:00:57.159> that<00:00:57.609> structure<00:00:58.149> it<00:00:58.210> a

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
trying to simplify that structure it a

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:59.340 
trying to simplify that structure it a
bit<00:00:58.449> so<00:00:58.629> it's<00:00:58.780> something<00:00:59.109> a<00:00:59.199> bit<00:00:59.289> more

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
bit so it's something a bit more

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.009 
bit so it's something a bit more
practical<00:01:00.219> and<00:01:00.670> then<00:01:00.819> I<00:01:00.909> asked<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.359> writers

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
practical and then I asked the writers

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.590 
practical and then I asked the writers
to<00:01:02.350> turn<00:01:03.010> that<00:01:03.159> story<00:01:03.459> into<00:01:03.699> script<00:01:04.030> very<00:01:04.299> very

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
to turn that story into script very very

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.240 
to turn that story into script very very
quickly<00:01:04.930> so<00:01:05.560> they're<00:01:05.680> not<00:01:05.740> thinking<00:01:06.040> too<00:01:06.130> much

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
quickly so they're not thinking too much

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.149 
quickly so they're not thinking too much
about<00:01:06.580> it<00:01:06.850> but<00:01:07.540> they're<00:01:07.690> just<00:01:07.930> getting<00:01:08.159> words

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
about it but they're just getting words

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.980 
about it but they're just getting words
down<00:01:09.520> on<00:01:09.579> the<00:01:09.820> page<00:01:10.030> so<00:01:10.270> we<00:01:10.390> have<00:01:10.539> something<00:01:10.840> to

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
down on the page so we have something to

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.010 
down on the page so we have something to
work<00:01:11.140> with<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.640> then<00:01:12.850> once<00:01:13.299> I<00:01:13.479> can<00:01:13.659> see<00:01:13.869> that

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
work with and then once I can see that

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.630 
work with and then once I can see that
once<00:01:14.200> it<00:01:14.289> was<00:01:14.409> something<00:01:14.649> in<00:01:14.740> my<00:01:14.829> hands<00:01:15.219> I<00:01:15.310> feel

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
once it was something in my hands I feel

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.090 
once it was something in my hands I feel
we've<00:01:15.820> got<00:01:16.000> something<00:01:16.240> you<00:01:17.200> know<00:01:17.320> we've<00:01:17.530> got

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
we've got something you know we've got

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.980 
we've got something you know we've got
more<00:01:18.250> ingredients<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:18.909> work<00:01:19.030> with<00:01:19.180> and<00:01:19.630> that's

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
more ingredients to work with and that's

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.230 
more ingredients to work with and that's
when<00:01:20.289> I<00:01:20.320> start<00:01:20.770> going<00:01:21.520> through<00:01:21.670> it<00:01:22.060> and

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
when I start going through it and

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
building there and take these five

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.510 
building there and take these five
people<00:01:34.570> out<00:01:34.659> and<00:01:34.840> put<00:01:35.200> this<00:01:35.350> these<00:01:36.130> two<00:01:36.369> new

people out and put this these two new
people<00:01:36.789> in<00:01:36.880> so<00:01:37.240> still<00:01:37.570> big<00:01:37.899> changes<00:01:38.590> in<00:01:38.619> the

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
people in so still big changes in the

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.330 
people in so still big changes in the
script<00:01:38.950> I<00:01:39.310> ask<00:01:39.759> them<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:39.939> go<00:01:40.060> away<00:01:40.149> and<00:01:40.420> write

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
script I ask them to go away and write

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.160 
script I ask them to go away and write
another<00:01:42.340> script<00:01:42.579> on<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:42.880> basis<00:01:43.240> of<00:01:43.359> that<00:01:43.539> and

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
another script on the basis of that and

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.919 
another script on the basis of that and
then<00:01:45.130> we<00:01:45.429> reduce<00:01:45.729> it<00:01:45.850> again<00:01:46.119> we've<00:01:46.450> passed<00:01:46.750> the

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
then we reduce it again we've passed the

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.230 
then we reduce it again we've passed the
script<00:01:47.229> to<00:01:47.499> each<00:01:48.159> writer<00:01:48.549> takes<00:01:48.850> a<00:01:48.939> bit<00:01:49.090> the

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
script to each writer takes a bit the

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.209 
script to each writer takes a bit the
script<00:01:49.539> and<00:01:49.689> that<00:01:50.530> someone<00:01:50.859> else<00:01:50.890> has<00:01:51.070> written

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
script and that someone else has written

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.149 
script and that someone else has written
and<00:01:51.700> rewrites<00:01:52.149> it<00:01:52.450> we<00:01:53.079> all<00:01:53.229> swap<00:01:53.649> bits<00:01:54.009> of

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
and rewrites it we all swap bits of

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.700 
and rewrites it we all swap bits of
scripts<00:01:54.609> so<00:01:55.149> in<00:01:55.509> that<00:01:55.810> process<00:01:56.079> the<00:01:56.439> scripts

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
scripts so in that process the scripts

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.109 
scripts so in that process the scripts
getting<00:01:56.979> bigger<00:01:57.189> and<00:01:57.340> being<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.640> bigger<00:01:57.789> again

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
getting bigger and being a bigger again

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.569 
getting bigger and being a bigger again
and<00:01:58.570> then<00:01:58.659> we<00:01:58.749> reduce<00:01:59.380> it<00:01:59.560> again<00:01:59.859> to<00:02:00.549> a

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
and then we reduce it again to a

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.999 
and then we reduce it again to a
document<00:02:01.270> that<00:02:01.329> we<00:02:01.569> can<00:02:01.749> then<00:02:01.929> use<00:02:02.229> to<00:02:02.259> cast

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
document that we can then use to cast

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.459 
document that we can then use to cast
with<00:02:03.939> but<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.270> casting<00:02:04.689> process<00:02:04.810> is<00:02:05.229> fairly

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
with but the casting process is fairly

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.950 
with but the casting process is fairly
early<00:02:05.710> on<00:02:05.859> I<00:02:06.039> like<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.399> cast<00:02:06.640> people<00:02:07.090> early

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
early on I like to cast people early

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.380 
early on I like to cast people early
stages<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.649> writers<00:02:09.009> can<00:02:09.130> then<00:02:09.310> see<00:02:09.610> who

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
stages so the writers can then see who

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.790 
stages so the writers can then see who
the<00:02:10.539> cast<00:02:10.750> are<00:02:11.020> what<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.410> person<00:02:11.710> actually

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
the cast are what this person actually

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.530 
the cast are what this person actually
physically<00:02:12.370> loops<00:02:12.580> like<00:02:12.790> how<00:02:13.000> she<00:02:13.060> talks

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
physically loops like how she talks

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.110 
physically loops like how she talks
that's<00:02:14.530> something<00:02:14.800> we<00:02:15.280> rewrite<00:02:15.670> this<00:02:15.820> get<00:02:16.030> to

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
that's something we rewrite this get to

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.360 
that's something we rewrite this get to
the<00:02:16.210> basis<00:02:16.510> for<00:02:16.600> that

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
the basis for that

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.059 
the basis for that
it<00:02:18.120> becomes<00:02:18.450> bigger<00:02:18.720> again<00:02:19.080> we<00:02:19.650> go<00:02:19.799> into<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
it becomes bigger again we go into the

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.220 
it becomes bigger again we go into the
rehearsals<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.700> ask<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:21.060> cast<00:02:21.390> improvise

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
rehearsals I ask the cast improvise

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.199 
rehearsals I ask the cast improvise
around<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.860> script<00:02:23.220> because<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.580> want<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.879> get

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
around the script because I want to get

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.280 
around the script because I want to get
an<00:02:24.299> element<00:02:24.629> of<00:02:25.489> naturalism<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:27.200> sense<00:02:28.200> of

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
an element of naturalism and sense of

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.630 
an element of naturalism and sense of
the<00:02:28.379> characters<00:02:28.860> being<00:02:29.010> really<00:02:29.280> fleshed

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
the characters being really fleshed

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.940 
the characters being really fleshed
though<00:02:29.909> that<00:02:30.690> inevitably<00:02:31.260> leads<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.620> more

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
though that inevitably leads to more

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.039 
though that inevitably leads to more
material<00:02:32.610> being<00:02:32.790> generated<00:02:33.120> but<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.569> writers

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
material being generated but the writers

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.199 
material being generated but the writers
are<00:02:34.200> always<00:02:34.470> there<00:02:34.650> at<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:35.209> rehearsal

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
are always there at the rehearsal

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.059 
are always there at the rehearsal
process<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.810> they<00:02:37.049> can<00:02:37.200> take<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.590> material

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
process so they can take that material

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.160 
process so they can take that material
in<00:02:38.159> and<00:02:38.400> boil<00:02:38.849> it<00:02:39.000> down<00:02:39.060> again<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.810> package

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
in and boil it down again and to package

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.039 
in and boil it down again and to package
the<00:02:40.379> script<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:40.980> we<00:02:41.519> go<00:02:41.670> into<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.940> ship<00:02:42.180> with

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
the script and we go into the ship with

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.720 
the script and we go into the ship with
a<00:02:43.079> script<00:02:43.409> it<00:02:43.620> still<00:02:43.890> feels<00:02:44.099> a<00:02:44.220> little<00:02:44.370> bit<00:02:44.519> too

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
a script it still feels a little bit too

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.000 
a script it still feels a little bit too
long<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.950> always<00:02:46.950> feel<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.400> can't<00:02:47.670> tell

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
long I always feel you can't tell

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.410 
long I always feel you can't tell
sometimes<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.519> know<00:02:50.609> your<00:02:50.790> favorite<00:02:51.000> bit<00:02:51.299> in

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
sometimes you know your favorite bit in

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.819 
sometimes you know your favorite bit in
the<00:02:51.480> script<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.109> bit<00:02:52.290> when<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.560> come<00:02:52.709> to

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
the script is the bit when you come to

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.770 
the script is the bit when you come to
shoot<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.129> is<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.609> the<00:02:53.849> least<00:02:54.030> interesting<00:02:54.660> and

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
shoot it is is the least interesting and

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.500 
shoot it is is the least interesting and
yet<00:02:54.930> sometime<00:02:55.470> little<00:02:56.099> throwaway<00:02:56.400> remark<00:02:56.849> or

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
yet sometime little throwaway remark or

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.630 
yet sometime little throwaway remark or
a<00:02:57.870> moment<00:02:58.410> on<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.560> scripture<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.099> think<00:02:59.370> that

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
a moment on the scripture to think that

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.300 
a moment on the scripture to think that
something<00:03:00.540> lights<00:03:00.840> up<00:03:01.109> you<00:03:01.950> know<00:03:02.069> when<00:03:02.220> you

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
something lights up you know when you

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.479 
something lights up you know when you
shoot<00:03:02.549> it<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:02.970> can't<00:03:03.659> tell<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.349> so<00:03:04.859> I<00:03:04.890> sure

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
shoot it so I can't tell and so I sure

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.550 
shoot it so I can't tell and so I sure
as<00:03:05.640> much<00:03:05.790> as<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.000> can<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.329> I<00:03:06.750> leave<00:03:07.019> as<00:03:07.170> much<00:03:07.200> in

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
as much as I can and I leave as much in

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.849 
as much as I can and I leave as much in
as<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.739> can<00:03:07.980> until<00:03:08.159> we<00:03:08.519> shoot<00:03:09.319> and<00:03:10.319> so<00:03:10.530> never<00:03:10.739> did

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
as I can until we shoot and so never did

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.479 
as I can until we shoot and so never did
we<00:03:10.980> end<00:03:11.129> up<00:03:11.250> with<00:03:11.310> another<00:03:11.579> baggie<00:03:13.489> assembly

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
we end up with another baggie assembly

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.280 
we end up with another baggie assembly
and<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.760> first<00:03:15.299> cut<00:03:15.629> for<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:15.989> loop<00:03:16.140> was

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
and the first cut for in the loop was

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.050 
and the first cut for in the loop was
about<00:03:16.440> four<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.829> half<00:03:16.859> hours<00:03:17.310> long<00:03:17.489> but<00:03:17.909> I

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
about four and a half hours long but I

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
improvise if they are confident that

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.979 
improvise if they are confident that
they're<00:03:59.099> working<00:03:59.579> with<00:03:59.609> a<00:03:59.730> script<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.389> is

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
they're working with a script that is

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.900 
they're working with a script that is
watertight<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.829> know<00:04:01.919> items<00:04:02.430> so<00:04:02.549> we<00:04:02.639> spent<00:04:02.879> a

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
watertight you know items so we spent a

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.580 
watertight you know items so we spent a
lot<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:03.060> time<00:04:03.199> it's<00:04:04.199> almost<00:04:04.379> two

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
lot of time it's almost two

lot of time it's almost two
contradictory<00:04:05.129> processes<00:04:05.790> is<00:04:05.940> one<00:04:06.180> is

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
contradictory processes is one is

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.939 
contradictory processes is one is
blocking<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.019> script<00:04:07.379> down<00:04:07.590> so<00:04:07.829> that's

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:07.949 
blocking the script down so that's

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:12.050 
blocking the script down so that's
absolutely<00:04:08.639> as<00:04:09.230> tight<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.650> as<00:04:10.769> good<00:04:11.760> as<00:04:11.910> I

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060
