00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
hi I am Kristen Patterson and I'm here

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.360 
hi I am Kristen Patterson and I'm here
to<00:00:15.750> show<00:00:15.930> you<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.380> next<00:00:16.590> step<00:00:16.950> after

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:17.370 
to show you the next step after

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.880 
to show you the next step after
hopefully<00:00:18.180> you've<00:00:18.330> practiced<00:00:18.869> along<00:00:19.680> with

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
hopefully you've practiced along with

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.300 
hopefully you've practiced along with
the<00:00:20.220> learning<00:00:20.610> vibrato<00:00:21.060> part<00:00:22.020> 1<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.529> part<00:00:22.560> 2

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
the learning vibrato part 1 and part 2

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.750 
the learning vibrato part 1 and part 2
where<00:00:23.790> I<00:00:23.820> showed<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.150> how<00:00:24.270> to<00:00:24.300> do<00:00:24.540> ear<00:00:24.810> vibrato

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
where I showed you how to do ear vibrato

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.089 
where I showed you how to do ear vibrato
without<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.910> violin<00:00:27.270> and<00:00:27.540> in<00:00:28.230> part<00:00:28.470> 2<00:00:28.680> how<00:00:29.040> to

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
without the violin and in part 2 how to

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.460 
without the violin and in part 2 how to
do<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.400> with<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.660> violin<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.259> the<00:00:31.290> bow

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
do it with the violin and the bow

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.810 
do it with the violin and the bow
putting<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.279> together

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
putting it together

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.030 
putting it together
and<00:00:33.000> now<00:00:33.420> we're<00:00:33.600> going<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.750> be<00:00:33.930> putting<00:00:34.170> those

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
and now we're going to be putting those

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.920 
and now we're going to be putting those
techniques<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.790> you've<00:00:36.060> been<00:00:36.390> hopefully

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
techniques that you've been hopefully

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.310 
techniques that you've been hopefully
practicing<00:00:37.970> into<00:00:38.970> some<00:00:39.329> music<00:00:39.690> some<00:00:40.020> very

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
practicing into some music some very

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.670 
practicing into some music some very
simple<00:00:41.010> slow<00:00:41.579> music<00:00:42.060> this<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.020> how<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.200> teach<00:00:43.470> my

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
simple slow music this is how I teach my

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.200 
simple slow music this is how I teach my
students<00:00:44.130> so<00:00:44.310> I<00:00:44.370> wanted<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.730> share<00:00:44.970> it<00:00:45.090> with

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
students so I wanted to share it with

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.810 
students so I wanted to share it with
you<00:00:45.330> two<00:00:45.540> we're<00:00:46.230> gonna<00:00:46.380> use<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.860> song<00:00:47.100> that

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
you two we're gonna use the song that

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.330 
you two we're gonna use the song that
hopefully<00:00:48.420> many<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.470> learned<00:00:49.710> kind

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
hopefully many of you have learned kind

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.210 
hopefully many of you have learned kind
of<00:00:50.490> lightly<00:00:50.790> row<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:52.320> gonna<00:00:52.470> go<00:00:52.620> super<00:00:52.890> slow

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
of lightly row it's gonna go super slow

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.190 
of lightly row it's gonna go super slow
so<00:00:53.910> first<00:00:54.150> I'm<00:00:54.300> going<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.510> show<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.720> how<00:00:55.020> it's

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
so first I'm going to show you how it's

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.430 
so first I'm going to show you how it's
gonna<00:00:55.320> go<00:00:55.620> without<00:00:56.310> any<00:00:56.820> vibrato<00:00:57.240> so<00:00:58.170> maybe

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
gonna go without any vibrato so maybe

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.900 
gonna go without any vibrato so maybe
you<00:00:58.560> can<00:00:58.710> learn<00:00:58.830> it<00:00:59.010> with<00:00:59.130> me<00:00:59.340> if<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.670> don't

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
you can learn it with me if you don't

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.760 
you can learn it with me if you don't
know<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.240> play<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.900> with<00:01:01.020> me<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.200> few<00:01:01.230> times<00:01:01.530> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
know it play it with me a few times a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.570 
know it play it with me a few times a
alvarado

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
alvarado

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.299 
alvarado
then<00:01:02.880> I'm<00:01:02.970> going<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.180> show<00:01:03.330> you<00:01:03.390> how<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.600> add

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
then I'm going to show you how to add

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
then I'm going to show you how to add
vibrato<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:06.270> here<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.570> go<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.170> lightly

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
vibrato so here we go this is lightly

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:57.850 
vibrato so here we go this is lightly
rose<00:01:07.770> super<00:01:08.369> slow

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:20.850 

you

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.270 

why

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.720 

there<00:02:26.280> we<00:02:26.370> go

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
there we go

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.230 
there we go
so<00:02:27.060> that's<00:02:27.240> lightly<00:02:27.600> row<00:02:27.780> with<00:02:27.930> no<00:02:28.080> vibrato

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
so that's lightly row with no vibrato

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.480 
so that's lightly row with no vibrato
with<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.360> metronome<00:02:30.660> set<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.290> 50<00:02:31.980> for<00:02:32.430> the

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
with the metronome set to 50 for the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.700 
with the metronome set to 50 for the
quarter<00:02:32.760> note<00:02:32.910> it's<00:02:33.150> pretty<00:02:33.390> slow<00:02:33.660> but<00:02:34.530> that's

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
quarter note it's pretty slow but that's

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.410 
quarter note it's pretty slow but that's
gonna<00:02:34.860> be<00:02:34.950> super<00:02:35.430> important<00:02:35.910> when<00:02:36.120> we're

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
gonna be super important when we're

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.630 
gonna be super important when we're
gonna<00:02:36.510> add<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.900> vibrato<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:38.280> we're<00:02:38.490> starting

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
gonna add the vibrato so we're starting

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.050 
gonna add the vibrato so we're starting
at<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.060> fourth<00:02:39.420> finger<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.920> note<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.310> on<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.940> D

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
at the fourth finger the note a on the D

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.820 
at the fourth finger the note a on the D
string<00:02:42.090> by<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.050> way<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.320> technique<00:02:43.710> is

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
string by the way this technique is

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.490 
string by the way this technique is
going<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.070> work<00:02:44.220> both<00:02:44.400> for<00:02:44.640> viola<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.870> violin

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
going to work both for viola and violin

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.950 
going to work both for viola and violin
just<00:02:46.800> make<00:02:47.490> sure<00:02:47.610> you're<00:02:47.760> playing<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.240> on<00:02:48.420> the

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
just make sure you're playing it on the

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.720 
just make sure you're playing it on the
D<00:02:49.110> string<00:02:49.140> starting<00:02:49.860> with<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.100> fourth<00:02:50.430> finger

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
D string starting with the fourth finger

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.300 
D string starting with the fourth finger
a<00:02:51.170> so<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.290> first<00:02:52.530> measure<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:53.040> where<00:02:53.220> we're

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
a so the first measure is where we're

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.120 
a so the first measure is where we're
gonna<00:02:53.370> add<00:02:53.700> our<00:02:53.910> first<00:02:54.270> vibrato<00:02:55.140> wobble<00:02:55.740> yay

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
gonna add our first vibrato wobble yay

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.930 
gonna add our first vibrato wobble yay
and<00:02:56.610> all<00:02:57.060> we're<00:02:57.240> gonna<00:02:57.300> do<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.630> one<00:02:58.170> wobble<00:02:58.680> on

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
and all we're gonna do is one wobble on

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.300 
and all we're gonna do is one wobble on
each<00:02:59.940> half<00:03:00.270> note<00:03:00.630> in<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.380> song<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.070> first

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
each half note in the song so the first

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.120 
each half note in the song so the first
measure<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:02.730> gonna<00:03:02.970> sound<00:03:03.180> like<00:03:03.360> this<00:03:04.130> it's

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
measure is gonna sound like this it's

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.770 
measure is gonna sound like this it's
not<00:03:05.280> very<00:03:05.640> good<00:03:05.910> sounding<00:03:06.270> but<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.630> is

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
not very good sounding but this is

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.900 
not very good sounding but this is
really<00:03:07.020> important<00:03:07.410> for<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.620> technique<00:03:08.130> so

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
really important for a technique so

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.230 
really important for a technique so
we're<00:03:09.000> gonna<00:03:09.090> go<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.510> F<00:03:10.380> sure<00:03:10.680> F<00:03:11.430> sharp<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.030> a

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
we're gonna go a F sure F sharp and a

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:31.290 
we're gonna go a F sure F sharp and a
wobble<00:03:12.570> watch<00:03:12.780> how<00:03:13.020> I<00:03:13.050> do<00:03:13.200> it

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.540

wobble<00:03:37.850> on<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.210> half<00:03:38.390> note<00:03:38.570> e<00:03:38.810> starts<00:03:39.620> up<00:03:59.410> okay

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
wobble on the half note e starts up okay

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.370 
wobble on the half note e starts up okay
that's<00:04:00.950> all<00:04:01.100> it<00:04:01.250> is<00:04:01.310> one<00:04:01.640> little<00:04:01.760> one<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.810> then

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
that's all it is one little one and then

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.470 
that's all it is one little one and then
the<00:04:03.830> next<00:04:04.190> one<00:04:04.430> is<00:04:04.730> not<00:04:04.910> until<00:04:05.150> we're<00:04:05.270> doing

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
the next one is not until we're doing

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.440 
the next one is not until we're doing
the<00:04:05.600> fourth<00:04:05.840> finger<00:04:06.110> a<00:04:06.880> on<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:08.030> D<00:04:08.150> string<00:04:08.180> so

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
the fourth finger a on the D string so

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.990 
the fourth finger a on the D string so
we're<00:04:08.540> going<00:04:08.630> to<00:04:09.190> three<00:04:10.190> of<00:04:10.310> those<00:04:10.460> so<00:04:10.760> on<00:04:10.880> the

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
we're going to three of those so on the

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.400 
we're going to three of those so on the
on<00:04:11.330> the<00:04:11.480> half<00:04:11.660> note<00:04:11.870> we're<00:04:12.110> gonna<00:04:12.170> add<00:04:12.380> a

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
on the half note we're gonna add a

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.670 
on the half note we're gonna add a
wobble<00:04:16.600> now<00:04:17.600> we<00:04:17.660> discussed<00:04:18.080> earlier<00:04:18.200> how<00:04:18.650> the

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
wobble now we discussed earlier how the

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.710 
wobble now we discussed earlier how the
fours<00:04:19.040> are<00:04:19.220> really<00:04:19.430> tricky<00:04:19.609> to<00:04:20.330> get<00:04:20.450> them<00:04:20.630> to

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
fours are really tricky to get them to

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.870 
fours are really tricky to get them to
pull<00:04:20.900> back<00:04:20.930> so<00:04:21.350> do<00:04:21.500> your<00:04:21.650> best<00:04:21.680> isn't<00:04:22.490> it's<00:04:22.730> not

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
pull back so do your best isn't it's not

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.430 
pull back so do your best isn't it's not
gonna<00:04:23.120> sound<00:04:23.240> like<00:04:23.420> much<00:04:23.690> but<00:04:23.990> it's<00:04:24.230> the<00:04:24.410> idea

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
gonna sound like much but it's the idea

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.230 
gonna sound like much but it's the idea
that<00:04:24.800> we're<00:04:24.950> going<00:04:25.130> for<00:04:25.310> a<00:04:25.340> leader<00:04:25.520> we'll<00:04:26.120> be

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
that we're going for a leader we'll be

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.180 
that we're going for a leader we'll be
able<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.510> add<00:04:26.720> intensity<00:04:27.410> so<00:04:27.800> here's<00:04:27.980> how<00:04:28.130> it

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
able to add intensity so here's how it

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:38.000 
able to add intensity so here's how it
goes

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.640 

all<00:04:39.010> it<00:04:39.160> is<00:04:39.250> okay<00:04:40.360> next<00:04:40.990> parts<00:04:41.200> just<00:04:41.440> like<00:04:41.560> the

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
all it is okay next parts just like the

00:04:41.650 --> 00:05:04.460 
all it is okay next parts just like the
beginning<00:04:41.800> a<00:04:42.300> F<00:04:43.300> sharp<00:04:43.660> F<00:04:44.020> sharp<00:04:44.170> well<00:05:03.360> okay

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
beginning a F sharp F sharp well okay

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.250 
beginning a F sharp F sharp well okay
then<00:05:05.470> we're<00:05:05.590> gonna<00:05:05.710> go<00:05:06.010> D<00:05:06.400> F<00:05:06.760> sharp<00:05:07.030> a<00:05:07.180> a<00:05:07.630> and

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
then we're gonna go D F sharp a a and

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.160 
then we're gonna go D F sharp a a and
then<00:05:08.500> hold<00:05:08.860> an<00:05:09.250> F<00:05:09.550> sharp<00:05:09.580> for<00:05:10.150> four<00:05:10.360> beats<00:05:10.480> on

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
then hold an F sharp for four beats on

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.370 
then hold an F sharp for four beats on
the<00:05:11.590> F<00:05:11.800> sharp<00:05:11.830> whole<00:05:12.400> note<00:05:12.670> we're<00:05:12.940> gonna<00:05:13.000> do

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
the F sharp whole note we're gonna do

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.010 
the F sharp whole note we're gonna do
three<00:05:14.380> waddles<00:05:15.000> three<00:05:16.000> so<00:05:16.570> it's<00:05:16.690> gonna<00:05:16.810> be

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
three waddles three so it's gonna be

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.990 
three waddles three so it's gonna be
this<00:05:18.480> one<00:05:19.590> two<00:05:20.760> three

wobble wobble wobble here's how it's
gonna<00:05:29.350> be<00:05:29.470> on<00:05:29.680> the<00:05:29.710> music<00:05:31.080> it's<00:05:32.080> gonna<00:05:32.169> be<00:05:32.320> F

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
gonna be on the music it's gonna be F

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:43.300 
gonna be on the music it's gonna be F
sharp<00:05:32.910> so<00:05:33.910> we<00:05:34.000> go<00:05:34.150> play<00:05:38.400> cool<00:05:39.400> three<00:05:39.940> of<00:05:40.030> them

so<00:05:43.940> with<00:05:44.060> the<00:05:44.150> measure<00:05:44.330> before<00:05:44.540> that<00:05:44.930> we<00:05:45.080> have

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
so with the measure before that we have

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:53.719 
so with the measure before that we have
D

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729

gee a wobble okay and just like the
beginning<00:06:25.550> 42<00:06:26.419> a<00:06:36.940> D<00:06:37.940> F<00:06:38.270> sharp<00:06:38.300> a<00:06:38.630> a<00:06:38.870> and<00:06:39.169> then<00:06:39.260> we

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
beginning 42 a D F sharp a a and then we

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:46.989 
beginning 42 a D F sharp a a and then we
hold<00:06:39.560> the<00:06:39.740> deed
