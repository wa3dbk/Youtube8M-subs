something<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.659> we<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.840> eat<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.890> I

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
something that we can eat so I

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.499 
something that we can eat so I
personally<00:01:41.310> think<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.000> grow<00:01:42.270> your<00:01:42.450> own

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
personally think the grow your own

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.990 
personally think the grow your own
celery<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.979> not<00:01:44.280> worth<00:01:44.460> your<00:01:44.579> time<00:01:44.640> at<00:01:44.909> all

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
celery it is not worth your time at all

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.810 
celery it is not worth your time at all
so<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.360> wouldn't<00:01:45.659> do<00:01:45.750> that

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
so I wouldn't do that

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.719 
so I wouldn't do that
grow<00:01:47.820> your<00:01:47.880> lettuce<00:01:49.130> this<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.430> lettuce

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
grow your lettuce this is the lettuce

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.940 
grow your lettuce this is the lettuce
that<00:01:50.759> we<00:01:50.909> did<00:01:51.180> maybe<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.530> hold<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.829> up

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
that we did maybe I can just hold it up

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.289 
that we did maybe I can just hold it up
here<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.189> I'll<00:01:53.280> just<00:01:53.430> hold<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.759> up<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.000> carrot

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
here and I'll just hold it up the carrot

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.359 
here and I'll just hold it up the carrot
for<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.530> lettuce<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:55.920> we<00:01:56.130> did

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
for you this is the lettuce that we did

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.120 
for you this is the lettuce that we did
here<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.930> mean<00:01:57.930> that's<00:01:58.170> not<00:01:58.439> terrible<00:01:59.070> but

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
here I mean that's not terrible but

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.410 
here I mean that's not terrible but
again<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.610> has<00:01:59.790> been<00:01:59.820> going<00:02:00.119> for<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.329> few

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
again this has been going for a few

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.410 
again this has been going for a few
weeks<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.520> week<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.880> half<00:02:02.909> time

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
weeks so in a week and a half time

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.330 
weeks so in a week and a half time
almost<00:02:03.780> two<00:02:04.140> weeks<00:02:04.350> time<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.590> started<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.130> get<00:02:05.280> a

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
almost two weeks time I started to get a

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.260 
almost two weeks time I started to get a
little<00:02:05.490> spike<00:02:05.880> out<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.329> but<00:02:08.090> I'm

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
little spike out of it but I'm

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.150 
little spike out of it but I'm
this<00:02:09.450> one<00:02:09.630> here<00:02:09.870> it<00:02:09.990> doesn't<00:02:10.260> stink<00:02:10.530> it's<00:02:10.770> not

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
this one here it doesn't stink it's not

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.340 
this one here it doesn't stink it's not
a<00:02:11.190> big<00:02:11.370> deal<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.790> if<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:11.940> let<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.150> sit<00:02:12.270> then<00:02:13.230> you

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
a big deal so if you let it sit then you

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.080 
a big deal so if you let it sit then you
can<00:02:13.500> make<00:02:13.650> one<00:02:13.890> salad<00:02:14.190> out<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.550> once<00:02:14.940> a

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
can make one salad out of it once a

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.140 
can make one salad out of it once a
month<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.540> mean<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:15.840> don't<00:02:16.020> know<00:02:16.290> yeah<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:18.030> know

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
month I mean I don't know yeah you know

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.430 
month I mean I don't know yeah you know
it<00:02:18.240> seems<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.720> takes<00:02:18.810> an<00:02:18.990> awful<00:02:19.140> long

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
it seems like it takes an awful long

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.680 
it seems like it takes an awful long
time<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.980> get<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.550> two<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:21.120> grow<00:02:21.300> back<00:02:21.510> to

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
time to get that two to grow back to

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.030 
time to get that two to grow back to
where<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:21.930> could<00:02:22.020> actually<00:02:22.170> use<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:24.390> then

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
where you could actually use it and then

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.550 
where you could actually use it and then
here's<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.130> really<00:02:26.340> neat<00:02:26.580> one<00:02:27.380> here's<00:02:28.380> the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
here's a really neat one here's the

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.040 
here's a really neat one here's the
carrot<00:02:29.180> regrow<00:02:30.180> your<00:02:30.240> carrots

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
okay so I have nothing coming out of the

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.930 
okay so I have nothing coming out of the
bottom<00:02:34.050> yet<00:02:34.410> but<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:34.860> definitely<00:02:35.190> have<00:02:35.640> some

some<00:02:36.390> growth<00:02:36.630> in<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.900> top<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.350> looks<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:37.740> a

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
some growth in the top it looks like a

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.410 
some growth in the top it looks like a
carrot<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.370> would<00:02:38.970> grow<00:02:39.150> in<00:02:39.270> your<00:02:39.360> garden

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
split that's when the roots start

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.460 
split that's when the roots start
growing<00:02:54.390> onto<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.600> bottom<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.170> don't<00:02:55.410> know

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.540 
growing onto the bottom so I don't know
what<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.650> say<00:02:55.800> maybe<00:02:56.070> we'll<00:02:56.310> get<00:02:56.490> another

carrot that'll start to grow out of the
bottom<00:02:58.380> of<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.620> but<00:02:58.890> this<00:02:59.430> one<00:02:59.610> we're<00:02:59.700> going

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
out for sure on that and then leeks

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.440 
out for sure on that and then leeks
this<00:03:07.320> is<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.500> great<00:03:07.800> example<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:08.640> did<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.210> leeks

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
this is a great example I did the leeks

this is a great example I did the leeks
how<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.410> regrow<00:03:10.830> your<00:03:10.890> leeks<00:03:11.250> this<00:03:11.730> one

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
absolutely works that there's been a

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.010 
absolutely works that there's been a
week<00:03:14.550> and<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.730> half<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.209> look<00:03:15.390> at<00:03:15.480> that<00:03:15.720> I've

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
unhappy about the bottom these already

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.010 
unhappy about the bottom these already
come<00:03:22.170> with<00:03:22.500> roots<00:03:23.180> but<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.600> know<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.840> roots

come with roots but you know the roots
have<00:03:25.140> gotten<00:03:25.440> quite<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.680> bit<00:03:25.770> bigger<00:03:26.070> than<00:03:26.190> what

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
have gotten quite a bit bigger than what

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.930 
have gotten quite a bit bigger than what
they<00:03:26.580> were<00:03:26.640> when<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.030> first<00:03:27.270> bought<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.630> but<00:03:28.050> I

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
they were when I first bought it but I

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.120 
they were when I first bought it but I
absolutely<00:03:29.940> think<00:03:30.500> did<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.590> get<00:03:31.770> a<00:03:31.800> real

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
absolutely think did I get a real

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.690 
absolutely think did I get a real
right<00:03:32.340> now

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
right now

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.880 
right now
I<00:03:32.730> absolutely<00:03:33.270> think<00:03:33.750> that<00:03:33.870> works<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.740> can

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
I absolutely think that works you can

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.260 
I absolutely think that works you can
cut<00:03:35.070> that<00:03:35.220> right<00:03:35.430> now<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:35.790> use<00:03:35.910> it<00:03:36.060> you're<00:03:36.180> not

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
cut that right now and use it you're not

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.670 
cut that right now and use it you're not
going<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.510> use<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.660> large<00:03:37.020> amount<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.440> leeks

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
going to use a large amount of leeks

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.650 
going to use a large amount of leeks
when<00:03:37.920> you're<00:03:38.010> cooking<00:03:38.160> its<00:03:38.459> onion<00:03:38.820> right<00:03:39.060> so

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
when you're cooking its onion right so

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.660 
when you're cooking its onion right so
that's<00:03:39.870> sustainable<00:03:40.350> for<00:03:40.620> sure<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.340> would

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
that's sustainable for sure so I would

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.230 
that's sustainable for sure so I would
say<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:43.380> leeks<00:03:43.709> are<00:03:44.160> good<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.520> go<00:03:44.700> the

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
say that the leeks are good to go the

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.720 
say that the leeks are good to go the
romaine<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:45.690> very<00:03:46.140> slow<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.860> I<00:03:47.400> didn't<00:03:47.640> mean

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
romaine is very slow and I didn't mean

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.810 
romaine is very slow and I didn't mean
to<00:03:47.820> rhyme<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.800> the<00:03:49.800> celery<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.310> garbage

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
to rhyme that the the celery is garbage

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.920 
to rhyme that the the celery is garbage
I<00:03:50.940> wouldn't<00:03:51.150> even<00:03:51.209> waste<00:03:51.360> your<00:03:51.450> time<00:03:51.630> with<00:03:51.810> it

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
butchering the actual pineapple tree

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.900 
butchering the actual pineapple tree
that<00:04:03.750> I<00:04:03.780> had<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.560> group<00:04:04.830> pineapple<00:04:05.520> and<00:04:05.730> we're

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
that I had the group pineapple and we're

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.430 
that I had the group pineapple and we're
in<00:04:06.000> Eastern<00:04:06.270> Canada<00:04:06.480> here<00:04:06.840> man<00:04:06.989> I'm<00:04:07.110> talking

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
in Eastern Canada here man I'm talking

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.230 
in Eastern Canada here man I'm talking
right<00:04:07.560> now<00:04:07.620> I<00:04:07.800> think

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
right now I think

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.910 
right now I think
like<00:04:08.360> minus<00:04:08.780> ten<00:04:09.020> degrees<00:04:09.050> Celsius<00:04:09.320> outside

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
like minus ten degrees Celsius outside

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.370 
like minus ten degrees Celsius outside
so<00:04:10.520> that's<00:04:11.240> proof<00:04:11.630> you<00:04:11.810> can<00:04:11.960> do<00:04:12.110> it<00:04:12.260> at<00:04:12.350> your

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
so that's proof you can do it at your

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.310 
so that's proof you can do it at your
house<00:04:12.680> so<00:04:13.010> we<00:04:13.160> don't<00:04:13.370> have<00:04:13.460> warm<00:04:13.790> at<00:04:14.240> all<00:04:14.420> but
