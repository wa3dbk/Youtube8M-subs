00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.670
 the castel marina the model of the shotgun or winchester used at 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.670
 of very important interventions and in the marine environment 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:14.359
 it has a growing polymers and its metal parts are 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:18.339
 nickel-plated chrome in depth to resist salinity 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.210
 it's a gun that he has to be able to face any 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.210
 weather conditions and that any time 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.869
 the triggering of the pump is carried out via this 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.869
 little smart that allows you to retreat the penguin 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.930
 at the moment the sleeve returns to its initial position only the pressure on 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.740
 the relaxation and the departure of the couple will again be able to 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.370
 trigger 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.240
 if not, the penguin remains blocked to ensure safety 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.170
 of the Army 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.540
 all the more so with the latter ammunition of very high power 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.930
 can be pulled and the truck has been studied for use of 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.780
 chevrotine onassis 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.460
 given that was shot is used in service the handlebar features 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.970
 a trubio optical fiber element 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.659
 particularly long which also allowed for extraordinary contrasts 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.420
 this point do in normal lighting conditions looks like a 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.420
 small lit lamp 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.230
 now let's look at the costa marina a little closer 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.860
 we access the mechanics by removing the closing cap as 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.880
 for almost all rifles of this type 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.380
 now it is possible to remove the barrel to access the rest of the 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.380
 meet 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.380
 the first element that appears the shutter tip endowed with a 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.649
 radial closure 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.950
 as well as several fins that allow a moderate rotation of 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.610
 shutter 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.320
 we then excel mechanics of maintenance is unique shop 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.290
 which is fixed inside by the two spring functions that allows the 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.600
 complete disassembly 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.860
 once the copy is removed it is possible to extract the trigger guard from the 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.590
 relax with his plate and separate the lower part of the mechanics 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.150
 which contains the relaxation group
