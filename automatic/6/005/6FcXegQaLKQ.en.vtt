00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
it was really really bad and judging

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.350

one<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> worst<00:00:42.840> movies<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.320> all<00:00:43.530> time<00:00:43.820> it's

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
one of the worst movies of all time it's

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.630 
one of the worst movies of all time it's
often<00:00:45.120> said<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.539> game<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.370> better<00:00:47.370> than

often said that this game is better than

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.810 
often said that this game is better than
the<00:00:48.000> movie<00:00:48.500> now<00:00:49.500> that's<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:50.070> saying<00:00:50.340> much<00:00:50.489> so

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the movie now that's not saying much so

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.270 
the movie now that's not saying much so
it<00:00:50.940> could<00:00:51.059> still<00:00:51.270> suck<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.989> let's<00:00:52.949> hope<00:00:53.070> it's

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
it could still suck but let's hope it's

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.189 
it could still suck but let's hope it's
