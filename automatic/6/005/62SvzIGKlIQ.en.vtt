00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:15.420
 eighth place goes to cipher more often 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:19.740
 plants thorn lehr a prompter comes from 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.470
 East Asia Japan China Vietnam is 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.699
 have its origin can be attributed to 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.760
 the fact that the plant loves humidity 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.890
 increased air so if you 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.960
 place the plant in your winter garden 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.290
 need to take care to plant 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.320
 was placed further away from the batteries 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.090
 central heating in relation to 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.390
 cardboard compared to the previous one 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.820
 the position of the plant is less demanding 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.280
 that is lighting 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.719
 light penumbra there is a lot 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.449
 different types of whispers this is due to 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.230
 that the plant spreads to a large 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.550
 territories 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.500
 that is, where does she come from 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.040
 different kinds 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.549
 leaves there are green leaf paint 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.760
 foliage and also there are brigades smart 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.119
 species, that is, species in which 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.290
 there are stripes more 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.610
 light shades 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.640
 That concerns care plants like wet 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.380
 air therefore it is necessary 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.670
 periodically spray watering should 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.670
 be moderate 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.030
 the main disadvantage of this plant is 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.560
 call what the plant is subject to 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.119
 attack pest let spider 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:59.270
 tick for and other pests and in Sochi with 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.979
 such attacks with a plant can 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.100
 there are some changes that is 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.710
 plants often shed their leaves then 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.470
 there is from a big lush bush you 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.900
 may remain a few leaves 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.110
 Well, of course in the case of the wrong 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.660
 plant care ie if 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.630
 air humidity is not high 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.870
 if you dry it out and that is 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.870
 not enough water 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.350
 do not maintain a certain temperature 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:34.090
 plants can start to hurt and 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.090
 amazed and fall of pests
