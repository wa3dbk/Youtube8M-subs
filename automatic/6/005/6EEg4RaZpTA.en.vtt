of it and we'll say we'll do the
transparency<00:01:46.450> at<00:01:46.630> say<00:01:46.780> thirty-five<00:01:47.229> percent

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
transparency at say thirty-five percent

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.830 
transparency at say thirty-five percent
once<00:01:48.700> again<00:01:48.820> we're<00:01:49.060> going<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.240> save<00:01:49.479> this<00:01:49.630> as<00:01:49.689> a

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
once again we're going to save this as a

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.230 
once again we're going to save this as a
PNG<00:01:50.170> file<00:01:50.619> and<00:01:50.890> this<00:01:51.369> is<00:01:51.490> kind<00:01:51.700> of<00:01:51.760> beyond<00:01:52.150> the

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
PNG file and this is kind of beyond the

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.160 
PNG file and this is kind of beyond the
scope<00:01:52.420> of<00:01:52.479> this<00:01:52.540> tutorial<00:01:52.689> so<00:01:52.990> we're<00:01:53.110> not

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
scope of this tutorial so we're not

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.840 
scope of this tutorial so we're not
gonna<00:01:53.290> be<00:01:53.380> teaching<00:01:53.500> as<00:01:53.770> illustrator<00:01:54.310> but<00:01:54.729> I'm

go<00:02:11.920> back<00:02:12.129> into<00:02:12.370> Lightroom<00:02:13.019> up<00:02:14.019> it's<00:02:14.379> in<00:02:14.530> use<00:02:14.739> so

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
go back into Lightroom up it's in use so

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.229 
go back into Lightroom up it's in use so
what<00:02:15.310> we'll<00:02:15.459> do<00:02:15.549> is<00:02:15.579> we're<00:02:15.819> going<00:02:15.909> to<00:02:15.970> do<00:02:16.090> this

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
what we'll do is we're going to do this

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.520 
what we'll do is we're going to do this
we're<00:02:17.049> going<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.230> do<00:02:17.940> transparent

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
we're going to do transparent

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.500 
we're going to do transparent
we'll<00:02:20.400> save<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.730> as<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:20.850> different<00:02:20.970> name<00:02:21.300> that

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
we'll save it as a different name that

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.630 
we'll save it as a different name that
way<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.810> doesn't<00:02:22.230> give<00:02:22.440> us<00:02:22.560> an<00:02:22.650> issue<00:02:22.800> will

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
way it doesn't give us an issue will

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.160 
way it doesn't give us an issue will
copy<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:23.970> in<00:02:24.209> we're<00:02:24.540> going<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.690> go<00:02:24.810> back<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.080> the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
copy it in we're going to go back in the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.290 
copy it in we're going to go back in the
light<00:02:25.319> room<00:02:25.560> again<00:02:26.340> close<00:02:26.670> out<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.940> interface

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
light room again close out the interface

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.660 
light room again close out the interface
tab<00:02:27.540> hit<00:02:27.840> ctrl<00:02:28.230> or<00:02:28.470> command<00:02:28.740> comma<00:02:29.160> again<00:02:29.490> to

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
tab hit ctrl or command comma again to

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.430 
tab hit ctrl or command comma again to
get<00:02:29.790> back<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.480> then<00:02:31.170> we're<00:02:31.290> going<00:02:31.380> to

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
get back in and then we're going to

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.980 
get back in and then we're going to
select<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.920> transparent<00:02:32.790> one<00:02:32.910> again<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.420> so

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
select that transparent one again and so

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.540 
select that transparent one again and so
that<00:02:34.140> looks<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.440> lot<00:02:34.590> nicer<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:35.069> doesn't<00:02:35.310> jump

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
that looks a lot nicer it doesn't jump

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.370 
that looks a lot nicer it doesn't jump
out<00:02:35.730> nearly<00:02:36.090> as<00:02:36.270> much<00:02:36.450> as<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.750> previous<00:02:37.200> one

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
out nearly as much as that previous one

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.770 
out nearly as much as that previous one
so<00:02:38.130> now<00:02:38.280> I'm<00:02:38.489> going<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.670> hit<00:02:38.819> okay<00:02:39.270> everything

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
so now I'm going to hit okay everything

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.949 
so now I'm going to hit okay everything
else<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.050> fine<00:02:40.319> and<00:02:40.650> if<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.370> go<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.819> look<00:02:42.090> all<00:02:42.600> of

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
else is fine and if I go and look all of

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.690 
else is fine and if I go and look all of
my<00:02:43.080> panel<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.560> marks<00:02:43.800> now<00:02:43.920> should<00:02:44.250> have<00:02:44.459> the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
my panel and marks now should have the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.059 
my panel and marks now should have the
SLR<00:02:45.120> logo<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.170> feel<00:02:46.350> free<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.530> customize<00:02:46.739> that

SLR logo so feel free to customize that

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.650 
SLR logo so feel free to customize that
have<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.310> guys<00:02:47.400> like<00:02:47.610> again<00:02:48.030> if<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.270> want<00:02:48.510> to

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
have you guys like again if you want to

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.600 
have you guys like again if you want to
space<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.050> around<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:50.160> need<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.459> use

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
space it around you need to use

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.430 
space it around you need to use
transparent<00:02:51.180> pixels<00:02:51.330> so<00:02:51.780> create<00:02:52.260> like<00:02:52.410> a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
transparent pixels so create like a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.740 
transparent pixels so create like a
little<00:02:52.680> bumper<00:02:52.980> on<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.190> top<00:02:53.400> so<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.030> it's

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
little bumper on the top so that it's

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.449 
little bumper on the top so that it's
transparent<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.440> so<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.680> bumps<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.100> entire

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
transparent and so it bumps the entire

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.620 
transparent and so it bumps the entire
local<00:02:56.730> down<00:02:56.970> which<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.269> something<00:02:57.390> i'm<00:02:57.510> going

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
local down which is something i'm going

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.600 
local down which is something i'm going
to<00:02:57.690> do<00:02:57.780> actually<00:02:58.140> right<00:02:58.470> now<00:02:58.650> but<00:02:59.400> i'll<00:02:59.519> let

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610
