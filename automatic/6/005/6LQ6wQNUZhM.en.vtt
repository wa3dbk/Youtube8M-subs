00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
much when you pick the icons you can run

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.150 
much when you pick the icons you can run
out<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.849> space<00:00:30.060> really<00:00:30.330> quickly<00:00:30.890> you<00:00:31.890> can<00:00:32.040> run

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
out of space really quickly you can run

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.830 
out of space really quickly you can run
out<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.309> space<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.700> addition<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.690> go

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
couple problems one if you have more

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.540 
couple problems one if you have more
programs<00:01:07.440> that<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.740> want<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.950> put<00:01:08.070> down<00:01:08.160> here

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
programs that you want to put down here

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.999 
programs that you want to put down here
then<00:01:08.880> there's<00:01:09.479> space<00:01:09.810> then<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.590> gets<00:01:10.830> really

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
then there's space then it gets really

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.890 
then there's space then it gets really
ugly<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.850> right<00:01:12.150> side<00:01:12.180> there'll<00:01:12.690> be<00:01:12.780> a

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
ugly on this right side there'll be a

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.170 
ugly on this right side there'll be a
like<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> little<00:01:13.470> scroll<00:01:14.190> bar<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.790> scroll

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
like a little scroll bar and you scroll

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.230 
like a little scroll bar and you scroll
it<00:01:15.420> up<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:16.050> looks<00:01:16.440> bad<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.850> pretty<00:01:18.090> much

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
it up it looks bad and it's pretty much

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.680 
it up it looks bad and it's pretty much
a<00:01:18.300> bad<00:01:18.479> idea<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.840> think<00:01:19.670> likewise<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.539> want

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
a bad idea I think likewise is you want

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.090 
a bad idea I think likewise is you want
to<00:01:21.750> put<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.869> folder<00:01:22.289> in<00:01:22.380> here<00:01:22.410> you<00:01:22.950> have

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
to put a folder in here you have

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.910 
to put a folder in here you have
obviously<00:01:23.430> your<00:01:23.759> Windows<00:01:24.060> Explorer<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:25.710> can

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
obviously your Windows Explorer you can

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.109 
obviously your Windows Explorer you can
you<00:01:26.250> wouldn't<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.550> that<00:01:26.670> there<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.000> it'll

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
you wouldn't have that there and it'll

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.910 
you wouldn't have that there and it'll
launch<00:01:27.360> your<00:01:27.600> libraries<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.590> problem<00:01:28.860> is

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
launch your libraries but the problem is

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.680 
launch your libraries but the problem is
if<00:01:29.039> you<00:01:29.190> want<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.460> put<00:01:29.640> an<00:01:29.789> individual<00:01:30.479> folder

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
if you want to put an individual folder

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.450 
if you want to put an individual folder
kind<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.229> like<00:01:31.320> we're<00:01:31.860> back<00:01:32.070> with<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.369> old

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
kind of like we're back with the old

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.420 
kind of like we're back with the old
quick<00:01:32.789> launch<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:34.140> can't<00:01:34.350> do<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.800> you<00:01:35.190> can't

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
quick launch you can't do that you can't

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.630 
to have a folder to put them all in so
that<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.200> can<00:02:25.680> have<00:02:25.800> all<00:02:25.860> these<00:02:26.099> links<00:02:26.310> without

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640

sure what the deal is I guess that's
just<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.520> glitch<00:04:24.120> in<00:04:24.270> Windows<00:04:24.539> 7<00:04:24.750> not<00:04:25.350> really

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
everything else is simple from here okay

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.570

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
and put it down here now obviously if

two<00:06:09.070> different<00:06:09.099> ways<00:06:09.460> you<00:06:09.729> can<00:06:09.820> do<00:06:09.940> it<00:06:10.030> from

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
two different ways you can do it from

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.149 
two different ways you can do it from
here<00:06:10.300> you're<00:06:10.479> pretty<00:06:10.570> much<00:06:10.720> done<00:06:10.990> but<00:06:11.349> it<00:06:11.680> does

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:12.159 
here you're pretty much done but it does

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:13.879 
here you're pretty much done but it does
mostly<00:06:12.490> comes<00:06:12.639> down<00:06:12.819> to<00:06:13.030> preference

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
mostly comes down to preference

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.189 
mostly comes down to preference
obviously<00:06:14.889> you<00:06:14.949> can<00:06:15.039> dry<00:06:15.220> it<00:06:15.250> back<00:06:15.520> but

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
obviously you can dry it back but

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:19.230 
obviously you can dry it back but
there's<00:06:17.199> it's<00:06:18.159> not<00:06:18.490> quite<00:06:18.849> a<00:06:18.880> hundred<00:06:19.180> percent

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240

think<00:06:33.909> would<00:06:34.090> be<00:06:34.150> the<00:06:34.240> right<00:06:34.479> way<00:06:34.659> but<00:06:34.930> it

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
think would be the right way but it

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.839 
think would be the right way but it
doesn't<00:06:35.289> quite<00:06:35.560> work<00:06:35.620> let<00:06:35.949> me<00:06:36.009> show<00:06:36.159> you<00:06:36.219> so

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:36.849 
doesn't quite work let me show you so

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:38.430 
doesn't quite work let me show you so
you<00:06:36.880> hit<00:06:37.060> large<00:06:37.270> icon<00:06:37.630> at<00:06:37.840> first<00:06:38.110> that<00:06:38.229> looks

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
you hit large icon at first that looks

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.850 
you hit large icon at first that looks
great<00:06:38.650> but<00:06:39.280> if<00:06:39.340> you<00:06:39.430> look<00:06:39.550> over<00:06:39.729> here<00:06:39.840> like<00:06:40.860> all

can see it but we're just bumped up

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.670 
can see it but we're just bumped up
maybe<00:06:45.280> like<00:06:45.490> 10<00:06:45.789> pixels<00:06:46.210> or<00:06:46.360> whatever<00:06:46.680> the

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
maybe like 10 pixels or whatever the

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.379 
maybe like 10 pixels or whatever the
whole<00:06:47.860> taskbar<00:06:48.400> looks<00:06:48.699> a<00:06:48.759> little<00:06:48.849> odd<00:06:49.090> maybe

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:49.389 
whole taskbar looks a little odd maybe

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:50.640 
whole taskbar looks a little odd maybe
you<00:06:49.570> like<00:06:49.719> it<00:06:49.750> you<00:06:49.930> see<00:06:50.050> look<00:06:50.229> at<00:06:50.320> the<00:06:50.380> clock

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.650 
you like it you see look at the clock

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.390 
you like it you see look at the clock
it's<00:06:50.979> a<00:06:51.130> little<00:06:51.370> taller<00:06:51.840> um<00:06:52.840> you<00:06:53.440> know<00:06:53.530> if<00:06:54.190> you

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 
it's a little taller um you know if you

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.040 
it's a little taller um you know if you
look<00:06:54.550> here<00:06:54.820> like<00:06:55.000> here's<00:06:55.270> the<00:06:55.389> camstudio<00:06:55.780> if

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050 
look here like here's the camstudio if

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.450 
look here like here's the camstudio if
you<00:06:56.139> look<00:06:56.289> on<00:06:56.500> the<00:06:56.800> bottom<00:06:57.130> you<00:06:57.219> can<00:06:57.310> see<00:06:57.340> a

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.460 
you look on the bottom you can see a

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.360 
you look on the bottom you can see a
little<00:06:57.669> strip<00:06:58.030> of<00:06:58.270> blank<00:06:58.840> and<00:06:59.380> that's<00:06:59.979> kind<00:07:00.280> of

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.370 
little strip of blank and that's kind of

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.879 
little strip of blank and that's kind of
a<00:07:00.550> little<00:07:00.789> downside<00:07:01.090> for<00:07:01.659> some<00:07:01.810> reason<00:07:02.169> the

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:02.889 
a little downside for some reason the

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:05.700 
a little downside for some reason the
links<00:07:03.370> when<00:07:03.639> you<00:07:04.030> add<00:07:04.150> a<00:07:04.180> large<00:07:04.719> icon<00:07:05.440> link

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:08.349 
kind of bumps it up so you know that

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:09.240 
kind of bumps it up so you know that
kind<00:07:08.560> of<00:07:08.590> comes<00:07:08.770> down<00:07:08.830> to<00:07:09.070> personal

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.250 
kind of comes down to personal

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.800
