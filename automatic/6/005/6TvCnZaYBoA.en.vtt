00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
simple and now you actually used a

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.440 
simple and now you actually used a
booklet<00:01:25.500> from<00:01:26.070> my<00:01:26.220> China<00:01:26.490> haul<00:01:26.729> video<00:01:27.030> called

a<00:01:34.860> perfect<00:01:35.250> size<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.479> used<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.780> one

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
a perfect size so I just used this one

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.010 
a perfect size so I just used this one
and<00:01:37.229> what<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.590> did<00:01:37.860> was<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.329> used<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.659> internet

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
and what I did was I used the internet

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.770 
and what I did was I used the internet
and<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.320> used<00:01:40.500> Photoshop<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:41.299> resize<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.329> and

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and I used Photoshop to resize it and

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.240 
and I used Photoshop to resize it and
position<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.500> or<00:01:43.649> probably<00:01:44.009> everything

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
position it or probably everything

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.859 
position it or probably everything
although<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.670> did<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.090> some<00:01:45.299> flaws<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.720> can

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
although I did have some flaws you can

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.120 
although I did have some flaws you can
see<00:01:45.990> at<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.170> back<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.560> not<00:01:46.680> completely

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
see at the back it's not completely

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.160 
see at the back it's not completely
filled<00:01:48.140> fill<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.409> that's<00:01:49.500> perfectly<00:01:50.070> fine

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170
