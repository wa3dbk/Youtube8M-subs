00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
suggest that they might want to move

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.130 
suggest that they might want to move
another<00:01:58.049> five<00:01:58.350> yards<00:01:58.710> because<00:01:59.240> the<00:02:00.240> only<00:02:00.420> 20

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
another five yards because the only 20

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.130 
another five yards because the only 20
yards<00:02:01.409> away<00:02:01.530> or<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:01.890> from<00:02:02.539> the<00:02:03.539> wickets<00:02:03.899> they

yards away or so from the wickets they
are<00:02:04.229> still<00:02:04.500> unable<00:02:05.039> to<00:02:05.369> prevent<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.789> single

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
it is likely to the right or left maybe

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.330 
it is likely to the right or left maybe
another<00:02:09.810> two<00:02:10.050> or<00:02:10.080> three<00:02:10.170> yards<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:11.160> put<00:02:11.310> a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
another two or three yards just put a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.590 
another two or three yards just put a
little<00:02:11.400> more<00:02:11.580> pressure<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.120> batsman<00:02:12.510> we

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
little more pressure on the batsman we

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.180 
little more pressure on the batsman we
can<00:02:12.720> singles<00:02:13.110> still<00:02:13.410> being<00:02:13.620> stolen<00:02:14.010> quite

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
can singles still being stolen quite

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.880 
can singles still being stolen quite
easily

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.440 

we're<00:02:21.460> running<00:02:21.610> between<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.000> wickets<00:02:22.090> and

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
we're running between the wickets and

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.510 
we're running between the wickets and
just<00:02:22.630> like<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:22.780> said<00:02:22.990> Charu<00:02:23.260> if<00:02:24.250> you<00:02:24.460> are

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
just like I said Charu if you are

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.890 
just like I said Charu if you are
another<00:02:24.790> five<00:02:25.060> yards<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.450> he<00:02:25.510> probably<00:02:25.720> would

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
another five yards and he probably would

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.040 
another five yards and he probably would
have<00:02:25.990> prevented<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:26.620> single<00:02:27.660> but

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
have prevented that single but

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.780 
have prevented that single but
we're<00:02:30.650> being<00:02:30.800> harsh<00:02:31.040> on<00:02:31.190> him<00:02:31.310> or<00:02:31.460> for<00:02:31.580> this

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
we're being harsh on him or for this

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.080 
we're being harsh on him or for this
