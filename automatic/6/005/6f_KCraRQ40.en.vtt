00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:17.060
 let's make chard with ham 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.890
 we have a whole bunch of beets that 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.720
 we are going to cut it we are going to cut the 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.450
 Ugly part with a sharp knife 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.070
 to cut meat with one slash and then 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.140
 as we do not fit in the container in 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.929
 where are we going to know 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.350
 all of a sudden in two parts these two 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.300
 parts and whole without chop let 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.210
 wash in abundant water not leaving them 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.920
 never soak and we will cook them in 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.960
 twice since we do not fit a 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.730
 only once in the microwave could you 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.340
 do also in a super fast pot 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.079
 without any water tightly covered 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.820
 container as you see has to have a 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.850
 good cover is not watertight 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.699
 course but the cover part of 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.440
 up that perfectly supports the 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.960
 bottom edge and no steam loss 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.199
 and we'll put in the microwave 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.820
 maximum power for 5 minutes then 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.670
 container that we put on more 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.310
 gloves to take them out and we're going to 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.280
 drain because although we have not 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.790
 put no water the chard have 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.270
 a lot in its constitution 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.210
 the above is important to cook well 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.550
 the vegetables and not in water with cutlery 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.490
 of the voice has not always been done and much 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.930
 less by adding bicarbonate that creates a 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.820
 alkaline medium in which they are destroyed 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.830
 very many nutrients are going to 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.020
 drain as you see despite 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.150
 have put no water have water 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.160
 we take out the container the same 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.930
 container with a little bit of paper and 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.040
 let's put in the amount of oil 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.770
 that carries the ration 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.200
 the recipe and let's sauté the taquitos 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.180
 of ham very lean ham during a 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.369
 minute to maximum power in the 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.490
 microwave so that they stay like 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.210
 cold as fried chard leaves and 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.979
 drained we throw them a little with paper 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.890
 Absorbent kitchen because really 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.050
 we're going to sauté them in quotes in the 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.720
 microwave between the ones we're going to cut 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.209
 now and not before because if we cut the 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.100
 vegetables all colored vegetables 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.250
 green that are the vegetables should be 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.600
 wash in water as little as possible 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.450
 because for each cut 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.240
 they lose nutrients we 're going to mix 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.240
 well with the ham and we have sofrito 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.580
 we remove it with a wooden spoon and 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.340
 we put them in the microwave again 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.800
 maximum power for two or three 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.560
 minutes simply already to unify 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.600
 flavors and they're ready to eat 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.130
 you have seen what we have taken and what 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.880
 that we have messed up the container goes 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.900
 then to the dishwasher and it 's fantastic and 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.900
 very comfortable
