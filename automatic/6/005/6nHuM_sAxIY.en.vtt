and if not rehearse well I mean look at
look<00:02:24.510> what<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.810> boat<00:02:25.019> datum<00:02:25.350> is<00:02:25.440> trying<00:02:25.620> to

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
look what the boat datum is trying to

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.800 
look what the boat datum is trying to
float<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.250> vowels<00:02:26.580> going<00:02:26.850> into<00:02:27.090> current<00:02:27.450> yep

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
float the vowels going into current yep

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.539 
float the vowels going into current yep
that<00:02:28.200> gave<00:02:28.410> me<00:02:28.560> an<00:02:28.650> idea<00:02:28.769> to<00:02:29.130> maybe<00:02:29.310> do

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
that gave me an idea to maybe do

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.220 
that gave me an idea to maybe do
something<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.120> can<00:02:30.329> like<00:02:30.480> like<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> little

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
something I can like like a little

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.900 
something I can like like a little
temporary<00:02:31.620> hook<00:02:31.950> for<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.489> stabilizer

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
temporary hook for the stabilizer

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.180 
temporary hook for the stabilizer
counter<00:02:33.420> well<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:34.170> might<00:02:34.470> tie<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.709> little<00:02:34.920> hook

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
counter well I might tie a little hook

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.130 
counter well I might tie a little hook
or<00:02:35.370> something<00:02:35.790> another<00:02:36.480> little<00:02:36.690> hook<00:02:36.959> or

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
or something another little hook or

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.539 
or something another little hook or
something<00:02:37.440> here<00:02:37.650> just<00:02:37.680> have<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.100> little<00:02:38.280> bungee

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
something here just have a little bungee

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.789 
something here just have a little bungee
call<00:02:39.000> bungee<00:02:39.480> cord<00:02:39.750> if<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.410> just<00:02:40.590> would<00:02:40.739> have

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
call bungee cord if I just would have

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.560 
call bungee cord if I just would have
hooked<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:41.070> bungee<00:02:41.370> cord<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.880> thing<00:02:42.120> to

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
hooked a bungee cord to the thing to

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.860 
hooked a bungee cord to the thing to
keep<00:02:42.780> on<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.140> down<00:02:43.320> currents<00:02:43.769> there<00:02:44.010> yeah

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
keep on the down currents there yeah

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.569 
keep on the down currents there yeah
yeah<00:02:45.870> that'll<00:02:46.260> work

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
yeah that'll work

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.979 
yeah that'll work
she's<00:02:47.579> high<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.790> solve<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.329> this<00:02:48.660> will<00:02:48.810> save

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
she's high to solve that this will save

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.300 
she's high to solve that this will save
a<00:02:49.019> lot<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.290> people<00:02:49.620> from<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:50.100> know<00:02:50.160> with
