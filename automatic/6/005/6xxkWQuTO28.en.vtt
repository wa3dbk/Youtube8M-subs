00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 you saw a message about the death of two 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.460
 Russian journalists in Ukraine we 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.900
 have seen these messages in the media but we are not 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.300
 we have confirmed information 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.610
 as to how and what it is 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.800
 happened according to some reports they 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.810
 were badly injured by others died 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.760
 when were with a group of armed 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.279
 separatists during the battle in Lugansk 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.470
 we would certainly express their condolences 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.990
 families and we urge the parties to provide 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.480
 safety of journalists but I repeat 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.219
 we do not have exact data about what happened 16 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.020
 june i ask you about comments 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.840
 Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.460
 affairs of Ukraine you do not know maybe 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.129
 one of the American politicians 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.899
 raised this question maybe the us ambassador 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.879
 In Ukraine, Jeffrey Payette somehow 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.100
 commented on these controversial statement 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.260
 Ukrainian officials or are you 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.360
 I chose to leave them alone 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.280
 talked about the context of the comment part 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.210
 I got acquainted with the rest after 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.309
 our conversation 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.790
 Prime Minister of Ukraine comment was submitted 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.970
 wrong he didn't quote anyone 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.250
 subhumans 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.770
 he meant that those who support 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.890
 militants destabilizing the situation on 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.080
 Eastern Ukraine inhuman and in this 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.330
 there is a difference and at the same time 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.610
 the prime minister had in mind the armed militants 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:26.670
 they are Russians as far as I understood from 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.950
 translation but in the original phrase which 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.600
 was later changed it said those who 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.270
 supports separatists 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.420
 subhuman and not inhuman 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.579
 This phrase was replaced only yesterday. 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.500
 then you would be bothered if the prime 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.579
 Minister of Ukraine everywhere would declare that 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.689
 Russian subhumans 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:49.619
 I think accurate translation is very important here. 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.049
 requested or the us government 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.070
 any explanation from ukrainian 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.930
 no side i just think it's 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.590
 important detail in the context of this 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.780
 comment 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.520
 clear and when you said you saw 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.219
 signs of growing Russian activity 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.700
 troops you mean activity in Russia 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.619
 near the Ukrainian border 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.570
 near the border exactly is that 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.960
 sufficient cause for concern 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.400
 Naturally this is not for us 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.650
 preferred option we're going 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.250
 closely monitor the situation and 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.470
 what will they do in the coming days I 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.209
 I mean this because their country they have 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.430
 the right to move troops freely 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.140
 its territory is true but the next 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.610
 building up military presence on 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.610
 the border will be cause for concern
