you can also wear statement pieces of

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.949 
you can also wear statement pieces of

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
jewelry I have seen that as well and it

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.810 
jewelry I have seen that as well and it
just<00:03:26.139> depends<00:03:26.650> really<00:03:26.829> on<00:03:26.979> your<00:03:27.250> style<00:03:27.579> and

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
just depends really on your style and

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.879 
just depends really on your style and
what<00:03:28.030> is<00:03:28.180> accepted<00:03:28.660> at<00:03:28.780> your<00:03:28.930> school<00:03:29.260> cute

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
what is accepted at your school cute

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.400 
what is accepted at your school cute
skirts<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.519> dresses<00:03:30.729> are<00:03:31.150> also<00:03:31.359> really<00:03:32.109> good

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
skirts and dresses are also really good

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.830 
skirts and dresses are also really good
for<00:03:32.470> teaching<00:03:33.070> but<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:34.239> think<00:03:34.510> it's<00:03:34.630> generally

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
for teaching but I think it's generally

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.289 
for teaching but I think it's generally
better<00:03:35.199> if<00:03:35.560> you're<00:03:35.859> on<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.250> younger<00:03:36.549> stage<00:03:36.970> like

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
better if you're on a younger stage like

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.810 
better if you're on a younger stage like
kindergarten<00:03:38.229> early<00:03:38.410> stage<00:03:39.100> ones<00:03:39.370> date<00:03:39.609> one

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
kindergarten early stage ones date one

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.210 
kindergarten early stage ones date one
um<00:03:40.060> but<00:03:40.780> I<00:03:41.049> find<00:03:41.380> that<00:03:41.500> at<00:03:41.620> stage<00:03:41.859> two<00:03:42.100> and

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
um but I find that at stage two and

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.409 
um but I find that at stage two and
stage<00:03:42.280> three<00:03:42.459> it's<00:03:42.880> a<00:03:42.940> little<00:03:43.150> bit<00:03:43.269> better

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
stage three it's a little bit better

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.390 
stage three it's a little bit better
just<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:43.959> be<00:03:44.169> a<00:03:44.199> bit<00:03:44.470> more<00:03:44.560> conservative<00:03:45.190> and

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
just to be a bit more conservative and

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.580 
just to be a bit more conservative and
look<00:03:45.940> a<00:03:45.970> little<00:03:46.120> bit<00:03:46.329> more<00:03:46.510> businesslike<00:03:47.019> then

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
look a little bit more businesslike then

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.740 
look a little bit more businesslike then
normal<00:03:48.280> I<00:03:48.310> think<00:03:48.609> I<00:03:48.729> do<00:03:48.850> dress<00:03:49.209> a<00:03:49.239> little<00:03:49.449> bit

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
normal I think I do dress a little bit

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.599 
normal I think I do dress a little bit
more<00:03:50.350> on<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.620> formal<00:03:50.919> side<00:03:51.130> sorry<00:03:51.400> I<00:03:51.459> was

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
more on the formal side sorry I was

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.129 
more on the formal side sorry I was
talking<00:03:52.030> in<00:03:52.090> my<00:03:52.209> camera<00:03:52.479> turn<00:03:52.750> off<00:03:52.900> so

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
talking in my camera turn off so

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:55.409 
talking in my camera turn off so
basically<00:03:53.829> I<00:03:54.130> was<00:03:54.280> saying<00:03:54.549> that<00:03:54.760> I<00:03:54.790> do<00:03:54.940> have<00:03:55.269> my

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
basically I was saying that I do have my

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.569 
basically I was saying that I do have my
casual<00:03:55.870> days<00:03:56.019> as<00:03:56.199> well<00:03:56.380> but<00:03:56.650> really<00:03:57.190> believing

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
casual days as well but really believing

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.099 
casual days as well but really believing
the<00:03:57.669> saying<00:03:57.940> that<00:03:58.239> what<00:03:58.419> you<00:03:58.449> wear<00:03:58.780> is<00:03:58.900> how<00:03:59.049> you

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
the saying that what you wear is how you

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.310 
the saying that what you wear is how you
feel<00:03:59.560> so<00:04:00.160> if<00:04:00.639> you<00:04:00.820> dress<00:04:01.090> more<00:04:01.750> formal<00:04:02.290> a

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
feel so if you dress more formal a

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.229 
feel so if you dress more formal a
little<00:04:02.650> bit<00:04:02.769> more<00:04:02.919> mature<00:04:03.070> than<00:04:03.519> you<00:04:03.910> actually

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
little bit more mature than you actually

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.900 
little bit more mature than you actually
feel<00:04:04.509> more<00:04:04.889> mature<00:04:05.889> and<00:04:06.130> you<00:04:06.430> have<00:04:06.609> a<00:04:06.639> little

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
feel more mature and you have a little

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.550 
feel more mature and you have a little
bit<00:04:07.030> more<00:04:07.209> Authority<00:04:07.810> whereas<00:04:08.079> if<00:04:08.229> you<00:04:08.320> dress

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
bit more Authority whereas if you dress

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.409 
bit more Authority whereas if you dress
casual<00:04:09.070> you<00:04:09.280> sort<00:04:09.549> of<00:04:09.609> tend<00:04:09.880> to<00:04:09.970> act<00:04:10.150> more

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
casual you sort of tend to act more

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.060 
casual you sort of tend to act more
casual<00:04:10.840> as<00:04:10.959> well<00:04:11.109> so<00:04:11.440> I<00:04:11.680> think<00:04:11.739> it<00:04:12.040> really

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
casual as well so I think it really

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.670 
casual as well so I think it really
depends<00:04:12.759> on<00:04:12.850> your<00:04:13.269> your<00:04:13.750> personality<00:04:14.440> and

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
depends on your your personality and

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.710 
depends on your your personality and
also<00:04:15.310> your

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
so as a teacher I thought I'm not

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.340 
so as a teacher I thought I'm not
repeating<00:04:17.820> myself<00:04:18.060> too<00:04:18.420> much<00:04:18.450> alright<00:04:19.140> so<00:04:19.320> I

definitely not something you will do

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.410 
definitely not something you will do
really<00:05:04.740> well<00:05:04.980> that<00:05:05.160> if<00:05:05.460> you<00:05:05.730> just<00:05:05.970> think<00:05:06.210> of<00:05:06.330> it

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
really well that if you just think of it

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.830 
really well that if you just think of it
as<00:05:06.600> a<00:05:07.040> 93<00:05:08.040> job<00:05:08.550> even<00:05:09.060> when<00:05:09.240> you're<00:05:09.360> outside<00:05:09.720> of

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
as a 93 job even when you're outside of

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.420 
as a 93 job even when you're outside of
school<00:05:10.080> you're<00:05:10.230> still<00:05:10.560> thinking<00:05:10.800> like<00:05:11.190> you're

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430
