00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
for me the biggest thing was trying to

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.789 
for me the biggest thing was trying to
learn<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.180> choreography<00:02:41.360> fast<00:02:41.930> because<00:02:42.590> what

will have rehearsal for the school for

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.589 
will have rehearsal for the school for
like<00:02:45.739> four<00:02:46.280> months<00:02:46.310> before<00:02:46.879> we<00:02:46.909> actually<00:02:47.239> do<00:02:47.569> a

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
like four months before we actually do a

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.420 
like four months before we actually do a
piece<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.230> here<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:48.680> can<00:02:48.769> never<00:02:48.920> know<00:02:49.099> for<00:02:49.250> a

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
piece and here you can never know for a

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.130 
piece and here you can never know for a
week<00:02:49.579> and<00:02:49.730> then<00:02:49.790> go<00:02:49.970> perform<00:02:50.299> it<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:51.049> have

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
week and then go perform it and you have

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.690 
week and then go perform it and you have
to<00:02:51.230> know<00:02:51.319> it<00:02:51.440> perfectly<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.370> that<00:02:52.519> was

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
to know it perfectly so that was

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.009 
to know it perfectly so that was
probably<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:53.060> hardest<00:02:53.150> thing<00:02:53.569> for<00:02:53.720> me<00:02:53.780> was

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
probably the hardest thing for me was

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.190 
probably the hardest thing for me was
being<00:02:54.500> able<00:02:54.739> to<00:02:54.799> pick<00:02:54.920> things<00:02:55.069> up<00:02:55.280> really<00:02:55.879> fast

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
being able to pick things up really fast

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.600 
being able to pick things up really fast
but<00:02:57.200> it's<00:02:57.530> also<00:02:57.650> fun<00:02:57.980> because<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:58.340> get<00:02:58.549> to

but it's also fun because you get to

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.539 
but it's also fun because you get to
dance<00:02:58.910> in<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.390> for<00:02:59.870> everybody<00:03:00.769> around<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.400> this
