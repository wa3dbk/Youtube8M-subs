00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.319
 hello girls and boys today 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.929
 by popular demand will do 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.840
 low-fat cheese such videos very much 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.990
 but for some reason girls quit anyway 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.400
 and I thought why not take off and for 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:25.760
 this we need the curd itself 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:28.730
 egg skimmed milk forgot to put 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.899
 skimmed milk 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.880
 salt soda and some herbs to taste 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.790
 what will i do first of all i 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.579
 take the pot and lay out t'mor 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.670
 the yard where I take two packs you don't look 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:50.160
 so that the capacity itself is just not right 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:54.629
 it happened that the remains of one pack in 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:59.039
 overall I take it all spread pour 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:07.170
 milk so that it covers the curd i dont 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:11.580
 I look there for a milliliter she covered and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.150
 everything means ok you see milk 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:21.180
 as now it is all a matter blender 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:23.850
 beat up with a blender hit here 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.159
 is milk and it dissolved the valves 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.920
 milk, in principle, could add 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.960
 by the sword and now this mass I put on 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.460
 the fire 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.720
 I put on fire and see, yes you can 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.450
 more fire 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.299
 take and when 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:45.990
 still value five minutes so here i have 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:47.670
 boil the mass of our future curd 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:54.490
 you see 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:58.270
 separated became cottage cheese now we have it 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.060
 the case is still to cook finally 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.719
 separated heap so passed five 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.080
 of minutes and that's how we in fact 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.910
 the protein mass is separated now we are 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.940
 We will all be cast in a colander on 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:25.440
 Marlechku take drushlak 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:25.440

 soda and herbs to taste 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:55.329
 worth it and the matter is very very well needed 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.799
 knead very well now that's what 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:05.190
 we have merged 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:05.190
 we'll press a little bit more I press 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.780
 straight shower lobby 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:21.739
 and spread this matter here in our our 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.250
 egg salt there soda 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:29.900
 they are very active this whole thing 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.549
 stir you hear such a hiss 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.680
 this is normal because it was created 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.190
 man and act with cottage cheese because 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.200
 it should be eaten once and now this 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.319
 mass we put back on fire 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.040
 just a few minutes it's all business 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:53.730
 well we interfere she will start to stick it 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:04:01.319
 mass it's not scary bye now 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:04.799
 heat up and interfere with need to interfere with cooking 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:09.239
 until it becomes such 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:13.730
 this mass is tough and a bit like that 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:18.000
 It is as clear as if 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:22.590
 a little bit reduce see she pestering 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.229
 it starts ok here it should 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.320
 think of it this mass 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.320
 and 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:37.959
 run as if I already feel that 

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:42.589
 we shoot everything, you see, it stretches 

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:47.509
 how rubber such became now this thing 

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:51.860
 we all take and lay out in advance 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:57.379
 prepared container here I have it 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:59.629
 I covered it with film you need to do everything 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:02.259
 very quickly because he is very fast 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:07.659
 freezes 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:07.659
 Here is the style or film in advance and 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:20.599
 help quickly quickly and alert 

00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:23.509
 so here's a film not just not 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:27.639
 worry take plenochku and starts 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.639
 mold as you like 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:37.230

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.200
 normal with this table so doing 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.900
 I put back 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:48.720
 I give any capacity so slightly from him 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:51.870
 cool and put in the fridge until 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.760
 cool as cool all you can eat 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:06:01.140
 its result will show you when it cools 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:03.680
 so it took two hours our cheese is ready I him 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.680
 getting out 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:14.880
 it turns out such a hard cheese 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:19.770
 By the way until the end and cooled but all 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:22.190
