much<00:02:16.820> because<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.239> kind<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.570> could<00:02:17.750> get

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
much because it kind of could get

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.449 
much because it kind of could get
repetitive<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.950> know<00:02:19.040> you're<00:02:19.190> always<00:02:19.280> using

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
repetitive you know you're always using

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.880 
repetitive you know you're always using
type<00:02:19.820> 95<00:02:20.120> spp<00:02:20.780> 90s<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.380> that<00:02:21.470> stupid

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
type 95 spp 90s and that stupid

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.430 
type 95 spp 90s and that stupid
juggernaut<00:02:22.670> on<00:02:22.850> dome<00:02:23.150> that's<00:02:23.840> why<00:02:24.049> i<00:02:24.079> stopped

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
juggernaut on dome that's why i stopped

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.690 
juggernaut on dome that's why i stopped
playing<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.130> know<00:02:25.190> i<00:02:25.220> don't<00:02:25.400> know<00:02:25.459> if<00:02:25.579> they

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
playing it you know i don't know if they

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.539 
playing it you know i don't know if they
made<00:02:25.910> any<00:02:26.030> changes<00:02:26.150> since<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:27.370> since<00:02:28.370> they

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
made any changes since that since they

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.350 
made any changes since that since they
introduced<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:30.340> infected<00:02:31.340> game<00:02:31.550> mode<00:02:31.760> but

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
introduced the infected game mode but

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.580 
introduced the infected game mode but
what<00:02:32.480> they're<00:02:32.599> going<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.750> do<00:02:32.900> is<00:02:33.020> probably<00:02:33.200> add

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
what they're going to do is probably add

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.720 
what they're going to do is probably add
in<00:02:33.739> some<00:02:33.920> new<00:02:34.040> weapons<00:02:34.400> and

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
in some new weapons and

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.160 
in some new weapons and
not<00:02:34.909> so<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.180> think<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:35.450> could<00:02:35.690> be<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:35.900> really

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
not so I think that could be a really

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.710 
not so I think that could be a really
good<00:02:36.260> addition<00:02:36.680> they're<00:02:36.830> also<00:02:36.950> going<00:02:37.129> to<00:02:37.190> add

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
good addition they're also going to add

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.410 
good addition they're also going to add
community<00:02:38.720> playlist<00:02:39.430> leaderboards<00:02:40.430> for<00:02:40.519> you

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
know like drop zone and some of the

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.850 
know like drop zone and some of the
free-for-all<00:02:44.480> type<00:02:44.720> game<00:02:44.930> modes<00:02:45.140> now<00:02:45.680> they're

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
free-for-all type game modes now they're

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.559

also going to make some changes for the

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.229

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
they're going to make these changes but

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:52.990 
they're going to make these changes but

model 1887 shotgun pm-9 submachine gun

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.449 
model 1887 shotgun pm-9 submachine gun
and<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.659> mp5<00:03:06.200> submachine<00:03:06.560> guns<00:03:07.040> said<00:03:07.310> they

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
and the mp5 submachine guns said they

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.059 
and the mp5 submachine guns said they
all<00:03:07.670> need<00:03:08.290> basically<00:03:09.290> little<00:03:09.590> boost<00:03:09.799> and<00:03:10.010> I

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
all need basically little boost and I

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.589 
all need basically little boost and I
agree<00:03:10.370> all<00:03:10.579> those<00:03:10.790> weapons<00:03:10.970> are<00:03:11.269> really

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
agree all those weapons are really

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.240 
agree all those weapons are really
subpar<00:03:11.870> compared<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.680> other<00:03:12.829> weapons<00:03:13.160> I

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
subpar compared to the other weapons I

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.080 
subpar compared to the other weapons I
would<00:03:13.459> love<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.760> see<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.180> m16<00:03:14.690> get<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:14.930> boost<00:03:15.200> so

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
would love to see the m16 get a boost so

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.449 
would love to see the m16 get a boost so
it's<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:17.989> actually<00:03:18.319> drops<00:03:18.620> in<00:03:18.829> one<00:03:19.010> shot<00:03:19.250> like

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
it's it actually drops in one shot like

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:20.920 
it's it actually drops in one shot like
you<00:03:19.609> used<00:03:19.879> to<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.329> now<00:03:20.390> I'm<00:03:20.480> not<00:03:20.660> saying<00:03:20.810> it

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
you used to and now I'm not saying it

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.479 
you used to and now I'm not saying it
needs<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.170> be<00:03:21.290> a<00:03:21.319> laser<00:03:21.650> beam<00:03:21.950> from<00:03:22.160> across<00:03:22.430> the

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
needs to be a laser beam from across the

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.199 
needs to be a laser beam from across the
map<00:03:23.109> but<00:03:24.109> however<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:24.640> it's<00:03:25.640> kind<00:03:25.849> of<00:03:25.910> sad<00:03:26.150> when

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
map but however it it's kind of sad when

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.910 
map but however it it's kind of sad when
you're<00:03:26.569> mid-range<00:03:27.049> and<00:03:27.349> you're<00:03:27.530> having<00:03:27.739> to

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
you're mid-range and you're having to

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.349 
you're mid-range and you're having to
hit<00:03:28.069> people<00:03:28.220> with<00:03:28.400> two<00:03:28.640> and<00:03:28.760> three<00:03:28.940> bursts

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
hit people with two and three bursts

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.119 
hit people with two and three bursts
it's<00:03:29.540> kind<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.750> ridiculous<00:03:30.010> also<00:03:31.010> they're

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
it's kind of ridiculous also they're

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:32.470 
it's kind of ridiculous also they're
going<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.310> talk<00:03:31.400> about<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.640> riot<00:03:31.910> shield<00:03:32.030> I

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
going to talk about the riot shield I

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.210 
going to talk about the riot shield I
love<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.410> right<00:03:33.560> shoulder<00:03:33.769> modern<00:03:34.099> warfare

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
love the right shoulder modern warfare

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.670 
love the right shoulder modern warfare
two<00:03:34.459> but<00:03:34.670> I<00:03:34.700> don't<00:03:34.970> like<00:03:35.150> using<00:03:35.510> it<00:03:35.840> in<00:03:35.989> modern

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
two but I don't like using it in modern

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.960 
two but I don't like using it in modern
warfare<00:03:36.799> 3<00:03:36.950> because<00:03:37.370> it<00:03:37.549> seems<00:03:37.730> that<00:03:37.819> you<00:03:37.940> can

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
warfare 3 because it seems that you can

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.460 
warfare 3 because it seems that you can
shoot<00:03:38.329> directly<00:03:38.510> through<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.109> shield<00:03:39.290> the

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
shoot directly through the shield the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.129 
shoot directly through the shield the
hit<00:03:39.650> detection<00:03:39.769> is<00:03:40.250> really<00:03:40.639> off<00:03:40.849> so<00:03:41.180> what

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
hit detection is really off so what

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.150 
hit detection is really off so what
they're<00:03:42.260> going<00:03:42.349> to<00:03:42.410> talk<00:03:42.620> to<00:03:42.739> their<00:03:42.859> design

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
they're going to talk to their design

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.640 
they're going to talk to their design
team<00:03:43.340> about<00:03:43.549> is<00:03:43.959> basically<00:03:44.959> fixing<00:03:45.349> that<00:03:45.440> hit

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
team about is basically fixing that hit

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.289 
team about is basically fixing that hit
detection<00:03:45.799> on<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.280> shield<00:03:46.489> especially<00:03:47.120> when

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
detection on the shield especially when

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.349 
detection on the shield especially when
it's<00:03:47.419> on<00:03:47.599> your<00:03:47.810> back<00:03:48.109> and<00:03:48.410> then<00:03:49.040> some<00:03:49.459> of<00:03:50.180> the

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
it's on your back and then some of the

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.210 
it's on your back and then some of the
challenges<00:03:50.660> when<00:03:51.139> you<00:03:51.230> prestige<00:03:51.470> don't<00:03:51.980> carry

challenges when you prestige don't carry

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.860 
challenges when you prestige don't carry
over<00:03:52.430> some<00:03:52.760> of<00:03:52.790> them<00:03:52.940> I<00:03:53.060> think<00:03:53.419> master<00:03:53.780> and

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
over some of them I think master and

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.900 
over some of them I think master and
veteran<00:03:54.260> challenges<00:03:54.739> so<00:03:55.519> they're<00:03:55.639> going<00:03:55.760> to

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
veteran challenges so they're going to

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.879 
veteran challenges so they're going to
talk<00:03:56.060> about<00:03:56.209> fixing<00:03:56.720> that<00:03:56.900> also<00:03:57.739> they're

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
talk about fixing that also they're

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.190 
talk about fixing that also they're
going<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:58.069> talk<00:03:58.250> about<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:59.060> final<00:03:59.660> stand<00:03:59.900> fix

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
going to talk about the final stand fix

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.720 
going to talk about the final stand fix
so<00:04:00.470> when<00:04:00.650> you<00:04:00.769> put<00:04:00.950> someone<00:04:01.160> in<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.430> final

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
so when you put someone in the final

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.629 
so when you put someone in the final
stand<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.269> someone<00:04:02.840> steals<00:04:03.169> that<00:04:03.349> kill<00:04:03.639> you

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
stand and someone steals that kill you

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.129 
stand and someone steals that kill you
get<00:04:04.819> credited<00:04:05.269> for<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.569> full<00:04:05.750> kill<00:04:05.989> and<00:04:06.109> I

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
get credited for the full kill and I

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.199 
get credited for the full kill and I
think<00:04:06.319> the<00:04:06.410> teammate<00:04:06.769> gets<00:04:06.980> an<00:04:07.250> assist<00:04:07.730> kind

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
think the teammate gets an assist kind

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.640 
think the teammate gets an assist kind
of<00:04:08.269> like<00:04:08.389> how<00:04:08.540> black<00:04:08.810> ops<00:04:09.019> made<00:04:09.260> that<00:04:09.410> patch

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
of like how black ops made that patch

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.069 
of like how black ops made that patch
towards<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.370> end<00:04:10.400> and<00:04:11.060> I<00:04:11.510> think<00:04:11.840> I'd<00:04:11.930> be<00:04:12.049> a

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
towards the end and I think I'd be a

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.569 
towards the end and I think I'd be a
great<00:04:12.440> addition<00:04:12.709> you<00:04:13.010> know<00:04:13.130> helped<00:04:13.370> a<00:04:13.459> lot

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
great addition you know helped a lot

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:14.890 
great addition you know helped a lot

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
more people hit kill streaks because

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.810 
more people hit kill streaks because

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
these damn bastards fallen in the final

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.240 
these damn bastards fallen in the final
stand<00:04:17.030> or<00:04:17.180> so<00:04:17.539> annoying<00:04:17.930> final<00:04:18.709> stand<00:04:18.919> is<00:04:19.039> more

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
stand or so annoying final stand is more

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.710

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
prevalent than second chance it's

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
ridiculous and it's a death street that

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.370 
ridiculous and it's a death street that
