00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.500
 Dr. Alejandro Camps is a dermatologist 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.180
 and belongs to the doctors el selecto 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.610
 circle of first level doctors 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.799
 Spain as an expert in the transplant of 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.070
 hair will explain the details of this 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.070
 method 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.490
 induced me in that the ancient technique 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.279
 acquires a round technique called 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.099
 tip technique left the head like 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:34.000
 with doll hair at the moment 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.470
 to see among others it occurred to him to separate 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.019
 these hairs in loose hairs and 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.690
 planting them individually is 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.879
 he opened an excellent field to be able 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.720
 do a cosmetic transplant and without that 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.850
 was seen in these round 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.830
 since then what we have done are 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.650
 variations on this technique and improvements 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.090
 what merritt 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.090
 and others promoted 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.610
 a hair transplant is required when 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.920
 the part of hair loss or 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.290
 alopecia 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.990
 import unites the person enough 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.080
 to have a desire to repopulate this 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.330
 zone this happens both in men and in 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.570
 women what happens is that the 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.009
 need is greater in women because a 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.619
 woman with little hair looks in a 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.670
 worse condition than what a 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.780
 man where baldness are 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.780
 relatively accepted 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.320
 20 years ago, we are going to plant 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.450
 practically only men in the 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.820
 currently about 20 percent 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.350
 of the patients we treat for 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.350
 transplant are women 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.659
 the ideal condition for the realization 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.439
 of surgery is one that allows 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.470
 have healthy hair to 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.990
 transport it so it can be transported to 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.640
 the area where hair is missing if 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.100
 meet these requirements we can do 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.520
 a transplant 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.520
 frankly successful 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.000
 the result must be of excellence and 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.660
 understands excellence to cover the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.930
 area that harms the patient 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.700
 For this we depend on the quality of the 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.250
 hair from the area loves to say that there 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.740
 Enough and abundant hair is fine 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.160
 or thick to cover this area 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.160
 mentioned 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.780
 nowadays we use only one technique 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.590
 for the most cosmetic hair transplant 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.590
 is the follicular units for 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.510
 cover the zone lopez and here the difference 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.650
 and where there are two techniques is in the 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.769
 way to get these units 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.829
 follicular in the donor area there is a 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.500
 zone of the strip that this zone contributes 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.079
 abundant hair is drawn a long line 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.989
 of a centimeter of scalp that 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.299
 then it is sutured and a scar remains 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:17.799
 imperceptible or we can get the 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:20.109
 hair through a small bit of 07 to 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.900
 one millimeter in diameter taking out the 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:25.810
 hairs individually the advantage of the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.790
 technique of the headband is that it gets more 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.099
 of twice as much hair as with 30 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.739
 follicular units and the person who 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.760
 transplant what you want and need is 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.760
 abundance of hair 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.390
 of surgery we will perform on your 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.940
 whole with local anesthesia and I do not 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.430
 it removes that in some more anxious patient 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.510
 can be applied a bit of sedation 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.900
 but keeping the conscience the time 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.690
 of duration of the surgery will be about 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.610
 four hours or five because we do not have 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.950
 No hurry and what we want is a 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.950
 work well done with comfort 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.590
 for the patient and with the times 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.370
 needed to be able to do a job 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.370
 of perfection 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.760
 immediately surgery the patient 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.550
 seal your address 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.460
 appreciating a sowing of orders very 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.740
 short that in a few days approximately 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.830
 in the time of a month will fall quality 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.350
 because they lack irrigation and will return to 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.530
 reproduce from when they get 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.290
 the blood supply to be able to produce 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.000
 hair all the hair after 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.210
 transplant that we will appreciate to 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.830
 approximately eight months and the 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.570
 absolute maturity of the transplant what 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.870
 we will see the year after the 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.870
 transplant 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.720
 the degree of satisfaction is very good 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.810
 because with patients what we carry 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.510
 is a 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.700
 an expectation project that fits in 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.310
 both our offer and what he 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.409
 wait for her and with this one with this one 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.229
 conjunction of 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:20.879
 of positions what we get is that 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.429
 the patient has a degree of happiness 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:26.639
 great having covered in a way 

00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:29.279
 satisfactory the lopez area and here the 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.629
 mini micrografts or transplants 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:33.089
 follicular units that is the one that 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:35.759
 does now everywhere they give a 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:38.550
 immense cosmetic to what is a 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:41.369
 transplant the hair transplant should not 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.489
 to notice it nobody but that it takes 

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:43.489
