can
you<00:03:20.620> know<00:03:20.709> customize<00:03:21.370> all<00:03:21.610> of<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.150> controls

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
you know customize all of the controls

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.530 
you know customize all of the controls
on<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.290> ps3<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.400> fit<00:03:24.640> this<00:03:24.820> game<00:03:25.060> how<00:03:25.330> you'd

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
on the ps3 to fit this game how you'd

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.390 
on the ps3 to fit this game how you'd
like<00:03:25.780> so<00:03:26.440> we're<00:03:26.650> just<00:03:26.680> going<00:03:26.860> to<00:03:26.950> go<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:27.190> drag

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
like so we're just going to go and drag

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.340 
like so we're just going to go and drag
some<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:27.730> these<00:03:27.880> around<00:03:28.269> here<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:29.050> kind<00:03:29.260> of

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
some of these around here and kind of

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.979 
some of these around here and kind of
get<00:03:29.500> things<00:03:29.739> set<00:03:30.430> up<00:03:30.459> until<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.300> have<00:03:31.540> something

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
get things set up until I have something

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.740 
get things set up until I have something
that<00:03:32.170> is<00:03:32.350> kind<00:03:33.130> of<00:03:33.280> playable<00:03:33.790> in<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.060> game

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
that is kind of playable in the game

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.630 
that is kind of playable in the game
here<00:03:35.140> so<00:03:35.500> now<00:03:35.620> that<00:03:35.739> we<00:03:35.860> have<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.070> control<00:03:36.400> set

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
here so now that we have the control set

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.400 
here so now that we have the control set
up<00:03:36.760> tap<00:03:37.030> on<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.330> done<00:03:37.570> button<00:03:37.600> in<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.140> bottom

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
up tap on the done button in the bottom

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.680 
up tap on the done button in the bottom
corner<00:03:38.769> here<00:03:38.800> and<00:03:39.220> then<00:03:39.970> we<00:03:40.150> can<00:03:40.300> just<00:03:40.450> back

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
corner here and then we can just back

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.740 
corner here and then we can just back
out<00:03:40.900> of<00:03:40.959> all<00:03:41.350> this<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.850> continue<00:03:42.850> back<00:03:43.239> into

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
out of all this and continue back into

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.470 
out of all this and continue back into
modern<00:03:44.200> combat<00:03:44.470> 4<00:03:45.100> so<00:03:45.880> let's<00:03:45.910> go<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.299> home

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.020 
modern combat 4 so let's go to the home
screen<00:03:46.840> here<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.350> we'll<00:03:47.799> open<00:03:48.190> up<00:03:48.580> modern

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
screen here and we'll open up modern

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.600 
screen here and we'll open up modern
combat<00:03:49.239> 4<00:03:49.630> again<00:03:49.989> so<00:03:50.590> after<00:03:50.860> we<00:03:50.980> unpause<00:03:51.310> this

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
combat 4 again so after we unpause this

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.330 
combat 4 again so after we unpause this
you<00:03:51.940> can<00:03:52.150> see<00:03:52.360> that<00:03:52.390> I<00:03:52.780> am<00:03:53.110> moving<00:03:53.650> around<00:03:54.010> in

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
you can see that I am moving around in

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.580 
you can see that I am moving around in
modern<00:03:54.670> combat<00:03:54.910> 4<00:03:55.269> without<00:03:55.510> touching<00:03:56.019> the

as you can see I'm just kind of playing
through<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:21.010> game<00:04:21.040> here<00:04:21.669> but<00:04:22.090> I<00:04:22.240> want<00:04:22.450> to

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
through the game here but I want to

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.630 
through the game here but I want to
point<00:04:22.690> out<00:04:22.810> something<00:04:23.080> real<00:04:23.380> quick<00:04:23.650> here<00:04:24.039> one

point out something real quick here one

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.000 
point out something real quick here one
thing<00:04:24.880> is<00:04:25.030> with<00:04:25.330> this<00:04:25.960> right<00:04:26.349> controller

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
thing is with this right controller

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.690 
thing is with this right controller
stick<00:04:27.400> you

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
stick you

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.340 
stick you
can<00:04:27.820> actually<00:04:28.180> set<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.480> sensitivity<00:04:29.320> even

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
can actually set the sensitivity even

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.770 
can actually set the sensitivity even
further<00:04:30.070> by<00:04:30.400> doing<00:04:30.730> a<00:04:30.820> couple<00:04:31.180> things<00:04:31.210> here<00:04:31.750> so

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
further by doing a couple things here so

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.990 
further by doing a couple things here so
it<00:04:32.020> back<00:04:32.230> in<00:04:32.380> blue<00:04:32.590> troll<00:04:32.890> we<00:04:33.520> have<00:04:33.670> the<00:04:33.790> little

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
it back in blue troll we have the little

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.180 
it back in blue troll we have the little
right<00:04:34.210> joystick<00:04:34.810> control<00:04:35.380> here<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:35.830> if<00:04:35.980> you

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
right joystick control here and if you

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.430 
right joystick control here and if you
make<00:04:36.340> it<00:04:36.490> bigger<00:04:36.730> or<00:04:36.850> smaller<00:04:37.060> that<00:04:37.840> will<00:04:38.050> vary

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
make it bigger or smaller that will vary

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.490 
make it bigger or smaller that will vary
the<00:04:38.710> sensitivity<00:04:39.520> for<00:04:40.480> looking<00:04:40.870> around<00:04:40.990> in

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
the sensitivity for looking around in

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.690 
the sensitivity for looking around in
the<00:04:41.530> game<00:04:41.830> so<00:04:42.070> as<00:04:42.160> you<00:04:42.250> can<00:04:42.370> see<00:04:42.460> I<00:04:42.490> have<00:04:42.670> it

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
the game so as you can see I have it

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.790 
the game so as you can see I have it
really<00:04:43.090> big<00:04:43.330> here<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:43.990> we're<00:04:44.530> going<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:44.710> go

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
really big here and we're going to go

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.230 
really big here and we're going to go
back<00:04:44.980> into<00:04:45.190> modern<00:04:45.580> combat<00:04:45.760> 4<00:04:46.150> and<00:04:46.420> once<00:04:47.230> we<00:04:47.380> uh

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
back into modern combat 4 and once we uh

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.180 
back into modern combat 4 and once we uh
that<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.390> sensitivity<00:04:49.750> is<00:04:50.170> very<00:04:50.530> very<00:04:50.860> high

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
that the sensitivity is very very high

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.920 
that the sensitivity is very very high
now<00:04:51.490> when<00:04:51.820> I'm<00:04:51.910> moving<00:04:52.240> this<00:04:52.360> around<00:04:52.540> it's

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
now when I'm moving this around it's

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.740 
now when I'm moving this around it's
very<00:04:52.990> high<00:04:53.590> almost<00:04:53.950> too<00:04:54.640> high<00:04:54.850> but<00:04:55.180> you<00:04:55.570> can

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
very high almost too high but you can

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.800 
very high almost too high but you can
play<00:04:55.990> around<00:04:56.260> with<00:04:56.470> this<00:04:56.770> and<00:04:57.100> the<00:04:58.000> in-game

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
play around with this and the in-game

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.200 
play around with this and the in-game
sensitivity<00:04:59.800> controls<00:05:00.190> to<00:05:00.610> kind<00:05:00.880> of<00:05:00.970> get

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
sensitivity controls to kind of get

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.630 
sensitivity controls to kind of get
something<00:05:01.690> that<00:05:02.110> works<00:05:02.320> for<00:05:02.530> you<00:05:02.710> so<00:05:03.370> let's<00:05:03.550> go
