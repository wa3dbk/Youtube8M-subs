00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
onto the meat as opposed to a pan I

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.220 
onto the meat as opposed to a pan I
think<00:00:32.239> we<00:00:32.329> were<00:00:32.419> cooking<00:00:32.570> in<00:00:32.750> a<00:00:32.810> pan<00:00:32.930> then<00:00:33.110> I'd

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
think we were cooking in a pan then I'd

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.260 
think we were cooking in a pan then I'd
be<00:00:33.320> I'd<00:00:33.470> be<00:00:33.500> putting<00:00:33.739> oil<00:00:33.920> into<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.190> into<00:00:35.180> the

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
be I'd be putting oil into the into the

be I'd be putting oil into the into the
pan<00:00:35.420> yeah<00:00:35.570> I<00:00:35.690> think<00:00:35.870> you<00:00:35.930> know<00:00:36.020> as<00:00:36.380> it's<00:00:36.950> a<00:00:37.480> like

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
pan yeah I think you know as it's a like

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.319 
pan yeah I think you know as it's a like
this<00:00:38.630> I<00:00:38.870> think<00:00:38.930> so<00:00:39.760> rub<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:40.880> oil<00:00:40.910> onto<00:00:41.149> the

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.540 
this I think so rub the oil onto the
meat<00:00:41.480> it's<00:00:42.320> a<00:00:42.440> fantastic<00:00:43.010> company<00:00:43.280> and<00:00:43.460> when

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 
to go as easy as that I mean it's how it

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.390 
to go as easy as that I mean it's how it
depends<00:06:58.509> on<00:06:58.629> the<00:06:58.810> fat<00:06:59.199> quantity<00:06:59.590> of<00:06:59.680> the<00:06:59.860> ribs

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 
depends on the fat quantity of the ribs

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.070 
depends on the fat quantity of the ribs
but<00:07:00.639> yeah<00:07:00.849> if<00:07:01.030> it<00:07:01.180> dries<00:07:01.449> out<00:07:01.629> during<00:07:02.020> the

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 
but yeah if it dries out during the

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.089 
but yeah if it dries out during the
cooking<00:07:02.289> you<00:07:02.440> can<00:07:02.530> always<00:07:02.680> add<00:07:02.860> a<00:07:02.889> bit<00:07:03.069> more

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:03.099
