is it fake I grabbed a frame in the
computer<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.779> we're<00:00:22.680> out<00:00:22.800> putting<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.220> now<00:00:23.369> in

computer and we're out putting it now in
digital<00:00:23.939> format<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.960> see<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.380> we

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
digital format and you can see that we

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.060 
digital format and you can see that we
have<00:00:25.680> an<00:00:25.830> absolutely<00:00:26.460> solid<00:00:27.000> picture<00:00:28.070> done

was taken the picture and moved it over

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.660 
was taken the picture and moved it over
so<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.739> can<00:00:34.890> look<00:00:35.040> at<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> information

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
so that we can look at the information

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.130 
so that we can look at the information
that's<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.480> between<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.050> frames<00:00:37.350> now<00:00:38.960> we<00:00:39.960> look

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
that's in between the frames now we look

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.250 
that's in between the frames now we look
at<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.350> motion<00:00:40.739> video<00:00:41.070> we<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.239> see<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.960> it

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
at the motion video we can see that it

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.500 
at the motion video we can see that it
still<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.219> not<00:00:44.670> bad<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:46.670> we<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.149> little

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
still is not bad and we have this little

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.639 
still is not bad and we have this little
indicator<00:00:49.200> down<00:00:49.860> here<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.969> tells<00:00:51.239> me<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:53.000> the

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
indicator down here it tells me that the

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.830 
indicator down here it tells me that the

see the Moray patterns so there's a

see the Moray patterns so there's a

Hollywood in it in a minute no problem
this<00:04:55.050> one<00:04:55.199> has<00:04:55.350> a<00:04:55.380> much<00:04:55.620> creepier<00:04:56.010> quality

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
this one has a much creepier quality

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:02.180 
this one has a much creepier quality
than<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.139> alien<00:04:58.139> autopsy<00:04:58.680> tape<00:04:58.919> I<00:04:59.130> think<00:05:01.190> that

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
than the alien autopsy tape I think that

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.650 
than the alien autopsy tape I think that
one<00:05:02.400> that<00:05:02.760> one<00:05:02.880> I<00:05:02.910> definitely<00:05:03.270> didn't<00:05:03.539> buy

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
one that one I definitely didn't buy

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.200 
one that one I definitely didn't buy
just<00:05:03.960> because<00:05:04.020> of<00:05:04.380> the<00:05:04.470> look<00:05:04.680> of<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:06.030> way<00:05:06.150> it

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
just because of the look of the way it

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.210 
just because of the look of the way it
laid<00:05:06.419> on<00:05:06.539> the<00:05:06.630> table<00:05:06.840> there<00:05:07.229> was<00:05:07.860> a<00:05:07.889> couple<00:05:08.160> of

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
laid on the table there was a couple of

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.980 
laid on the table there was a couple of
things<00:05:08.280> this<00:05:08.669> actually<00:05:09.180> whoever<00:05:09.720> did<00:05:09.900> this

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
things this actually whoever did this

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.020 
things this actually whoever did this
was<00:05:10.169> or<00:05:10.560> if<00:05:10.710> someone<00:05:11.039> did<00:05:11.250> this<00:05:11.460> they<00:05:11.970> were

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
was or if someone did this they were

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.779 
was or if someone did this they were
very<00:05:12.210> clever<00:05:12.630> because<00:05:12.900> it<00:05:13.289> you<00:05:14.010> know<00:05:14.130> it<00:05:14.370> it

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
very clever because it you know it it

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.029 
very clever because it you know it it
hides<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.300> lot<00:05:15.330> of<00:05:15.660> stuff<00:05:15.960> so<00:05:16.289> that's<00:05:16.800> what

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
hides a lot of stuff so that's what

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.740 
hides a lot of stuff so that's what
makes<00:05:17.250> me<00:05:17.430> kind<00:05:17.669> of<00:05:17.699> disbelieve<00:05:18.270> it<00:05:18.389> a<00:05:18.449> little

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
makes me kind of disbelieve it a little

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.540 
makes me kind of disbelieve it a little
bit<00:05:19.020> but<00:05:20.180> you<00:05:21.180> know<00:05:21.240> who<00:05:21.419> knows<00:05:22.550> Criswell

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
bit but you know who knows Criswell

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.730 
bit but you know who knows Criswell
thought<00:05:23.849> the<00:05:24.030> alien<00:05:24.539> exhibited<00:05:25.110> movements

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
thought the alien exhibited movements

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.400 
thought the alien exhibited movements
that<00:05:25.889> would<00:05:26.070> be<00:05:26.220> difficult<00:05:26.490> to<00:05:26.910> fake<00:05:27.410> there

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
that would be difficult to fake there

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.050 
that would be difficult to fake there
are<00:05:28.560> moments<00:05:29.160> when<00:05:29.669> it<00:05:31.130> this<00:05:32.130> looks<00:05:32.340> very<00:05:32.729> real

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
are moments when it this looks very real

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.390 
are moments when it this looks very real
and<00:05:33.300> and<00:05:34.020> I<00:05:34.650> don't<00:05:34.830> know<00:05:34.949> how<00:05:35.160> they<00:05:35.340> did

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
and and I don't know how they did

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.980 
and and I don't know how they did
certain<00:05:36.300> little<00:05:36.330> things<00:05:36.599> about<00:05:37.169> this<00:05:38.990> so

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
certain little things about this so

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.180 
certain little things about this so
right<00:05:40.169> right<00:05:40.349> when<00:05:40.500> I<00:05:40.530> would<00:05:40.740> say<00:05:40.919> that<00:05:40.949> it's

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
right right when I would say that it's

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.490 
right right when I would say that it's
definitely<00:05:41.610> a<00:05:41.639> puppet<00:05:41.970> he<00:05:42.139> he<00:05:43.139> moves<00:05:43.380> a

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
definitely a puppet he he moves a

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.409 
definitely a puppet he he moves a
certain<00:05:43.710> way<00:05:43.800> or<00:05:43.830> he'll<00:05:44.310> or<00:05:44.520> he'll<00:05:44.760> lift<00:05:45.000> up<00:05:45.210> in

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
certain way or he'll or he'll lift up in

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:46.790 
certain way or he'll or he'll lift up in
the<00:05:45.539> frame<00:05:45.840> and<00:05:45.990> all<00:05:46.110> that<00:05:46.289> and<00:05:46.590> all<00:05:46.680> these

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
the frame and all that and all these

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.260 
the frame and all that and all these
little<00:05:46.860> things<00:05:47.070> are<00:05:47.310> important<00:05:47.760> to<00:05:47.849> the<00:05:48.000> you

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270
