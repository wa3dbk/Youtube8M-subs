00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.990 
strainer cocktail and I would choose a
double<00:02:12.740> strainer<00:02:13.010> when<00:02:13.280> there's<00:02:13.460> any<00:02:13.610> sort<00:02:13.910> of

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
double strainer when there's any sort of

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.290 
double strainer when there's any sort of
fruit<00:02:14.210> involved<00:02:14.690> because<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.410> just<00:02:15.560> helps<00:02:15.800> to

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
fruit involved because it just helps to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.300 
fruit involved because it just helps to
decrease<00:02:17.300> all<00:02:17.780> those<00:02:17.960> pulpy<00:02:18.590> bits<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:19.070> might

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
decrease all those pulpy bits that might

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.530 
decrease all those pulpy bits that might
go<00:02:19.580> in<00:02:19.700> there<00:02:19.880> in<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.180> end<00:02:21.910> fresh<00:02:22.910> ice<00:02:23.210> into

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
go in there in the end fresh ice into

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.940 
go in there in the end fresh ice into
the<00:02:23.720> glass<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:25.690> then<00:02:26.690> we'll<00:02:26.960> finish<00:02:27.320> with

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
the glass and then we'll finish with

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.060 
the glass and then we'll finish with
about<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.430> quarter<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.180> an<00:02:29.450> ounce<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.890> east

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
about a quarter of an ounce of the east

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.280 
about a quarter of an ounce of the east
lay<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.580> bow<00:02:31.910> more<00:02:32.240> right<00:02:32.570> over<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.020> top

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
lay of the bow more right over the top

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.920 
lay of the bow more right over the top
just<00:02:33.710> to<00:02:33.830> float<00:02:34.310> really<00:02:35.240> lends<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.780> nice

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
just to float really lends a nice

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.370 
just to float really lends a nice
aromatic<00:02:36.290> character<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.400> cocktail<00:02:37.850> and

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
aromatic character to the cocktail and

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.450 
aromatic character to the cocktail and
then<00:02:39.380> maybe<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.770> nice<00:02:39.950> rustic<00:02:40.610> feel<00:02:44.350> squeeze

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
then maybe a nice rustic feel squeeze

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:59.040 
then maybe a nice rustic feel squeeze
and<00:02:46.460> there<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.120> have<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.750> penicillin

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.960 

my<00:02:59.920> voice<00:03:00.490> you<00:03:01.210> didn't<00:03:01.720> know
