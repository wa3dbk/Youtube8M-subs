00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
things like

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.620 
things like

battery backpack in there you can get
spare<00:02:24.120> batteries<00:02:24.600> spare<00:02:25.470> batteries<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:25.920> this

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
spare batteries spare batteries in this

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.800 
spare batteries spare batteries in this
one<00:02:26.780> as<00:02:27.780> well<00:02:27.990> as<00:02:28.200> some<00:02:28.820> spare<00:02:29.820> charging

one as well as some spare charging
cables<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:32.100> camera<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.670> then<00:02:32.880> there's<00:02:33.090> a

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
cables the camera and then there's a

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.750 
cables the camera and then there's a
zippered<00:02:33.570> pocket<00:02:33.600> at<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.140> top<00:02:34.380> which<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.370> to

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
zippered pocket at the top which is to

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.910 
zippered pocket at the top which is to
keep<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.210> really<00:02:36.450> small<00:02:36.780> things<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.230> keep<00:02:37.470> SD

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
keep the really small things you keep SD

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.870 
keep the really small things you keep SD
cards<00:02:38.520> or<00:02:39.560> what<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.590> keep<00:02:40.890> up<00:02:41.040> here<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.520> the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
cards or what I keep up here is the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.150 
cards or what I keep up here is the
extension<00:02:42.390> arms<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.840> spare<00:02:43.620> bolts<00:02:44.070> just

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
extension arms and spare bolts just

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.670 
extension arms and spare bolts just
because<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.730> don't<00:02:44.850> like<00:02:45.300> them<00:02:45.680> bouncing

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
because I don't like them bouncing

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.290 
because I don't like them bouncing
around<00:02:46.770> inside<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.580> case<00:02:47.850> because<00:02:48.120> I'm

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
around inside the case because I'm

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.520 
around inside the case because I'm
worried<00:02:48.600> they're<00:02:48.750> going<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.930> scratch<00:02:49.200> things

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
worried they're going to scratch things

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.680 
worried they're going to scratch things
and<00:02:49.710> they<00:02:49.770> just<00:02:49.890> kind<00:02:50.070> of<00:02:50.130> are<00:02:50.790> really<00:02:51.120> hard<00:02:51.480> to

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
and they just kind of are really hard to

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.800 
and they just kind of are really hard to
keep<00:02:52.080> track<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.710> so<00:02:52.890> top<00:02:53.460> there<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.730> have<00:02:54.060> all<00:02:54.750> of

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
keep track of so top there I have all of

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.320 
keep track of so top there I have all of
my<00:02:54.990> extension<00:02:55.500> arms<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:55.980> are<00:02:56.520> my<00:02:56.670> tension

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
my extension arms and are my tension

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.580 
my extension arms and are my tension
arms<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:58.010> spare<00:02:59.010> GoPro<00:02:59.580> bolts<00:03:00.410> so<00:03:01.410> there's

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
arms and spare GoPro bolts so there's

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.970 
arms and spare GoPro bolts so there's
two<00:03:01.800> approaches<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.760> GoPro<00:03:03.330> cases<00:03:03.780> on<00:03:03.990> that<00:03:04.050> on

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
two approaches to GoPro cases on that on

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.100 
two approaches to GoPro cases on that on
the<00:03:05.160> market<00:03:05.490> right<00:03:05.610> now<00:03:05.790> there's<00:03:06.510> this

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
the market right now there's this

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.730 
the market right now there's this
approach<00:03:07.800> which<00:03:08.250> has<00:03:08.330> small<00:03:09.330> foam<00:03:10.140> dividers

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
approach which has small foam dividers

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.160 
approach which has small foam dividers
inside<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.430> case<00:03:11.640> but<00:03:12.330> apart<00:03:12.600> from<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.780> it's

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
inside the case but apart from that it's

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.870 
inside the case but apart from that it's
not<00:03:13.410> really<00:03:13.620> form-fitting<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.490> camera

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
not really form-fitting to the camera

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.850 
not really form-fitting to the camera
and<00:03:15.030> then<00:03:15.450> there's<00:03:15.600> other<00:03:15.810> cases<00:03:16.170> which<00:03:16.620> are

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
and then there's other cases which are

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.860 
and then there's other cases which are
completely<00:03:17.430> filled<00:03:17.760> with<00:03:17.970> foam<00:03:18.150> inside<00:03:18.510> and

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
completely filled with foam inside and

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.130 
completely filled with foam inside and
they<00:03:19.320> have<00:03:19.350> shaped<00:03:20.340> cutouts<00:03:20.820> cut<00:03:21.240> pacifically

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
they have shaped cutouts cut pacifically

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.930 
they have shaped cutouts cut pacifically
for<00:03:22.530> each<00:03:22.820> GoPro<00:03:23.820> camera<00:03:24.270> each<00:03:25.110> has<00:03:25.440> its

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
for each GoPro camera each has its

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.940 
for each GoPro camera each has its
positive<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.090> minuses<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:28.260> nice<00:03:28.590> thing<00:03:28.860> with

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
positive and minuses the nice thing with

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.220 
positive and minuses the nice thing with
a<00:03:29.040> case<00:03:29.250> like<00:03:29.460> this<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:30.210> that<00:03:30.270> you're<00:03:31.020> not

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
a case like this is that you're not

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.320 
a case like this is that you're not
limited<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.220> layout<00:03:32.610> that<00:03:33.120> the

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
limited to a layout that the

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.380 
limited to a layout that the
manufacturer<00:03:34.310> wanted<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.520> have<00:03:35.790> well

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
manufacturer wanted you to have well

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.970 
manufacturer wanted you to have well
these<00:03:36.750> are<00:03:36.990> Sony<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.560> you're<00:03:37.680> not<00:03:37.770> going<00:03:37.920> to

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
these are Sony and you're not going to

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.620 
these are Sony and you're not going to
move<00:03:38.070> them<00:03:38.250> around<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:39.150> have<00:03:39.300> a<00:03:39.330> little<00:03:39.510> more

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
move them around you have a little more

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.390 
move them around you have a little more
flexibility<00:03:40.140> in<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.380> kinds<00:03:40.890> of<00:03:41.010> things<00:03:41.250> you

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
flexibility in the kinds of things you

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.550 
flexibility in the kinds of things you
keep<00:03:41.550> in<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.790> case<00:03:42.030> if<00:03:42.270> you<00:03:42.750> only<00:03:42.960> have<00:03:43.290> one

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
keep in the case if you only have one

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.100 
keep in the case if you only have one
GoPro<00:03:44.010> this<00:03:44.310> pocket<00:03:44.640> isn't<00:03:45.180> only<00:03:45.900> going<00:03:46.050> to

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
GoPro this pocket isn't only going to

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.360 
GoPro this pocket isn't only going to
work<00:03:46.230> for<00:03:46.410> another<00:03:46.530> GoPro<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.100> can<00:03:47.220> keep

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
work for another GoPro you can keep

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.790 
work for another GoPro you can keep
other<00:03:47.550> accessories<00:03:48.180> in<00:03:48.300> here<00:03:48.500> handlebars<00:03:49.500> fit

other accessories in here handlebars fit

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.170 
other accessories in here handlebars fit
in<00:03:49.920> there<00:03:50.100> you<00:03:50.250> could<00:03:50.400> fit<00:03:50.520> a<00:03:50.580> suction<00:03:50.850> cup

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
in there you could fit a suction cup

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.210 
in there you could fit a suction cup
mount<00:03:51.390> in<00:03:51.600> there<00:03:51.810> probably<00:03:52.230> yeah<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.010> could

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
mount in there probably yeah you could

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.560 
mount in there probably yeah you could
totally<00:03:53.310> fit<00:03:53.580> a<00:03:53.610> suction<00:03:53.910> cup<00:03:54.060> mount<00:03:54.270> in<00:03:54.450> one

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
totally fit a suction cup mount in one

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.410 
totally fit a suction cup mount in one
of<00:03:54.660> these<00:03:54.750> pockets<00:03:55.200> so<00:03:55.730> because<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.940> pockets

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
of these pockets so because the pockets

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.250 
of these pockets so because the pockets
aren't<00:03:57.720> cut<00:03:58.140> for<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.650> certain<00:03:59.190> thing<00:03:59.850> you<00:04:00.750> have

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
aren't cut for a certain thing you have

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.730 
aren't cut for a certain thing you have
a<00:04:01.290> little<00:04:01.590> bit<00:04:01.680> more<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:02.660> adapts<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.750> your<00:04:04.410> kit

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
a little bit more it adapts to your kit

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.580 
a little bit more it adapts to your kit
better<00:04:05.190> than<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:05.730> case<00:04:06.150> which<00:04:06.420> is<00:04:06.600> specifically

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
better than a case which is specifically

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.860 
better than a case which is specifically
cut<00:04:07.860> for<00:04:08.130> each<00:04:08.370> part<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.180> fit<00:04:09.540> and<00:04:09.720> if<00:04:09.780> you

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
cut for each part to fit and if you

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.900 
cut for each part to fit and if you
don't<00:04:10.110> have<00:04:10.290> that<00:04:10.500> part<00:04:10.800> or<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.070> have<00:04:11.220> isolate

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
don't have that part or you have isolate

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.660 
don't have that part or you have isolate
different<00:04:12.300> part<00:04:12.540> you're<00:04:12.870> kind<00:04:13.440> of<00:04:14.580> out

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
of luck on being able to fit your stuff

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.300 
of luck on being able to fit your stuff
into<00:04:18.030> that<00:04:18.239> case<00:04:18.590> cases<00:04:19.590> which<00:04:19.770> have<00:04:19.980> foam

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
into that case cases which have foam

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.159 
into that case cases which have foam
cutouts<00:04:20.850> for<00:04:21.090> each<00:04:22.430> individual<00:04:23.430> part<00:04:23.880> do<00:04:24.450> tend

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
cutouts for each individual part do tend

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.770 
cutouts for each individual part do tend
to<00:04:25.410> keep<00:04:25.530> things<00:04:25.590> better<00:04:25.979> organized<00:04:26.430> because

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
to keep things better organized because

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.610 
to keep things better organized because
because<00:04:27.780> each<00:04:28.020> pocket<00:04:28.410> is

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
because each pocket is

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.800 
because each pocket is
cut<00:04:28.740> perfectly<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:29.760> can<00:04:30.030> be<00:04:30.120> exactly<00:04:30.540> the

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
cut perfectly it can be exactly the

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.210 
cut perfectly it can be exactly the
right<00:04:30.930> size<00:04:31.140> so<00:04:31.200> that<00:04:31.440> you<00:04:31.620> have<00:04:31.740> very<00:04:32.010> very

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
right size so that you have very very

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.730 
right size so that you have very very
little<00:04:32.520> movement<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.060> then<00:04:33.300> also<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:34.470> can

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
little movement and then also it can

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.110 
little movement and then also it can
provide<00:04:34.980> a<00:04:35.190> little<00:04:35.310> more<00:04:35.400> protection<00:04:35.790> because

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
provide a little more protection because

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.660 
provide a little more protection because
often<00:04:36.570> there's<00:04:36.720> a<00:04:36.780> lot<00:04:37.080> more<00:04:37.530> foam<00:04:38.040> between

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
often there's a lot more foam between

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.700 
often there's a lot more foam between
the<00:04:39.300> camera<00:04:39.690> and<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.930> edge<00:04:40.170> of<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.470> case

however<00:04:41.370> there's<00:04:41.730> a<00:04:41.790> big<00:04:42.000> drawback<00:04:42.270> and

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
however there's a big drawback and

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.500 
however there's a big drawback and
that's<00:04:42.840> that<00:04:43.050> often<00:04:43.530> those<00:04:44.340> cases<00:04:44.970> are<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.180> lot

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
that's that often those cases are a lot

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.200 
that's that often those cases are a lot

pocket of your backpack and it's not a

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.700 
pocket of your backpack and it's not a
massive<00:05:48.510> case<00:05:48.990> so<00:05:49.200> it's<00:05:49.350> not<00:05:49.470> going<00:05:49.620> to

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
massive case so it's not going to

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.380 
massive case so it's not going to
completely<00:05:50.520> dominate<00:05:50.760> whatever<00:05:51.240> you're

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
putting it into the case feels like it

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.660 
putting it into the case feels like it
has<00:05:53.760> fairly<00:05:54.300> good<00:05:54.630> build<00:05:55.050> quality<00:05:55.320> and<00:05:55.650> gopole

backs it with a lifetime warranty so if

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.870 
backs it with a lifetime warranty so if
anything<00:05:58.980> goes<00:05:59.190> wrong<00:05:59.250> with<00:05:59.580> it

anything goes wrong with it
you<00:06:00.420> know<00:06:00.660> that<00:06:00.930> you're<00:06:01.170> going<00:06:01.650> to<00:06:01.680> be<00:06:01.980> covered

this<00:06:02.880> was<00:06:03.270> my<00:06:03.420> review<00:06:03.480> of<00:06:03.780> the<00:06:04.020> gopole<00:06:04.500> venture

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280
