00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
could do this at work i could do it on

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.280 
could do this at work i could do it on
my<00:02:10.259> my<00:02:11.220> phone<00:02:11.520> for<00:02:11.910> example<00:02:12.420> whatever<00:02:13.230> I

wanted
and<00:02:14.100> there's<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.640> representation<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
and there's a representation of the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.510 
and there's a representation of the
thermostat<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.740> this<00:02:17.040> thermostat

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
thermostat and that this thermostat

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.840 
thermostat and that this thermostat
right<00:02:17.970> here<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.920> if<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.070> wanted<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.460> I

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
right here and so so if I wanted to I

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.840 
right here and so so if I wanted to I
could<00:02:21.210> take<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.310> set<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> new<00:02:23.610> target

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
could take and set a new target

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:31.040 
could take and set a new target
temperature<00:02:24.360> for<00:02:25.080> heat<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:29.600> as<00:02:30.600> soon<00:02:30.780> as<00:02:30.900> that

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
temperature for heat and as soon as that

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:40.100 
temperature for heat and as soon as that
set<00:02:32.240> 75<00:02:33.240> 76<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:39.390> now<00:02:39.570> that<00:02:39.900> should

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
set 75 76 so now that should

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.600 
set 75 76 so now that should
automatically<00:02:40.620> update<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.250> thermostat

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
automatically update that thermostat

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.460 
automatically update that thermostat
next<00:02:42.030> time<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.360> thermostat<00:02:42.690> goes<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.440> a

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
next time that thermostat goes to a

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.110 
next time that thermostat goes to a
request<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.100> cloud<00:02:44.340> server<00:02:44.640> happens

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
request to the cloud server happens

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.000 
request to the cloud server happens
about<00:02:45.270> every<00:02:45.330> one<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.810> two<00:02:45.840> minutes<00:02:46.140> then<00:02:46.800> that

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
about every one to two minutes then that

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.620 
about every one to two minutes then that
thermostat<00:02:47.370> will<00:02:47.670> receive<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.120> new<00:02:48.240> target

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
thermostat will receive the new target

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.720 
thermostat will receive the new target
temperature<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.290> then<00:02:49.770> it'll<00:02:50.220> automatically

know a new target temperature if I want

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.280 
know a new target temperature if I want
to<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:11.269> that<00:04:12.269> should<00:04:12.450> automatically<00:04:12.959> again

is and and but there's no cost to you so

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.160 
is and and but there's no cost to you so
while<00:04:29.970> radio<00:04:30.150> thermostat<00:04:30.540> is<00:04:30.630> doing<00:04:30.870> that<00:04:30.990> as

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
while radio thermostat is doing that as

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.140 
while radio thermostat is doing that as
part<00:04:31.410> of<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.740> their<00:04:32.250> financing<00:04:32.820> that<00:04:32.910> through

thermostats<00:04:43.050> as<00:04:43.200> you'd<00:04:43.320> like<00:04:43.350> once<00:04:43.770> you're

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
thermostats as you'd like once you're

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.470 
thermostats as you'd like once you're
there<00:04:44.040> so<00:04:44.280> it's<00:04:44.400> pretty<00:04:44.520> cool<00:04:44.730> stuff<00:04:44.940> I'm<00:04:45.330> just

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
there so it's pretty cool stuff I'm just

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.480 
there so it's pretty cool stuff I'm just
one<00:04:45.660> other<00:04:45.810> aspect<00:04:45.960> to<00:04:46.410> it<00:04:46.440> that<00:04:46.800> particularly

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
one other aspect to it that particularly

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.790 
one other aspect to it that particularly
interesting<00:04:47.940> to<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:48.720> engineering<00:04:49.139> crowd<00:04:49.470> of

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
interesting to the engineering crowd of

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.400 
interesting to the engineering crowd of
esc<00:04:50.160> and<00:04:50.610> that<00:04:51.090> is<00:04:51.270> hacking<00:04:51.720> your<00:04:51.840> thermostat

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
esc and that is hacking your thermostat

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.980 
esc and that is hacking your thermostat
so<00:04:52.770> these<00:04:53.700> thermostats<00:04:54.300> not<00:04:54.570> only<00:04:54.750> are

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
so these thermostats not only are

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.890 
so these thermostats not only are
posting<00:04:55.740> to<00:04:56.010> a<00:04:56.040> cloud<00:04:56.520> server<00:04:56.880> but<00:04:57.660> these

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
posting to a cloud server but these

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.830 
posting to a cloud server but these
thermostats<00:04:58.470> are<00:04:58.620> also<00:04:59.210> UK<00:05:00.210> have<00:05:00.540> a<00:05:00.570> web

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
thermostats are also UK have a web

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.600 
thermostats are also UK have a web
server<00:05:01.110> running<00:05:01.440> themselves<00:05:01.710> so<00:05:02.340> what<00:05:02.490> we've

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
server running themselves so what we've

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.830 
server running themselves so what we've
done<00:05:02.640> is<00:05:03.210> we've<00:05:03.840> taken<00:05:04.050> microchips<00:05:05.060> mmv<00:05:06.060> it's

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
done is we've taken microchips mmv it's

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.990 
done is we've taken microchips mmv it's
a<00:05:07.080> multimedia<00:05:07.830> board<00:05:08.280> that<00:05:08.910> you<00:05:08.940> see<00:05:09.300> here<00:05:09.720> and

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
a multimedia board that you see here and

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.830 
a multimedia board that you see here and
this<00:05:12.000> is<00:05:12.210> a<00:05:12.620> qvga<00:05:13.620> display<00:05:13.650> color<00:05:14.430> runs<00:05:15.419> one<00:05:15.600> on

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
this is a qvga display color runs one on

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.900 
this is a qvga display color runs one on
one<00:05:15.990> of<00:05:16.080> our<00:05:16.169> pic32<00:05:16.560> devices<00:05:17.550> which<00:05:17.700> has

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
one of our pic32 devices which has

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.409 
one of our pic32 devices which has
integrated<00:05:18.330> Ethernet<00:05:19.200> USB<00:05:19.760> 0<00:05:20.760> boards<00:05:21.150> and<00:05:21.300> so

forth and my colleague Sean he actually
wrote<00:05:25.320> an<00:05:25.530> application<00:05:26.130> for<00:05:26.340> this<00:05:26.490> where<00:05:27.090> he

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
wrote an application for this where he

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.440 
wrote an application for this where he
queries<00:05:28.320> that<00:05:28.350> thermostat<00:05:29.270> periodically<00:05:30.270> he

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
queries that thermostat periodically he

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.030 
queries that thermostat periodically he
could<00:05:30.570> query<00:05:30.750> any<00:05:31.020> of<00:05:31.169> these<00:05:31.320> thermostats

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
could query any of these thermostats

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.460 
could query any of these thermostats
that<00:05:32.250> are<00:05:32.340> local<00:05:32.669> and<00:05:32.790> does<00:05:33.450> an<00:05:33.600> HTTP<00:05:34.200> GET

that are local and does an HTTP GET

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.830 
that are local and does an HTTP GET
grabs<00:05:35.220> the<00:05:35.430> thermostat<00:05:35.940> information<00:05:36.600> and

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
grabs the thermostat information and

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.690 
grabs the thermostat information and
then<00:05:37.020> he<00:05:37.110> renders<00:05:37.500> it<00:05:37.680> in<00:05:37.860> real<00:05:38.070> time<00:05:38.100> on<00:05:38.550> this

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
then he renders it in real time on this

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.580 
then he renders it in real time on this
display<00:05:38.970> and<00:05:39.419> you<00:05:39.750> can<00:05:39.870> see<00:05:39.990> that<00:05:40.020> perfectly
