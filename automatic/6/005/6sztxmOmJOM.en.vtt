negative side of the pulse and so since

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.699 
negative side of the pulse and so since
this<00:02:47.430> is<00:02:47.490> a<00:02:47.760> negatively<00:02:48.330> controlled<00:02:48.959> solenoid

negative<00:02:59.190> poles<00:02:59.670> you<00:03:00.209> will<00:03:00.360> have<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.630> high<00:03:00.989> duty

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
negative poles you will have a high duty

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.290 
negative poles you will have a high duty
cycle<00:03:01.770> because<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.580> actual<00:03:02.820> component<00:03:03.239> is

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
cycle because the actual component is

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.420 
cycle because the actual component is
going<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.510> be<00:03:03.570> performing<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.140> lot<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.350> work<00:03:04.590> if

going to be performing a lot of work if
it<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.880> narrow<00:03:06.300> pulse<00:03:06.780> as<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.680> can<00:03:07.830> see<00:03:07.950> in

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
it is a narrow pulse as you can see in

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.270 
it is a narrow pulse as you can see in
the<00:03:08.310> middle<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.730> this<00:03:09.800> oscilloscope<00:03:10.800> diagram
