 surname are Italian is a foreigner or 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:24.110
 17 years are on youtube for more than one 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:28.430
 I think more than something more than one to me 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:32.830
 something and mine is my director 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.420
 gameplay with media game capture hd e 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.050
 game with turtle beach you also have 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.070
 saw my my connected voice are 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:47.090
 I really enjoy it here 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.059
 new series that I hope has not been seen by us 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:56.600
 which of mv ta I am a little sick of feigen 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:59.000
 play on mv two because precisely said 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.300
 before it changes but stews great 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.059
 this series consists of seven eight 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.270
 episodes always if I am granted 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.830
 obviously that I will play in the battle the 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.830
 nest that can happen or deathmatch a 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.659
 obviously two less teams or domain 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.990
 where I will play every game with 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.350
 the inter 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.810
 yes with a different sniper 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.380
 the first game that I did indeed 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.140
 it costs what you are seeing and its grace and ho 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.730
 used the intervention that is my beloved 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.740
 absolute city in any call of 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:40.900
 duty together with budget in this match 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:44.110
 and is also using perk on bonuses 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.110
 trick 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:51.140
 you can stop and command then if not 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:55.250
 mistake it's like the raid decisions 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:59.150
 ai e clear flies well daniel pablo e 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.100
 the support I was trying to make 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.660
 nuclear charge 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.720
 I explain to you one thing in these 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.970
 mode in these games is not always 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.620
 having said that I do scores by how much 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:16.010
 kill a death or 60 kills ten 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.410
 dead because with the sniper anyway 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.629
 playing against deyna boni who are gods 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.420
 fathers who do what they want 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:26.900
 or in any case they are medium-sized games from 20 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.640
 25 that the 10 dead in this match is 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.409
 a team deathmatch didn't last 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.090
 very 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:37.629
 I did a 13 6 could have been better but 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.150
 oh well it is full of brands is playing one 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:43.209
 what a monstrous boy then I lived 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.890
 explain why smv 2 mv i already had 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.310
 said before as I told you before 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.769
 stewed for various things that I'm not here at 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.410
 tell you a gameplay of 40 came out 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:57.010
 minutes I moved his mv two 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.769
 because in my opinion it is superior, however 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.150
 the two continued together 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.140
 best calls of duty that are there 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:09.579
 according to me more on two cell 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.069
 intervention that you excuse from 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.540
 shit to the msr even if it is anyway 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.319
 great weapon 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.329
 then anyway mv two as lights sounds is 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.599
 superior I do not say that he put this 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:26.019
 fact is to crap but for charity 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:30.160
 I think even if then the maps i 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:33.150
 packages map there is a ground what is eo 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.650
 john give you mind guys right away 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.510
 they only did it for entertaining 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.829
 because in my opinion they have seen that always 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.560
 more people were leaving 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.310
 so if we throw two map packages 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.239
 etc 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.630
 so who's there is then there is still his 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.450
 mv you the shotgun that is if me 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.790
 I want to use the shotgun shotgun a 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.950
 mirna secondary mom pump that can 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.049
 to succeed for example with bmw tare that is 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.340
 a primary weapon or that can happen 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.180
 one on the other side of the world 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.319
 on the other side the map with the spas neck 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.849
 following at least two he can also love it 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:12.340
 primary and from a distance I could take it 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.859
 unfortunately guys the gameplay as before 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.160
 game as the first video does not last 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:22.150
 a lot and 4 minutes 50 we are already at 10 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:25.120
