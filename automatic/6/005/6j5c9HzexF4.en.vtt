the managers asking of him and the rest
of<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> side<00:01:01.019> picked<00:01:01.319> itself<00:01:01.679> I<00:01:01.800> guess<00:01:01.979> after

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
of the side picked itself I guess after

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:03.709 
of the side picked itself I guess after
the<00:01:02.370> performance<00:01:02.640> against<00:01:03.089> Leeds<00:01:03.329> two<00:01:03.539> weeks

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the performance against Leeds two weeks

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.329 
the performance against Leeds two weeks
ago<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.199> think<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.800> I<00:01:04.830> thought<00:01:05.100> they<00:01:05.280> were

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
ago I think so I thought they were

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.010 
ago I think so I thought they were
excellent<00:01:05.790> against<00:01:06.120> Legion<00:01:06.540> all<00:01:06.660> other<00:01:06.870> were

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
excellent against Legion all other were

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.630 
excellent against Legion all other were
periods<00:01:07.470> where<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.800> came<00:01:07.980> under<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> cosh

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
periods where we came under the cosh

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.940 
periods where we came under the cosh
they<00:01:09.210> actually<00:01:09.870> defended<00:01:10.440> in<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> shape<00:01:10.920> that

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
they actually defended in the shape that

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.950 
they actually defended in the shape that
the<00:01:11.280> manager<00:01:11.670> wants<00:01:12.000> they<00:01:12.180> showed<00:01:12.930> a

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
the manager wants they showed a

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.020 
the manager wants they showed a
discipline<00:01:13.560> about<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> performance<00:01:14.310> and

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
discipline about the performance and

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.880 
discipline about the performance and
again<00:01:15.510> I<00:01:15.540> think<00:01:15.870> they've<00:01:16.290> earned<00:01:16.440> that<00:01:16.680> right

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
again I think they've earned that right

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.190 
again I think they've earned that right
