probably<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.640> most<00:01:53.790> amazing<00:01:54.240> screen<00:01:54.479> you've

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
probably the most amazing screen you've

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.020 
probably the most amazing screen you've
ever<00:01:55.020> seen<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.490> true<00:01:56.700> until<00:01:56.939> you

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
ever seen and this is true until you

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.050 
ever seen and this is true until you
start<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.390> run<00:01:57.540> into<00:01:58.159> non<00:01:59.159> retina<00:01:59.490> ready<00:01:59.790> apps

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
start to run into non retina ready apps

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.050 
start to run into non retina ready apps
and<00:02:00.329> web<00:02:00.479> pages<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.979> imagine<00:02:02.250> taking<00:02:02.610> an<00:02:02.880> image

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
and web pages so imagine taking an image

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.969 
and web pages so imagine taking an image
in<00:02:03.360> Photoshop<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:03.990> basically<00:02:04.320> stretching<00:02:04.890> it

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
in Photoshop and basically stretching it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.550 
in Photoshop and basically stretching it
to<00:02:05.159> double<00:02:05.369> its<00:02:05.700> original<00:02:06.149> size<00:02:06.469> it'll<00:02:07.469> look

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
to double its original size it'll look

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.320 
to double its original size it'll look
like<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.770> fuzzy<00:02:08.160> pile<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.520> crap<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:08.819> that's<00:02:09.179> how

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
like a fuzzy pile of crap and that's how

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.850 
like a fuzzy pile of crap and that's how
everything<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.899> isn't<00:02:10.110> retinal<00:02:10.679> ready

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
everything that isn't retinal ready

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.180 
everything that isn't retinal ready
looks<00:02:11.250> including<00:02:11.730> Photoshop<00:02:12.480> so

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
looks including Photoshop so

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.040 
looks including Photoshop so
at<00:02:13.340> one<00:02:13.610> hundred<00:02:13.760> percent<00:02:13.940> zoom<00:02:14.450> in<00:02:14.600> Photoshop

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
at one hundred percent zoom in Photoshop

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.230 
at one hundred percent zoom in Photoshop
because<00:02:15.950> everything<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.490> a<00:02:16.520> blurry<00:02:16.790> mess<00:02:17.000> you

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
because everything is a blurry mess you

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.240 
because everything is a blurry mess you
can't<00:02:17.600> even<00:02:17.960> really<00:02:18.110> work<00:02:18.380> on<00:02:18.560> anything<00:02:18.830> and

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
can't even really work on anything and

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.850 
can't even really work on anything and
someone<00:02:20.210> should<00:02:20.360> probably<00:02:20.870> bug<00:02:21.140> Adobe<00:02:21.620> about

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
someone should probably bug Adobe about

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.280

around<00:03:43.650> seven<00:03:44.129> hours<00:03:44.400> of<00:03:44.519> battery<00:03:44.790> life<00:03:45.110> with

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
around seven hours of battery life with

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.020 
around seven hours of battery life with

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.839 
wireless internet and 30 days of standby
time<00:03:48.269> with<00:03:48.989> moderate<00:03:49.439> use<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.890> got<00:03:50.129> around<00:03:50.370> five

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
time with moderate use I got around five

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.729 
time with moderate use I got around five
hours<00:03:51.329> which<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:51.659> definitely<00:03:51.870> decent<00:03:52.560> for<00:03:52.680> a

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
hours which is definitely decent for a

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.069 
hours which is definitely decent for a
laptop<00:03:52.920> like<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:53.489> it<00:03:54.180> also<00:03:54.480> runs<00:03:54.659> really

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
laptop like this it also runs really

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.530 
laptop like this it also runs really
cool<00:03:55.319> at<00:03:55.530> least<00:03:55.560> in<00:03:55.890> comparison<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:56.700> 2011

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
cool at least in comparison to the 2011

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.690 
cool at least in comparison to the 2011
microprose<00:03:58.140> which<00:03:58.799> were<00:03:58.950> basically<00:03:59.159> space

heaters<00:04:02.420> so<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.599> new<00:04:03.780> redesign<00:04:04.439> apparently

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
heaters so the new redesign apparently

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.920 
heaters so the new redesign apparently
has<00:04:05.099> a<00:04:05.340> symmetrical<00:04:05.970> blade<00:04:06.299> fans<00:04:06.569> inside

has a symmetrical blade fans inside
which<00:04:07.170> spin<00:04:07.560> at<00:04:07.709> a<00:04:07.739> certain<00:04:08.010> sound<00:04:08.370> frequency

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
which spin at a certain sound frequency

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.080 
which spin at a certain sound frequency
to<00:04:09.090> make<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.359> fan<00:04:09.540> quieter<00:04:10.109> I<00:04:10.980> can<00:04:11.879> personally

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
to make the fan quieter I can personally

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.970 
to make the fan quieter I can personally
say<00:04:12.359> that<00:04:12.690> I<00:04:12.720> have<00:04:13.079> never<00:04:13.290> heard<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.680> fence

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
but up until it got really hot so it

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.830 
but up until it got really hot so it

top-of-the-line<00:05:35.820> 15<00:05:36.570> inch<00:05:36.750> version<00:05:36.960> because

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
top-of-the-line 15 inch version because

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.779 
top-of-the-line 15 inch version because
they<00:05:37.560> wanted<00:05:37.830> to<00:05:37.889> draw<00:05:38.220> in<00:05:38.430> a<00:05:38.520> crowd<00:05:38.550> that

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
they wanted to draw in a crowd that

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.550 
they wanted to draw in a crowd that
would<00:05:39.150> create<00:05:39.389> that<00:05:39.720> high<00:05:39.930> resolution

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
would create that high resolution

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.950 
would create that high resolution
content<00:05:41.039> to<00:05:41.159> begin<00:05:41.430> with<00:05:41.610> so<00:05:42.240> if<00:05:42.479> you<00:05:42.630> aren't<00:05:42.900> a

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
content to begin with so if you aren't a

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.719 
content to begin with so if you aren't a
developer<00:05:43.469> i<00:05:43.500> would<00:05:43.889> say<00:05:44.099> hold<00:05:44.370> off<00:05:44.520> for<00:05:44.550> now

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
developer i would say hold off for now

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.700 
developer i would say hold off for now
because<00:05:45.210> if<00:05:45.599> you<00:05:45.779> aren't<00:05:46.020> doing<00:05:46.050> retina<00:05:46.560> work

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
because if you aren't doing retina work

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.740 
because if you aren't doing retina work
on<00:05:46.919> it<00:05:47.039> you<00:05:47.279> won't<00:05:47.460> find<00:05:47.729> much<00:05:47.969> benefit<00:05:48.510> in

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
on it you won't find much benefit in

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.240 
on it you won't find much benefit in
