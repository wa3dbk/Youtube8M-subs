 she gave an evolution from 2012 to 2013 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:53.140
 she is much older and we have colleagues there 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.670
 which comes from north to south and we find ourselves 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:02.620
 here is very interesting this one 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:04.900
 cultural exchange as soon as I could 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.570
 realize that there is enough new company 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.100
 it's well full also nice has 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.410
 Pretty new thing in the booths 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.690
 workshops are taking place in 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.090
 moments is very important for us is 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.820
 very precious tips is not because 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.040
 they open wide in the minds of 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.040
 photographers and participants 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.750
 and today it is very easy to buy a 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.909
 camera is very easy to become a photographer 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.180
 I think this thing about you being the 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.549
 only have a signature and every time 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.990
 invest in it more and I think this is 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.990
 the way to the market 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:30.740
 I want what is the truth is 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.110
 I got four already running without 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.360
 incidents 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.270
 I thought I would leave the 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.270
 corinthians for the mother to beat more 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.700
 I spoke to bullying but it is only strong. 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.980
 my dream is nick diaz and brian ching hai 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.980
 now turn it over 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.730
 He charged me, it was actually mine. 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.740
 record company 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.910
 we work together for a long time 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:15.180
 already sat down we selected the albums three 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.970
 of these three we selected one and together 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.920
 bringing the small modifications but I 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.390
 I think it's the simplicity of my 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.230
 photos along with the simplicity of 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.210
 diagram that had this simplicity 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.840
 There was something else that touched my heart. 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.840
 his 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.580
 This we have to think about every day, right? 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.379
 Every day you have to think what we 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.650
 can do it again because we can 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.650
 improve 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.960
 Hello
