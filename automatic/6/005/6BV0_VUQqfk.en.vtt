00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.599
 version 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.080
 Although it is not much with the new 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.880
 minecraft version comes up but 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.439
 nevertheless , especially the people will be 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.939
 happy to live in sweden and 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.650
 use minecraft 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.210
 A big part will be out of you now 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.550
 surely ask what is minecraft 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.740
 ruins minecraft williams is a 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.689
 server system of mojang way similar 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.160
 how a world is working you have 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.750
 minecraft williams then activates 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.670
 appears in your minecraft menu 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.440
 new button here it is now possible 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.579
 to host worlds and other players 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.829
 to invite it 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.390
 Basically it is a server of 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.070
 easily create in minecraft 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.840
 and is hosted by mojang 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.610
 but as tempting as the first 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.110
 Unfortunately, it does not seem that moment 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.950
 You also have to have this server 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.719
 pay 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.730
 how many exactly that is only 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.800
 the beta tester in sweden known 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.930
 in the near future, my head should be dreams 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.699
 however, be made available worldwide 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.590
 the actual update to the version 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.969
 is now, however, that as in 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.129
 an official youtube clip from 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.570

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.820
 Welten can host 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.010
 another change of version 1.7 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.810
 point 5 is also that the server 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.130
 Software has received improvements and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.170

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.299
 edited 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.700
 it will be one before the 1.8 release 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.409
 minecraft version 1.7 point 6 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.420
 in the then the new already in the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.549
 current snapshots implemented 3d 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.560

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.729
 a feature which many of you 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.680
 it should be that she is then 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.990
 most likely yours too 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.030
 Names in minecraft could change like and 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.530
 if that works exactly that is 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.549
 but not yet officially known 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.649
 been given 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.540
 So that was basically the reason to say it 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.549
 We are changes now we are 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.950
