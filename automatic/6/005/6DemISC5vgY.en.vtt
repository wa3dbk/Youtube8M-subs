00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.410
 we're back with one more engine to 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.010
 seven flights and attending my first 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.309
 video on the noise on the 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.529
 cut so many comments and 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.960
 talked about the partnership with noise like this 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.539
 there are two types of noise that 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.800
 The noise is of the command of Paul Avenue 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.890
 that's the noise 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.660
 now this case here is a personal Celtic 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.029
 of each one will sell his day 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.689
 is the almost same motor of the cut is flex 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.000
 power 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.750
 We've already removed the cover here from 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.239
 return 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.870
 the control is in perfect condition and has 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.940
 a woodpecker and within the metal to the beaten 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.340
 in the head and if paulo then it stays there 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.129
 in until found that is so or 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.710
 by accessing the game to see what 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.199
 that the noise there that it pricks that 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:58.969
 have to be so Mexico goes with the money and 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.969
 Look there too. 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.650
 so take and publish a meta- truck and 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.650
 a computer 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.210
 after the step beating in. 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:33.909
 There you can call and it looks nice there. 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.909
 me in there 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.509
 So you 're taking too long today, you can call the 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.270
 car 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.750
 failure can bind a good management not 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:51.009
 So it's there and if that noise is the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:55.270
 Typical type of pine piston skirt of 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.549
 piston to the site that has shape caused 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.069
 a boil in the engine and all that noise 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.020
 then you will have to have replaced the 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.789
 the piston and get lost that it's no longer worth 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.479
 nothing else has to play the four are 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.799
 replace and check the shirts 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.890
 To see how the shirt is, too. 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:15.220
 beauty then this noise is typical of 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.230
 piston or exits with personnel speaking to the 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.540
 confuses with rival command 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.420
 then this was the most recent of a 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.420
 series until the next with the supporter
