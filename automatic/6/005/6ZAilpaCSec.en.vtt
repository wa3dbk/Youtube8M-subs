00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.940
 comparative focus against more gives to what 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.570
 throughout our ten years of auto show 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.820
 tv we have made more than 1,700 tests 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.540
 of handling of all kinds and this time 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.060
 we show you the ford focus 2012 which 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.480
 we have been testing it for 45,000 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.369
 kilometers and has left us pleasantly 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.680
 surprised and this time we have 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.830
 confronted others were successful the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.250
 market the mazda3 of which the brand has 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.500
 placed more than 50,000 units if you're 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.329
 thinking about buying a sedan these are 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.750
 two good options with styles 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.750
 completely different on the one hand 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.550
 the ford focus with a european design 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.920
 Manufactured in Michigan has lines 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.170
 daring and dynamic undoubtedly more 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.989
 oriented to compete with Europeans as 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.300
 the jet to its quality is extraordinary 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.000
 without a doubt one of the best cars that 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.859
 Ford offers its chassis on the market today 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.469
 It is rigid and the suspension is 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.899
 fairly firm and very comfortable 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.899
 for the bad roads of mexico 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.010
 in the other corner is the mazda3 a 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.200
 car that has been well accepted in mexico 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.870
 for its combination of sportsmanship and 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.330
 comfort your gearbox does it 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.760
 very fun to drive and its suspension 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.760
 a little more firm makes it very dynamic 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.430
 In the style of your Samsung your design is 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.920
 Japanese but not so wild the others da 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.480
 the opposite that toyota also thought 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.480
 in those on the other side of the world 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.090
 your interiors also to your style 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.610
 They show very dynamic boards and well 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.560
 achieved in materials and assemblies and 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.170
 over time neither of the two 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.940
 it showed noises inside though 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.250
 the focus has the system of 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.680
 hands-free commands which is very 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.280
 comfortable to handle and meanwhile the 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.320
 Mazda is accessible to the driver in the 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.660
 acceleration test both stressed 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.120
 for its gearbox because although 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.030
 automatic the box does not subtract torque 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.970
 and accelerate from 0 to 100 in 8 points 9 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.540
 seconds at 2200 meters above the level 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.540
 from sea
