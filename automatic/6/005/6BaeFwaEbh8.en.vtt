our new members Bowser jr. here and it
is<00:02:32.400> kind<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.700> funny<00:02:32.880> actually

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
is kind of funny actually

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.500 
is kind of funny actually
I<00:02:33.660> wasn't<00:02:34.260> sure<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:35.010> which<00:02:35.610> type<00:02:35.940> of<00:02:35.970> case<00:02:36.300> I

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
I wasn't sure on which type of case I

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.930 
I wasn't sure on which type of case I
wanted<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.020> could<00:02:37.380> either<00:02:37.650> get<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.100> with<00:02:38.670> a

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
wanted I could either get it with a

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.350 
wanted I could either get it with a
plain<00:02:39.690> background<00:02:40.020> in<00:02:40.440> back<00:02:40.740> or<00:02:41.220> reflective<00:02:42.150> I

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
plain background in back or reflective I

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.320 
plain background in back or reflective I
do<00:02:42.720> think<00:02:43.050> reflective<00:02:43.620> looks<00:02:43.860> better<00:02:44.180> for<00:02:45.180> the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
do think reflective looks better for the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.760 
do think reflective looks better for the
figures<00:02:45.630> themselves<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:46.290> think<00:02:46.470> it's<00:02:46.590> great

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
figures themselves I think it's great

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.770 
figures themselves I think it's great
being<00:02:47.010> able<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.280> look<00:02:47.430> at<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.730> front<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.180> back

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
being able to look at the front and back

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.720 
being able to look at the front and back
of<00:02:49.080> figures<00:02:49.470> as<00:02:49.680> you're<00:02:49.890> going<00:02:50.070> across<00:02:50.190> like

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
of figures as you're going across like

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.120 
of figures as you're going across like
this<00:02:51.150> if<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.750> do<00:02:51.870> an<00:02:51.960> angle<00:02:52.200> shot<00:02:52.410> but<00:02:52.830> if<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:52.980> look

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
this if I do an angle shot but if I look

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.230

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
semi familiar order at the moment but it

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.040

character is duck hunt not hunt dog

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.790 
character is duck hunt not hunt dog
because<00:04:40.879> it<00:04:41.879> includes<00:04:42.689> you<00:04:43.020> this<00:04:43.409> is<00:04:43.530> a<00:04:43.560> weird

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
because it includes you this is a weird

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.890 
because it includes you this is a weird
semantics<00:04:44.520> thing<00:04:44.759> so<00:04:45.000> duck<00:04:45.330> hunt<00:04:45.569> the

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
semantics thing so duck hunt the

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.300 
semantics thing so duck hunt the
character<00:04:46.409> has<00:04:47.219> you<00:04:48.169> firing<00:04:49.169> like<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.800> zapper

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
character has you firing like the zapper

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.929 
character has you firing like the zapper
at<00:04:50.759> different<00:04:51.750> objects<00:04:52.289> that<00:04:52.680> duck<00:04:53.460> hunt<00:04:53.699> has

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:53.939 
at different objects that duck hunt has

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:57.649 
at different objects that duck hunt has
so<00:04:54.539> it's<00:04:54.659> actually<00:04:54.889> the<00:04:55.889> duck<00:04:56.099> hunt<00:04:56.250> dog<00:04:56.659> the

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
so it's actually the duck hunt dog the

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:01.189 
so it's actually the duck hunt dog the
duck<00:04:57.930> and<00:04:59.030> youth<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.060> player<00:05:00.780> with<00:05:01.169> the

midnight I was like not even 10 yet but

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.899 
midnight I was like not even 10 yet but
it's<00:05:54.599> also<00:05:54.750> a<00:05:54.900> secret<00:05:55.589> mission<00:05:55.770> was<00:05:56.400> all<00:05:56.610> we

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:56.909 
it's also a secret mission was all we

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:58.909 
it's also a secret mission was all we
were<00:05:57.180> gonna<00:05:57.419> get<00:05:57.690> ice<00:05:57.900> cream<00:05:58.289> because<00:05:58.589> it's

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
were gonna get ice cream because it's

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.309 
were gonna get ice cream because it's
light<00:05:59.129> and<00:06:00.060> that's<00:06:00.240> not<00:06:00.479> actually<00:06:00.690> a<00:06:01.080> good

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
light and that's not actually a good

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.559 
light and that's not actually a good
reason<00:06:01.680> but<00:06:01.800> for<00:06:01.860> me<00:06:02.159> it<00:06:02.490> is<00:06:02.699> because<00:06:03.240> I've

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:03.569 
reason but for me it is because I've

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:07.550 
reason but for me it is because I've
been<00:06:03.750> pretty<00:06:04.199> active<00:06:04.560> lately<00:06:06.259> exercising<00:06:07.259> so
