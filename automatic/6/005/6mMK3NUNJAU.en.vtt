for our purposes in this video I'd like

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.460 
for our purposes in this video I'd like
to<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:08.130> compare<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> Atkins<00:01:09.119> diet<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.689> the

to just compare the Atkins diet and the
Ornish<00:01:10.860> diet<00:01:10.890> because<00:01:11.460> they<00:01:11.610> represent<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
Ornish diet because they represent the

Ornish diet because they represent the

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
calories from fat as opposed to a much

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.710 
calories from fat as opposed to a much
significant<00:01:20.549> reduction<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.090> carbohydrates

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
significant reduction of carbohydrates

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.230 
significant reduction of carbohydrates
down<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.960> 34%<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.890> that's<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:23.759> exactly

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
down to 34% and that's just exactly

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.999 
down to 34% and that's just exactly
opposite<00:01:24.689> pretty<00:01:24.960> much<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.350> what<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> Ornish

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
opposite pretty much of what the Ornish

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.370 
opposite pretty much of what the Ornish
plan<00:01:26.280> recommends<00:01:26.880> as<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.630> will<00:01:27.810> recall<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
plan recommends as you will recall the

plan recommends as you will recall the
Ornish<00:01:28.860> diet<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.430> one<00:01:29.700> that's<00:01:29.850> low<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.240> fat<00:01:30.600> and

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
Ornish diet is one that's low in fat and

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.530 
Ornish diet is one that's low in fat and
high<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.619> carbs<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.759> let's<00:01:32.970> compare<00:01:33.390> the
