00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.360
 we all have found mutants even later in the situation that 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.609
 we have to move a very large file 

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:13.039
 a file that exceeds in capacity storage systems or those that 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.779
 we have and we have to move urgently right at the moment minus 70 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.300
 indicated is to say a Sunday night a World Cup at night in which 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.409
 we do not have maybe we have it from you and we have to have only what 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:30.150
 we have around us in this case and many users have 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.760
 of various garments several usbs memories 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.310
 several photo cards e me for camera photography for example 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.160
 i many dead have the fuel electors be card director 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.080
 what are we going to do to move that file that we have to move or have 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.270
 that he transported unfailingly at that moment 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.530
 and that far exceeds the layers of high storage capacity 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.940
 of which we have 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.530
 so what are we going to do is going to be 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.650
 a pisco set with all those units 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.680
 what we have 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.949
 and then percent have enough capacity to move that 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.670
 was filed on this occasion and as you can see in the photo in Moscow fear 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.280
 a small java 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.080
 that has a card reader 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.130
 two central d 1 gb capacity and a couple of cards that we can connect 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.610
 now our computer 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.170
 tell us what happens 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.100
 you see the desktop will appear 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.370
 four discs 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.610
 2. 3 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.610
 and with the fourth will appear 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.360
 concluded we are going to do good because in reality we are going to do this 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.870
 com the lace of discs for that already discs 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.289
 is found in 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.030
 ap utilities 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.030
 utility and disks 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.520
 they will disappear here 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.520
 as you will see all the units with which we are going to work 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.709
 we will select first the unit with greater capacity in this case 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.140
 bashir is 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.450
 and we will go alak 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.350
 we will give a title to Brazil 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.420
 a group root percent and we'll call it for example 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:11.709
 its power 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.509
 his father transports 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.699
 the volume format as it is going to be a large format and its disk size 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:19.899
 very small that is going to be 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:23.119
 - of 4 gigas the backrest was classified in your home 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:24.889
 Eden 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:26.349
 the 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.650
 frames plus 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.020
 if you are going to go to a computer with access to go with a computer with peter we will do 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.819
 what waiters 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.669
 this case jorge marcos plus 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:38.169
 it will be a set of concatenated disks 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:40.499
 the next step will be to create 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:44.779
 a super transport radio group that will be a set of concatenated discs 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.779
 then we just have to drag 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:52.589
 different discs 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:59.029
 once we have the 4 dragged just have to give 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.569
 to create will not be notified that all data will be deleted 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.579
 of those discs 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.279
 ixo we do not have to give 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:12.519
 operatively my intention the disk utility will be able to work and will create a 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.849
 single disc 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.849
 with the sum of the sizes 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.729
 all the capabilities of those usbs cards and memories 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:23.809
 to which you have to discount the space you reserve 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:26.369
 for the file system 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:29.259
 you will need to save the corresponding references to the 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:30.549
 files that keep 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.650
 once we say percent mac os x this option has finished in our 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.650
 desktop will appear our new disk 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:42.799
 a capacity that will be the sum of all those devices 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.260
 in these moments is preparing you already we have here 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.340
 a steak a capacity of conoco hand to 4 gigas what will be what is the 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.029
 capacity that we will have 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:59.319
 what do we do now to separate this reality in having again the 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.349
 four bolocco cards its simple we just have to select 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:08.169
 the elements and say that it does not erase and choose the type to erase 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:14.690
 what we want was going to be for a hundred is the asad or will be frames plus we belong 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.370
 we just have to want to erase 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.599
 and thematically 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:18.419
 will erase 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.840
 and we recover one by one 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.199
 all the unitys 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.129
 we want is quoting 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:30.129
 with this case wide shoulders farc 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:32.890
 to create 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.539
 our little rayÃ¡n 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.379
 kerpo we should be able to transport it in one piece just to be able to move 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:45.029
 that file so big and so important that we have to move and that thing was 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:48.330
 in the eighth minute we have realized that we do not have not gone 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.550
 large enough 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.159
 to transport 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:54.240
 and exterminating oct 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.870
 and now we pay 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.990
 / the last fragment 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.990
 of the roots group 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.499
 and we can see that we already have here 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:08.089
 d of these 4 discs again
