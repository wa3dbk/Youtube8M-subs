basically<00:02:14.250> search<00:02:14.930> service<00:02:15.930> if<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.410> don't

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
basically search service if you don't

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.809

want<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.040> do<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:18.660> use<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.319> blender<00:02:19.819> to

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
want to do that to use the blender to

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.290

really blend everything up really nicely
then<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.660> suggest<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.440> definitely<00:02:25.709> slice

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
then I suggest that you definitely slice

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:34.220 
then I suggest that you definitely slice
and<00:02:26.910> shred<00:02:27.300> everything<00:02:27.930> very<00:02:28.769> fine<00:02:33.110> so<00:02:34.110> I'm

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
and shred everything very fine so I'm

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.949 
and shred everything very fine so I'm
just<00:02:34.440> going<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.680> go<00:02:34.830> ahead<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.280> give<00:02:35.489> this<00:02:35.519> a

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
just going to go ahead and give this a

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.610 
just going to go ahead and give this a
stir<00:02:36.959> for<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.470> few<00:02:38.010> more<00:02:38.760> seconds<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:40.019> then

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
stir for a few more seconds and then

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.789
