00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.759
 not again 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.240
 today goes 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.240
 who have 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.059
 young blackbird have seen the last time 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.959
 in the harbor wire fence in the hedge 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.959
 neighbors lived 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.330
 around strawberries 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.330
 and fear and is 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.890
 everything 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.099
 but of course they also go 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.099
 the strawberries but there they can 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.720
 it's about the 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.720
 Moth in the apple tree 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:48.250
 actually think penultimate year to 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:50.620
 had the first time they fall to learn 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.990
 Last year it was done again 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.510
 less today this year is now 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.800
 but even less, but me 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.800
 try to make 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.660
 the easiest method you can get all 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.400
 do not attach anyway 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.660
 but again at the top in 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.920
 the tip where you just not turn 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.610
 but that is not true 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.530
 dramatic 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.610
 the tree does not jump 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.000
 but have as long as it is not so much taking 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.000
 I would like 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:44.940
 you can recognize feathers and behind them 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.950
 a bloody birdie of 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.900
 Chainlink fence was probably then 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.900
 after all, their fans are protected 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.750
 already exist 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:21.730
 that's what the fisherman looks like 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.040
 there are that's not particularly tasty 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.430
 I do not know if you recognize now 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.140
 can 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:34.209
 one shot is the other 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:36.220
 problems that is yet 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.050
 much less than last year and 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.580
 maybe by regular destruction 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.580
 At least that's what it takes 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.720
 not so that the laying of the apple tree 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.670
 with huge damage would take the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.820
 eat the apples so the apples there 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.970
 not the leaves and they actually 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.850
 Maybe he loses a bit 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.780
 but he wants it off so hard it is 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.780
 not but I do not do it 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.500
 it is something not to grasp which 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.349
 A blackbird fly away 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.180
 then you could hate her again thinking 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:42.219
 here at the strawberries looks suspicious 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:49.060
 off and it starts here 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:51.469
 the first clicked on green strawberry 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.500
 now does not come over now I'm in 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:59.180
 moment no fortunately because here comes 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.980
 always will already could namely 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.799
 always such a secure network does that 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.909
 belongs only once but becomes something 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:11.569
 really great and stable 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:14.719
 And still small machines big mesh 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.310
 the state of currants are you 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.930
 it can also pity it has 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.940
 Of course not the ideal shape because of me 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.349
 I do not want to cut that up either 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.389
 in front of the white so up here the 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:28.310
 white ones are here 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:31.870
 I think little ones are there to go anyway 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.870
 I do not hope so 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:42.660
 he long and narrow 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.660
 Well, that works 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:09.559
 I can not feel light just now 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:12.429
 break I would not be a 

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.429
 very good network 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:27.170
 just been out there purely flown through 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.170
 network out and 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:48.789
 one can only hope for here 

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:50.500
 everything full right through the hardworking 

00:07:48.789 --> 00:07:53.220
 The wet people are great on the 

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.220
 huts say 

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:57.380
 to be there
