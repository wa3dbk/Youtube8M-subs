35<00:01:48.329> degrees<00:01:48.750> which<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.110> normal<00:01:49.500> enough<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:52.110> I

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
35 degrees which is normal enough and I

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.320 
35 degrees which is normal enough and I
kept<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.649> device<00:01:52.979> aside<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.670> around<00:01:53.850> 10<00:01:54.179> to
