some people were catching up to him but
i<00:02:35.850> definitely<00:02:36.090> think<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.480> was<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.020> know

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
right here I just definitely think it

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.320 
right here I just definitely think it
was<00:02:40.560> because<00:02:40.710> he<00:02:41.010> was<00:02:41.100> behind<00:02:41.460> players<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:41.970> I

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
was because he was behind players and I

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.790 
was because he was behind players and I
players<00:02:42.600> with<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.780> little<00:02:42.990> little<00:02:43.410> bit<00:02:43.590> slower

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
paced especially the defenders I played
