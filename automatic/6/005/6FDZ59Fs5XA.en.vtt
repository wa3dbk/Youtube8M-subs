00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
opening game you know so I think we know

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.040 
opening game you know so I think we know
it's<00:00:38.700> important<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.270> get<00:00:39.360> off<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> good

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
it's important to get off to a good

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.350 
it's important to get off to a good
start<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.770> think<00:00:41.340> we're<00:00:41.520> also<00:00:41.640> smart<00:00:42.090> enough<00:00:42.149> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
start I think we're also smart enough to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.740 
start I think we're also smart enough to
know<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.540> it's<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.110> long<00:00:43.320> season<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.750> points

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
know that it's a long season and points

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.750 
know that it's a long season and points
are<00:00:45.870> important<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:47.160> not<00:00:47.340> going<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
are important but it's not going to the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.850 
are important but it's not going to the
end<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.059> world<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:49.110> doesn't<00:00:49.500> work<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.829> way

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
end of the world it doesn't work the way

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.069 
end of the world it doesn't work the way
we<00:00:49.980> want<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.670> think<00:00:50.969> we're<00:00:51.539> stressing<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
we want but I think we're stressing the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.229 
we want but I think we're stressing the
importance<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.710> really<00:00:53.460> trying<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.820> take<00:00:54.030> care

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
importance of really trying to take care

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.850 
importance of really trying to take care
of<00:00:54.300> things<00:00:54.420> at<00:00:54.629> home<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:55.079> know<00:00:55.110> get<00:00:55.469> points

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
out of our home game so I think it would

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.619 
out of our home game so I think it would
be<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:58.160> really<00:00:59.160> great<00:00:59.670> opportunity<00:00:59.789> for<00:01:00.390> us<00:01:00.570> to

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.850 
but it's just something where everyone
needs<00:01:48.970> to<00:01:49.030> be<00:01:49.150> on<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.390> same<00:01:49.600> page<00:01:49.630> I<00:01:50.320> think

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
needs to be on the same page I think

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.469 
needs to be on the same page I think
they're<00:01:51.010> a<00:01:51.040> very<00:01:51.280> good<00:01:51.400> possession<00:01:51.880> oriented

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
they're a very good possession oriented

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.030 
they're a very good possession oriented
team<00:01:52.660> I<00:01:52.720> thought<00:01:52.990> them<00:01:53.200> Kansas<00:01:53.680> City<00:01:53.890> in

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
team I thought them Kansas City in

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.370 
team I thought them Kansas City in
Seattle<00:01:54.460> with<00:01:54.580> three<00:01:54.910> best<00:01:55.150> teams<00:01:55.390> in<00:01:55.600> terms

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
Seattle with three best teams in terms

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.859 
Seattle with three best teams in terms
of<00:01:56.560> possessing<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:57.430> ball<00:01:57.670> last<00:01:57.880> year<00:01:58.060> so<00:01:58.360> we

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
of possessing the ball last year so we

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.300 
of possessing the ball last year so we
want<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.200> really<00:01:59.350> try<00:01:59.619> to<00:01:59.650> disrupt<00:02:00.009> that

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
want to really try to disrupt that

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.480 
want to really try to disrupt that
better<00:02:00.640> possession<00:02:01.210> a<00:02:01.330> little<00:02:01.570> bit<00:02:01.750> and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
better possession a little bit and

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.320 
better possession a little bit and
pressing<00:02:03.490> some<00:02:03.670> different<00:02:03.970> parts<00:02:04.180> of<00:02:04.270> the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
pressing some different parts of the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.790 
pressing some different parts of the
field<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:04.810> don't<00:02:05.020> really<00:02:05.320> let<00:02:05.500> them<00:02:05.650> get<00:02:05.740> a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
field that don't really let them get a

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.310 
field that don't really let them get a
foothold<00:02:06.160> of<00:02:06.690> controlling<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.780> tempo<00:02:08.110> of<00:02:08.259> the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
foothold of controlling the tempo of the

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.620 
foothold of controlling the tempo of the
game<00:02:08.350> I<00:02:08.740> think<00:02:08.950> that's<00:02:09.100> a<00:02:09.190> big<00:02:09.369> key<00:02:09.610> but<00:02:09.940> it's<00:02:10.540> a

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
game I think that's a big key but it's a

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.390 
game I think that's a big key but it's a
very<00:02:10.660> good<00:02:11.080> team<00:02:11.260> obviously<00:02:11.709> a<00:02:11.770> playoff<00:02:12.160> team

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
very good team obviously a playoff team

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.850 
very good team obviously a playoff team
last<00:02:12.640> year<00:02:12.850> I<00:02:13.270> think<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.959> key<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.470> not<00:02:14.650> let

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
last year I think the key is to not let

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.309 
last year I think the key is to not let
them<00:02:15.100> establish<00:02:15.670> their<00:02:15.910> with

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
them establish their with

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.250 
them establish their with
composed<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.219> will<00:02:17.780> from<00:02:18.780> last<00:02:19.019> year<00:02:19.230> I

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
composed it will from last year I

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.319 
composed it will from last year I
remember<00:02:19.530> their<00:02:19.950> back<00:02:20.189> line<00:02:20.400> being<00:02:20.790> really

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
remember their back line being really

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.809 
remember their back line being really
good<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:22.260> their<00:02:22.920> keeper<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.400> really<00:02:23.639> good

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
good and their keeper is really good

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.059 
good and their keeper is really good
she's<00:02:24.299> on<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.569> full<00:02:24.719> team<00:02:24.930> as<00:02:25.230> well<00:02:25.409> and<00:02:25.739> so

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
for me it's always a challenge playing

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.649
