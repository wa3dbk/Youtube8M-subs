00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.000
Jacky: Alright, let's move to the next issue 'H project'. 
Dont' know it will be a 'paradise' island or not.

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:12.000
This movie went to shoot at Hiroshi island (wrong one, 
actually it is Hashima) where it'd been struck by Tsunami.

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:16.000
And now it's been abandoned but the shooting crews went there. 
There was a press conf of it yesterday.

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:20.000
Host 1:  Is it a Thai movie?
Jacky:  Yes, it's Thai. Thai full name is Mai Chuae Tong Lob Lue 
(= Don't believe, yet disrespectful)

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.000
Host 1&amp;2:  Oh..Mai Chuae Tong Lob Lue.

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:24.000
Jacky:  The story is about...let's show the clip together.

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:32.000
The story is about a teenager group that went there. 
This group included Saipan, Mike, Aom, Jessy and Alex.

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:36.000
Host 1:  Mike and Aom have played movie and drama 
together so often these days.

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:46.000
Jacky:  Right. Mike said they had been to Japan for 10 days shooting. 
Then went to Korea for 20 days. Lot of fanclubs were joined in the press conf.

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:53.000
Yesterday a lot of Chinese 'handsome girl' FCs went there 
to meet Aom. They also followed my social media.

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:59.000
So we interviewed Aom for updating news of her works, 
her news with the director 'Bas'.

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:06.000
And the most important news everyone will 'fin' with, 
she said she will have a new film project with Tina.

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:15.000
Host 2:  Oh..many said they are Khu Jin.
Host 1: Yesterday Tina's new movie, Love Sud Jin Fin Sugoi, 
was started for the first day. She looks so nice and very handsome.

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:22.000
Jacky:  Aom said they've known each other news. 
Yesterday Tina was also at Siam, right?
Host 1:  Hmm...shooting a film.

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:28.000
Jacky:  They are 'lovely' friends. Oh..I'm look like a student.

00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:42.000
Host 1:  How about Mike D Angelo after he changed his name?
Jacky:  Still the same. Anyway, please keep support him.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:50.000
Btw, I like what Aom said that she played with my daughter in Full House. Who?
Host 2:  Nest
Jacky:  Nest!! Yes, she talked about her a lot.

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:53.000
Host 1:  Nest is so funny
Jacky:  Yes.
Host 2:  She is cute.

00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:58.000
Jacky:  Right, just keep support them then. 
Let's move to see Mike and Aom.

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:04.000
Aom:  It's my first project to work with M39 (Film company). 
This is quite a big project.

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:12.000
Because we got a chance to shoot in the difficult place 
to access. Now it becomes the world heritage.

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:16.000
Jacky:  Is it kind of 'Paradise Island'?
Aom:  It is a ghost island instead.

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:26.000
Jacky:  [chuckle] I heard that the shooting of the ruins building scene looks so real.
Aom:  Yes, indeed, when we went there. The island has been abandoned for 50-60 years.

00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:33.000
But there are those daily life stuffs in every rooms. I feel like 
they are still there and packed for moving out like we usually do.

00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:40.000
Their leaving looks so abruptly. You can see many thing, 
even the cooked rice in a cooking rice!

00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:47.000
Jacky:  You believe they were still there and still shot those scenes.
Aom:  Right, we shot with many difficulties.

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:50.000
Jacky:  I heard Piratch (Mike's first name) got sleep paralysis afterward. 
Aom:  Yes.

00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:56.000
Jacky:  Did you? 
Aom:  No, I didn't. Apinya, Piratch and Alex got sleep paralysis.

00:02:56.001 --> 00:03:02.000
Jacky:  You are very strong minded person
Aom:  Yes, I am. Kind of playing blurred to the spirits.

00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:05.000
Jacky: [laughing] Or actually she was too sleepy. Sleep all the time.
Aom:  Right

00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:08.000
Jacky:  You work very hard and travel around a lot with Piratch. 
Japan. Korea.

00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:18.000
Aom:  Yes, you are right. Meet him every day. After He and I 
went back from Japan, we went to Korea for 20 days.

00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:24.000
Jacky:  20 days. Since you traveled around, what do your FC said?

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:27.000
Aom:  They said they miss me, please stay in Thailand more.

00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:38.000
Jacky:  You've a lot of works in other countries.
Aom:  I think it is co-incindent that my new film or series 
have to shoot in foreign countries.

00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:41.000
Jacky:  So your schedule is quite busy.
Aom:  Yep, quite busy.

00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:46.000
Jacky:  Tina is missing you. She also has her new film.
Aom:  Yes, she was shot yesterday.

00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:48.000
Jacky:  At Siam.
Aom:  Really?

00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:52.000
Love Sud Jin, she also works with Apinya. Like we replace.

00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:55.000
Jacky:  With the same co-worker
Aom:  Right.

00:03:55.001 --> 00:04:00.000
Jacky:  Will you get any chance to work with Tina again?
Aom:  Certainly...Hmmmm....I tell this for the first time!!

00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:04.000
Jacky:  Really!? And what kind of works? YoN 3 or YoN 4?
Aom:  It's a secret, but....

00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:11.000
Oho...look at the FC they look exciting and wait for my answer.
Actually, Tina and I will have a film project together.

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:14.000
But I can't tell you any details now.
Jacky:  Have to wait and follow the news.

00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:18.000
Aom:  May be at the end of this year or the early of next year.

00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:21.000
Jacky:  Is this happend because the fans' request?

00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:33.000
Aom:  I have to accept that you are right. Because both 
Thai and foreign FC request to see more of our work. 
This made a film producer want us to play movie together.

00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:38.000
Jacky:  Have you been wondered why you have a lot of FC, 
esp a lof ot foreign FCs who come to visit you.

00:04:38.001 --> 00:04:49.000
Aom:  I also wonder. But I think it is because of YoN movie. 
With its target group and those fans who love this film.

00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:54.000
Jacky:  So they become fin.
Aom: Yep, fin.
Jacky: Me too. I am also in this fin gang. And jin gang.

00:04:54.001 --> 00:05:00.000
Aom:  Hey, in my new series, Full house, I've been worked 
with your daughter. 
Jacky: Who?
Aom:  Nest.

00:05:00.001 --> 00:05:02.000
Jacky:  Oh, Nest.
Aom:  She's so cute.

00:05:02.001 --> 00:05:08.000
Jacky:  I haven't been visit this series shooting unit yet. 
P'Top (another host) went there yesterday, right?
Aom:  Yes, he was.

00:05:11.001 --> 00:05:14.000
Jacky:  Another question for FC is about P'Bas.

00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:24.000
Aom:  Right, P'Bas is like my brother. He is my senior at the univ 
and we work in the same industry.

00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:34.000
So we greeted, chated and consulted each other. 
Sometimes I met him because I am close to his friends.

00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:40.000
Jacky: Those directors, crew team.
Aom: Yes, crew team, acting coach. 
We hanged out together sometimes.

00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:44.000
Jacky:  Could you please tell your FC is it Yes or No? 
Esp for the foreign fans, they are dying to know about it.

00:05:44.001 --> 00:05:47.000
Aom:  About P'Bas issue?
Jacky:  Yes.

00:05:47.001 --> 00:05:52.000
Aom:  We are kind of bro-sis hood.
Jacky:  So Yes or No then? Is it Not boyfriend but friend?

00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:54.000
Aom:  Yes. Friend.

00:05:54.001 --> 00:06:00.000
Jacky:  How about Tina?
Aom:  Tina, recently we haven't met each other.

00:06:00.001 --> 00:06:05.000
Jacky:  Did she upset with you?
Aom:  No, she has lot of works. 2-3 films now.

00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:12.000
Jacky:  She becomes a pretty girl.
Aom:  Err..right a pretty girl, not a handsome girl. 
These days she becomes a pretty girl.

00:06:12.001 --> 00:06:14.000
Jacky:  Upset with it?
Aom:  [chuckle]

00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:18.000
Jacky:  Will you be angry with me like that snack advert?
Aom:  Nah...I am not kind of that angry girl.

00:06:18.001 --> 00:06:21.000
Jacky:  Not that kind of girl.
Aom:  Nahh.

00:06:21.001 --> 00:06:29.000
Jacky:  Do your FC understand about it now?
Aom:  They understand well, but some said that 
I made them frightened.

00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:35.000
Jacky:  That chabby girl played well, the one 
whose her LED plate fell on the floor.

00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:42.000
Aom:  But my hand hadn't touch it, yet LED plate was fallen. 
I was frightened and she was too.
Jacky:  She played so well.

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:45.000
Anyway, please leave your message to the fans.

00:06:45.001 --> 00:06:52.000
Aom:  Please keep support my works. Tomorrow 
Namaste Ja-ey Bye Bye will be shown in the cinema on Sep 19th.

00:06:52.001 --> 00:06:58.000
Then Hashima project, it will be on Halloween day, Oct 31st.

00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:02.000
And please wait for Full House series at the end of this year.
