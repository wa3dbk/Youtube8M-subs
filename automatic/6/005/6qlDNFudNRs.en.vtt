00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.300 
really suit you and then really like I
think<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.600> might<00:02:09.720> be<00:02:09.750> best<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.320> go<00:02:10.860> for<00:02:11.070> like<00:02:11.160> an

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
think it might be best to go for like an

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.860 
think it might be best to go for like an
experience<00:02:11.910> or<00:02:12.060> something<00:02:12.390> even<00:02:12.660> if<00:02:12.750> it's

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
experience or something even if it's

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.650 
experience or something even if it's
just<00:02:13.020> like<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.140> meal<00:02:13.410> out<00:02:13.650> or<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:15.000> trip<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.540> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
just like a meal out or a trip to the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.990 
just like a meal out or a trip to the
cinema<00:02:16.050> or<00:02:16.320> you<00:02:16.500> go<00:02:16.800> bowling<00:02:17.310> or<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.820> can

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
cinema or you go bowling or you can

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.310 
cinema or you go bowling or you can
think<00:02:18.120> outside<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.510> box<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.870> could<00:02:19.050> go<00:02:19.260> to

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
think outside the box you could go to

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.120 
think outside the box you could go to
the<00:02:19.590> zoo<00:02:20.360> or<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:22.230> know<00:02:22.380> something<00:02:22.710> like<00:02:22.830> that

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
the zoo or you know something like that

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.880 
the zoo or you know something like that
but<00:02:23.520> I<00:02:23.550> think<00:02:23.870> experiences<00:02:24.870> are<00:02:25.110> good<00:02:25.320> over

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
but I think experiences are good over

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.080 
but I think experiences are good over
the<00:02:25.980> presence<00:02:26.310> if<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.460> can't<00:02:26.730> think<00:02:26.940> of

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
the presence if you can't think of

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.480 
the presence if you can't think of
anything<00:02:27.300> because<00:02:27.630> if<00:02:27.780> not<00:02:27.980> then<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.340> might

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
anything because if not then you might

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.620 
anything because if not then you might
end<00:02:29.550> up<00:02:29.760> buying<00:02:29.910> something<00:02:30.210> that<00:02:30.390> they<00:02:30.480> don't

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
end up buying something that they don't

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.290 
end up buying something that they don't
really<00:02:30.960> want<00:02:31.200> or<00:02:31.530> need<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.940> can<00:02:32.970> have<00:02:33.240> a
