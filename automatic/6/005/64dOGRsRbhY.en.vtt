a lot of walking at work and I'm sure he
would<00:01:01.739> much<00:01:01.920> prefer<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.399> wear<00:01:02.520> tennis<00:01:02.940> shoes

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
would much prefer to wear tennis shoes

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.960 
would much prefer to wear tennis shoes
but<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.379> don't<00:01:04.799> know<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.729> they<00:01:05.850> would

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.789 
but I don't know that they would
appreciate<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.900> none<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.170> these<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.650> have

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
appreciate that and none of these I have

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.310 
appreciate that and none of these I have

Barbados<00:01:16.430> which<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.610> really<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.240> they<00:01:18.869> are

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
Barbados which I really like they are

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.760 
Barbados which I really like they are
different<00:01:19.710> than<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:21.060> 90<00:01:21.600> no<00:01:21.720> ones<00:01:21.960> they're

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
like kind of a green khaki faiths are

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.990 
like kind of a green khaki faiths are
very<00:01:27.210> different<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.750> black<00:01:27.990> sole<00:01:28.340> but<00:01:29.340> um<00:01:29.640> I

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
very different in a black sole but um I

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.170 
very different in a black sole but um I
just<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:31.020> like<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.560> style<00:01:31.890> it's<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.939> little

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
just I like this style it's a little

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.240 
just I like this style it's a little
darker<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.049> towel<00:01:34.320> I'm<00:01:34.590> not<00:01:34.829> sure<00:01:35.070> it's

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
darker on the towel I'm not sure it's

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.359 
darker on the towel I'm not sure it's
kind<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.579> casual<00:01:36.000> look<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.920> don't<00:01:38.280> know

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
kind of a casual look so I don't know

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.069 
kind of a casual look so I don't know
how<00:01:38.549> go<00:01:38.700> fat<00:01:38.970> but<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.270> think<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.600> these<00:01:39.780> would

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
how go fat but I think that these would

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.499 
how go fat but I think that these would
be<00:01:40.200> beautiful<00:01:40.380> with<00:01:40.680> jeans<00:01:41.100> or<00:01:41.430> with<00:01:42.000> casual

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
be beautiful with jeans or with casual

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.060 
be beautiful with jeans or with casual
khaki<00:01:45.110> we'll<00:01:46.110> see<00:01:46.320> though<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.579> can<00:01:47.729> get<00:01:47.909> him

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
khaki we'll see though if I can get him

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.420 
khaki we'll see though if I can get him
and<00:01:50.070> then<00:01:51.799> swapping<00:01:52.799> without<00:01:53.159> buying

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
and then swapping without buying

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.200 
and then swapping without buying
something<00:01:53.759> John<00:01:54.210> Varvatos<00:01:54.810> right<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.380> like

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
something John Varvatos right it's like

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.219 
something John Varvatos right it's like
it<00:01:57.210> seems<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.689> be<00:01:57.810> ubiquitous<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:59.630> and<00:02:00.630> then

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
it seems to be ubiquitous and and then

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.130 
it seems to be ubiquitous and and then
these<00:02:01.409> again<00:02:01.829> are<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:02.159> nice<00:02:02.399> flat<00:02:02.790> squishy<00:02:03.479> sole

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
these again are a nice flat squishy sole

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.399 
these again are a nice flat squishy sole
so<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.340> don't<00:02:05.520> know<00:02:05.700> how<00:02:06.360> he's<00:02:06.750> gonna<00:02:06.869> do<00:02:07.170> with

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
so I don't know how he's gonna do with

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.800 
so I don't know how he's gonna do with
this<00:02:07.560> light<00:02:07.799> kind<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.099> Chuck<00:02:08.429> hike<00:02:08.640> but<00:02:08.970> we're
