 the world of gadgets increase in size 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.789
 along with the rise of the screen diagonal usually 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.409
 suffer ergonomics devices despite 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.049
 On this engineer or otherwise could achieve 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.030
 and 859 to perfectly lay in the palm of your hand 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.999
 and its thickness does not exceed weight 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.499
 generally accepted standards with a weight of 160 grams 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:04.420
 the thickness of the smartphone is only 

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:06.070
 nine point 2 millimeters 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.689
 the manufacturer decided not to specify the type 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.250
 protective coating used 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.050
 glass copes with its 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.670
 the main task even after long 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.770
 gadget travel usage by 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.050
 pocket pockets of scratch bags and 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.489
 scuffs will be at least light 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.200
 body design will help avoid 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.500
 a large number of prints from the tracks 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.340
 on white dress they are simply not visible 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.170
 the music speaker gives out quite 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.239
 decent sound volume is enough for that 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.370
 not to miss the call and notification 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:45.370
 I recommend listening to music 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:47.080
 use headphones lenovo and 859 as 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.510

 this is enough for 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.540
 everyday use sole 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.950
 minus can be considered a small version 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.720
 colors to be published on the matrix under 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.560
 certain angle but it should not 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.489
 become a serious problem in quality
