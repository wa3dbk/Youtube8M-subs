00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.200
 to slip on Wednesday its attributes 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.240
 today rather than playing a game 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.300
 arcade without designing a machine that 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.510
 at the time where you are or little love obame 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.390
 or 3000 euros we will play a game 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.480
 which I played a lot 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.380
 coty mortal fever kombat because and well 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.649
 sure the trailer of mortal kombat season 2 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.899
 ledesma kombat legacy season 2 he leaves 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.390
 he ensured on the machine chain images 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.820
 you pass the link is made to wear 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.010
 crate suddenly had to design such a fight 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.480
 fashion made me want to play the mortal 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.440
 kombat I played the most in my 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.489
 life that is unfortunately mortal 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.260
 kombat two supervisors and yet 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.579
 yet dirty everything but like that you 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.320
 go see that in this mortal kombat 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.940
 warrior version now but there is 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.890
 all you need there is everything that 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.630
 founds the voice digits there are 10 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.490
 gilles two characters your in 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.159
 champion's league on transport 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.350
 conform to the different characters of 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.990
 the eu the graphics have gone from 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.549
 its mine of nothing 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.470
 this fight is the gameboy version thing 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.860
 is sure it's something war 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.970
 or the guide you prefer for 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.159
 those who do not know are their 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:35.060
 two men's portable console have 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:39.070
 started was reported to us but the 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.070
 wants but if I do formula 1 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.080
 not every little mill here they have 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.430
 maybe more than he needs he has everything he 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.860
 it's the experience when a fight 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.860
 ultimate press at the fire 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:18.870
 look at this it's called technique 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.550
 technical you then I will have you well 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.350
 you place a fatality bunker version 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.840
 because we see that once in his 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:30.450
 life purpose then suddenly you have to block and 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.710
 do the same but a little of it lamela 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.240
 needs them to do it if you 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.290
 block do o'byrne 1 it's not won 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.650
 knowing that you will do it is not the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.750
 football 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.120
 so if I'm still on slaps and 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.520
 I'm doing here I can transform myself 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.470
 in kit for the future 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.520
 console a console like africa 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.630
 yesterday it was impressive to have 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.570
 shared that can load others 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.430
 characters like that instantly the 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.740
 colors are not too disgusting 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:04.400
 nothing a noise know it's really 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.400
 problem at 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.310
 here we see the smirk 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.989
 on his team any high song 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.829
 resolution 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.859
 if you do not see me it's you do not have 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:18.280
 no imagination we will try to 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:22.540
 to transform that's hop it's not at all 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.010
 never without his features at all 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.189
 of course you may think that I 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:32.019
 am in red but it's just that I 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:35.230
 I have a shih tzu the vehicles ok 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.420
 okay the barrel if it's observing a 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.549
 hockey because it's one in two 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.230
 kicks I could have absorbed the 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.590
 majority really right otherwise if you 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.169
 really want to be curious a lot 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.099
 had teleportation 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.099
 completely is completely phew 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:59.639
 so I would like here I am 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.639
 turned into a wolf 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.040
 that's without a scenario absolutely held 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.030
 for nothing so suddenly if you do not like 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.319
 not the guillotiere will you do 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.060
 fucked because finally it's like 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.450
 the best portable console that are 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.680
 never came out because casually 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.450
 until the release of the game boy advance 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.450
 and with not much it allows you 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.680
 to have come with such quality you 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.820
 magic is a great defender come 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.620

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.270
 defender of diarrhea who has authority 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.460

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.290
 of vegetables say as well on mac and 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.480
 to say necessarily she did not walk because 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.800
 that it was the only step really 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.300
 portable it still needed the 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.180
 branch and to have fun more than two 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.070
 hours on it but you have to plug in there 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.340

 energy needs and asked but 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:25.280
 so frankly when we see 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:27.800
