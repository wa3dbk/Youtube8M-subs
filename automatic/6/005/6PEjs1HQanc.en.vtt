00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:28.000
 the first guitar was at six 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.180
 my dad's gift is still me today 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.980
 I bring back with great with great joy 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.190
 with a particular approach that is 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.140
 always very much enjoyed it a bit 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.989
 as if it were always a really great one 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.580
 nice toy in which I then try to 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.470
 bring out my emotions the most 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.470
 the more authentic ones want more sincere 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.880
 I believe that in music in art in 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.100
 general is born with a dowry 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.780
 natural with a talent with one 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.380
 propensity towards this form of 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.560
 expression is like that and so it was for me 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.540
 it was a continuous discovery 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.579
 already two years I was singing era 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.799
 anyway brought for music in one 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:29.860
 however, it is also an unmistakable way 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:32.829
 this is my father today 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.820
 passion and my grandfather for example played 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:38.979
 in the band of the country for which the 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.039
 family music was breathed and mine 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.509
 father wanted me to be asi and so it is 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.689
 in short, he sowed on land 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.689
 fertile 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.060
 today I find myself having an approach 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.800
 with the tool that I consider to be 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.540
 a kind of small orchestra the 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.360
 guitar for me this basically 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.710
 so I try to run on 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.660
 solo instrument those that are gods 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.060
 tracks that are usually played by 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.920
 ensemble or larger formations 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.260
 let's say this is my approach 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.640
 yes they call me at the university of 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.280
 california every year to do these 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.740
 unified seminars for the departments of 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.930
 classical guitar jazz I realized 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.820
 recently a record with a duo with Richard 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.500
 smith this american colleague who with 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.300
 who was born this association now 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.250
 we will have concerts in greece and then 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.900
 in short, life is my life a life of 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.720
 however, musician is a life in 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.010
 continuous progress in becoming 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.590
 see for example the collaboration with 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.900
 antonella ruggiero see the fact that 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.350
 I write music for the cinema recently 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.000
 one for the muccino brothers a docu 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.460
 fiction 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.490
 in short, I like to always confront myself with 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.530
 different territories to test me 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.510
 because I think there are no barriers 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.510
 in music there is no i 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.640
 watertight compartments to which perhaps 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.520
 someone wants to let us get used to this is 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.930
 caught these jazz this and classic me 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.489
 I believe that never as today the term 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.959
 crossover is well chosen because in the end 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.810
 one interprets at least I try to 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.030
 interpret the music I love 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.770
 filtering it with my background 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.900
 simply trying to put ourselves 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.720
 inside my lived my way of 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.820
 revisit arranging a song 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.410
 trying to make it this way of 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.410
 I would say original personal 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.630
 will give you a tool with a thousand faces 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.370
 there is the folk guitar 12 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.310
 hawaiian and jazz strings 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.140
 classical acoustics would be difficult 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.870
 say if he is a musician he is better than a 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.490
 others should be measured in the moles 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.560
 their respective sectors of belonging 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:53.000
 but I think that making the rankings is 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.000
 however still wrong 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.340
 the art emotion we were in 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.470
 history of guitarists with two 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.110
 notes have excited and still today 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.940
 they are copied imitated there are only 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.860
 guitarists instead equipped with technique 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.810
 extraordinary but then maybe to 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.139
 end of a concert leave you so a 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.539
 bit cold then 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.180
 in short, art is the one that we ourselves 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.620
 we perceive in front of a 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.319
 concert strong of our background 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.779
 strong of our emotions than that 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:39.360
 that we ate the night before 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:40.860
 in short, one can never say in art is 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.870
 a world so I believe it is a 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.870
 universe still unexplored 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:02.200
 working with antonella is exciting 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.880
 why work with one of the largest 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.440
 interpreters I've never met in 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.290
 my life 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.900
 I think you can't define her 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.510
 a singer because it would be limiting 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.880
 to him she uses her voice 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.290
 as if it were an instrument this is the 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.840
 which surprises me from time to time 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.480
 there is never a concert the same as another 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.820
 because he is so capable of interpreting 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.760
 exactly classics belonging to 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.880
 any kind of music as of 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:36.240
 release his improvisational talent with 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.240
 a freedom with a disarming fluidity 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.540
 the race with Giuseppe has now become 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.130
 a sort of we are data of 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.410
 habituÃ¨ so much is true that we have thought 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.670
 to make a record together and I tell you 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.370
 already a preview of the title it should 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.320
 be careful of those two 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.510
 because we both discovered each other 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.820
 roger moore and tony enthusiasts 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.080
 curtis rehn who did that of the 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.820
 famous here for the famous series 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.620
 film 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.090
 we have a certain age even I know 43 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.730
 giuseppe years he has someone more than 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.230
 so we discovered some 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.090
 common passions therefore we will achieve 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.460
 this record in duo 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.280
 I would like that our Sicily 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.360
 was remembered forever for the 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.580
 great for pirandello for sciascia for 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.560
 camilleri for I could make a list that 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.390
 never even ends with music 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.130
 frank sinatra and of lercaresi origins 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.970
 joe pass on the john guitar 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:40.720
 passalacqua messinese I could do 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:43.510
 a series of names and we would do night then 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.620
 this is Sicily that I love Sicily 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.740
 who tries to carry around for the 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.740
 world 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.460
 and then a greeting to televisionet with 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.790
 all the music I have in my heart 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.790
 See you soon
