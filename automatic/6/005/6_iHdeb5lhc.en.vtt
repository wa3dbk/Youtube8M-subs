again<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.260> think<00:01:14.100> my<00:01:14.190> favorite<00:01:14.580> part<00:01:14.790> about<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.280 
again I think my favorite part about the
whole<00:01:15.150> plan<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.659> fact<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.870> you<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.140> just

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
whole plan is the fact that you can just

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.870 
whole plan is the fact that you can just
flip<00:01:16.470> some<00:01:16.710> kind<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.950> switch<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.460> robot<00:01:17.760> to

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
flip some kind of switch in a robot to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.120 
flip some kind of switch in a robot to
make<00:01:18.000> him<00:01:18.180> evil<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.500> know<00:01:19.620> like<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> entire

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130
