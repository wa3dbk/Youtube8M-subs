00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.360
 this morning 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.360
 agi 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.340
 really miss home a few hours this 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.110
 I would like to dedicate the column to the 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.110
 the children of this festival 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.460
 today more than an interview I would like to do 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:38.800
 a chat with a great friend 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.750
 alessandro zanardi who has for children 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.570
 really done an important thing hello 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.039
 hello fabrizio you want to tell us a little 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.219
 where does this idea come from 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.659
 bimbingamba is watching bimbingamba born one 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.839
 evening behind a glass of red wine 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:55.829
 Tuscan as together with a friend 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:58.769
 we had contributed to the realization 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.760
 we had raised funds for 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.939
 transform an old ruin into one 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.009
 welcome home in the park of the AOP 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:07.720
 the hospital of atria and other body years 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.819
 we knew he crowned I had made one 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.679
 nice thing so much so that he at a 

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:14.350
 some point it broke the atmosphere 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:16.950
 saying ok now I said now 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.950
 Bimbingamba 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.770
 what bimbingamba proposes to 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.270
 to help all those children who 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.770
 just because maybe they come from the country 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.680
 where there is no assistance whatsoever 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.120
 health care have no other solutions though 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.860
 not those to appeal to them 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:46.229
 brother's family to those who help them 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.840
 often families can also be 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.220
 fugitives can somehow have 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.170
 left the children in a situation 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.990
 difficulties only children think 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.270
 were raised in orphanages and 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.920
 the reasons are not simply those 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.540
 of accidents rather than problems in the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.270
 course of their growth but also 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.979
 birth defects and prostheses 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.440
 then they are not only those of limb 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.200
 inferior children arrive maybe 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.570
 they don't have an arm or they don't have 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.100
 both arms technology in the 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.170
 over time has made strides from 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.739
 logical giant with a prosthesis will not be able 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.140
 never be how can I tell 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.360
 of the natural limb art that mother 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.720
 nature gives us originally however 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.280
 see the children leave with a 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.630
 smile that comes from one ear 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.150
 to the other because obviously 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.820
 that object during their life 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.880
 represents a huge step forward 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.190
 technically also it is psychologically 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.290
 for us a huge joy as well as one 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.060
 great source of motivation to search 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.489
 to do more and more because then i 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.480
 children grow up and their little thesis goes to 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.480
 day bars 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.090
 disability is a very relative concept 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.670
 we have children who come in 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.900
 somehow used to living life 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.140
 without anything every form of 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.140
 recovery for them is a source of joy 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.890
 I have witnessed testimonials from 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.750
 wonderful children that they are 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.550
 arrived from us maybe looking at the 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.750
 floor I am reminded of the story of 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:27.480
 this little girl who came from 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.580
 moldavia maria she was born with this 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.260
 malformation so she lacks an arm 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.300
 at birth and she came to us 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.160
 staring at the floor this was let's say 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.660
 the form of defense he had developed 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.740
 towards the looks of the 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.380
 people and when it started and left 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.970
 that boldly looked at people 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.390
 in the eyes and this filled me up 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.390
 heart of joy 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.879
 these are magical days 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.409
 many things come true if 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.780
 someone wanted to give a gift 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.400
 smart therefore help a dream of 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.189
 one of these smart kids like 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.100
 could do in the simplest and easiest way 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:24.970
 address these bombs people 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:27.460
 on our site www.bimbimbici.it there 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.670
 there are information where 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.320
 someone wanted to make a donation but 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.360
 it also makes us a simple gift 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.090
 spreading the message because we do a lot 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.800
 often we need to be 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.590
 usable for these children who 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.110
 logically if they come from places where 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.600
 there is no one who can provide for them 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.110
 figured if they have internet rather than 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.120
 television so the way for us 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.190
 to be usable perhaps through the 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.590
 word of mouth then the disclosure of 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.960
 message let us know that we exist is 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.940
 in itself a great help can be 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.690
 an extra euro that weighs on his pocket 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.940
 it annoys him 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.050
 we also gladly take the broad one 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.370
 it serves to bring the result home 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.610
 perfect thanks to the graces 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.800
 of welcome and what can I say to 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.420
 this point to wish you a merry Christmas a 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.940
 all 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.400
 the magic is that of many santa claus 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.780
 wishes for a peaceful Christmas and a 2014 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.470
 full of sporting successes 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.470
 Hi everyone
