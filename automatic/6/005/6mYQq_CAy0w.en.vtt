and I've got my point all facing what we
believe<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.979> true<00:01:26.009> north<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.970> let<00:01:27.119> me<00:01:27.150> grab

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
believe to be true north so let me grab

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.929 
believe to be true north so let me grab
my<00:01:27.659> compass<00:01:28.310> so<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:29.579> verify<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:31.939> alright

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
my compass so we can verify it alright

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.240 
my compass so we can verify it alright
so<00:01:33.630> here<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.900> see<00:01:33.960> that's<00:01:34.770> where<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.040> stick

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
hemisphere version works so you guys

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.740 
hemisphere version works so you guys
will<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.250> look<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.610> up<00:01:53.670> all<00:01:54.630> right
