thoughts<00:03:09.739> of<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.069> hair<00:03:10.310> when<00:03:10.639> I<00:03:10.669> opened<00:03:11.120> it

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
thoughts of the hair when I opened it

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.379 
thoughts of the hair when I opened it
was<00:03:11.510> these<00:03:12.380> bundles<00:03:12.769> are<00:03:13.310> really<00:03:13.819> really<00:03:14.090> thin

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
was these bundles are really really thin

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.300 
was these bundles are really really thin
I<00:03:14.930> knew<00:03:15.440> they<00:03:15.590> were<00:03:15.650> going<00:03:15.859> to<00:03:15.919> be<00:03:16.040> thin

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
I knew they were going to be thin

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.370 
I knew they were going to be thin
because<00:03:16.700> they<00:03:17.209> have<00:03:17.359> to<00:03:17.540> compensate<00:03:18.169> the

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
because they have to compensate the

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.229 
because they have to compensate the
longer<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:18.859> hair<00:03:19.069> is<00:03:19.250> you<00:03:19.790> know<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.030> thinner

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
longer the hair is you know the thinner

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.979 
longer the hair is you know the thinner
