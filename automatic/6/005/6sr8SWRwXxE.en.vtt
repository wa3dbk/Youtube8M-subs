obviously and if you have having

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.069 
obviously and if you have having
problems<00:00:47.879> finding<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.750> it's<00:00:48.870> not<00:00:48.989> on

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
problems finding this and it's not on

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.380 
problems finding this and it's not on
your<00:00:49.200> actual<00:00:49.410> sweetie<00:00:49.890> dashboard<00:00:50.700> then<00:00:51.270> you

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
your actual sweetie dashboard then you

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.389 
your actual sweetie dashboard then you
might<00:00:51.539> want<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.719> search<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.199> Bing<00:00:52.469> or<00:00:52.710> maybe

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
might want to search in Bing or maybe

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.360 
might want to search in Bing or maybe
you<00:00:53.610> look<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.239> app<00:00:54.590> you<00:00:55.590> know<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
you look on that app you know on the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.819 
you look on that app you know on the
little<00:00:57.270> tab<00:00:57.840> they've<00:00:58.140> got<00:00:58.289> on<00:00:58.379> there

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
little tab they've got on there

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.380 
little tab they've got on there
so<00:00:59.370> anyway<00:01:00.230> it's<00:01:01.230> at<00:01:01.350> one<00:01:01.559> point<00:01:01.980> 25<00:01:02.460> MB<00:01:03.030> as<00:01:03.300> you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
so anyway it's at one point 25 MB as you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.240 
so anyway it's at one point 25 MB as you
can<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> screen<00:01:03.989> there<00:01:04.379> don't<00:01:05.100> take

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
can see on the screen there don't take

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.469 
can see on the screen there don't take
that<00:01:05.339> long<00:01:05.519> if<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:06.180> 58<00:01:06.630> already<00:01:07.140> 80<00:01:08.479> 100

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
that long if that 58 already 80 100

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.149 
that long if that 58 already 80 100
maybe<00:01:09.720> more<00:01:10.280> likely<00:01:11.280> really<00:01:12.049> but<00:01:13.049> anyway

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
maybe more likely really but anyway

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.240 
maybe more likely really but anyway
we'll<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.369> what<00:01:15.150> brings<00:01:15.450> up<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.110> we'll<00:01:16.590> click

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
we'll see what brings up and we'll click

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.499 
we'll see what brings up and we'll click
it<00:01:17.400> now<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:20.130> play<00:01:20.939> now

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
it now and play now

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.899 
it now and play now
so<00:01:22.290> that's<00:01:22.650> what<00:01:22.799> we'll<00:01:22.950> do<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:25.670> think<00:01:26.670> it's

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
so that's what we'll do I think it's

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.249 
so that's what we'll do I think it's
just<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.180> sign-up<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.850> met<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.060> may<00:01:30.509> have<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.840> type

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
just a sign-up so met I may have to type

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.460 
just a sign-up so met I may have to type

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
here a to exit so I think we've done

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.979 
here a to exit so I think we've done
we've<00:03:26.680> got<00:03:26.860> into<00:03:27.370> our<00:03:27.459> beta<00:03:27.700> we've<00:03:28.450> signed<00:03:28.750> up

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.670 
we've got into our beta we've signed up
and<00:03:29.260> it<00:03:29.590> takes<00:03:29.830> about<00:03:29.980> one<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.310> two<00:03:30.430> days<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:32.140> to

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
and it takes about one to two days to to

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.100 
and it takes about one to two days to to
get<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.100> I<00:03:33.160> think<00:03:33.430> that's<00:03:34.180> what<00:03:34.390> it<00:03:34.510> says

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
I mean Xbox Live then you're probably

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:04.000 
I mean Xbox Live then you're probably
not<00:05:57.570> gonna<00:05:57.870> find<00:05:58.430> it<00:05:59.630> so<00:06:02.000> um

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
not gonna find it so um

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.250 
not gonna find it so um
Cathy<00:06:05.010> I'm<00:06:05.190> there<00:06:05.460> either<00:06:05.780> I'm<00:06:06.780> gonna<00:06:06.960> browse

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
Cathy I'm there either I'm gonna browse

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:14.480 
Cathy I'm there either I'm gonna browse
that<00:06:08.540> probably<00:06:09.540> the<00:06:09.990> best<00:06:10.290> thing<00:06:10.470> to<00:06:10.530> do<00:06:11.390> so<00:06:13.490> it

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
that probably the best thing to do so it

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:26.180 
that probably the best thing to do so it
would<00:06:14.730> be<00:06:14.910> would<00:06:15.300> it<00:06:15.330> be<00:06:15.510> social<00:06:24.560> I<00:06:25.560> don't

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
would be would it be social I don't

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:32.260 
would be would it be social I don't
think<00:06:26.460> it's<00:06:26.640> in<00:06:26.790> their<00:06:27.980> video<00:06:28.980> see<00:06:29.370> oh<00:06:29.780> so

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
think it's in their video see oh so

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.840 
think it's in their video see oh so
hopefully<00:06:33.270> it<00:06:33.510> would<00:06:33.630> be<00:06:33.690> on<00:06:33.990> their<00:06:34.850> research

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:35.850 
hopefully it would be on their research

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.570 
hopefully it would be on their research
backs<00:06:36.210> I<00:06:36.570> didn't<00:06:36.810> see<00:06:36.930> that<00:06:37.140> down<00:06:37.320> there
