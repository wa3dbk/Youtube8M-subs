00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.980
 in the mid-1960s the moscow cars literally shook the market 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.459
 North American 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:11.979
 arrived to me 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:16.640
 of mubarak have created a legion of subjects and fans that goes from 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.710
 generation 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.730
 now the forecast back 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.320
 with more technology 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.269
 has the same shape of asphalt 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:24.529
 Excessive heat 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.529
 is one of them 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.000
 this independent import 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.330
 in 2006 very interesting 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.600
 one of them has the body color 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.800
 which does not appear in the case of the Brazilian 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.870
 And the second 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.210
 the six-speed manual transmission and adds valuable horsepower 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.420
 the engine 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.620
 notice too 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.700
 with emphasis on the 20-inch wheels 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.520
 the brake brembo together 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.520
 in fact 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.430
 there 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:03.430
 - We played very well today in six points 426 horses as I had said 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.990
 I heard this will help with manual gearbox are 20 years or more steering 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.990
 take this measure not in brazil 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.889
 third key head number 5 in the world 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:32.909
 I say I will be conniving with the number 1 in the world 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.469
 the number 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:47.179
 the only 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:03:00.749
 they fight millions 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.819
 ae 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.979
 to anadarko
