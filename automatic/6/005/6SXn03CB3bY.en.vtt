00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.370
 Oh 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.370
 it likes 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.699
 when i heard i was with the fire line 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.439
 another thought that was quite a challenge 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.600
 because if I 'm right I'm already 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.710
 one of the most efficient drivers inside 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.559
 Company 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.059
 and then even more economical 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.829
 press not to be 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.480
 what my wife is in case and in terms of 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.960
 interior space 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.160
 consciously made noise for the driver 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.699
 everything within reach and 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.720
 uncluttered and he just drives very 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.159
 yummy 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.430
 and once you sit down then you have 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.859
 something like setje in hey guys we go 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.140
 what the steering behavior I have with 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.789
 other vehicles driven with heavier ones 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.440
 comes whole suspect 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.570
 then sent something true and this sends 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.580
 just light you can just with your finger 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.720
 keep driving and you love him 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.050
 always under control 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.580
 effortlessly delicious I actually have 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.440
 nothing special done to be economical 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.600
 able to drive because previously only possible 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.479
 little but if you just in advance 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.979
 and anticipate and think carefully about what you are 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.729
 is going to do what goes possibly hair 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:33.400
 come and let your hair roll it out 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:36.640
 then you are already cutting back and so am 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.770
 I have also been on one and and Antwerp and 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.240

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.729
