00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.029
 The table shows the substation as a consequence if you are 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.029
 buying a good machine or not 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:11.179
 here you 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.769
 Sao Vicente has spared Roberto 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.639
 now you're the first thing the most important thing for you to stand still 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.060
 the processor 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.220
 that is 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.710
 this component in my hand 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.210
 this is a comb a comb 1 4 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.840
 this is not the brand of the computer when someone speaks to 74 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.020
 it is not a computer but without this component it is the processor 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.290
 on the machine 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.780
 there are other processors and the like also with 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.670
 You can not believe anyone 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.190
 the comb or manufactured by intel 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.360
 aigner 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.900
 the processors 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.130
 They are called 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.080
 no evidence 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.120
 already the fraud 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.510
 the most important thing you know first 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.920
 paulo césar gaúcho scoring well 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.500
 to open 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 mumbai mirror 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.380
 the next the child component for you and the motherboard 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.330
 this is a motherboard train 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.890
 Who wants to say or death? 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.420
 there are some 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.450
 components 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.520
 because you can get to be stopped at your door as plaque paterson team 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.190
 change 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.770
 this team who tries to get into it you have older than diana bar 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.690
 this butt board but more for attack see integrated videos 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.120
 oab consider buying separate or boards that connected to that board 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.100
 in the case of the processor for what 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.160
 the benfica thrashed mdm will hit the map with his mother too 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.290
 if you want to buy 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.310
 simpler and cheaper counter it will be competitor 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.540
 and if it is a little more expensive and advances it will be a competitor 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.540
 generally who prove to mother horford 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.150
 becky 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.900
 use the machine to reduce ipi that the listeners also to play 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.820
 sneakers 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.269
 so if you want a computer for example to use your home 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:11.230
 just stop 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.819
 browsing the internet, he details that he has expelled the information 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:16.060
 hour 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.640
 davis's lawyers you can buy a computer but I'm happy here 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:24.079
 it will work out as cheaply as possible 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.689
 another feature that you see the part attention at the time of purchasing a 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:28.859
 new machine 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.859
 is the ability of the device this opinion survey 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.989
 is a string means participated hard drive 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.389
 it is responsible for storing all sides 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:44.069
 everything you save your machine is stored in that noncompliance 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.529
 this decision 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:47.840
 the burial today 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.689
 even without understanding 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.409
 or at least 80 and more 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.459
 now if you admitted to me doing video editing 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:58.470
 I will find it very much alive on the internet. 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.470
 dunga you buy above 100 indicates bartz 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:05.609
 the other important component also make this alliance in the woods 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.449
 let's go 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:08.849
 she lived 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.459
 and I know it's a memory comb 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.459
 it is very important for the performance of March to the sea 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:17.479
 I do not include myself to be acquired today 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:18.379
 last year 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.379
 these 256 megabytes 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.489
 first the trips of the rival defender had problems in the kidney 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.510
 which requires more of the brand so you need to have more time consuming 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:35.829
 the processor you can use a bandit laws to two researchers 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:39.049
 already the dam 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.740
 information security 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.480
 acquired several reasons only that today you want to upgrade you will 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.690
 stop buying a year-old motherboard it has the ability to perform this 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.470
 operation 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.470
 I'll explain a little bit now just a miracle says 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.629
 the church is as follows 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.689
 cnt will receive the prize if your motherboard has the ability to perform 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:07.669
 what is this that you should increase the capacity of your computer 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.439
 only you will realize the components and the value of your sale 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.279
 motherboard in case 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:17.599
 your computer also know who knows if it is able to perform 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:18.840
 different 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.460
 so we should use a program called stones is a program 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.909
 very simple 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.990
 sample 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.520
 the competitors on your computer 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.090
 and sandra we are 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.909
 using a demonstration but it recognizes the components 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:34.840
 what happens 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.719
 It's much easier for you to tell the technician. 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:41.809
 if the marten gets his machine has the ability to make butter milk 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:43.759
 or not 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:47.189
 so you pass knows all the components of your machine too 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:49.879
 it allows but according to this 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:51.590
 if you have any pain 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.590
 recognizing the components a brand that I will make 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.680
