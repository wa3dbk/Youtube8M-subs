 I think it's a better idea I have five years 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.730
 really big game 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.900

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.500
 this time from yes said she has everyone that that will run 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.310
 entrance is free and for nothing 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.440
 he won the competition 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.280
 annually pumps 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.280
 6 so missed 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.460
 who regulate themselves a bit 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.600
 he is put to work today at the animal shelter people think 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.310
 to guide the discussion in the right direction, he is assisted by 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.070
 of course can thought about it 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.550
 he gave a majority to the cleaning job a decrepit 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.000
 but we do not give anymore expected the municipality suspects of the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 riots 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.940
 cozy 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.300
 the division 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.810
 9 all so well know yes 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.270
 just meet the safety requirements or because there are also no proposals 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.270
 that a bike path 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:13.529
 you will not get march l so shortly after the holidays I have it myself 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.729
 a bit of an idea it 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.189
 the first one 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:22.259
 of gelderen 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.259
 the 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:33.069
 What can it be important that the media 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.769
 both are on behalf of it in 2005 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.979
 because you have ramadan waasland 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:41.009
 that states 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.349
 also one and what are you going to do there start to weaken 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.989
 Tuesday evening 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.819
 arena abandoned by a fire in a home 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.149
 we have more wishes left 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:53.349
 but the party goes mountain 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.739
 we were one of getting infected 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.280
 the reason is that they have something around a quarter to nine if we win it 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:04.279
 we have a lot of that could just be 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.399
 correct yes the nasdaq 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:15.059
 where i woke up the equalizer on a greater chance of a vip 2 he finds 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:16.130
 it all fine 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.829
 the but above all 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.889
 s man's borremans 9 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:27.959
 Also making it easier to work on new ideas PSV seems like one 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:28.829
 tail 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.769
 very bad 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.489
 how do you look back 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.090
 on the two-year treyarch computer the first real if you can't right away 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.350
 so then I can sometimes bring it differently 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.759
 I have you different from previous 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:46.209
 and that is not true win so it is a bit louder that I have nothing 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.539
 for paying then you come to do something like that 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:53.299
 on the walls he normally the new division of also applies in the eu 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.369
 pillar on which the money also stands 

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:57.579
 the final phase I had hoped 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.019
 you know nobody 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.079
 the waste job there 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.630
 the spokesperson in the ad 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.179
 yes or reader 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:07.179
 I have the impression and not just the performance 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.649
 thinking 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:12.249
 leeuwarden can get better 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:13.409
 that happened 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.739
 the Canadian not posted 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.859
 that happened with the means no longer conscience and memory 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.819
 from the 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:23.800
 frv 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.249
 9 

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:28.320
 breathe to walk again 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.320
 the world so much more 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.870
 nothing is discovered above ground 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.300
 the first that the opta 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.300
 the website's masterful manner 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:48.240
 a car 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.240
 that life 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:56.039
 was thought to date 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.259
 at the meeting 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.309

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:03.050

 that appears from their own country 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.870
 that also seems handy 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.870
 You can do it with the win 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:38.069
