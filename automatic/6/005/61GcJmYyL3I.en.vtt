 hello on air and you in 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.179
 and this is another interesting issue 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.119
 information and responses of game developers 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.189
 armored warfare and starting with information 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.199
 regarding pva and player mode 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.140
 Received an offer that they would like 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.910
 see in the game a hardcore mode where not 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.500
 will be the contours of the tanks and will not 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.449
 recover hepe tanks between 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.930
 missions as well as present 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.160
 time limit and so on 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.020
 developers answered what they think 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.629
 over such options under level 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.090
 the complexity of the nightmare and then the players 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.730
 reported what they would like to see in pvf 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.399
 smarter bots on that developers 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.350
 answered as follows we constantly 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.660
 We are working on improving bots in time 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.370
 I can add that bots 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.190
 really getting better with each 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.780
 patch and last sentence from 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.120
 players in regards to you and modes 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.460
 sounds like being able to go through pvp in 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.040
 the developers alone responded 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.340
 that they say there is no such plan in v.e. 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.200
 this is a team game on this dad and me 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.409
 it's all an extra turn 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.920
 game client functionality and first 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.909
 turn 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.990
 information about the ability to record ripley 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.450
 developers agree that the record 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.840
 Ripley is very important and necessary and by their 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.700
 according to 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.229
 replay is currently under development 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.930
 However, on the edge of the engine 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.700
 it is not a trivial task but nonetheless 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.500
 they will try to implement this 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.369
 functional 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.799
 following offer from players 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.369
 concerns the implementation of voice communication as 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.500
 in pvp and in the mode that the developers 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.079
 gave this answer in the near future 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.970
 This functionality is not, however, from the idea of ​​not 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.430
 refuse maybe there will be some 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.979
 later after finishing the main gaming 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.659
 the mechanic and the players account arrived 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.310
 suggestion about what's good 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.549
 would be able to stream 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.930
 directly from the game client 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.420
 developers have responded to this offer 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.409
 in the following way 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.509
 some kind of separate software 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.490
 security is not worth it as 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.950
 There are programs like shadow play 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.170
 but the possibility of implementation is not excluded 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.660
 This functionality through the game center 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.450
 but quite in the remote 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.940
 future and I turn to information 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.280
 regarding fines and penalties and the first 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.020
 the players offer is a must 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.030
 need to implement a punishment system in 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.070
 the game through the functional complain 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.990
 debriefing can be conducted 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.450
 patrol players or in other words 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.770
 moderators and need to provide for 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.290
 did not get banned normal and adequate 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.300
 players from envy as it happens in 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.440
 world of tanks 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.300
 developers have responded to this offer 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.190
 that the sting system will be implemented in 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.300
 some form but not the fact that in the version 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.280
 with moderators 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.080
 following offer from players 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.060
 As for the fact that it would be nice 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.160
 implement a reward system through 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.670
 functional thank or best 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.920
 tankman 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.140
 maybe the best artilleryman 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.270
 further developers think of this 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.270
 system but its implementation is worth the wait in 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.370
 more distant future still players very 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.590
 worried about creating a good anti 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.450
 there will be systems developers said that 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.780
 such a system will be implemented in the 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.360
 or some form also suggested by the players 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.580
 the idea of regularly cleaning inactive names 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.560
 the developers have not given accounts for this 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.780
 exact answer and said that it is possible 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.310
 will be implemented but not yet 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.980
 necessity and this question will be 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.709
 decide later the next sentence 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.390
 from the players sounds so be sure to 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.900
 regulate the issue of match fixing 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.590
 This is a sore subject of many games. 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.290
 developers on this offer 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.450
 reported that it will probably be built 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.270
 system of restrictions that will allow 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.590
 to regulate this question and then 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.959
 information regarding 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.690
 gameplay and about this from 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.250
 players have such an offer 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.680
 it would be nice to see the world 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.600
 more interactive and here we are talking about 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.400
 destructible publications dynamic 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.380
 landscapes and things like that 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.020
 however, it is imperative 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.610
 keep track of the balance of the developers 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.860
 answered that large remaking 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.840
 current cards will not be but increase 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.989
 destructibility are planned for example 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.400
 opportunity to shoot down trees with shots 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.500
 there is also a suggestion from the players 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.150
 add technology beeps 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.030
 need this in order to bring up 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.100
 Ally for any information ask 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.730
 give drive free point and the 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.799
 like 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.979
 the developers said it was interesting 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.539
 ideas and it can consider the following 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.980
 the players' proposal is that 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.450
 need to somehow balance in 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.060
 and the technique on which is not open yet 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.550
 modifications and equipment to this 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.220
 the equipment did not suffer at least the first 5 10 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.170
 battles after purchase and developers 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.960
 answered that the offer will be 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.580
 implemented yet from the players arrived 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.680
 the sentence that needs to be reduced 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.620
 characteristics of Sheridan as in this 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.870
 moment he is very powerful his developers 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.490
 all wrote that he was already ponerfili 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.760
 and now the statistics fluctuate around 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.520
 50 2 50 three percent but they 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.020
 continue to watch him 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.970
 The following sentence concerns the regime in 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.680
 fighting players ask and implement 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.070
 the possibility of training 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.110
 battles 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.900
 and that it would be nice to have new ones 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.450
 Modes for 5-7 10 players including 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.220
 for battalions on both of these proposals 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.470
 developers responded positively and 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.140
 This functionality will be introduced into the game. 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.940
 and as for the technical issues in 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.400
 the game then the players care about the question when 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.470
 problem with 32-bit will be fixed 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.410
 systems and will there be 32-bit support 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.360
 systems in the future as well as players 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.330
 I wonder how things are with windows xp 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.450
 these questions the developers answered that 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.910
 problem of 32 bit windows 7 systems or 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.220
 vista will be fixed but windows xp 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.100
 will not be supported at all as 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.110
 this system is outdated by many players and 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.150
 report errors when armor piercing 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.790
 piercing shells do not pierce 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.070
 fencing mesh fences and the like 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:52.000
 things and also there are many places where in the holes 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.320
 environments do not fly shells at all 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.940
 developers know this and say that 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.210
 these errors are corrected in each 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.800
 the specific place of their appearance are still players 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.630
 report such an error when the ram does not 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.920
 deals damage at high speed 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.310
 but we wear a little while 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.450
 passing cars is very close 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.160
 developers taste and such a mistake and 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.960
 reported that the mechanic ram on 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.720
 refinement and still have many 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.700
 changes associated with it and last on 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.380
 what the players noticed is that 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.510
 with the burning of technology burns out very 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.790
 quickly to seventy percent total 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.360
 efficiency maybe it's worth counting 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.280
 and balance 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.860
 developers answered that the changes 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.740
 will be paid but they said how soon 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:35.270
 on this i finish the current release with all 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.270
 good luck and see you soon
