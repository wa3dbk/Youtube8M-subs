00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
show up and do our thing I think we're

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.210

gonna<00:01:35.009> do<00:01:35.100> really<00:01:35.520> really<00:01:35.850> good<00:01:37.040> besides<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
gonna do really really good besides the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.370 
gonna do really really good besides the
fact<00:01:38.400> our<00:01:38.759> pool<00:01:39.360> consists<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:40.020> phase<00:01:40.380> red<00:01:41.150> fabe

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
fact our pool consists of phase red fabe

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.149 
fact our pool consists of phase red fabe
Germany<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.649> fav<00:01:44.070> all-stars<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.140> think<00:01:47.040> our

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
Germany and fav all-stars so I think our

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.920 
Germany and fav all-stars so I think our
match<00:01:47.399> versus<00:01:47.820> phase<00:01:48.030> right<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.420> obviously

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
match versus phase right is obviously

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.600 
match versus phase right is obviously
going<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> biggest<00:01:49.590> one<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.250> then<00:01:50.430> we

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
going to be the biggest one and then we

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.490 
going to be the biggest one and then we

wasn't<00:04:36.930> I<00:04:37.940> didn't<00:04:38.940> have<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.150> right

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
wasn't I didn't have the right

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.420 
wasn't I didn't have the right
confidence<00:04:40.020> that<00:04:40.320> mindset<00:04:40.740> that<00:04:40.919> you<00:04:41.070> needed

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
confidence that mindset that you needed

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.879 
confidence that mindset that you needed
to<00:04:41.580> compete<00:04:42.090> at<00:04:42.330> a<00:04:42.360> really<00:04:43.110> high<00:04:43.169> level<00:04:43.350> and

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
to compete at a really high level and

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.060 
to compete at a really high level and
now<00:04:44.550> that<00:04:44.760> I<00:04:44.790> do<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:45.389> a<00:04:45.690> lot<00:04:45.720> of<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:46.169> amateur

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
now that I do and a lot of you amateur

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.640 
now that I do and a lot of you amateur
players<00:04:47.310> out<00:04:47.669> there<00:04:47.699> will<00:04:48.360> eventually<00:04:48.660> get<00:04:49.500> it

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
players out there will eventually get it

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.920 
players out there will eventually get it
but<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:50.520> just<00:04:50.699> build<00:04:51.030> up<00:04:51.180> this<00:04:51.300> confidence

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
but you just build up this confidence

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.200 
but you just build up this confidence
where<00:04:52.169> you<00:04:52.770> it's<00:04:53.729> not<00:04:53.910> like<00:04:54.060> you're

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
where you it's not like you're

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.210 
where you it's not like you're
challenging<00:04:54.870> everything<00:04:55.139> um<00:04:55.620> because

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
challenging everything um because

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.469 
challenging everything um because
obviously<00:04:56.520> you<00:04:56.790> don't<00:04:57.060> want<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.270> challenge

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
obviously you don't want to challenge

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.060 
obviously you don't want to challenge
everything<00:04:57.840> and<00:04:58.139> call<00:04:58.290> of<00:04:58.380> duty<00:04:58.530> there's

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
everything and call of duty there's

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.650 
everything and call of duty there's
times<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.460> challenge<00:04:59.880> and<00:05:00.000> not<00:05:00.360> win<00:05:00.539> the

times the challenge and not win the

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.600 
times the challenge and not win the
challenge<00:05:01.020> but<00:05:01.229> it's<00:05:02.039> when<00:05:02.310> you're<00:05:02.430> not

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
challenge but it's when you're not

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.490 
challenge but it's when you're not
second-guessing<00:05:03.419> any<00:05:03.810> play<00:05:04.169> that<00:05:04.380> you're

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
was really good at this game and I feel

was really good at this game and I feel
like<00:05:16.830> I'm<00:05:17.280> getting<00:05:17.460> a<00:05:17.729> lot<00:05:17.910> better<00:05:17.970> every

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
like I'm getting a lot better every

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.830 
like I'm getting a lot better every
single<00:05:18.539> week<00:05:19.130> but<00:05:20.130> the<00:05:21.000> thing<00:05:21.240> about<00:05:21.270> me<00:05:21.630> right

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
single week but the thing about me right

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.840 
single week but the thing about me right
now<00:05:21.870> is<00:05:22.199> that<00:05:22.410> what<00:05:22.740> held<00:05:22.949> me<00:05:23.010> back<00:05:23.220> was<00:05:23.520> I

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
now is that what held me back was I

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.850 
now is that what held me back was I
always<00:05:24.510> second-guess<00:05:24.990> myself<00:05:25.199> when<00:05:25.530> I<00:05:25.620> play

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
always second-guess myself when I play

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.090 
always second-guess myself when I play
and<00:05:26.100> now<00:05:26.760> I<00:05:27.060> just<00:05:27.180> go<00:05:27.630> with<00:05:27.780> the<00:05:27.810> flow<00:05:27.930> and<00:05:28.350> I

going<00:05:42.570> into<00:05:42.900> this<00:05:43.050> event<00:05:43.229> thinking<00:05:43.770> it's

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
going into this event thinking it's

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.920
