period of time and really challenge some

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.630 
period of time and really challenge some
of<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.530> conceptions<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.519> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
of the conceptions and the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.509 
of the conceptions and the
misconceptions<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.540> have<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:46.110> just<00:00:47.010> an

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
misconceptions we have is just an

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.039 
misconceptions we have is just an
opportunity<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.239> can't<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.629> missed<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.960> I

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:49.049 
opportunity that can't be missed and I

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.509 
opportunity that can't be missed and I
think<00:00:49.260> that's<00:00:49.409> the<00:00:49.559> real<00:00:49.739> value<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.159> what<00:00:50.400> we

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
think that's the real value in what we

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:51.859 
think that's the real value in what we
do<00:00:50.670> today<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.180> then<00:00:51.299> we<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.540> over<00:00:51.750> these

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:51.869 
do today and then we do over these

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:54.289 
do today and then we do over these
events<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.470> for<00:00:53.369> me<00:00:53.519> that's<00:00:53.729> where<00:00:53.970> I<00:00:54.000> you

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:54.299 
events and for me that's where I you

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:56.570 
events and for me that's where I you
know<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.600> get<00:00:55.019> so<00:00:55.409> much<00:00:55.680> insight<00:00:56.309> and

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
know I get so much insight and

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.130 
know I get so much insight and
excitement<00:00:57.089> around<00:00:57.210> some<00:00:57.540> of<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.689> topics<00:00:57.900> we

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
excitement around some of the topics we

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.930 
excitement around some of the topics we
discussed

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.690 

so<00:01:04.720> within<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.110> private<00:01:05.320> sector<00:01:05.860> I<00:01:06.070> think

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
so within the private sector I think

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.430 
so within the private sector I think
security<00:01:07.150> is<00:01:07.180> becoming<00:01:07.630> increasingly<00:01:07.720> a<00:01:08.259> bore

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
security is becoming increasingly a bore

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.710 
security is becoming increasingly a bore
level<00:01:08.680> agenda<00:01:09.100> there<00:01:09.820> people<00:01:10.210> are<00:01:10.299> starting

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
level agenda there people are starting

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.450 
level agenda there people are starting
to<00:01:10.750> understand<00:01:11.170> and<00:01:11.350> draw<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.619> direct<00:01:11.950> link

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
to understand and draw a direct link

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.359 
to understand and draw a direct link
between<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.780> security<00:01:14.409> incident<00:01:14.500> disclosure

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
between a security incident disclosure

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.210 
between a security incident disclosure
or<00:01:15.670> even<00:01:16.060> a<00:01:16.119> perceived<00:01:16.540> disclosure<00:01:17.140> or<00:01:17.440> bridge

or even a perceived disclosure or bridge

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.870 
or even a perceived disclosure or bridge
and<00:01:18.900> share<00:01:19.900> price<00:01:20.369> stakeholder<00:01:21.369> value<00:01:21.520> a

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
reputation or damage financial loss so

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.820 
reputation or damage financial loss so
that<00:01:25.090> link<00:01:25.299> has<00:01:25.450> been<00:01:25.570> increasingly<00:01:26.470> drawn

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
that link has been increasingly drawn

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.740 
that link has been increasingly drawn
between<00:01:27.100> you<00:01:27.759> know<00:01:27.880> between<00:01:28.030> a<00:01:28.210> board<00:01:28.509> level

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
between you know between a board level

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.160 
between you know between a board level
and<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:30.009> user<00:01:30.190> or<00:01:30.399> the<00:01:30.520> employee<00:01:31.170> that

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
and the user or the employee that

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.870 
and the user or the employee that
changes<00:01:32.680> completely<00:01:32.979> how<00:01:33.310> securities

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
changes completely how securities

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.430 
changes completely how securities
delivered<00:01:34.360> how<00:01:34.630> its<00:01:34.810> seen<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:35.229> how<00:01:35.289> its

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
delivered how its seen and how its

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.649 
delivered how its seen and how its
invested<00:01:35.890> in<00:01:36.009> within<00:01:36.220> organizations<00:01:37.000> so<00:01:37.630> I

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
invested in within organizations so I

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.810 
invested in within organizations so I
think<00:01:37.869> from<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.200> from<00:01:38.470> a<00:01:38.610> private<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:39.759> a

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
think from it from a private and a

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.999 
think from it from a private and a
commercial<00:01:40.330> view<00:01:40.630> we're<00:01:41.320> seeing<00:01:41.350> huge<00:01:41.800> amount

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
commercial view we're seeing huge amount

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.010 
commercial view we're seeing huge amount
of<00:01:42.100> investment<00:01:42.340> huge<00:01:43.179> amount<00:01:43.479> of<00:01:43.569> focus<00:01:43.810> and

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
of investment huge amount of focus and

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.249 
of investment huge amount of focus and
huge<00:01:44.409> amount<00:01:44.740> of<00:01:44.860> of<00:01:45.399> notoriety<00:01:45.819> and<00:01:46.479> that's

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
huge amount of of notoriety and that's

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.960 
huge amount of of notoriety and that's
challenging<00:01:47.500> security<00:01:48.340> professionals<00:01:48.850> in

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
challenging security professionals in

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.540 
challenging security professionals in
the<00:01:49.030> security<00:01:49.390> industry<00:01:49.420> I<00:01:49.929> think<00:01:50.770> in<00:01:51.009> the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
the security industry I think in the

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.790 
the security industry I think in the
public<00:01:51.850> sector<00:01:52.030> within<00:01:52.330> governments<00:01:52.990> the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
public sector within governments the

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.219 
public sector within governments the
pressure<00:01:54.039> is<00:01:54.220> twofold<00:01:54.610> one<00:01:54.880> I<00:01:55.690> think<00:01:56.050> there's

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
pressure is twofold one I think there's

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.840 
pressure is twofold one I think there's
a<00:01:56.289> huge<00:01:56.530> pressure<00:01:56.830> around<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.280> cyber<00:01:57.490> threat

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
a huge pressure around the cyber threat

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.270 
a huge pressure around the cyber threat
which<00:01:58.690> looks<00:01:58.990> primarily<00:01:59.830> at<00:02:00.009> critical

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
which looks primarily at critical

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.130 
which looks primarily at critical
national<00:02:00.429> infrastructure<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:01.810> looks<00:02:01.990> at

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
national infrastructure and it looks at

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.730 
national infrastructure and it looks at
protecting<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.770> citizens<00:02:03.069> data<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:05.500> think

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
protecting the citizens data and I think

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.919 
protecting the citizens data and I think
secondly<00:02:06.190> governments<00:02:06.909> are<00:02:07.060> trying<00:02:07.659> to

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
secondly governments are trying to

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.419 
secondly governments are trying to
maintain<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.739> develop<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:09.129> measure<00:02:09.310> of

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
maintain and develop a measure of

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.640 
maintain and develop a measure of
control<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.780> they're<00:02:10.899> trying<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.230> regulate

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
control so they're trying to regulate

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.619 
control so they're trying to regulate
industries<00:02:12.310> they're<00:02:12.459> trying<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.879> act<00:02:13.270> as

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
industries they're trying to act as

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.570 
industries they're trying to act as
maybe<00:02:14.530> it's<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.800> big<00:02:14.950> brother<00:02:15.129> but<00:02:15.370> more

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
maybe it's the big brother but more

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.280 
maybe it's the big brother but more
often<00:02:15.730> as<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.120> policeman<00:02:16.629> on<00:02:16.720> behalf<00:02:17.020> of

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
often as the policeman on behalf of

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.250 
often as the policeman on behalf of
organizations<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.190> put<00:02:18.370> in<00:02:18.489> place<00:02:19.260> standards

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
organizations to put in place standards

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260 
organizations to put in place standards
and<00:02:20.500> policies<00:02:20.650> that<00:02:21.160> people<00:02:21.489> can<00:02:21.640> can<00:02:22.120> adhere

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
and policies that people can can adhere

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.170 
and policies that people can can adhere
to<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:22.840> feel<00:02:23.200> safe<00:02:23.560> with<00:02:23.890> so<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.940> challenge

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
to and feel safe with so the challenge

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.510 
to and feel safe with so the challenge
for<00:02:25.420> organizations<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.680> not<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.160> lose<00:02:27.310> money

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
for organizations is not to lose money

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.020 
for organizations is not to lose money
is<00:02:27.910> not<00:02:28.390> look<00:02:28.750> bad<00:02:28.959> is<00:02:29.110> not<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.560> lose

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
is not look bad is not to lose

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.660 
is not look bad is not to lose
reputation<00:02:31.030> for<00:02:31.930> governments<00:02:32.890> I<00:02:33.040> think<00:02:33.550> it's

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
reputation for governments I think it's

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.190 
reputation for governments I think it's
a<00:02:33.730> much<00:02:33.879> more<00:02:34.030> paternal<00:02:34.540> instinct<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.050> protect

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
a much more paternal instinct to protect

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.860 
a much more paternal instinct to protect
and<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:36.430> help<00:02:36.640> develop<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.540> promote

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
and to help develop and promote

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.259 
and to help develop and promote
information<00:02:38.620> exchange<00:02:39.099> in<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.459> secure<00:02:39.849> way<00:02:39.879> for

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
information exchange in a secure way for

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.089 
information exchange in a secure way for
citizens<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:41.379> I<00:02:41.410> think<00:02:41.500> that's<00:02:41.769> the<00:02:41.830> duel

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
citizens so I think that's the duel

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:48.480 
citizens so I think that's the duel
challenge<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:42.610> we<00:02:42.730> see

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.910 

I<00:02:48.580> think<00:02:49.450> actually<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:50.230> know<00:02:50.350> short<00:02:50.650> and

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
I think actually you know short and

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.580 
I think actually you know short and
medium<00:02:51.280> term<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:52.120> difficult<00:02:52.720> concept<00:02:52.930> in

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
medium term is a difficult concept in

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.410 
medium term is a difficult concept in
the<00:02:53.770> industry<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.340> everything's<00:02:54.640> moving<00:02:54.910> so

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
the industry and everything's moving so

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.710 
the industry and everything's moving so
fast<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:57.550> know<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:57.700> talk<00:02:58.030> about<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:58.600> know

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
fast and you know I talk about you know

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.410 
fast and you know I talk about you know
things<00:02:58.990> we<00:02:59.140> see<00:02:59.320> on<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.500> horizon<00:02:59.620> now<00:03:00.420> we'll

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
things we see on the horizon now we'll

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.000 
things we see on the horizon now we'll
be<00:03:01.570> right<00:03:01.810> up<00:03:01.840> in<00:03:02.170> front<00:03:02.200> of<00:03:02.470> us<00:03:02.560> in<00:03:02.740> a<00:03:02.980> very

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
be right up in front of us in a very

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.980 
be right up in front of us in a very
short<00:03:03.340> space<00:03:03.760> of<00:03:03.820> time<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.510> three<00:03:04.780> key

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
short space of time and the three key

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.140 
short space of time and the three key
areas<00:03:05.140> we're<00:03:05.500> looking<00:03:05.800> at<00:03:05.980> I<00:03:06.160> think<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:06.970> first

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
areas we're looking at I think the first

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.300 
areas we're looking at I think the first
one<00:03:07.330> is<00:03:07.450> around<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:08.650> consumer<00:03:09.220> and

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
one is around the consumer and

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.160 
one is around the consumer and
consumerization<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.300> what<00:03:10.420> that<00:03:10.600> means<00:03:10.870> is

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
consumerization and what that means is

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.310 
consumerization and what that means is
is<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.650> mixture<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.480> social<00:03:13.480> media<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.870> mixture

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
is a mixture of social media a mixture

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.320 
is a mixture of social media a mixture
of<00:03:14.380> applications<00:03:15.160> as<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.340> mixture<00:03:15.640> of<00:03:15.730> facebook

the<00:03:44.440> second<00:03:44.800> piece<00:03:44.920> is<00:03:45.100> around<00:03:45.340> side<00:03:45.580> we

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
the second piece is around side we

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.730 
the second piece is around side we
talked<00:03:46.000> about<00:03:46.090> that<00:03:46.210> earlier<00:03:46.570> on<00:03:46.750> you<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:47.620> be

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
talked about that earlier on you to be

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.640 
talked about that earlier on you to be
the<00:03:48.010> issue<00:03:48.130> around<00:03:48.640> cyber<00:03:49.270> crime<00:03:49.660> around

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
the issue around cyber crime around

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.610 
the issue around cyber crime around
nation-states<00:03:51.460> around<00:03:52.360> cyber<00:03:52.630> activists<00:03:53.440> I

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
nation-states around cyber activists I

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.040 
nation-states around cyber activists I
think<00:03:54.580> this<00:03:54.700> is<00:03:54.880> something<00:03:55.090> that<00:03:55.480> is<00:03:55.630> either<00:03:55.780> a

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
think this is something that is either a

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.800 
think this is something that is either a
real<00:03:56.290> threat<00:03:56.680> your<00:03:57.430> targeted<00:03:58.030> directly<00:03:58.210> as<00:03:58.720> an

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
real threat your targeted directly as an

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.500 
real threat your targeted directly as an
individual<00:03:59.290> an<00:03:59.470> organization<00:04:00.130> or<00:04:00.510> actually

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
individual an organization or actually

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.760 
individual an organization or actually
have<00:04:01.600> perceived<00:04:01.900> threat<00:04:02.260> so<00:04:02.440> what<00:04:02.590> are<00:04:02.680> we

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
have perceived threat so what are we

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.620 
have perceived threat so what are we
doing<00:04:03.100> about<00:04:03.160> this<00:04:03.490> do<00:04:03.670> we<00:04:03.760> worry<00:04:04.090> about<00:04:04.180> these

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
doing about this do we worry about these

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.420 
doing about this do we worry about these
things<00:04:04.900> you<00:04:05.200> know<00:04:05.500> if<00:04:05.650> I'm<00:04:05.860> testing

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
things you know if I'm testing

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.490 
things you know if I'm testing
genetically<00:04:07.240> modified<00:04:07.660> crops<00:04:07.960> in<00:04:08.140> a<00:04:08.200> part<00:04:08.410> of

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
genetically modified crops in a part of

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.870 
genetically modified crops in a part of
the<00:04:08.590> world<00:04:08.800> and<00:04:09.250> we're<00:04:09.430> now<00:04:09.520> going<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:09.760> get

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
the world and we're now going to get

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.180 
the world and we're now going to get
targeted<00:04:10.150> because<00:04:10.510> I'm<00:04:10.780> doing<00:04:11.110> that<00:04:11.260> so<00:04:11.920> side

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
targeted because I'm doing that so side

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.490 
targeted because I'm doing that so side
was<00:04:12.400> a<00:04:12.430> huge<00:04:12.820> issue<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.870> I<00:04:14.020> think<00:04:14.050> the<00:04:14.290> third

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
was a huge issue and I think the third

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.280 
was a huge issue and I think the third
issue<00:04:14.680> is<00:04:15.299> an<00:04:16.299> enterprise<00:04:16.750> issue<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.230> that's

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
issue is an enterprise issue and that's

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.380 
issue is an enterprise issue and that's
around<00:04:17.650> new<00:04:18.310> delivery<00:04:18.730> model<00:04:19.000> so<00:04:19.150> we<00:04:19.270> think

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
around new delivery model so we think

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.530 
around new delivery model so we think
about<00:04:19.690> cloud<00:04:20.140> so<00:04:21.130> when<00:04:21.370> we<00:04:21.549> put<00:04:21.580> our<00:04:21.820> data<00:04:22.240> in

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
about cloud so when we put our data in

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.600 
about cloud so when we put our data in
another<00:04:22.660> suppliers<00:04:23.400> environment<00:04:24.400> when<00:04:24.490> we

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
another suppliers environment when we

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.970 
another suppliers environment when we
put<00:04:24.820> our<00:04:24.850> services<00:04:25.600> in<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:25.840> cloud<00:04:25.960> and<00:04:26.380> ask

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
put our services in the cloud and ask

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.670 
put our services in the cloud and ask
for<00:04:27.310> a<00:04:27.340> much<00:04:27.580> more<00:04:27.730> utility<00:04:28.240> based<00:04:28.390> model<00:04:28.870> who

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
for a much more utility based model who

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.650 
for a much more utility based model who
looks<00:04:29.950> after<00:04:30.130> the<00:04:30.400> information<00:04:30.970> there<00:04:31.240> how

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
looks after the information there how

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.560 
looks after the information there how
can<00:04:31.870> I<00:04:31.960> get<00:04:32.230> the<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:33.100> the<00:04:33.550> understanding<00:04:34.360> and
