00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
from civilization a little bit you know

from civilization a little bit you know
I<00:00:14.790> get<00:00:15.030> my<00:00:15.150> inspiration<00:00:15.330> from<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.529> Prairie

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
I get my inspiration from the Prairie

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.519 
I get my inspiration from the Prairie
because<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.730> Prairie<00:00:18.029> does<00:00:18.330> kind<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.840> calm<00:00:19.350> me

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
because the Prairie does kind of calm me

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.099 
because the Prairie does kind of calm me
down<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.770> takes<00:00:20.490> me<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.939> quieter<00:00:21.630> place<00:00:21.660> in

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
down and takes me to a quieter place in

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.470 
down and takes me to a quieter place in
a<00:00:22.170> simpler<00:00:22.590> place<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:23.160> think<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.910> had<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> really

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
a simpler place I think I had a really

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.509 
a simpler place I think I had a really
great<00:00:24.630> mother<00:00:24.990> she<00:00:25.320> was<00:00:25.619> not<00:00:25.769> an<00:00:25.890> uptight<00:00:26.250> mom

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
great mother she was not an uptight mom

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.550 
great mother she was not an uptight mom
and<00:00:26.820> she<00:00:27.150> was<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.300> really<00:00:27.539> good<00:00:27.630> cook<00:00:27.990> she

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
and she was a really good cook she

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.659 
and she was a really good cook she
cooked<00:00:29.070> hearty<00:00:29.730> kind<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.510> elegant<00:00:31.289> but

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
cooked hearty kind of elegant but

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.370 
cooked hearty kind of elegant but
abundant<00:00:32.669> food<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.329> think<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.809> learned<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.200> lot

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
abundant food so I think I learned a lot

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.280 
abundant food so I think I learned a lot
of<00:00:34.649> my<00:00:34.860> mom's<00:00:35.070> cooking<00:00:35.640> style<00:00:36.030> growing<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:36.989> and
