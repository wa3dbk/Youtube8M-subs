because<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:52.259> very<00:01:52.560> very<00:01:52.829> old<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:54.030> has

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
because it's very very old and it has

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.569 
because it's very very old and it has
have<00:01:54.450> some<00:01:54.659> serious<00:01:55.200> where<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.680> hair<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.460> it

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
have some serious where and hair but it

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.899 
have some serious where and hair but it
still<00:01:56.790> works<00:01:57.030> perfectly<00:01:57.540> fine<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.759> I've<00:01:59.759> just

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
still works perfectly fine and I've just

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.209 
still works perfectly fine and I've just
made<00:02:00.210> them<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.479> couple<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.869> hay<00:02:01.049> toys<00:02:01.380> rather

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
made them a couple of hay toys rather

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.859 
made them a couple of hay toys rather
than<00:02:02.430> putting<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.850> hay<00:02:03.030> rack<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.479> here<00:02:03.750> it's

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
than putting a hay rack in here it's

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.600 
than putting a hay rack in here it's
just<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.079> bit<00:02:04.200> easier<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.770> make<00:02:04.920> hay<00:02:05.100> toys<00:02:05.340> if

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
just a bit easier to make hay toys if

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.859 
just a bit easier to make hay toys if
you<00:02:05.700> want<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.939> nibble<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.210> little<00:02:06.240> bit<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.600> hay

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
you want to nibble a little bit of hay

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.119 
you want to nibble a little bit of hay
and<00:02:08.300> so<00:02:09.300> yeah<00:02:09.450> that's<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.840> really<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.530> might

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
and so yeah that's it really I might

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.500 
and so yeah that's it really I might
even<00:02:11.160> get<00:02:11.400> some<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.610> their<00:02:11.760> willow<00:02:11.940> balls<00:02:12.209> down

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
even get some of their willow balls down

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.670 
even get some of their willow balls down
when<00:02:13.050> they're<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.319> more

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
when they're it more

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.119 
when they're it more
but<00:02:14.189> I<00:02:14.459> think<00:02:15.299> this<00:02:15.450> time<00:02:15.689> of<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.200> afternoon

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
but I think this time of the afternoon

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.640 
but I think this time of the afternoon
is<00:02:17.459> like<00:02:17.760> they're<00:02:17.939> quiet<00:02:18.269> time<00:02:18.689> the<00:02:19.469> really

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
is like they're quiet time the really

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.380 
is like they're quiet time the really
active<00:02:20.069> first<00:02:20.370> thing<00:02:20.579> in<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.700> morning<00:02:21.150> and

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
active first thing in the morning and

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.300 
active first thing in the morning and
then<00:02:21.540> they<00:02:22.109> sort<00:02:22.349> of<00:02:22.439> have<00:02:22.650> their<00:02:22.799> lunch<00:02:23.010> in

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
then they sort of have their lunch in

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.819 
then they sort of have their lunch in
there<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.459> little<00:02:23.549> bit<00:02:23.900> tired<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:25.049> bit<00:02:25.140> quiet<00:02:25.500> and

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
there a little bit tired a bit quiet and

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.289 
there a little bit tired a bit quiet and
then<00:02:25.950> they<00:02:26.129> seemed<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.430> perk<00:02:26.670> up<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:26.939> little<00:02:27.180> bit

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
then they seemed to perk up a little bit

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.110 
then they seemed to perk up a little bit
again<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.659> evening<00:02:27.689> so<00:02:28.109> I<00:02:28.560> think<00:02:29.010> as<00:02:29.939> the
