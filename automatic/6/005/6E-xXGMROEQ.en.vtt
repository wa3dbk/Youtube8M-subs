00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.029 
it sounds a bit crazy but when we look
at<00:00:28.119> this<00:00:28.270> actual<00:00:28.750> car<00:00:28.930> first<00:00:29.619> of<00:00:29.770> all<00:00:29.800> it's

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
at this actual car first of all it's

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.980 
at this actual car first of all it's
quite<00:00:30.430> light<00:00:30.730> like<00:00:31.210> you'd<00:00:31.360> expect<00:00:31.480> something

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
quite light like you'd expect something

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.990 
quite light like you'd expect something
like<00:00:32.169> this<00:00:32.289> to<00:00:32.469> be<00:00:32.770> quite<00:00:33.100> heavy<00:00:33.340> it's

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
like this to be quite heavy it's

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.729 
like this to be quite heavy it's
actually<00:00:34.270> quite<00:00:34.390> sort<00:00:34.690> of<00:00:34.719> plastic<00:00:35.379> tacky

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
actually quite sort of plastic tacky

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.829 
actually quite sort of plastic tacky
feeling<00:00:36.280> and<00:00:36.730> along<00:00:36.969> the<00:00:37.120> bottom<00:00:37.269> side<00:00:37.600> is

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
feeling and along the bottom side is

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.290 
feeling and along the bottom side is
just<00:00:38.050> this<00:00:38.199> sort<00:00:38.469> of<00:00:38.760> conveyor<00:00:39.760> belt<00:00:40.030> thing

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
just this sort of conveyor belt thing

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.840 
just this sort of conveyor belt thing
how<00:00:40.899> it<00:00:41.079> works<00:00:41.319> if<00:00:41.649> you<00:00:41.739> drive<00:00:42.039> it<00:00:42.249> along<00:00:42.489> like

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
how it works if you drive it along like

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.239 
how it works if you drive it along like
a<00:00:42.879> normal<00:00:43.269> car<00:00:43.449> towards<00:00:44.019> wolf<00:00:44.260> full<00:00:44.649> speed<00:00:45.010> and

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:45.249 
a normal car towards wolf full speed and

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:47.669 
a normal car towards wolf full speed and
when<00:00:45.760> you<00:00:45.879> get<00:00:46.059> there<00:00:46.329> and<00:00:46.600> it<00:00:46.899> starts<00:00:47.379> moving

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
when you get there and it starts moving

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:50.399 
when you get there and it starts moving
and<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.339> internal<00:00:48.729> throttles<00:00:49.329> kicking<00:00:50.139> when

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.409 
and the internal throttles kicking when

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.009 
and the internal throttles kicking when
it<00:00:50.559> reaches<00:00:50.889> a<00:00:50.920> 45<00:00:51.579> degree<00:00:51.819> angle<00:00:52.089> and<00:00:52.510> this

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
it reaches a 45 degree angle and this

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.959 
it reaches a 45 degree angle and this
particular<00:00:53.229> material<00:00:54.010> actually<00:00:54.190> sticks<00:00:54.760> to

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
particular material actually sticks to

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.149 
particular material actually sticks to
the<00:00:55.059> wall<00:00:55.089> and<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:56.229> manual<00:00:56.679> says<00:00:56.710> you<00:00:57.010> can

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
the wall and the manual says you can

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.129 
the wall and the manual says you can
navigate<00:00:57.309> upwards<00:00:57.969> downwards<00:00:58.179> sideways

00:00:59.129 --> 00:00:59.139 
navigate upwards downwards sideways

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:01.289 
navigate upwards downwards sideways
until<00:00:59.829> of<00:01:00.039> tests<00:01:00.370> so<00:01:00.579> far<00:01:00.609> we've<00:01:01.030> managed<00:01:01.269> to

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
until of tests so far we've managed to

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:03.090 
until of tests so far we've managed to
go<00:01:01.479> up<00:01:01.629> a<00:01:01.659> wall<00:01:01.960> but<00:01:02.409> sort<00:01:02.679> of<00:01:02.739> coming<00:01:03.069> down

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
go up a wall but sort of coming down

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.979 
go up a wall but sort of coming down
sort<00:01:03.639> of<00:01:03.729> involves<00:01:04.150> screaming<00:01:04.690> and<00:01:04.839> jumping

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
sort of involves screaming and jumping

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.440 
sort of involves screaming and jumping
out<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.379> way<00:01:05.620> it<00:01:06.340> also<00:01:06.640> makes<00:01:06.790> really

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
out the way it also makes really

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.149 
out the way it also makes really
horrible<00:01:07.870> noise<00:01:08.080> when<00:01:08.409> you<00:01:08.440> turn<00:01:08.680> it<00:01:08.710> on<00:01:08.920> and

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
horrible noise when you turn it on and

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.429 
horrible noise when you turn it on and
it<00:01:09.520> so<00:01:09.579> you<00:01:10.210> charge<00:01:10.539> it<00:01:10.689> up<00:01:10.780> for<00:01:10.960> about<00:01:11.110> 12

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
it so you charge it up for about 12

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.529 
it so you charge it up for about 12
hours<00:01:11.590> it's<00:01:11.979> only<00:01:12.219> about<00:01:12.280> 20<00:01:12.820> minutes<00:01:13.000> actual

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
hours it's only about 20 minutes actual

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:16.170 
hours it's only about 20 minutes actual
usage<00:01:13.750> which<00:01:14.500> is<00:01:14.619> a<00:01:14.649> bit<00:01:14.860> sucky<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.549> it<00:01:15.759> is<00:01:15.880> 80

technology and new products it always

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.770 
technology and new products it always
starts<00:02:00.249> price<00:02:00.700> starts<00:02:01.090> quite<00:02:01.270> higher<00:02:01.479> then<00:02:01.689> it

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
enjoy this and Here I am about to test

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.340 
enjoy this and Here I am about to test
it<00:02:12.550> for<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:12.790> by<00:02:12.910> our<00:02:13.060> very<00:02:13.240> own<00:02:13.600> good<00:02:14.140> wolf

it for you by our very own good wolf
this<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.740> glass

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
this is glass

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.820 
this is glass
does<00:02:15.570> actually<00:02:15.720> go<00:02:16.050> in<00:02:16.230> all<00:02:16.410> sorts<00:02:16.650> of

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
does actually go in all sorts of

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.430 
does actually go in all sorts of
surfaces<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:18.060> now<00:02:18.240> let's<00:02:18.600> see<00:02:18.810> how<00:02:19.020> well<00:02:19.230> this

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
surfaces so now let's see how well this

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:31.680 
surfaces so now let's see how well this
works<00:02:20.480> moving<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.630> side<00:02:28.610> okay

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.960 

now<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.320> navigation<00:02:33.130> of<00:02:33.190> it<00:02:33.400> is<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.640> bit<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:33.880> a

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
now the navigation of it is a bit of a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.220 
now the navigation of it is a bit of a
problem

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
problem

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.380 
problem
now<00:02:35.800> going<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.069> go<00:02:36.190> sideways<00:02:36.640> at<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.209> world

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
now going to go sideways at the world

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.770 
now going to go sideways at the world
which<00:02:38.290> wasn't<00:02:38.590> quite<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.069> plan<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.790> it's

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
which wasn't quite the plan and it's

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.860 
which wasn't quite the plan and it's
tough<00:02:41.580> but<00:02:42.580> what<00:02:42.819> if<00:02:43.150> you're<00:02:43.420> going<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.599> go<00:02:43.720> up

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
tough but what if you're going to go up

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.809 
tough but what if you're going to go up
the<00:02:44.019> wall<00:02:44.170> again

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.670 

and<00:02:49.420> here<00:02:49.780> we've<00:02:49.989> got<00:02:50.019> some<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.409> it<00:02:50.499> just

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
and here we've got some of it just

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.720 
and here we've got some of it just
working<00:02:51.159> with<00:02:51.249> the<00:02:51.340> color<00:02:53.099> not<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.189> fastest

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
working with the color not the fastest

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.020 
working with the color not the fastest
model<00:02:55.060> on<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.150> market<00:02:55.689> let's<00:02:55.900> play<00:02:56.170> nice<00:02:56.349> and

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
model on the market let's play nice and

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.459 
model on the market let's play nice and
the<00:02:58.030> fact<00:02:58.239> that<00:02:58.329> if<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.599> get<00:02:58.749> two<00:02:58.959> roles<00:02:59.170> in

00:02:59.459 --> 00:02:59.469 
the fact that if you get two roles in

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.180 
the fact that if you get two roles in
flight<00:02:59.709> okay

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
flight okay

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.680 
flight okay
you<00:03:03.190> can<00:03:03.340> only<00:03:03.460> climb<00:03:03.730> walls<00:03:03.940> without<00:03:04.150> setting

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
you can only climb walls without setting

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.270 
you can only climb walls without setting
boards<00:03:04.990> but<00:03:05.080> you<00:03:05.200> can<00:03:05.410> use<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.680> little<00:03:06.070> ramp

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
boards but you can use a little ramp

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
boards but you can use a little ramp
what<00:03:06.490> you<00:03:06.640> want<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:08.440> if<00:03:08.800> any<00:03:09.430> surface<00:03:10.120> is

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
what you want so if any surface is

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.530 
what you want so if any surface is
conquerable<00:03:10.840> I<00:03:11.520> know<00:03:12.520> it's<00:03:12.820> quite<00:03:13.090> good<00:03:13.300> toy

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
conquerable I know it's quite good toy

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.450 
conquerable I know it's quite good toy
for<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:13.930> few<00:03:14.260> design<00:03:14.590> things<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:15.100> can<00:03:15.310> be

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
for a few design things that can be

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.790 
for a few design things that can be
worked<00:03:15.580> out<00:03:15.880> but<00:03:16.360> for<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:16.750> first<00:03:17.050> model<00:03:17.470> zero

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
worked out but for a first model zero

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.800 
worked out but for a first model zero
gravity<00:03:18.100> wall<00:03:18.460> climber<00:03:18.910> vez<00:03:19.120> definitely<00:03:19.630> gets

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
gravity wall climber vez definitely gets

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.470 
gravity wall climber vez definitely gets
a<00:03:19.960> thumbs<00:03:20.170> up
