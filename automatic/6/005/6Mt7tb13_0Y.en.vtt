the<00:00:18.630> TNT<00:00:19.230> but<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.859> good<00:00:19.980> thing<00:00:20.010> about<00:00:20.189> this

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the TNT but the good thing about this

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.890 
the TNT but the good thing about this
one<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.789> when<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.060> open<00:00:21.210> up<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.539> door<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
one is when you open up the door the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.500 
one is when you open up the door the
door<00:00:22.140> sound<00:00:22.439> hides<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.369> piston<00:00:23.760> sound<00:00:24.000> so

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
door sound hides the piston sound so

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.150 
door sound hides the piston sound so
people<00:00:24.840> won't<00:00:25.019> know<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.289> when<00:00:25.680> they<00:00:25.800> open<00:00:25.830> up

you're gonna maybe use 30 TNT I'm not
sure<00:01:27.900> but<00:01:28.049> you're<00:01:28.140> only<00:01:28.259> gonna<00:01:28.409> need<00:01:28.530> one<00:01:28.680> for

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
sure but you're only gonna need one for

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.080 
sure but you're only gonna need one for
it<00:01:29.400> for<00:01:30.270> torches<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.530> dust<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.579> immovable

it for torches to dust and to immovable

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.080 
it for torches to dust and to immovable
objects<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.659> choose<00:01:34.110> furnaces<00:01:34.710> because<00:01:35.090> well

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
objects I choose furnaces because well

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.700 
objects I choose furnaces because well
furnace<00:01:36.450> has<00:01:36.570> only<00:01:36.750> caused<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.200> cobblestone

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
furnace has only caused a cobblestone

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.289 
furnace has only caused a cobblestone
and<00:01:38.189> guess<00:01:38.490> what<00:01:38.670> you're<00:01:38.820> gonna<00:01:38.909> have<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> lot

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
and guess what you're gonna have a lot

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.580 
and guess what you're gonna have a lot
of<00:01:39.329> cobblestone<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:40.049> you're<00:01:40.170> doing<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.470> on

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
of cobblestone if you're doing this on

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.740 
of cobblestone if you're doing this on
survival<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.850> we<00:01:42.240> got<00:01:42.360> our<00:01:42.479> nice<00:01:42.600> little

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
survival so we got our nice little

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.880 
survival so we got our nice little
double<00:01:43.140> door<00:01:43.320> right<00:01:43.470> here<00:01:43.590> we're<00:01:43.740> gonna<00:01:43.799> have

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
double door right here we're gonna have

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.440 
double door right here we're gonna have
to<00:01:44.040> dig<00:01:44.189> down<00:01:44.310> at<00:01:44.490> least<00:01:44.640> four<00:01:44.939> for<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.210> build

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
to dig down at least four for this build

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.730 
to dig down at least four for this build
as<00:01:45.600> well<00:01:45.720> that's<00:01:45.960> why<00:01:46.049> I'm<00:01:46.200> down<00:01:46.350> here<00:01:46.409> we<00:01:46.649> got

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
as well that's why I'm down here we got

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.590 
as well that's why I'm down here we got
to<00:01:46.860> take<00:01:46.979> down<00:01:47.009> these<00:01:47.280> four<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.479> what

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
to take down these four so this is what

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.550 
to take down these four so this is what
I<00:01:48.630> meant<00:01:48.899> by<00:01:48.960> you're<00:01:49.140> gonna<00:01:49.259> have<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.470> at<00:01:49.530> least

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
I meant by you're gonna have to at least

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.710 
I meant by you're gonna have to at least
cover<00:01:49.950> up<00:01:50.189> something<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:51.270> these<00:01:51.540> two

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
cover up something because on these two

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.969 
cover up something because on these two
sides<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.200> doors<00:01:52.409> we're<00:01:52.560> gonna<00:01:52.649> have<00:01:52.860> to

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
sides of the doors we're gonna have to

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.010 
sides of the doors we're gonna have to
put<00:01:53.159> some<00:01:53.369> sticky<00:01:53.729> pistons<00:01:54.149> now<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.689> reason

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
put some sticky pistons now the reason

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.359 
put some sticky pistons now the reason
why<00:01:55.110> I'm<00:01:55.229> doing<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.619> both<00:01:55.829> sides<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
why I'm doing it on both sides of the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.580 
why I'm doing it on both sides of the
door<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.759> because<00:01:57.180> well<00:01:57.540> what<00:01:57.719> happens<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.320> one

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
door is because well what happens if one

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.870 
door is because well what happens if one
person<00:01:58.950> goes<00:01:59.040> through<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.340> side<00:01:59.579> or<00:01:59.850> that

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
person goes through this side or that

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.580 
person goes through this side or that
side<00:02:00.090> because<00:02:01.020> if<00:02:01.140> they<00:02:01.229> go<00:02:01.320> through<00:02:01.439> this

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
side because if they go through this

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.160 
side because if they go through this
side<00:02:01.829> then<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.159> one<00:02:02.340> won't<00:02:02.520> activate<00:02:03.170> so

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
side then this one won't activate so

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.350 
side then this one won't activate so
it's<00:02:04.290> gonna<00:02:04.380> look<00:02:04.469> something<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.890> and

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
it's gonna look something like that and

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.999 
it's gonna look something like that and
then<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.719> then<00:02:07.170> we're<00:02:07.290> gonna<00:02:07.380> put<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:07.799> our

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
then to the then we're gonna put in our

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.130 
then to the then we're gonna put in our
removable<00:02:08.369> objects<00:02:08.879> for<00:02:09.030> now<00:02:09.119> like<00:02:09.750> these

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
removable objects for now like these

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.690 
removable objects for now like these
will<00:02:10.289> cut<00:02:10.470> these<00:02:10.619> will<00:02:10.770> be<00:02:10.920> taken<00:02:11.250> out<00:02:11.400> these

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
will cut these will be taken out these

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.010 
will cut these will be taken out these
will<00:02:11.879> be<00:02:12.060> taken<00:02:12.420> out<00:02:12.540> so

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
will be taken out so

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.380 
will be taken out so
don't<00:02:13.230> worry<00:02:13.380> about<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:14.060> next<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.270> the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
don't worry about that next to the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.090 
don't worry about that next to the
left-hand<00:02:15.930> side<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.470> block<00:02:16.680> that's<00:02:16.950> in

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
left-hand side of the block that's in

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.620 
left-hand side of the block that's in
front<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.400> our<00:02:17.490> sticky<00:02:17.790> pistons<00:02:18.030> gonna<00:02:18.300> delete

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
front of our sticky pistons gonna delete

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
front of our sticky pistons gonna delete
these<00:02:18.810> two<00:02:19.130> I'm<00:02:20.130> gonna<00:02:20.370> put<00:02:20.550> torches<00:02:20.820> there

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
these two I'm gonna put torches there

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.230 
these two I'm gonna put torches there
like<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.920> now<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.700> reason<00:02:24.000> why<00:02:24.090> those

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
like that now the reason why those

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.240 
like that now the reason why those
torches<00:02:24.540> are<00:02:24.720> there<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.080> so<00:02:25.650> when<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.920> person

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
torches are there is so when the person

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.130 
torches are there is so when the person
opens<00:02:26.490> up<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.730> door<00:02:26.970> then<00:02:27.600> get<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:27.990> door

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
opens up the door then get that door

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.980 
opens up the door then get that door
when<00:02:28.800> someone<00:02:29.040> opens<00:02:29.340> up<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.610> door<00:02:29.990> the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
when someone opens up the door the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.680 
when someone opens up the door the
sticky<00:02:31.290> piston<00:02:31.620> will<00:02:31.800> activate<00:02:32.790> pushing<00:02:33.540> down

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
sticky piston will activate pushing down

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.630 
sticky piston will activate pushing down
the<00:02:33.840> block<00:02:34.080> because<00:02:34.770> this<00:02:35.040> acts<00:02:35.310> like<00:02:35.490> a

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
the block because this acts like a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.460 
the block because this acts like a
updater<00:02:36.270> for<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.570> block<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:36.900> let<00:02:37.110> me<00:02:37.230> see<00:02:37.290> let

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
updater for the block so let me see let

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.330 
updater for the block so let me see let
me<00:02:37.530> just<00:02:37.620> show<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:37.830> if<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.040> delete<00:02:38.310> that

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
me just show you if I delete that

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.150 
me just show you if I delete that
furnace<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.000> click<00:02:39.780> this<00:02:39.960> open<00:02:40.260> as<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.040> can

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
furnace and I click this open as you can

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.920 
furnace and I click this open as you can
see<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.400> piston<00:02:41.790> updates<00:02:42.240> because<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.630> torch

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
see the piston updates because the torch

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.680 
see the piston updates because the torch
will<00:02:43.110> update<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:44.120> but<00:02:45.120> as<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.450> can<00:02:45.570> see<00:02:45.630> it

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
will update it but as you can see it
