00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
for all those bullets as a chance that

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.160 
for all those bullets as a chance that
when<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.009> reload<00:00:32.420> there'll<00:00:33.420> be<00:00:33.450> an<00:00:33.630> explosion

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170

manage to do this it does take a while

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.319 
manage to do this it does take a while
it's<00:00:43.860> not<00:00:44.129> some<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.579> ham<00:00:44.730> straight<00:00:45.090> away

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329

on the bullets now this is a very very
effective<00:01:23.580> way<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.759> mean<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.000> can<00:01:24.119> do<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.360> with

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
effective way I mean you can do it with

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.179 
effective way I mean you can do it with
other<00:01:24.570> guns<00:01:24.840> shotguns<00:01:25.290> or<00:01:25.799> anything<00:01:26.159> like

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
that but it's it's really effective

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.679 
that but it's it's really effective

outside the gang so it doesn't shut and
the<00:01:44.430> bullets<00:01:44.729> are<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.479> more<00:01:45.720> effective

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
the bullets are so it's more effective

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.389 
the bullets are so it's more effective
online<00:01:46.290> because<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.740> bullet<00:01:46.920> seemed<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.280> do

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
online because the bullet seemed to do

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.639 
online because the bullet seemed to do
more<00:01:47.579> damage<00:01:47.820> but<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.780> kill<00:01:48.960> hyperius<00:01:49.560> in

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
more damage but you can kill hyperius in

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.100 
more damage but you can kill hyperius in
a<00:01:49.710> matter<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.950> seconds<00:01:50.689> so<00:01:51.689> much<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:51.960> on

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
a matter of seconds so much so on

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.300 
a matter of seconds so much so on
talking<00:01:52.350> about<00:01:52.409> i'm<00:01:52.619> going<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.860> run<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.280> him

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
talking about i'm going to run up to him

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.819 
talking about i'm going to run up to him
because<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.270> easier<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.780> do<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.049> from<00:01:55.619> close

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
because it's easier to do it from close

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.819 
because it's easier to do it from close
range<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.280> doing<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.549> by<00:01:56.670> itself<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.829> what

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
range of you doing it by itself and what

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.530 
range of you doing it by itself and what
this<00:01:58.979> actually<00:01:59.159> will<00:01:59.490> do<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.240> start

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
this actually will do and just start

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.080 
this actually will do and just start
firing<00:02:00.840> random<00:02:01.290> bullet<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.680> cook<00:02:02.399> itself<00:02:04.100> gone

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
firing random bullet in cook itself gone

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.380 
firing random bullet in cook itself gone
see<00:02:06.750> how<00:02:07.439> awesome<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.300> obviously<00:02:09.300> you

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
if they got a shield as that as it will

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.140 
if they got a shield as that as it will
do<00:02:26.430> now<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:27.750> will<00:02:27.900> put<00:02:28.080> yourself<00:02:28.379> back<00:02:28.500> down

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
so if you look at this that that's a

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.660 
so if you look at this that that's a
very<00:02:32.160> very<00:02:32.879> easy<00:02:33.239> way<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.810> killing<00:02:34.489> her<00:02:35.489> the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
very very easy way of killing her the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.410 
very very easy way of killing her the
Invincibles<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.299> it<00:02:36.360> does<00:02:36.510> work<00:02:38.299> with<00:02:39.299> the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
Invincibles and it does work with the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.100 
Invincibles and it does work with the
other<00:02:39.569> Invincibles<00:02:40.049> as<00:02:40.140> well<00:02:40.319> if<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.400> think

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
other Invincibles as well if I think

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.589 
other Invincibles as well if I think
she's<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.140> bit<00:02:43.560> harder<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.750> kill<00:02:45.750> but<00:02:47.420> you<00:02:48.420> can

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
she's a bit harder to kill but you can

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:49.699 
she's a bit harder to kill but you can
do<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:48.930> now<00:02:49.110> what<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.290> was<00:02:49.440> talking<00:02:49.560> about

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
do this now what I was talking about

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.180 
do this now what I was talking about
doing<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.340> with<00:02:50.489> other<00:02:51.480> people<00:02:51.920> you<00:02:52.920> have<00:02:53.069> to

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
doing it with other people you have to

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.979 
doing it with other people you have to
do<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.340> think<00:02:53.670> it's<00:02:53.790> about<00:02:53.849> five<00:02:54.209> times<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.810> can

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
do I think it's about five times you can

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.550 
do I think it's about five times you can
do<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:56.299> then<00:02:57.299> by<00:02:57.750> let's<00:02:57.959> say<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.170> have<00:02:58.349> to<00:02:58.440> go

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
do this then by let's say you have to go

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.140 
do this then by let's say you have to go
back<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.769> pickle<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.250> loot<00:02:59.400> up<00:02:59.549> you<00:02:59.760> can<00:02:59.940> just

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
back and pickle the loot up you can just

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.580 
back and pickle the loot up you can just
keep<00:03:00.329> doing<00:03:00.629> it's<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.840> really<00:03:01.049> work<00:03:01.260> good<00:03:01.410> way

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
keep doing it's a really work good way

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.240 
keep doing it's a really work good way
