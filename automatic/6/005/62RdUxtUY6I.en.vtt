00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
pick me any half time because the

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.689 
pick me any half time because the
corners<00:07:19.659> are<00:07:19.840> not<00:07:20.020> that<00:07:20.199> good<00:07:20.409> you<00:07:20.800> know<00:07:21.039> match

our favorites the broncos with that and

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.629 
our favorites the broncos with that and
basically<00:07:25.300> and<00:07:26.199> basically<00:07:26.770> it's<00:07:27.189> going<00:07:27.460> to<00:07:27.520> be

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:27.639 
basically and basically it's going to be

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:30.719 
basically and basically it's going to be
a<00:07:27.990> battle<00:07:28.990> between<00:07:29.169> Allah<00:07:29.949> and<00:07:29.979> Allah<00:07:30.279> and

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:30.729 
a battle between Allah and Allah and

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:33.240 
a battle between Allah and Allah and
I'll<00:07:30.940> kick<00:07:31.300> the<00:07:31.659> Deveraux<00:07:32.080> Bronco<00:07:32.620> oats<00:07:32.860> the

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:33.250 
I'll kick the Deveraux Bronco oats the

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.519 
I'll kick the Deveraux Bronco oats the
reason<00:07:33.580> is<00:07:33.699> because<00:07:33.879> I<00:07:34.569> think<00:07:35.169> they<00:07:35.229> have<00:07:35.409> the

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:35.529 
reason is because I think they have the

00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:38.159 
reason is because I think they have the
better<00:07:35.680> not<00:07:35.949> sure<00:07:36.159> on<00:07:36.430> I<00:07:36.940> think<00:07:37.840> that<00:07:37.900> the

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:38.169 
better not sure on I think that the

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:40.379 
better not sure on I think that the
offensive<00:07:38.560> line<00:07:38.740> of<00:07:39.219> the<00:07:39.400> Ravens<00:07:39.849> will<00:07:40.089> not<00:07:40.210> be

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:40.389 
offensive line of the Ravens will not be

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:43.409 
offensive line of the Ravens will not be
able<00:07:40.479> to<00:07:40.690> hold<00:07:40.870> their<00:07:41.379> pass<00:07:41.949> rush<00:07:42.279> and<00:07:42.639> that

00:07:43.409 --> 00:07:43.419 
able to hold their pass rush and that

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:47.700 
able to hold their pass rush and that
all<00:07:43.719> it's<00:07:44.409> gonna<00:07:44.529> be<00:07:44.680> a<00:07:44.710> close<00:07:44.889> game<00:07:44.979> but<00:07:46.710> it's

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:47.710 
all it's gonna be a close game but it's

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.879 
all it's gonna be a close game but it's
just<00:07:47.979> that<00:07:48.219> the<00:07:48.969> i<00:07:49.389> think<00:07:49.750> that<00:07:49.960> the<00:07:50.110> broncos

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:50.889 
just that the i think that the broncos

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:54.589 
just that the i think that the broncos
have<00:07:50.919> too<00:07:51.400> many<00:07:52.169> the<00:07:53.169> Ravens<00:07:53.710> I<00:07:53.919> mean<00:07:54.400> the

00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 
have too many the Ravens I mean the

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:57.809 
have too many the Ravens I mean the
Broncos<00:07:55.599> have<00:07:55.930> too<00:07:56.710> many<00:07:56.889> problems<00:07:57.190> for<00:07:57.669> them

00:07:57.809 --> 00:07:57.819 
Broncos have too many problems for them

00:07:57.819 --> 00:08:01.769 
Broncos have too many problems for them
so<00:07:58.180> I<00:07:58.449> picked<00:07:59.050> the<00:07:59.110> Broncos<00:07:59.729> the<00:08:00.729> score<00:08:01.240> is

00:08:01.769 --> 00:08:01.779 
so I picked the Broncos the score is

00:08:01.779 --> 00:08:07.730 
so I picked the Broncos the score is
going<00:08:02.169> to<00:08:02.319> be<00:08:03.990> 21<00:08:04.990> no<00:08:05.830> actually<00:08:06.190> scratch<00:08:06.969> that

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:07.740 
going to be 21 no actually scratch that

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:12.270 
going to be 21 no actually scratch that
28<00:08:08.740> to<00:08:09.669> 17
