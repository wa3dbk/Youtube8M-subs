course and then there's this fabric

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.390 
course and then there's this fabric
paint<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:40.159> fabric<00:01:41.159> paint

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
paint that is just like a fabric paint

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.980 
paint that is just like a fabric paint
that's<00:01:41.729> exactly<00:01:42.180> what<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.840> can

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
some point these smaller fabric paints

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.870 
some point these smaller fabric paints
come<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.909> various<00:01:57.840> colors<00:01:57.950> lots<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.340> colors

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and with these you can actually write

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.770 
and with these you can actually write
directly<00:02:02.939> onto<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.420> fabric<00:02:04.579> or<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:06.090> can<00:02:06.329> once

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
directly onto the fabric or you can once

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.440 
directly onto the fabric or you can once
again<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.380> can<00:02:07.560> spread<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.099> out<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.670> paint

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
again you can spread it out and paint

did<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.690> t-shirt<00:03:58.079> I'm<00:03:58.199> going<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.470> make<00:03:58.620> first

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
did the t-shirt I'm going to make first

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.849 
did the t-shirt I'm going to make first
I<00:03:59.280> actually<00:03:59.669> made<00:04:00.359> my<00:04:00.389> own<00:04:00.599> stencil<00:04:01.290> now<00:04:01.799> the

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
I actually made my own stencil now the

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.039 
I actually made my own stencil now the
way<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:02.220> this<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.819> a<00:04:02.849> microphone<00:04:03.419> and<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.870> way<00:04:04.019> I

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
way I this is a microphone and the way I

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.920 
way I this is a microphone and the way I
did<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:04.470> was<00:04:04.829> I<00:04:04.980> actually<00:04:05.190> found<00:04:05.639> a<00:04:06.000> JPEG<00:04:06.569> of

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
did that was I actually found a JPEG of

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.809 
did that was I actually found a JPEG of
a<00:04:07.440> microphone<00:04:08.069> and<00:04:08.660> I<00:04:09.660> put<00:04:10.440> this<00:04:10.680> under<00:04:11.519> my

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
a microphone and I put this under my

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.170 
a microphone and I put this under my
stencil<00:04:12.780> which<00:04:13.139> made<00:04:13.379> it<00:04:13.560> so<00:04:14.069> easy<00:04:14.099> to<00:04:14.669> do<00:04:14.879> and

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
stencil which made it so easy to do and

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.770 
stencil which made it so easy to do and
then<00:04:15.959> I<00:04:16.289> used<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.370> light<00:04:17.669> colored<00:04:18.209> sharpie

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
then I used a light colored sharpie

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.960 
then I used a light colored sharpie
marker<00:04:18.810> and<00:04:19.530> I'm<00:04:20.220> real<00:04:20.430> good<00:04:20.549> with<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.820> light

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
marker and I'm real good with the light

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.969 
marker and I'm real good with the light
colors<00:04:21.359> because<00:04:21.840> if<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.169> mess<00:04:22.409> it<00:04:22.440> up<00:04:22.680> you<00:04:22.740> can

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
colors because if you mess it up you can

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.920 
colors because if you mess it up you can
always<00:04:23.130> go<00:04:23.430> over<00:04:23.969> it<00:04:24.060> with<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.240> darker<00:04:24.690> color

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
always go over it with a darker color

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.050 
always go over it with a darker color
you<00:04:25.260> know<00:04:25.590> for<00:04:26.039> correction

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
you know for correction

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.990 
you know for correction
so<00:04:27.420> I<00:04:27.450> used<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.170> light<00:04:28.410> color<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:29.070> I<00:04:29.520> traced

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
so I used a light color and I traced

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.240 
so I used a light color and I traced
