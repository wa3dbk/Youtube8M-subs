opinions<00:01:45.630> about<00:01:45.780> yeah<00:01:46.079> there<00:01:46.350> was<00:01:46.470> some<00:01:46.619> um<00:01:46.950> I

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460

guess criticism about how race is dealt

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.950 
guess criticism about how race is dealt
with<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:50.369> our<00:01:51.000> show<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.420> then<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.540> think<00:01:51.780> maybe

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
with on our show and then I think maybe

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.929 
with on our show and then I think maybe
it<00:01:52.170> was<00:01:52.829> stereotypical<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.549> maybe<00:01:53.700> played

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
it was stereotypical and maybe played

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.429 
it was stereotypical and maybe played
into<00:01:54.119> some<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.360> those<00:01:54.420> stereotypes<00:01:54.780> I'm<00:01:55.079> not

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
into some of those stereotypes I'm not

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.109 
into some of those stereotypes I'm not
in<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> room<00:01:55.829> I'll<00:01:56.369> shave<00:01:56.640> off<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.880> question

in the room I'll shave off that question

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:57.950 
in the room I'll shave off that question
by<00:01:57.180> saying<00:01:57.210> I'm<00:01:57.390> not<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> right<00:01:57.689> person<00:01:57.780> but

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
by saying I'm not the right person but

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.780 
by saying I'm not the right person but
