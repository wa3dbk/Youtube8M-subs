00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.240 
screen doesn't my turn all if again the
battery<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.150> just<00:01:57.360> not<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.750> mind<00:01:57.930> having<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.800> so

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
battery is just not to mind having it so

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.550 
battery is just not to mind having it so
anyways<00:01:59.760> again<00:02:00.000> there's<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.870> look<00:02:01.050> at<00:02:01.290> how

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
anyways again there's just a look at how

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.070 
anyways again there's just a look at how
it<00:02:01.770> converts<00:02:02.220> from<00:02:04.700> notebook<00:02:05.750> like<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.810> tablet

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
it converts from notebook like a tablet

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.510 
it converts from notebook like a tablet
and<00:02:07.500> back<00:02:07.979> again

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:21.330 

it<00:02:13.030> works<00:02:13.210> better<00:02:13.360> if<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:13.570> use<00:02:13.630> two<00:02:13.900> hands<00:02:16.710> 11

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.400
