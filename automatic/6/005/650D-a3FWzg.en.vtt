euro<00:02:03.450> stuff<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.869> great<00:02:04.350> move<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:05.250> also<00:02:05.430> keeps

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
euro stuff is a great move it also keeps

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.059 
euro stuff is a great move it also keeps
the<00:02:05.790> defense<00:02:06.270> off-balance<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.290> it's<00:02:07.619> very

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
the defense off-balance and it's very

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.999 
the defense off-balance and it's very
hard<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:09.090> go<00:02:09.330> ahead<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.690> try<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.229> time<00:02:10.679> this

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
hard to go ahead and try to time this

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.059 
hard to go ahead and try to time this
layup<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:12.270> because<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.040> intricacy<00:02:14.040> of

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
layup just because of the intricacy of

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.330 
layup just because of the intricacy of
the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.119 
the
move<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:15.209> you're<00:02:15.540> being<00:02:15.780> able<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.260> step<00:02:16.830> one

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
move and you're being able to step one

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.880 
move and you're being able to step one
way<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.610> then<00:02:17.700> go<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:18.180> total<00:02:18.870> different<00:02:19.739> way

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
way and then go a total different way

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.699 
way and then go a total different way
that's<00:02:20.700> very<00:02:20.849> hard<00:02:21.150> it's<00:02:21.810> very<00:02:21.900> hard<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.349> time

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
that's very hard it's very hard to time

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.180 
that's very hard it's very hard to time
and<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:24.150> keeps<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.450> off-balance<00:02:24.599> so<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:26.010> can

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
and it keeps you off-balance so you can

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.820 
and it keeps you off-balance so you can
also<00:02:26.310> attract<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.269> draw<00:02:27.450> more<00:02:27.660> fouls<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.620> also

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
also attract and draw more fouls it also

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.180 
also attract and draw more fouls it also
displays<00:02:29.459> knowledge<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.810> game<00:02:31.049> it's<00:02:31.950> one

of those goals that you have to work on

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.720

a<00:03:39.030> great<00:03:39.269> time<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.690> go<00:03:39.810> ahead<00:03:40.019> and<00:03:40.170> use<00:03:40.290> that

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
a great time to go ahead and use that

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.479 
a great time to go ahead and use that

Euro step how to perform it if this is

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.550 
Euro step how to perform it if this is
something<00:03:44.819> that<00:03:44.849> you<00:03:45.090> have<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.269> pay<00:03:45.599> close

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
something that you have to pay close

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.680 
something that you have to pay close
attention<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:47.160> because<00:03:47.700> I'm<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.239> see<00:03:48.419> a<00:03:48.450> lot<00:03:48.660> of

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
attention to because I'm I see a lot of

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.629 
attention to because I'm I see a lot of
kids<00:03:48.989> trying<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.349> do<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:49.680> because<00:03:50.220> they<00:03:50.459> watch

kids trying to do it because they watch

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.909 
kids trying to do it because they watch
you<00:03:50.910> know<00:03:51.060> that<00:03:51.239> he<00:03:51.450> is<00:03:51.569> being<00:03:51.750> moves<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:52.380> see

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
you know that he is being moves and see

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.240 
you know that he is being moves and see
guys<00:03:53.099> on<00:03:53.130> TV<00:03:53.579> do<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:54.349> but<00:03:55.349> there's<00:03:55.560> an<00:03:55.680> order<00:03:56.069> to

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
guys on TV do it but there's an order to

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.589 
guys on TV do it but there's an order to
it<00:03:57.290> it's<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.380> two-step<00:03:58.769> process<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.599> involves

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
it it's a two-step process and involves

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.990 
it it's a two-step process and involves
number<00:04:00.959> one<00:04:01.200> your<00:04:01.440> lead<00:04:01.650> step<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.220> that's

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
number one your lead step and that's

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.879 
number one your lead step and that's
followed<00:04:03.299> by<00:04:03.599> what<00:04:03.900> I<00:04:03.930> call<00:04:04.260> an<00:04:04.470> adjustment

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
followed by what I call an adjustment

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.210 
followed by what I call an adjustment
step<00:04:05.250> so<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.810> lead<00:04:07.049> step<00:04:07.349> requires<00:04:07.769> that<00:04:08.040> you

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
step so the lead step requires that you

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.970 
step so the lead step requires that you
are<00:04:08.370> in<00:04:08.459> control<00:04:08.760> of<00:04:08.849> your<00:04:09.120> body<00:04:09.329> speed<00:04:09.799> in<00:04:10.799> my

my speed theory you know and how to
actually<00:04:17.160> control<00:04:17.489> your<00:04:17.549> body<00:04:17.910> how<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.269> be

actually control your body how to be

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.480 
actually control your body how to be
quick<00:04:18.930> but<00:04:19.620> not<00:04:19.859> necessarily<00:04:20.459> in<00:04:20.880> a<00:04:21.329> rush<00:04:21.599> and

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
quick but not necessarily in a rush and

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.529 
quick but not necessarily in a rush and
it's<00:04:23.490> very<00:04:23.760> very<00:04:23.849> important<00:04:24.270> because<00:04:24.360> the

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
it's very very important because the

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.839 
it's very very important because the
people<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:25.080> you<00:04:25.770> just<00:04:25.800> move<00:04:26.219> the<00:04:26.370> best<00:04:26.580> you

people that you just move the best you

people that you just move the best you
know<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.000> way

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
know the way

know the way

Ginobli Nash Rondo on Parkers me the

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.640 
Ginobli Nash Rondo on Parkers me the
list<00:04:32.580> is<00:04:32.730> goes<00:04:32.910> on<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.270> on<00:04:33.300> now<00:04:33.540> they<00:04:33.750> they're

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
list is goes on and on now they they're

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.350 
list is goes on and on now they they're
always<00:04:34.920> in<00:04:35.280> control<00:04:35.640> of<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:35.910> body<00:04:36.120> and

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
always in control of the body and

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.390 
always in control of the body and
they're<00:04:36.480> never<00:04:36.720> at<00:04:36.900> their<00:04:37.080> top<00:04:37.380> speed<00:04:37.620> because

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
they're never at their top speed because

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.490 
they're never at their top speed because
just<00:04:38.760> like<00:04:38.880> driving<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.360> car<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.870> faster<00:04:40.320> you

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
just like driving the car the faster you

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.280 
just like driving the car the faster you
go<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:41.010> less<00:04:41.670> control<00:04:41.880> you<00:04:42.240> have<00:04:42.480> over<00:04:42.510> that

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
go the less control you have over that

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.550 
go the less control you have over that
vehicle<00:04:43.860> or<00:04:44.040> in<00:04:44.490> this<00:04:44.610> case<00:04:44.850> over<00:04:45.240> your<00:04:45.360> body

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
vehicle or in this case over your body

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.200 
vehicle or in this case over your body
alright<00:04:46.560> so<00:04:46.800> that<00:04:47.010> lead<00:04:47.220> step<00:04:47.580> is<00:04:47.760> very<00:04:47.850> very

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
alright so that lead step is very very

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.210 
alright so that lead step is very very
important<00:04:48.660> that<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:49.470> know<00:04:49.590> you<00:04:49.650> can<00:04:49.830> get<00:04:49.950> you

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
important that you know you can get you

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.520 
important that you know you can get you
can<00:04:50.400> burst<00:04:50.580> by<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.150> guy<00:04:51.450> you<00:04:52.080> can<00:04:52.230> get<00:04:52.350> under

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
can burst by a guy you can get under

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.020 
can burst by a guy you can get under
control<00:04:52.650> again<00:04:53.220> so<00:04:53.430> bring<00:04:53.640> it<00:04:53.730> down<00:04:53.880> a<00:04:53.910> notch

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
control again so bring it down a notch

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.980 
control again so bring it down a notch
and<00:04:54.660> be<00:04:54.870> able<00:04:54.990> to<00:04:55.610> plant<00:04:56.610> that<00:04:56.760> lead<00:04:57.000> step<00:04:57.300> now

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
and be able to plant that lead step now

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.950 
and be able to plant that lead step now
the<00:04:58.050> second<00:04:58.560> step<00:04:58.800> or<00:04:59.510> adjustment<00:05:00.510> step<00:05:00.720> as<00:05:00.840> I

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
the second step or adjustment step as I

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.010 
the second step or adjustment step as I
call<00:05:01.170> it<00:05:01.610> it<00:05:02.610> requires<00:05:03.150> a<00:05:03.450> little<00:05:03.660> bit<00:05:03.900> of

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
call it it requires a little bit of

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.340 
call it it requires a little bit of
insight<00:05:04.530> into<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:04.830> game<00:05:05.070> and<00:05:05.370> you<00:05:06.140> knowing<00:05:07.140> on

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
insight into the game and you knowing on

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.740 
insight into the game and you knowing on
the<00:05:07.470> fly<00:05:07.740> who<00:05:08.280> it<00:05:08.460> is<00:05:08.610> that's<00:05:09.270> coming<00:05:09.540> to

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
the fly who it is that's coming to

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.260 
the fly who it is that's coming to
rotate<00:05:10.110> for<00:05:10.920> instance<00:05:11.190> if<00:05:11.430> it's<00:05:11.910> a<00:05:12.030> bigger

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
rotate for instance if it's a bigger

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.660 
rotate for instance if it's a bigger
defender<00:05:12.960> obviously<00:05:13.560> you<00:05:14.160> know<00:05:14.280> a<00:05:14.310> lot<00:05:14.550> of

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
defender obviously you know a lot of

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.030 
defender obviously you know a lot of
times<00:05:14.820> they're<00:05:15.000> slow<00:05:15.210> foot<00:05:15.510> so<00:05:16.170> that<00:05:16.500> second

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
times they're slow foot so that second

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.430 
times they're slow foot so that second
adjustment<00:05:17.310> that<00:05:17.970> can<00:05:18.450> be<00:05:18.540> a<00:05:18.570> quick<00:05:18.840> step<00:05:19.140> in

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
adjustment that can be a quick step in

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.220 
adjustment that can be a quick step in
opposite<00:05:19.920> direction<00:05:20.300> but<00:05:21.300> if<00:05:21.480> it's<00:05:21.660> a<00:05:21.750> faster

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
opposite direction but if it's a faster

opposite direction but if it's a faster
guard<00:05:22.530> who's<00:05:22.800> quick<00:05:23.160> and<00:05:23.670> he<00:05:24.630> knows<00:05:24.810> what
