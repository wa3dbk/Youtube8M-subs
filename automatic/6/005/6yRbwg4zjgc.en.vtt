put on everything you know possible if
it<00:01:55.619> actually<00:01:56.159> even<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.520> high<00:01:56.759> flow<00:01:57.149> water<00:01:57.540> pump

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
it actually even a high flow water pump

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.639 
it actually even a high flow water pump
from<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.950> Stewart<00:01:59.479> all<00:02:00.479> new<00:02:00.719> hoses<00:02:01.020> put<00:02:01.530> on

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
from the Stewart all new hoses put on

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.609 
from the Stewart all new hoses put on
the<00:02:01.829> H<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.689> things<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.110> water<00:02:04.350> would

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the H of things so the water would

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.919 
the H of things so the water would
circulate<00:02:04.950> when<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.640> heater<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.240> off

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929

six years yeah it is I matched it up
with<00:02:57.829> the<00:02:57.980> other<00:02:58.129> one<00:02:58.400> now<00:02:58.900> as<00:02:59.900> far<00:03:00.139> as<00:03:00.319> though

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
with the other one now as far as though

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.589 
with the other one now as far as though
it<00:03:00.560> looks<00:03:00.859> it<00:03:01.400> looks<00:03:01.430> identical

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
it looks it looks identical

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.030 
it looks it looks identical
we<00:03:03.230> built<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.769> thermostat<00:03:05.349> in<00:03:06.349> here<00:03:06.379> put<00:03:06.889> the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
we built the thermostat in here put the

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.059 
we built the thermostat in here put the
bun<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.489> it<00:03:07.639> forward<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.209> other<00:03:08.889> for<00:03:09.889> the

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
bun and it forward the other for the

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.649 
bun and it forward the other for the
tempered<00:03:10.639> you<00:03:10.670> know<00:03:10.970> for<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.329> answer<00:03:11.629> that

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:11.659 
tempered you know for the answer that

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.750 
tempered you know for the answer that
that<00:03:11.989> that<00:03:12.319> keeps<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.709> fan<00:03:12.919> on<00:03:13.129> based<00:03:13.489> on<00:03:13.639> the

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
that that keeps the fan on based on the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.610 
that that keeps the fan on based on the
temperature<00:03:14.209> yeah<00:03:14.449> right<00:03:14.870> yeah<00:03:15.199> cuz<00:03:15.440> I<00:03:15.560> still

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
temperature yeah right yeah cuz I still

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.640 
temperature yeah right yeah cuz I still
have<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.190> stock<00:03:16.519> gauge<00:03:16.879> and<00:03:17.359> then<00:03:18.109> this<00:03:18.379> one

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
have the stock gauge and then this one

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.670 
have the stock gauge and then this one
runs<00:03:18.980> up<00:03:19.250> in<00:03:19.459> through<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.910> small<00:03:20.239> fan<00:03:20.680> and

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
runs up in through the small fan and

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.629 
runs up in through the small fan and
then<00:03:21.980> I<00:03:22.280> put<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.180> relay<00:03:23.780> over<00:03:24.230> here<00:03:24.530> you<00:03:25.370> can

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
then I put the relay over here you can

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:29.080 
then I put the relay over here you can
see<00:03:25.879> it<00:03:25.970> yeah<00:03:26.329> hid<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.930> wire<00:03:27.139> as<00:03:27.530> much<00:03:27.799> as<00:03:28.090> no

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
see it yeah hid the wire as much as no

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.750 
see it yeah hid the wire as much as no
I'm<00:03:29.269> not<00:03:29.449> a<00:03:29.480> show<00:03:29.810> car<00:03:30.109> but<00:03:30.349> I<00:03:30.500> still<00:03:31.190> like<00:03:31.459> it

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
I'm not a show car but I still like it

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.229 
I'm not a show car but I still like it
looking<00:03:32.389> pretty<00:03:32.510> original<00:03:32.780> yeah<00:03:33.319> yeah<00:03:34.239> we'd

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
looking pretty original yeah yeah we'd

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.170 
looking pretty original yeah yeah we'd
put<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.659> air<00:03:35.840> on<00:03:35.870> but<00:03:36.470> I<00:03:36.590> couldn't<00:03:37.150> use<00:03:38.150> the

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
put the air on but I couldn't use the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.020 
put the air on but I couldn't use the
air<00:03:38.629> much<00:03:39.319> because<00:03:39.979> it<00:03:40.159> over<00:03:40.489> whether<00:03:40.849> it

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
air much because it over whether it

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.580 
air much because it over whether it
would<00:03:41.180> overheat<00:03:41.690> without<00:03:42.139> the<00:03:42.349> air<00:03:42.500> on<00:03:42.799> so<00:03:43.359> now

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
would overheat without the air on so now

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.369 
would overheat without the air on so now
waiting<00:03:45.590> feel<00:03:45.919> it<00:03:46.419> there's<00:03:47.419> there's<00:03:47.720> no<00:03:48.139> in

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379
