household reflector I'm using this

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.020 
household reflector I'm using this
because<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.870> wanted<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.320> straight<00:00:43.980> beam<00:00:44.250> in

using the usual acrylic rods to keep the
rock<00:00:53.910> together<00:00:54.350> I've<00:00:55.350> used<00:00:55.800> tent<00:00:56.250> poles<00:00:56.610> which

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
rock together I've used tent poles which

rock together I've used tent poles which
aren't<00:00:57.239> made<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.660> carbon<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.530> no<00:00:58.710> carbon

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
aren't made of carbon and so no carbon
