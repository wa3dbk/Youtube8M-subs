00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.980 
and that that actually can output up to
500<00:02:13.980> watts<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.460> need<00:02:14.610> students<00:02:14.940> rated<00:02:15.120> at<00:02:15.300> at

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
500 watts of a need students rated at at

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.470 
500 watts of a need students rated at at
UM<00:02:16.230> average<00:02:17.100> output<00:02:17.520> but<00:02:17.700> maximum<00:02:18.120> output<00:02:18.240> is

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
UM average output but maximum output is

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.440 
UM average output but maximum output is
around<00:02:18.720> 500<00:02:19.320> so<00:02:19.530> that's<00:02:20.490> good<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.970> have<00:02:21.390> this

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
around 500 so that's good I have this

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.480 
around 500 so that's good I have this
huge<00:02:22.050> old<00:02:22.380> cooler<00:02:22.830> in<00:02:23.130> here<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.950> big<00:02:26.130> old<00:02:26.280> heat

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
huge old cooler in here the big old heat

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.260 
huge old cooler in here the big old heat
sinks<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.860> after<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:29.040> old<00:02:29.280> Pentium<00:02:30.000> D<00:02:30.180> in

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
sinks and after that old Pentium D in

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.080 
sinks and after that old Pentium D in
there<00:02:30.450> which<00:02:30.570> is<00:02:30.690> real<00:02:30.870> power<00:02:31.050> hungry<00:02:31.590> um<00:02:32.090> I've

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
there which is real power hungry um I've

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.750 
there which is real power hungry um I've

to 250 gigabyte hard drives which
running<00:02:36.480> raid<00:02:36.720> 0<00:02:37.020> so<00:02:37.650> that's<00:02:37.890> 500<00:02:38.640> gigs<00:02:39.540> of

I<00:02:40.490> got<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:43.760> sound<00:02:44.760> auto<00:02:45.630> g2<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.140> think<00:02:46.470> it's

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
I got a sound auto g2 I think it's

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.380 
I got a sound auto g2 I think it's
called<00:02:46.740> is<00:02:47.070> my<00:02:47.250> sound<00:02:47.610> card<00:02:47.910> yeah

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
called is my sound card yeah

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.270 
called is my sound card yeah
maybe<00:02:51.390> showcase<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:51.990> little<00:02:52.320> better<00:02:52.470> there's<00:02:53.220> a

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
maybe showcase a little better there's a

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.830 
maybe showcase a little better there's a
huge<00:02:53.640> problem<00:02:53.880> with<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.300> computer<00:02:54.600> though

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
huge problem with this computer though

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.560 
huge problem with this computer though
and<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.320> that<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:55.980> BTX<00:02:56.610> configuration

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
and that is that is BTX configuration

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.440 
and that is that is BTX configuration
which<00:02:57.870> means<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.740> can't<00:02:59.700> really<00:03:00.030> upgrade

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
which means that I can't really upgrade

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.560 
which means that I can't really upgrade
any<00:03:00.750> parts<00:03:01.230> any<00:03:02.190> aftermarket<00:03:02.430> parts<00:03:03.030> in<00:03:03.300> the

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
story short I can't really snaps off you

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.460

doesn't<00:03:14.940> step<00:03:15.090> off<00:03:15.239> that<00:03:15.269> hard<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.930> kind<00:03:16.440> of

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
doesn't step off that hard I kind of

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.479 
doesn't step off that hard I kind of
pinched<00:03:16.739> it<00:03:16.890> there<00:03:17.269> no<00:03:18.269> harm<00:03:18.540> done<00:03:18.810> um<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:20.280> yeah

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
pinched it there no harm done um so yeah

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.090 
pinched it there no harm done um so yeah
I<00:03:20.519> can<00:03:20.640> see<00:03:21.570> it's<00:03:21.780> just<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:22.110> warm<00:03:22.350> knock<00:03:22.590> it's<00:03:22.980> a

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
I can see it's just a warm knock it's a

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:32.400 
I can see it's just a warm knock it's a
little<00:03:23.340> cool<00:03:26.180> take<00:03:27.180> this<00:03:27.330> out

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.930 

well<00:03:32.920> I<00:03:32.950> thought<00:03:33.130> you'd<00:03:33.310> likely<00:03:33.520> pulled<00:03:33.850> it

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
well I thought you'd likely pulled it

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.410 
well I thought you'd likely pulled it
out<00:03:34.030> there<00:03:34.270> huh<00:03:34.450> there<00:03:34.840> we<00:03:34.930> go<00:03:36.810> this<00:03:37.810> up<00:03:39.420> even

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
out there huh there we go this up even

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.110 
out there huh there we go this up even

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
card it's support 64-bit channel sound

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.150 
card it's support 64-bit channel sound
it's<00:03:49.750> got<00:03:50.050> uh<00:03:51.840> it's<00:03:52.840> got<00:03:53.020> five<00:03:53.410> point<00:03:53.680> one<00:03:53.890> and

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
it's got uh it's got five point one and

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.590 
it's got uh it's got five point one and
it's<00:03:54.430> also<00:03:54.580> got<00:03:54.730> a<00:03:54.790> FireWire<00:03:55.210> port<00:03:55.240> in<00:03:55.510> the

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
it's also got a FireWire port in the

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.220 
it's also got a FireWire port in the
back<00:03:55.750> so<00:03:55.930> that's<00:03:55.990> kind<00:03:56.230> of<00:03:56.260> nice

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
they're adding a second to take the

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.130 
they're adding a second to take the
graphics<00:04:01.180> card<00:04:01.390> out<00:04:01.540> and<00:04:01.660> cuz<00:04:01.840> it's<00:04:01.990> got<00:04:02.110> a

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
graphics card out and cuz it's got a

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.570 
graphics card out and cuz it's got a
little<00:04:02.290> pin<00:04:02.530> holder<00:04:02.800> you<00:04:02.890> get<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.040> pop-up

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
little pin holder you get a pop-up

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:12.840 
little pin holder you get a pop-up
there's<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.750> card<00:04:05.220> out<00:04:06.960> very<00:04:07.960> dusty<00:04:11.850> yeah

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
there's the card out very dusty yeah

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.310 
there's the card out very dusty yeah
that<00:04:13.150> gets<00:04:13.390> pretty<00:04:13.540> hot<00:04:13.780> they<00:04:13.930> gets<00:04:14.080> about

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
that gets pretty hot they gets about

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.400 
that gets pretty hot they gets about
eighty<00:04:14.680> degrees<00:04:15.040> Celsius<00:04:15.780> 145<00:04:16.780> degrees

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
eighty degrees Celsius 145 degrees

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.120 
eighty degrees Celsius 145 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:04:17.440> so<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.250> get<00:04:18.460> some<00:04:18.640> very<00:04:18.760> warm<00:04:20.130> CA

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
Fahrenheit so I get some very warm CA

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.100 
Fahrenheit so I get some very warm CA
here<00:04:21.460> you<00:04:21.520> can<00:04:21.670> see<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:22.000> computer<00:04:22.450> better<00:04:22.960> now

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
here you can see the computer better now
