00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
flywheel is wholly composite this means

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.040 
flywheel is wholly composite this means
that<00:01:19.930> we<00:01:20.110> can<00:01:20.140> spin<00:01:20.590> faster<00:01:21.370> than<00:01:21.700> other

overall weight of the system is lower

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.710 
overall weight of the system is lower
which<00:01:28.630> gives<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.170> best<00:01:29.440> compromise<00:01:30.220> of<00:01:30.720> power

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
which gives the best compromise of power

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.970 
which gives the best compromise of power
at<00:01:31.870> home<00:01:32.020> unit<00:01:32.380> weight<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:35.590> biggest

at home unit weight the biggest

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.820 
at home unit weight the biggest
difference<00:01:36.370> to<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:37.320> performance<00:01:38.320> of<00:01:38.740> the

difference to the performance of the

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.800 
difference to the performance of the
cars<00:01:39.040> I<00:01:39.160> think<00:01:39.250> is<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.760> f1<00:01:40.060> spectacle<00:01:40.630> they'll

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
cars I think is the f1 spectacle they'll

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.020 
cars I think is the f1 spectacle they'll
be<00:01:40.990> be<00:01:41.200> increased<00:01:41.590> amount<00:01:42.370> of<00:01:42.430> taking

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
be be increased amount of taking

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.300 
be be increased amount of taking
maneuvers<00:01:43.510> in<00:01:43.870> the<00:01:43.930> regulations<00:01:44.680> everybody's

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
maneuvers in the regulations everybody's

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.490 
maneuvers in the regulations everybody's
allowed<00:01:45.550> to<00:01:45.940> have<00:01:46.480> a<00:01:46.510> certain<00:01:47.050> amount<00:01:47.080> of

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
allowed to have a certain amount of

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.890 
allowed to have a certain amount of
energy<00:01:47.620> per<00:01:48.070> lap<00:01:48.340> which<00:01:49.090> is<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.390> equivalent

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
energy per lap which is the equivalent

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.980 
energy per lap which is the equivalent
of<00:01:49.990> about<00:01:50.280> 16<00:01:51.280> horsepower<00:01:51.700> for<00:01:52.210> six<00:01:52.420> seconds

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
of about 16 horsepower for six seconds

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.960 
of about 16 horsepower for six seconds
so<00:01:53.490> if<00:01:54.490> one<00:01:54.850> car<00:01:55.300> has<00:01:55.570> used<00:01:56.260> its<00:01:56.530> laps<00:01:57.430> worth<00:01:57.700> of

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
so if one car has used its laps worth of

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.120 
so if one car has used its laps worth of
energy<00:01:58.630> and<00:01:58.900> another<00:01:59.110> car<00:01:59.320> it<00:01:59.740> is<00:01:59.800> about<00:01:59.980> to

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
energy and another car it is about to

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.040 
energy and another car it is about to
overtake<00:02:00.370> that<00:02:00.790> will<00:02:00.940> be<00:02:01.060> enough<00:02:01.330> to<00:02:01.570> actually

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
overtake that will be enough to actually

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.070 
overtake that will be enough to actually
enable<00:02:02.230> a<00:02:02.440> car<00:02:02.650> to<00:02:02.800> overtake<00:02:03.130> when<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:03.430> may<00:02:03.550> be

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
enable a car to overtake when it may be

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.810 
enable a car to overtake when it may be

car<00:02:24.550> people<00:02:24.940> are<00:02:25.180> struggling<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.720> little<00:02:25.810> bit

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959

with<00:02:26.080> with<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.620> technologies<00:02:27.160> they<00:02:27.340> have<00:02:27.370> so

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
with with the technologies they have so

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.360 
with with the technologies they have so
I<00:02:28.600> think<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.280> developments<00:02:30.280> which

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
I think that the developments which

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.310 
I think that the developments which
being<00:02:30.610> done<00:02:30.850> in<00:02:31.090> Formula<00:02:31.540> One<00:02:31.690> will<00:02:32.080> have<00:02:32.290> a

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
being done in Formula One will have a

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.920 
being done in Formula One will have a
positive<00:02:32.980> effect<00:02:33.310> on<00:02:33.700> Aundre<00:02:34.000> ability

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
positive effect on Aundre ability

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.050 
positive effect on Aundre ability
there<00:02:35.380> are<00:02:35.530> lots<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.130> other<00:02:36.280> any<00:02:36.459> industries

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
there are lots of other any industries

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.170 
there are lots of other any industries
which<00:02:37.300> will<00:02:37.720> benefit<00:02:38.290> from<00:02:38.680> energy<00:02:39.610> recovery

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
which will benefit from energy recovery

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.949 
which will benefit from energy recovery
of<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:41.080> Singapore<00:02:41.560> from<00:02:41.770> road<00:02:42.280> cars<00:02:42.640> as<00:02:43.030> buses

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
of the Singapore from road cars as buses

of the Singapore from road cars as buses
trucks<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:45.010> reason<00:02:45.400> they're<00:02:45.610> not<00:02:45.880> doing<00:02:46.150> that

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
trucks the reason they're not doing that

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.370 
trucks the reason they're not doing that
the<00:02:46.420> most<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:46.720> largely<00:02:46.989> because<00:02:47.260> the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
the most is largely because the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.050 
the most is largely because the
technologies<00:02:48.010> are<00:02:48.190> not<00:02:48.310> well<00:02:48.850> developed

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
technologies are not well developed

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.120 
technologies are not well developed
enough<00:02:49.570> so<00:02:50.170> that<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.410> push<00:02:50.620> what<00:02:50.800> kinds<00:02:51.070> of

for<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:51.890> along<00:02:52.070> developments<00:02:52.610> I<00:02:52.730> think<00:02:52.910> there

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
for the along developments I think there

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.280 
for the along developments I think there
will<00:02:53.090> be<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.270> trickle-down<00:02:53.480> those<00:02:53.960> events

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
will be a trickle-down those events

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.960 
will be a trickle-down those events
weeks
