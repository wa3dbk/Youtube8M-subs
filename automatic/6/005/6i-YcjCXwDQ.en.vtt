happened<00:00:31.740> quite<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.920> few<00:00:32.040> different<00:00:32.250> times

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
happened quite a few different times

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.920 
happened quite a few different times
when<00:00:32.700> I'm<00:00:32.790> wearing<00:00:32.910> different<00:00:33.090> folks<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.899> I

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
when I'm wearing different folks so I

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.479 
when I'm wearing different folks so I
figured<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.440> easiest<00:00:34.469> way<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.100> ask<00:00:35.309> that

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
figured the easiest way to ask that

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.830 
figured the easiest way to ask that
question<00:00:35.610> instead<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.270> replying<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.660> all<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
question instead of replying to all the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.209 
question instead of replying to all the
different<00:00:37.050> comments<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.440> videos<00:00:37.710> would

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
different comments in the videos would

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.310 
different comments in the videos would
be<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.460> make<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> video<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.090> do<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.809> now

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
be to make a video to do just that now

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.479

so you can get this in an Engram but if

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.749 
so you can get this in an Engram but if

75 crucible marks so as I said that's

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.469 
75 crucible marks so as I said that's
why<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> lot<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.850> people<00:01:54.030> don't<00:01:54.119> buy<00:01:54.299> them

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
why a lot of people don't buy them

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.550 
why a lot of people don't buy them
simply<00:01:54.810> because<00:01:55.020> if<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.200> spend<00:01:55.350> your<00:01:55.470> time

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
simply because if you spend your time

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.319 
simply because if you spend your time
building<00:01:55.979> these<00:01:56.070> marks<00:01:56.369> up<00:01:56.490> then<00:01:56.939> most<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
building these marks up then most of the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.280 
building these marks up then most of the
time<00:01:57.509> you're<00:01:57.719> either<00:01:57.869> going<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.110> want<00:01:58.259> to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
time you're either going to want to

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.690 
time you're either going to want to
spend<00:01:58.439> them<00:01:58.590> on<00:01:58.740> weapons<00:01:59.130> or<00:01:59.340> you're<00:01:59.520> going<00:01:59.610> to

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700

buy<00:04:14.489> that<00:04:14.700> many<00:04:14.880> of<00:04:15.000> them<00:04:15.120> I<00:04:15.299> just<00:04:15.480> get<00:04:15.810> given

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
buy that many of them I just get given

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.390 
buy that many of them I just get given
them<00:04:16.140> randomly<00:04:16.350> from<00:04:16.530> engrams<00:04:16.859> as<00:04:17.010> opposed<00:04:17.310> to

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
them randomly from engrams as opposed to

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.740 
them randomly from engrams as opposed to
weapons<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:17.850> things<00:04:17.970> like<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.120> but<00:04:18.720> that

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
weapons and things like that but that

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.630 
weapons and things like that but that
being<00:04:19.019> said<00:04:19.169> this<00:04:19.470> also<00:04:19.769> came<00:04:20.100> for<00:04:20.220> an<00:04:20.280> Engram

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
being said this also came for an Engram

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.099 
being said this also came for an Engram
so<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.239> fact<00:04:21.419> that<00:04:21.450> you<00:04:21.570> can<00:04:21.690> no<00:04:21.750> longer<00:04:21.900> buy

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
so the fact that you can no longer buy

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.480 
so the fact that you can no longer buy
it<00:04:22.169> does<00:04:22.470> that<00:04:22.680> indicate<00:04:22.800> that<00:04:23.160> you<00:04:23.310> could

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
it does that indicate that you could

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.090 
it does that indicate that you could
well<00:04:23.640> get<00:04:23.789> this<00:04:23.910> if<00:04:24.150> RNG<00:04:24.780> is<00:04:24.810> in<00:04:25.020> your<00:04:25.140> favor<00:04:25.320> so

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
well get this if RNG is in your favor so

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.640 
well get this if RNG is in your favor so
with<00:04:26.400> that<00:04:26.490> being<00:04:26.640> said<00:04:26.729> that<00:04:27.120> brings<00:04:27.360> me

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
with that being said that brings me

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.080 
with that being said that brings me
