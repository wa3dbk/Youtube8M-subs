00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.590
 hello my love i have a new one 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.389
 youth book tip for you and indeed had 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.090
 the video's book ever in any 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.859
 another video of me also shown 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.980
 and also said that the karma 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.580
 totally reminiscent of fate is on 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.099
 Lisa traitor and I think that was 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.019
 also the first reason why me 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.790
 what ever bumped into this book 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.200
 I saw this cover like that and me 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.190
 I do not know, it just appeals to me 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.020
 to remember another book 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.430
 and then I have the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.200
 short description read 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.640
 thought could be something for me 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.520
 and that's why I have this book 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.579
 read yes I live on the unheard of 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.140
 life of the alex root or why that 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.770
 universe no plan 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.600
 it was written by gavin existenz 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.949
 and that's how it looks and if you have it 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.809
 now you might see too 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.730
 say yes, that reminds me too 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.680
 a lot of the book I can tell you but 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.019
 already say it has nothing at all 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.900
 It is the book of John Green to do it 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.240
 a totally different topic but it is 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.619
 at least as good though it totally 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.580
 it is also different from the desk 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.560
 and so how can they even 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.159
 do not compare 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.659
 yes, this book is about that 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.340
 outrageous lives of the electron and me 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.409
 I have in my written reviews 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.100
 written so outrageous is this life 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.470
 not at all 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.450
 not only because of me 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.939
 history was not so unheard of 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.610
 but also because I yes the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.450
 words from alex had to be heard and 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:41.159
 so his life is mine and mine 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.630
 no longer unheard of and it can or that 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.689
 I actually was first noticed as 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.939
 The book then closed at the end 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.229
 and so what is it about alex wurz 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.000
 a teenager who is actually now 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.259
 already a bit older but is on 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.210
 so start the story 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.950
 Looking back, telling him what a 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.630
 happened a few years ago because there is one 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.700
 Meteorite on his mother's house 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.500
 fallen and this meteorite 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.810
 now he's thinking about him 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.720
 Maybe that's how I thought at the beginning 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.730
 has so bright meteorite from space 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.150
 meet him now meets him so on 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.120
 head and the book fantasy or wiener 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.590
 should it be something with 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.120
 Astronomy and so what to do is it 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.739
 anyway a book then for 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.599
 me so I found that somehow on 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:30.030
 beginning so a bit surprising 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:34.080
 So, when I read this post 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.049
 have the theories and so and has since 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.989
 alex wurz ill and he suffers 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.700
 epilepsy and he explains it that way 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.130
 that through this meteorite as 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.840
 Meteorites are astonished in his life 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.000
 has come because now crazy 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.390
 somehow I also start but me 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.730
 It was totally good and I have alex wurz 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.709
 really from the beginning totally in mine 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.540
 Heart closed because he's such a boy 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:03.120
 is very much about life 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.720
 think about it and about the world and about that 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.150
 think about the universe and many things 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.680
 I would have thought so too 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.359
 and I have quite often in whole 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.209
 many videos said that I was such a 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.160
 I think totally human and that I am 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.060
 actually many things also determined 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.180
 often often think broken but 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.319
 that's why everything was kind of like that 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.329
 sympathetic yes and now it is so 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.889
 suffers as mentioned at etc and in the 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.359
 of course he is also teased 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.420
 and so pull yourself back and 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:37.590
 is very much in the world of books 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.480
 and there is a car i wanted 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.109
 write down names and I have it 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.910
 to forget 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.370
 I will not be here any more 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.799
 this title loses to book it because 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.170
 every now and then 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:52.290
 I think it kinda good on Karl 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.599
 or something like that is a book around that 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.130
 there is a lot going on in this book and me 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.989
 I also googled at times 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.750
 Amazon was so looked and so there is 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.190
 really not fictional or me 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.510
 I always had it in between 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.639
 Really the feeling I want this book 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.070
 Also read that because he is there 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:10.230
 Lately, so much of this 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.810
 and well, so he rushes into it 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.490
 read maybe a bit apart 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.690
 to get from the real world to them 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:22.290
 which does not do him so well at the moment and 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:25.310
 At some point he learns a coincidence 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:29.040
 know older man 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.300
 it is very embarrassing now because of the 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.770
 I forgot names now you know 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.900
 yes always so with sound and smoke and so 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.810
 and it 's been about three weeks 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.580
 I have read the book have her 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.010
 especially Christa Peters 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.990
 The older one can tell 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.990
 Guilty man too 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.290
 I live that introverted time and time too 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.430
 very isolated and such and the two 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:56.910
 get to know each other and make friends 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.220
 and yes this mixture of this 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.830
 friendship between the two and 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:07.980
 this passion to read from this 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:10.320
 mixing creates an idea in alex head 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.540
 which he then realized and I found 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.720
 this idea totally beautiful 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.220
 He then makes something on others 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.540
 people have to deal with now, of course 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.180
 do not betray you have to book this book yes 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.830
 read it myself and I found the idea but 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.430
 totally great 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.680
 and at some point the story takes one 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.860
 turn 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.470
 and at the end the book has me on 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.760
 Another book reminds me that I am 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.470
 but unfortunately can not tell 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.000
 because otherwise you would know what this 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.600
 history comes to an end and of course 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.120
 i wanna know you not told 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.680
 the book sadly left me behind 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.330
 but at the same time hopeful that 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.800
 is often like that when I'm at the very end 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.480
 trust that you are really espite 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.690
 and maybe water and so on 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.400
 Nevertheless, you can draw from this 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:00.030
 supposedly negative something 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.310
 positive for yourself and this 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.770
 embassy the book with me 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.420
 has also left a few 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.840
 I can not do it to you 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.930
 I always want to tell the most 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.250
 really so to tell so yes but then 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.460
 I would tell everything I want 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.139
 it does not stop that way 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.090
 the book really from the first one 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.110
 has tackled and I have too 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.000
 quite often on facebook always 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.710
 in between so between statements 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.050
 I also always wrote like that 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.699
 loving at I fully the eventful and 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.130
 that's what it's supposed to have been like until the end of it 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:32.979
 So it has not changed 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:35.050
 and that's why I have the book of course 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:38.050
 out of touch because I'm just the one 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.850
 protagonist has touched and because he 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.919
 did not hit where the author 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.750
 probably also wants his 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:46.750
 to meet readers in the heart 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.490
 i can recommend this book to you 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:52.060
 Remember the title Look at that 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:54.010
 cover again and then next book 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.250
 simple and are as excited and 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.720
 wait and see if the life of ns 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.910
 really as unheard of as the title 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.590
 it says until next time 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.590
 Take care and goodbye
