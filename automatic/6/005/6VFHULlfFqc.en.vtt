it's<00:02:07.139> the<00:02:07.409> caravan<00:02:08.310> part<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.929> really

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
it's the caravan part that really

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.820 
it's the caravan part that really
intrigues<00:02:10.950> me<00:02:11.450> creating<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.780> massive<00:02:13.410> target

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
intrigues me creating a massive target

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.130 
intrigues me creating a massive target
like<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.460> for<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.150> enemy<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.600> bound<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.990> lead

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
like that for the enemy is bound to lead

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.330 
like that for the enemy is bound to lead
to<00:02:16.200> shamanic

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
to shamanic

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.220 
to shamanic
and<00:02:18.340> these<00:02:18.610> are<00:02:18.820> all<00:02:18.940> systems<00:02:19.330> intended<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:20.080> be

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
and these are all systems intended to be

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.170 
and these are all systems intended to be
added<00:02:20.650> with<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.830> core<00:02:21.250> module<00:02:21.730> release

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
added with the core module release

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.130 
added with the core module release
that's<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.380> winter<00:02:24.150> 2016<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.570> probably

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
that's the the winter 2016 so probably

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.500 
that's the the winter 2016 so probably
early<00:02:26.820> 2017<00:02:28.440> release<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:31.030> that<00:02:31.240> last

that really makes it stand out but the

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.790 
that really makes it stand out but the
outcomes<00:03:12.490> from<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.630> system<00:03:14.080> are<00:03:14.290> always

your<00:04:14.080> side<00:04:14.400> whoever<00:04:15.400> however<00:04:16.090> many<00:04:16.359> players

your side whoever however many players
that<00:04:16.959> will<00:04:17.109> be<00:04:17.260> you'll<00:04:17.500> always<00:04:17.859> have<00:04:18.100> that

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
that will be you'll always have that

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.940 
that will be you'll always have that
same<00:04:19.359> goal<00:04:19.720> together<00:04:19.989> so<00:04:20.530> you're

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
same goal together so you're

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.890 
same goal together so you're
automatically<00:04:21.670> working<00:04:22.150> together<00:04:22.330> without

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
automatically working together without

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.350 
automatically working together without
the<00:04:23.440> mechanics<00:04:23.980> of<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.250> game<00:04:24.280> having<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:25.000> try

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
the mechanics of the game having to try

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.520 
the mechanics of the game having to try
and<00:04:25.630> trick<00:04:26.260> you<00:04:26.290> into<00:04:26.500> it

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
and trick you into it

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.030 
and trick you into it
so<00:04:28.520> if<00:04:28.700> your<00:04:28.880> team<00:04:29.120> wanna<00:04:29.720> build<00:04:29.960> defenses<00:04:30.440> in

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
so if your team wanna build defenses in

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.430 
so if your team wanna build defenses in
a<00:04:31.100> particular<00:04:31.370> area<00:04:31.850> you'll<00:04:32.480> probably<00:04:32.900> need

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
a particular area you'll probably need

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.400 
a particular area you'll probably need
to<00:04:33.500> hold<00:04:33.920> a<00:04:34.100> quarry<00:04:34.600> to<00:04:35.600> gather<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:36.110> stone

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
to hold a quarry to gather the stone

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.140 
to hold a quarry to gather the stone
which<00:04:36.680> then<00:04:36.889> needs<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.400> be<00:04:37.550> moved<00:04:37.760> to<00:04:38.030> the

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
which then needs to be moved to the

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.050 
which then needs to be moved to the
point<00:04:38.389> where<00:04:38.570> the<00:04:38.690> structure<00:04:39.080> is<00:04:39.200> being<00:04:39.410> built

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
point where the structure is being built

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.220 
point where the structure is being built
that's<00:04:41.060> all<00:04:41.270> great<00:04:41.480> lots<00:04:41.780> of<00:04:41.960> fun

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
that's all great lots of fun

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.120 
that's all great lots of fun
opportunities<00:04:42.980> there<00:04:43.960> but<00:04:44.980> adding<00:04:45.980> in

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
opportunities there but adding in

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.610 
opportunities there but adding in
decisions<00:04:46.790> adding<00:04:47.180> in<00:04:47.270> possibility<00:04:47.960> space<00:04:48.169> is

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
decisions adding in possibility space is

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.970 
decisions adding in possibility space is
a<00:04:49.430> really<00:04:50.270> fun<00:04:50.510> thing<00:04:50.540> in<00:04:51.080> my<00:04:51.320> opinion<00:04:51.350> while

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
a really fun thing in my opinion while

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.580 
a really fun thing in my opinion while
it's<00:04:52.160> probably<00:04:52.550> easier<00:04:53.150> to<00:04:53.419> move<00:04:53.630> it<00:04:53.870> by<00:04:54.320> hand

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
it's probably easier to move it by hand

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.200 
it's probably easier to move it by hand
you<00:04:54.830> can<00:04:54.980> stick<00:04:55.190> it<00:04:55.310> in<00:04:55.430> your<00:04:55.520> own<00:04:55.580> inventory

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
you can stick it in your own inventory

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.510 
you can stick it in your own inventory
and<00:04:56.570> run<00:04:56.750> a<00:04:56.780> quest<00:04:57.110> run<00:04:57.410> across<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:57.860> land<00:04:58.070> you

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
and run a quest run across the land you

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.080 
and run a quest run across the land you
can<00:04:58.700> frolic<00:04:59.389> and<00:04:59.660> be<00:04:59.840> free<00:05:00.140> to<00:05:00.680> all<00:05:00.830> that<00:05:01.090> it's

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
can frolic and be free to all that it's

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.240 
can frolic and be free to all that it's
probably<00:05:02.390> going<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.900> be<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:03.230> very<00:05:03.290> inefficient

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
probably going to be a very inefficient

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.800 
probably going to be a very inefficient
way<00:05:04.400> of<00:05:04.430> going<00:05:04.970> about<00:05:05.180> it<00:05:05.360> you<00:05:05.510> know<00:05:05.540> it's<00:05:05.750> a

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
way of going about it you know it's a

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.870 
way of going about it you know it's a
lot<00:05:05.930> of<00:05:05.960> manpower<00:05:06.340> you<00:05:07.340> probably<00:05:07.610> won't<00:05:07.790> be

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
lot of manpower you probably won't be

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.510 
lot of manpower you probably won't be
able<00:05:07.940> to<00:05:08.120> carry<00:05:08.360> very<00:05:08.720> much<00:05:09.190> and<00:05:10.190> you<00:05:10.340> could

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
able to carry very much and you could

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.270 
able to carry very much and you could
fall<00:05:10.760> behind<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.810> progress<00:05:12.350> of<00:05:12.560> your<00:05:12.680> enemies

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
fall behind the progress of your enemies

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.610 
fall behind the progress of your enemies
you<00:05:13.460> know<00:05:13.580> with<00:05:13.790> with<00:05:14.150> whatever

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
you know with with whatever

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.570 
you know with with whatever
fortifications<00:05:15.620> they're<00:05:15.980> trying<00:05:16.310> to<00:05:16.370> build

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
fortifications they're trying to build

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.420 
fortifications they're trying to build
so<00:05:16.820> if<00:05:16.970> you<00:05:17.090> use<00:05:17.300> a<00:05:17.330> cart<00:05:17.720> you'll<00:05:18.710> probably<00:05:19.160> be

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
so if you use a cart you'll probably be

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.820 
so if you use a cart you'll probably be
far<00:05:19.700> more<00:05:19.729> efficient<00:05:20.479> but<00:05:20.780> as<00:05:21.080> I<00:05:21.590> said<00:05:21.650> before

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
far more efficient but as I said before

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.430 
far more efficient but as I said before
you're<00:05:22.310> you're<00:05:22.790> creating<00:05:23.540> a<00:05:23.630> target<00:05:24.200> for<00:05:24.350> the

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
opportunity for other players but then

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.950 
opportunity for other players but then
if<00:05:30.380> other<00:05:30.979> players<00:05:31.340> are<00:05:31.700> targeting<00:05:32.510> your

Caravan setting up an ambush could strip

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.659 
Caravan setting up an ambush could strip
could<00:05:35.690> send<00:05:35.960> a<00:05:36.200> strong<00:05:36.740> message<00:05:36.800> if<00:05:37.460> they're

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
force to take these caravans and you can

take them by surprise maybe that will

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.230 
take them by surprise maybe that will
