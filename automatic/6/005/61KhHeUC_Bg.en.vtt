00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:04.080
 there is no limit to the cynicism of the empire and its spokesmen 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.150
 and in this 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.019
 the secretary of state 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.919
 clinton lady 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:15.919
 has said 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.859
 to the amount of weapons that has been purchased by Venezuela 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.279
 more than any South American country that is blatantly lying 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.439
 and she knows it 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.300
 She knows the politics of lying 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.750
 and cynicism 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.960
 Unlimited 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.460
 I repeat the phrase 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.500
 verbatim from what Mrs. Clinton said 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.770
 with respect to the amount of armament that has been bought by venezuela 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.170
 more than any South American country 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.930
 what raises the question d 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.180
 If you are going to see an arms race in the region, the question 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.700
 the question for herself 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.510
 Empire 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.400
 He has launched 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.110
 again 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.300
 a guerrilla offensive on South America 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.640
 today the news that she left the last Yankee soldiers 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.180
 Total and Ecuadorian thorium alive strap 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.630
 Anibal Ecuador 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.210
 the secretary of state 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.770
 you have to ask him, will Mrs. Clinton know how much she spends? 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.609
 U.S 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:32.430
 in armament 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.430
 how much he spends on covert operations he sure does not know 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.630
 I swear you do not know 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.110
 how much do they spend 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.490
 in secret operations 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.090
 how much do they spend 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.360
 in financing destabilizing movements 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.380
 how much do they spend on invasion wars like the one in irak how much they spend per day 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.009
 in irak 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.290
 how much they have spent 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.510
 how many weapons produce 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.520
 and now seven military bases in Colombia 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.000
 united states and colombia 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.590
 they are the champions of the armamentismo 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.569
 The america 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.159
 we have another chaff simply 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.159
 strengthening our defense system 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:15.729
 also brazil 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:18.799
 also brazil has considered 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.799
 necessary 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:26.029
 she says much the secretary of state 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:30.089
 there are concerns about it 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:33.089
 and they are concerns that we will continue to express 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:36.789
 and then a man came that the ipn 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.869
 the spokesman of the state department 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:44.559
 the declared desire of venezuela must increase its purchase of weapons 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:46.589
 It is a serious challenge 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.529
 liam this nicolÃ¡s pÃ©ric 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:51.869
 a serious challenge to stability 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:54.869
 in the Western Hemisphere 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.739
 I wanted to say 'I already in united notions 2 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.209
 little lasted in it 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.149
 like preparing for 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:04.659
 I wish to enter a new era 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.659
 of respect for the sovereignty of venezuela 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.540
 no and the trinity meeting and shaking hands little 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.569
 and the smile and such 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.039
 but look at legolas 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:16.789
 We'll have to 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:19.789
 it will be that he keeps running to suffer will go 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:25.159
 podium that he will be you think that I will get smell of sulfur to the best 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.289
 I do not know what ground all this 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:31.289
 is happening when we are a few hours 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.339
 novel of the beginning of the general assembly 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:38.339
 of the United Nations 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:43.509
 the same empire run over that runs over lying 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.659
 lie 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.659
 Quique do not point and is that a threat to us 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.299
 a record of the grandfather threats and not to mention the 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:58.809
 of the Venezuelan opposition the counterrevolution does not 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:03.549
 immediately they become the spokesmen of the empire 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.249
 and they repeat like parrots 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:06.930
 like parrots
