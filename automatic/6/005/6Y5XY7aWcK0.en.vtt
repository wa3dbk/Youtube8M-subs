and we get caught up with the bandage
the<00:01:48.850> velcro<00:01:49.030> gets<00:01:49.479> caught<00:01:49.689> up<00:01:49.810> with<00:01:49.929> the

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
the velcro gets caught up with the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.359 
the velcro gets caught up with the
bandage<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:52.619> sometimes<00:01:53.619> it<00:01:53.829> becomes<00:01:54.130> and
