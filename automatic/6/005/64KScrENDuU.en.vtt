00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:15.330
Whatoplay presents the Top 10 PS4 Games of
2015 So Far

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.980
Our ranking is not a personal opinion.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.650
It's based on a 1 to 10 score that aggregates
gamers and critics' reviews into a unique

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.259
score called playscore.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.070
Opening at number 10 is Hotline Miami 2: Wrong
Number.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.210
The gore and blood continues!

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.710
This sequel offers a more varied &amp; harder
gameplay that is bigger in scope.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.260
Wrong Number presents a semblance of a story
that is absent from the original.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.080
It plays smooth, coupled with intense visual
effects and, of course, a soundtrack that

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.790
will get you pumped up!

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.220
It has a playscore of 8.8.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.320
Number 9 is Saints Row IV: Re-Elected

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.400
One of the best open-world games on the PS3
is now on a new-gen console, packed with tons

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.930
of new content like added superpowers, better
graphics, and even sillier humor!

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.340
And what's more, you also get the Gat-Out-of-Hell
as a bonus.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.920
Isn't it great!

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.190
Although some bugs remain from the previous
version, it is likely to give you a hitch.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.190
a playscore of 8.8

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.170
Ranked number 8 is Dying Light

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.890
Probably the best action slash zombie game
as of date.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.750
First person parkour is so awesome when combined
with in-your-face zombie massacre!

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.880
Techland outdid themselves in the zombie genre,
with top quality graphics, dynamic zombie

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.300
AIs, clever crafting system, a vast open-world
experience.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.890
However, the lack of facial expression on
NPCs slightly put me off.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.820
a playscore of 8.8

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.810
In 7th place is Grim Fandango Remastered

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.620
Manny Calavera is back in this classic!

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.560
Those who played the original will easily
fall in love with this version.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.840
And those who haven't will find a timeless
adventure game.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.229
It stays true.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.760
The witty &amp; funny dialogues, twists and memorable
characters are all here.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.480
Now in upgraded graphics and a redid soundtrack.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.349
This is a remaster done well.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.900
It holds a playscore of 8.9

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.849
At number 6 is Super Stardust Ultra

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.739
A fading franchise that is surprisingly afloat
due to its multiplayer fan base.

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.519
With a few added features and minor to near-invisible
graphical upgrades, Super Stardust Ultra is

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.409
pretty much the same game as its previous
version - with the same addictive formula..

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.290
which is probably why it is still as exciting
as ever!

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.239
Despite that, Interactive Streaming is surprisingly
enjoyable.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:59.069
A playscore of 9.0

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.669
Ranked 5th is Starwhal

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:05.000
This is a game best played with friends on
a couch, trust me..

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.420
with its simplified controls.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.400
funny customizations
upbeat music.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.980
and very addictive co-op mode, this game will
make any party shine!

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.310
Although for now, there hasn't been any online
multiplayer mode.. but hey, who could blame

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.109
them, when playing it in a crowd at home is
sooo much more awesome!

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.980
a playscore of 9.0

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.529
4th place is Helldivers

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:35.959
A very cliche but effective storyline that
may not be the best looking game on your console,

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.150
but is definitely one of the most co-op fun!

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.180
Its intense level per level action is never
boring, with lots of different challenges

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.139
to choose from, and awesome arsenal to choose,
ranging from heavy machine guns to armored

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:50.139
vehicles!

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:56.159
It has a playscore of 9.0

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.980
Number 3 is Life is Strange

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.549
Lately, I'm glad that more and more games
are giving higher importance to story and

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:03.549
content.

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.650
Sure, graphical prowess gives instant attraction
to a game, but that is nothing compared to

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.900
a good story that lasts a lifetime.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.859
with its excellent main character
interesting scenario

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.250
and a great story that makes your choices
feel meaningful.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.250
Life is Strange gets a playscore of 9.0

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.710
2nd best is Bloodborne

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.310
The spiritual successor of the Souls series
that looks and plays better!

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.629
Set in a vast wonderfully-grotesque world,
this game ups itself with:

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:40.560
awesome character and monster designs
explosive new weapons that transforms at your

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.500
will
randomized chalice dungeons

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.750
tons of heart-stopping enemy encounters
and epic boss fights!

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.880
Get ready to die.. a lot!

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.130
Bloodborne holds a playscore of 9.1

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.759
And the best is Resident Evil HD Remaster

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.970
Who knew that having:
limited vision of the surroundings due to

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.560
fixed camera angles.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.510
restricted action choices.
and scarce supplies, makes a game so intense,

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.130
it becomes awesome.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.220
Resident Evil did just that, although it is
only a remaster, alot of modern-day horror

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.280
games still can't compare to this game's history
and brilliance.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:28.330
It holds a playscore of 9.3

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:41.000
To recap here are the 10 Best Playstation
4 games of 2015 So Far
