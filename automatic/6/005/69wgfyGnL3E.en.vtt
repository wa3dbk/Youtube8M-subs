00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.910
 good morning 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.910
 methylene blue yonkis 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:22.020
 as you see this I say it but that 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:24.960
 the great bolich efe has come and to my house 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.570
 Well, now it's an aquarium for the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.120
 channel be a little more dynamic let's say and 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.440
 have others 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.440
 other aquariums also 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.410
 you see the differences truth 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.880
 the differences with the main schedule 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.290
 of the Chanel 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.200
 this aquarium an aquarium of liquid 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.540
 as you can see it is sugar to load a 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.250
 cyclic 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.050
 Y 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.800
 and it has several differences with respect 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.570
 to the tropical aquarium 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.870
 is as well is much more populated 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.050
 with rocks because of the behavior that 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.269
 they have in this family of fish because they are 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.490
 quite territorial and always occupy 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:12.860
 some one is between the rocks 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:16.540
 they usually come from Malawi lakes 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.990
 and victories in africa 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.120
 but there are other pieces of liquids like 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.360
 for example the shelves that are also 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:29.250
 cichlids although although it may not seem 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.250
 these are the cichlids par excellence 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.720
 or wash their territoriality clearly 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.630
 look 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.590
 you get to arming inside bushes 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.829
 and good as they see pretty colors 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.829
 colorful 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.930
 is attacking 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.170
 h 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:03.490
 this is pretty much yawning 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.680
 this is the female of this stand 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.700
 territorial that we recorded before that 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.640
 as you see then quite a lot more people 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.230
 borrow much is much more calm and 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.230
 it is not so territorial 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.719
 Now if you look and if he wants to 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.700
 leave there is a slight unfair and behind 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:25.319
 it will end well by the hole of the 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.780
 rock 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:33.380
 and right now it's there I do not know if it will be 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.680
 there it is and what is the breeding of this the 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.680
 beast 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.220
 and good 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.910
 As you can see, this has also been done 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.730
 supposes territory between the plants and 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.040
 there is something very curious 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:56.709
 in the sand like this 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:59.500
 it's not on a whim but we create 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.540
 our house is like this because 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.939
 cichlids 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.540
 in the sand with your mouth and 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:09.730
 redistribute in the aquarium to your liking 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.319
 to create let's say your little nests 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.319
 its territory areas etc 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:21.460
 this gap that is here for example 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:24.310
 is the nest let's say the territory of this 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:28.360
 big mouth bug that is here 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.470
 and well I do not know how I'm going to go through there 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.930
 back with that yellow that is a facelift 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.569
 and that has its territory at least 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.830
 here what happens is that well 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.050
 it also moves because apart from the 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.720
 aquarium however this bug here 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.780
 has its territory right below and you see 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.290
 as soon as someone approaches 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.090
 Well, attack 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.090
 but if we new for the part of the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.379
 aquarium because it no longer attacks 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.610
 and little more I hope you liked it and
