00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.389
 hello in this video only very briefly 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.849
 shown as well as under windows 8 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.189
 again dvd can look microsoft 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.259
 has the dvd standard with windows 8 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.910
 has dropped so the 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.710
 corresponding licenses are not worried 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.060
 and so far windows can not do that anymore 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.680
 we can easily see that I have 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.939
 me now here once a dvd inserted 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.820
 to run 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.140
 then we get directly the dvd 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.940
 structure displayed here 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.739
 corresponding files and we see 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.870
 on the basis of the missing specifically here in front 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.930
 a file to order does not take place 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.330
 and when I say open with then will 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.830
 then asked yes ok but how and me 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.960
 get the option in the app if necessary 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.309
 store to search for so currently 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.049
 not, however, is not quite so 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.269
 we only need one 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.750
 Application to install the whole 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.460
 can 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.269
 our recommendation here now a few 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.280
 Just click on the media player link in 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.710
 the description if I now completely 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.660
 install shortly 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.670
 that is very fast 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.100
 you can complete that 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.810
 complete 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.090
 at the first start we can do this here 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.150
 confirm so and now should the whole 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:22.100
 already running medium open drives de 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.100
 dialed takes a moment 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.440
 but then it comes down so let's press 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.440
 on clay 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.650
 works wonderfully I hear yes 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.830
 even the tone to you only have that 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.830
 picture is easy 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.830
 OK
