laying one on top of the other and then

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.830 
laying one on top of the other and then
the<00:02:05.100> outside<00:02:05.280> you're<00:02:05.790> bringing<00:02:06.120> inwards<00:02:06.570> into

the outside you're bringing inwards into
the<00:02:07.080> circle<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.830> then<00:02:08.700> you're<00:02:08.880> going<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.060> pull

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300
