with the wood grain interior let's see

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.590 
with the wood grain interior let's see
I'm<00:01:21.509> trying<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.840> remember<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:23.600> speedometer

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
I'm trying to remember the speedometer

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.230 
I'm trying to remember the speedometer
does<00:01:24.810> work<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.560> gas<00:01:25.799> gauge<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.340> showing<00:01:26.369> full

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
does work the gas gauge is showing full

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.899 
does work the gas gauge is showing full
so<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.869> may<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> grounding<00:01:29.280> issue<00:01:29.460> we<00:01:29.759> need

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
so it may have a grounding issue we need

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.999 
so it may have a grounding issue we need
to<00:01:30.000> track<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.420> down<00:01:30.659> yet<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> gas<00:01:31.740> gauge

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
to track that down yet but the gas gauge

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.710 
to track that down yet but the gas gauge
is<00:01:32.189> showing<00:01:32.520> full<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.119> need<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.420> figure<00:01:33.630> out

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
is showing full so we need to figure out

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.749 
is showing full so we need to figure out
why<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.930> gas<00:01:34.770> gauge<00:01:35.100> isn't<00:01:35.549> isn't

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
why the gas gauge isn't isn't

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.770 
why the gas gauge isn't isn't
