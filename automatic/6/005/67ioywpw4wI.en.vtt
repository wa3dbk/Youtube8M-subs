00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
putting on the makeup one thing one

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.040 
putting on the makeup one thing one
thing<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.880> maybe<00:02:06.030> try<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.480> particular

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
thing that maybe try this particular

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.540 
thing that maybe try this particular
foundation<00:02:07.620> I<00:02:07.800> had<00:02:07.890> actually<00:02:08.040> received<00:02:08.250> a

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
foundation I had actually received a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.950 
foundation I had actually received a
sample<00:02:08.760> with<00:02:09.150> a<00:02:09.210> couple<00:02:09.450> different<00:02:09.540> shades

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
sample with a couple different shades

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.360 
sample with a couple different shades
and<00:02:10.380> it<00:02:11.130> seemed<00:02:11.460> to<00:02:11.640> be<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:13.110> says<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.830> website

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
and it seemed to be it says the website

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.340 
and it seemed to be it says the website
says<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.820> it's<00:02:15.390> supposed<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.690> be<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> medium

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
says that it's supposed to be a medium

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.410 
says that it's supposed to be a medium
coverage<00:02:16.680> foundation<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.030> was<00:02:18.270> looking

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
coverage foundation and so I was looking

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.320 
coverage foundation and so I was looking
for<00:02:18.750> something<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.410> would<00:02:20.070> have<00:02:20.340> my<00:02:21.030> shape

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
for something that would have my shape

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.910 
for something that would have my shape
because<00:02:21.600> sometimes<00:02:21.960> when<00:02:22.590> you're<00:02:22.740> just

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
because sometimes when you're just

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.470 
because sometimes when you're just
looking<00:02:23.190> for<00:02:23.220> foundations<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:24.060> can<00:02:24.180> be<00:02:24.270> hard

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
looking for foundations it can be hard

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.140 
looking for foundations it can be hard
to<00:02:24.600> find<00:02:25.610> foundations<00:02:26.610> for<00:02:26.670> darker<00:02:26.970> skin

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
to find foundations for darker skin

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.660 
to find foundations for darker skin
tones<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:28.770> it's<00:02:28.890> not<00:02:29.010> like<00:02:29.190> okay<00:02:29.490> maybe

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
tones and so it's not like okay maybe

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.450 
tones and so it's not like okay maybe
there's<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.060> big<00:02:30.270> one<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.630> would<00:02:30.750> work<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.460> so

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
there's a big one that would work and so

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.580 
there's a big one that would work and so
this<00:02:32.910> particular<00:02:33.150> color<00:02:33.660> mahogany<00:02:34.260> matched

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
this particular color mahogany matched

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:43.100 
this particular color mahogany matched
me<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.730> best<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:36.840> bought<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:39.800> so<00:02:42.110> the

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
me the best and so I bought it so the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.130 
me the best and so I bought it so the
product<00:02:44.070> is<00:02:44.510> supposed<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.600> be<00:02:45.660> radiant<00:02:46.020> skin

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
product is supposed to be radiant skin

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.510 
product is supposed to be radiant skin
satin<00:02:46.590> finish<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.190> it's<00:02:47.280> supposed<00:02:47.460> to

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
satin finish and so it's supposed to

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.000 
satin finish and so it's supposed to
kind<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.790> give<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.410> brightening<00:02:49.410> effect<00:02:49.500> but

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
kind of give a brightening effect but

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.480 
kind of give a brightening effect but
still<00:02:50.310> natural<00:02:51.800> as<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:53.010> see<00:02:53.220> i'm<00:02:53.340> not

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
still natural as you can see i'm not

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.160 
still natural as you can see i'm not
using<00:02:53.700> any<00:02:53.970> primers<00:02:54.510> or<00:02:54.630> anything<00:02:54.960> like<00:02:54.990> that

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
using any primers or anything like that

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.410 
using any primers or anything like that
just<00:02:55.410> because<00:02:56.070> i<00:02:56.460> kind<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.730> want<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:56.970> get<00:02:57.150> the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
just because i kind of want to get the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.560 
just because i kind of want to get the
real<00:02:57.630> true<00:02:58.490> finish<00:02:59.490> for<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.760> foundation<00:02:59.970> i

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
real true finish for the foundation i

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.949 
real true finish for the foundation i
don't<00:03:00.750> want<00:03:00.930> anything<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.350> really<00:03:02.480> sway<00:03:03.480> kind

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
don't want anything to really sway kind

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.920 
don't want anything to really sway kind
of<00:03:04.370> how<00:03:05.370> well<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.090> foundation<00:03:06.570> would<00:03:06.690> work

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
of how well the foundation would work

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.500 
of how well the foundation would work
because<00:03:07.709> sometimes<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.430> good<00:03:08.550> primer<00:03:08.790> can<00:03:09.180> you

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
because sometimes a good primer can you

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.110 
because sometimes a good primer can you
know<00:03:09.600> make<00:03:09.810> your<00:03:09.890> make<00:03:10.890> your<00:03:11.130> makeup<00:03:11.790> left<00:03:11.970> a

know make your make your makeup left a
little<00:03:12.239> bit<00:03:12.390> longer<00:03:12.570> than<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:13.080> probably<00:03:13.260> would

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
little bit longer than it probably would

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.110 
little bit longer than it probably would
have<00:03:16.010> one<00:03:17.010> thing<00:03:17.160> I<00:03:17.220> can<00:03:17.400> say<00:03:17.550> is<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.790> it<00:03:17.910> kind

very light fetal and smooth texture with
the<00:05:16.880> with<00:05:17.880> the<00:05:17.910> foundation<00:05:18.150> it<00:05:18.870> has<00:05:19.380> just<00:05:19.680> a

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
the with the foundation it has just a

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.180 
the with the foundation it has just a
very<00:05:20.510> when<00:05:21.510> they<00:05:21.630> say<00:05:21.900> satin<00:05:22.440> they<00:05:22.980> really

very when they say satin they really

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.310 
very when they say satin they really
means<00:05:23.490> that<00:05:23.700> it's<00:05:23.940> very<00:05:24.120> smooth<00:05:24.540> and<00:05:24.900> if<00:05:25.230> you

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
means that it's very smooth and if you

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.810 
means that it's very smooth and if you
can<00:05:25.440> find<00:05:25.620> that<00:05:25.890> itself<00:05:26.160> to<00:05:26.310> take<00:05:26.610> hear

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
really big difference is that reberty

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.659 
really big difference is that reberty
can<00:06:18.960> make<00:06:19.110> it<00:06:19.260> haven't<00:06:19.560> I<00:06:19.710> believe<00:06:20.100> about<00:06:20.130> 12

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669 
can make it haven't I believe about 12

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.300 
can make it haven't I believe about 12
13<00:06:21.210> shades<00:06:21.539> and<00:06:22.110> this<00:06:22.289> one<00:06:22.470> has<00:06:22.650> about<00:06:22.919> 20

antal<00:06:30.990> work<00:06:31.110> very<00:06:31.410> nicely<00:06:31.470> that<00:06:32.220> they

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
antal work very nicely that they

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.500 
antal work very nicely that they
definitely<00:06:32.850> are<00:06:33.060> in<00:06:33.240> the<00:06:33.539> same<00:06:33.810> price

probably Roy drugstore but sometimes and

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.160 
probably Roy drugstore but sometimes and
it's<00:07:51.130> at<00:07:51.250> and<00:07:51.550> I<00:07:51.640> said<00:07:51.820> earlier<00:07:52.120> it<00:07:52.750> can't<00:07:52.990> be<00:07:53.140> a

it's at and I said earlier it can't be a

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.750 
it's at and I said earlier it can't be a
little<00:07:53.290> hard<00:07:53.620> to<00:07:53.740> find<00:07:53.920> fighting<00:07:54.250> foundations

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:54.760 
little hard to find fighting foundations

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.430 
little hard to find fighting foundations
