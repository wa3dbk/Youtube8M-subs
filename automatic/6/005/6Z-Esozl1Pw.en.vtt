hello everybody on YouTube sonic waffles
here<00:00:02.129> and<00:00:02.280> today<00:00:02.399> we're<00:00:02.700> comparing<00:00:03.060> different

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
here and today we're comparing different

here and today we're comparing different
gun<00:00:03.600> setups<00:00:04.049> for<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.290> m4a1<00:00:04.920> now<00:00:05.370> you<00:00:05.460> might<00:00:05.609> be

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
gun setups for the m4a1 now you might be

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.950 
gun setups for the m4a1 now you might be
thinking<00:00:05.730> it's<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.120> little<00:00:06.330> bit<00:00:06.450> too<00:00:06.600> late<00:00:06.810> to

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960

in<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.269> game's<00:00:09.510> lifecycle<00:00:10.230> however<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.800> would

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
in the game's lifecycle however I would

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.709 
in the game's lifecycle however I would
like<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.429> say<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.759> it's<00:00:11.880> it's<00:00:12.480> very

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
like to say that it's it's very

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.360 
like to say that it's it's very
confusing<00:00:12.929> for<00:00:13.290> me<00:00:13.349> sometimes<00:00:13.799> what<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.160> should

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
confusing for me sometimes what I should

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.919 
confusing for me sometimes what I should
put<00:00:14.519> on<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> gun<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.150> decided<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.630> take<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.750> few

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
put on a gun and I decided to take a few

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.840 
put on a gun and I decided to take a few
minutes<00:00:16.109> out<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.770> my<00:00:16.949> day<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.220> record<00:00:17.730> some

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
minutes out of my day and record some

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.429 
minutes out of my day and record some
footage<00:00:18.150> compare<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.779> footage<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.260> then

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
footage compare the footage and then

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.080 
footage compare the footage and then
sure<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.010> guys<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.609> show<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:20.970> my

does make this very unlikely to have
class<00:00:39.210> here's<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.079> picture<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.620> actual

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
class here's a picture of the actual

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.260 
class here's a picture of the actual
bullet<00:00:41.340> spread

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.690 

the<00:00:46.810> next<00:00:47.110> set<00:00:47.260> up<00:00:47.410> is<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:47.740> exact<00:00:48.040> same<00:00:48.250> one<00:00:48.490> in

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
the next set up is the exact same one in

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.030 
the next set up is the exact same one in
the<00:00:48.790> last<00:00:49.000> clip<00:00:49.300> except<00:00:49.840> this<00:00:50.110> one<00:00:50.380> has<00:00:50.620> kick

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
the last clip except this one has kick

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.620 
the last clip except this one has kick
on<00:00:51.220> it<00:00:51.400> and<00:00:51.550> you'll<00:00:51.970> definitely<00:00:52.120> see<00:00:52.420> that

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
on it and you'll definitely see that

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.170 
on it and you'll definitely see that
kick<00:00:53.230> definitely<00:00:53.770> removes<00:00:54.550> much<00:00:54.910> of<00:00:54.970> the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
kick definitely removes much of the

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.620 
kick definitely removes much of the
vertical<00:00:55.600> recoil<00:00:55.720> of<00:00:56.080> this<00:00:56.260> gun<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:58.210> clip<00:00:58.510> is

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
vertical recoil of this gun this clip is

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.479 
vertical recoil of this gun this clip is
self-explanatory<00:00:59.230> it's<00:00:59.950> the<00:01:00.070> exact<00:01:00.310> same

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
self-explanatory it's the exact same

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.340 
self-explanatory it's the exact same
thing<00:01:00.760> except<00:01:01.180> much<00:01:01.540> less<00:01:01.780> vertical<00:01:01.989> recoil

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
thing except much less vertical recoil

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.380 
thing except much less vertical recoil
and<00:01:02.680> you<00:01:03.100> can<00:01:03.220> even<00:01:03.460> tell<00:01:03.670> by<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.000> picture

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
and you can even tell by the picture

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.510 
and you can even tell by the picture
here<00:01:04.720> that<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.470> bullet<00:01:05.770> spread<00:01:05.950> is<00:01:06.190> very

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
here that the bullet spread is very

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.860 
here that the bullet spread is very
tightly<00:01:06.940> packed

a1<00:01:53.430> plus<00:01:53.820> answer<00:01:54.300> does<00:01:55.110> have<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.710> reduced<00:01:55.860> range

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400

a1 plus answer does have a reduced range
however<00:01:56.930> you<00:01:57.930> won't<00:01:58.020> run<00:01:58.200> into<00:01:58.260> too<00:01:58.710> many

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890

close<00:01:59.220> quarters<00:01:59.550> gun<00:01:59.700> fights<00:01:59.970> with<00:02:00.180> it

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
close quarters gun fights with it

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.720 
close quarters gun fights with it
because<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:01.230> kills<00:02:01.440> pretty<00:02:01.920> quickly<00:02:02.160> and<00:02:02.490> also

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
because it kills pretty quickly and also

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.270 
because it kills pretty quickly and also
the<00:02:02.850> maps<00:02:03.060> are<00:02:03.360> decently<00:02:04.170> close<00:02:04.650> quarters<00:02:05.070> on

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
the maps are decently close quarters on

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.670 
the maps are decently close quarters on
this<00:02:05.580> game<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.150> you<00:02:06.750> do<00:02:06.870> have<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.080> advantage

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
this game so you do have the advantage

of an assault rifle even though a
slightly<00:02:09.480> lowered<00:02:10.380> range<00:02:10.649> because<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.100> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
slightly lowered range because of the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.760 
slightly lowered range because of the
silencer<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.670> also<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.780> silencers<00:02:13.260> added

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
silencer and also the silencers added
