reached its flash point that is a

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.390 
reached its flash point that is a
temperature<00:00:22.779> at<00:00:23.050> which<00:00:23.110> enough<00:00:23.980> of<00:00:24.160> the<00:00:24.279> oil

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
temperature at which enough of the oil

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.420 
temperature at which enough of the oil
has<00:00:24.790> vaporized<00:00:25.420> to<00:00:25.869> form<00:00:26.140> a<00:00:26.320> vapor<00:00:26.590> which<00:00:27.160> can

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
has vaporized to form a vapor which can

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.380 
has vaporized to form a vapor which can
then<00:00:27.460> be<00:00:27.640> combusted<00:00:29.760> when<00:00:30.760> we<00:00:30.880> add<00:00:31.060> the<00:00:31.210> water

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
then be combusted when we add the water

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.770 
then be combusted when we add the water
to<00:00:32.020> the<00:00:32.169> oil<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:33.430> water<00:00:33.699> will<00:00:34.239> instantly

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
to the oil the water will instantly

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.960 
to the oil the water will instantly
evaporate<00:00:35.410> this<00:00:36.160> is<00:00:36.280> because<00:00:36.580> there<00:00:36.790> is<00:00:36.879> an

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
evaporate this is because there is an

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.450 
evaporate this is because there is an
energy<00:00:37.180> transfer<00:00:37.629> from<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:38.470> oil<00:00:38.620> to<00:00:39.430> the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
energy transfer from the oil to the

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.090 
energy transfer from the oil to the
water<00:00:39.790> the<00:00:40.780> reason<00:00:41.080> this<00:00:41.170> energy<00:00:41.559> transfer<00:00:41.980> is

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
water the reason this energy transfer is

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
water the reason this energy transfer is
so<00:00:42.309> big<00:00:42.610> is<00:00:43.059> the<00:00:43.360> oil<00:00:43.800> light<00:00:44.800> water<00:00:45.160> has<00:00:45.640> quite

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
so big is the oil light water has quite

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.110 
so big is the oil light water has quite
a<00:00:46.149> high<00:00:46.420> specific<00:00:47.140> heat<00:00:47.170> capacity<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
a high specific heat capacity the

when we add the water you're cold this

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.190 
when we add the water you're cold this
creates<00:01:09.340> a<00:01:09.430> big<00:01:09.729> temperature<00:01:10.270> difference<00:01:10.780> or

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
creates a big temperature difference or

creates a big temperature difference or
a<00:01:11.229> temperature<00:01:11.770> gradient<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.970> is<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.300> big

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
a temperature gradient it is the big

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.990 
a temperature gradient it is the big
difference<00:01:14.320> in<00:01:14.470> temperature<00:01:15.070> which<00:01:15.580> causes

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
difference in temperature which causes

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.570 
difference in temperature which causes
the<00:01:16.119> very<00:01:16.330> fast<00:01:16.720> energy<00:01:17.049> transfer<00:01:17.830> this
