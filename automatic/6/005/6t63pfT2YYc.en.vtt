coming<00:01:00.060> through<00:01:00.240> the<00:01:00.360> sides<00:01:00.630> it<00:01:01.170> makes<00:01:01.380> it

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
coming through the sides it makes it

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.810 
coming through the sides it makes it
different<00:01:01.860> from<00:01:01.920> everyone<00:01:02.250> else<00:01:02.490> where<00:01:02.730> they

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
different from everyone else where they

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.420 
different from everyone else where they
do<00:01:02.970> the<00:01:03.120> stunt<00:01:03.420> person<00:01:03.739> so<00:01:04.739> what<00:01:04.860> makes<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.280> IP

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
do the stunt person so what makes the IP

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.920 
do the stunt person so what makes the IP
great<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.240> fact<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.510> we<00:01:06.660> have<00:01:06.810> an

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
great is the fact that we have an

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.660 
great is the fact that we have an
anatomic<00:01:07.560> look<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> bottom<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> last

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
anatomic look to the bottom of the last

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.300 
anatomic look to the bottom of the last
we<00:01:09.210> take<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.570> into<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> DI<00:01:10.200> P<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.100> this

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
we take that into the DI P and this

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.890 
we take that into the DI P and this
means<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.910> takes<00:01:11.940> on<00:01:12.300> every<00:01:12.690> single

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
means that it takes on every single

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.050 
means that it takes on every single
curve<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.650> contour<00:01:14.130> your<00:01:14.280> foot<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.030> you

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
curve and contour your foot so you

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.780 
curve and contour your foot so you
