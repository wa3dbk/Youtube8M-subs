hi<00:00:06.240> I'm<00:00:06.720> Veronica<00:00:06.899> let's<00:00:07.859> talk<00:00:08.130> about

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
hi I'm Veronica let's talk about

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.250 
hi I'm Veronica let's talk about
increasing<00:00:08.910> our<00:00:09.150> metabolic<00:00:09.719> rate<00:00:09.929> through

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
increasing our metabolic rate through

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.169 
increasing our metabolic rate through
diet<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.830> lose<00:00:11.460> weight<00:00:11.759> quickly<00:00:12.030> and

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
diet and lose weight quickly and

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.720 
diet and lose weight quickly and
steadily<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:13.380> metabolic<00:00:13.769> rate<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.700> rate

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
steadily the metabolic rate is the rate

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.150 
steadily the metabolic rate is the rate
at<00:00:15.059> which<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.540> body<00:00:15.780> burns<00:00:16.139> calories<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:17.039> is

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
at which the body burns calories that is

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.640 
at which the body burns calories that is
the<00:00:17.250> food<00:00:17.460> we<00:00:17.640> eat<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:18.029> produce<00:00:18.210> energy<00:00:18.650> that

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
the food we eat to produce energy that

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.509 
the food we eat to produce energy that
means<00:00:19.980> simply<00:00:20.550> put<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.570> eat<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.410> live<00:00:22.650> some

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
means simply put we eat to live some

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.040 
means simply put we eat to live some
foods<00:00:23.880> increase<00:00:24.269> your<00:00:24.570> body's<00:00:24.869> metabolic

foods increase your body's metabolic

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.250

more energy is produced that means that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.479 
more energy is produced that means that
even<00:00:34.980> as<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.309> eat<00:00:35.610> we<00:00:36.239> actually<00:00:36.870> lose<00:00:37.140> weight

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
even as we eat we actually lose weight
