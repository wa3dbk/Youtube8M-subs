00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.660
 the diamond 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.320
 once upon a time a king a long time ago 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.380
 who lived in ireland 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.900
 in those days Ireland was 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.900
 divided into many small kingdoms 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.840
 and the kingdom of that king was one more 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.450
 between those 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.150
 both the king and the kingdom were not so 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.700
 known 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.700
 and nobody paid them much attention 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.320
 but one day the king inherited a great 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.909
 incomparable beauty diamond of a 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.130
 family member who had died 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.939
 it was the largest diamond ever known 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.520
 it left everyone who 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:23.909
 they were lucky enough to contemplate it 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.539
 the other kings began to notice 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.079
 this king because if he owned a diamond 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:33.619
 how that had to be something now 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.619
 the usual 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.890
 the king had the jewel perpetually 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.080
 exposed in a glass case so that 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.520
 all who wanted to could 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.850
 getting closer 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.260
 to admire her 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.869
 naturally a good guardians 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.570
 armed they maintained that unique diamond 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.210
 under constant vigilance 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.570
 both the king and the king did not prosper 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.870
 and the king attributed to the diamond its good 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.870
 fortune 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:12.690
 one day one of the nervous guards 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:17.060
 requested permission to see the king 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.060
 and the guard trembled like a leaf 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.370
 he gave the king terrible news 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.530
 a defect had appeared in the 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.530
 Diamond 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.379
 it was a crack 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.540
 appeared just in the middle of the 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:39.379
 jewel 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.769
 the king was horrified and approached 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:44.090
 running to the place where I was 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.209
 installed the glass ballot box for 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.710
 check for yourself the deterioration of 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.040
 the jewel 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.519
 and it was true 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.969
 the diamond had suffered a fissure in 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:01.890
 your bowels flaw perfectly 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:04.569
 visible up on the outside of the jewel 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.150
 summoned all the jewelers of the kingdom 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:12.830
 to ask for your opinion and advice 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.010
 they only gave him bad news 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.820
 they assured him that the defect of the jewel 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.600
 it was so deep that if they tried 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:28.400
 correct what they would only get 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:32.150
 it would be that that wonderful stone 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.180
 lose all its value 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.000
 and that if they risked splitting it 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.069
 half to get two stones 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.120
 precious 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:47.360
 the jewel could in all likelihood 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.060
 split into millions of fragments 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.840
 while the king dictated me deeply 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:58.010
 about those two unique and sad options 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:01.910
 that he was offered an elderly jeweler 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:05.120
 who had been the last to arrive was 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.580
 approached and said 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:13.090
 if you give me a week to work in the 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:16.510
 jewel you may be able to repair it 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.239
 at first the king did not give credit 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.669
 some to his words 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.699
 because the other jewelers were 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.980
 totally sure of the impossibility 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:31.050
 to do it 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.770
 but finally the king gave 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:38.550
 But with one condition 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:41.340
 the jewel should not leave the royal palace 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.409
 the old jeweler liked the 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.459
 King's wish 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:49.469
 that was a good place to work and 

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:52.139
 I also accept that some guardians 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:55.150
 they will watch your work from outside 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:58.990
 from the door of the improvised workshop 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.480
 while he was working on the 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.810
 jewel 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:07.500
 still constiendo much to not have another 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:10.500
 option the king took for good the offer 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.470
 of the old jeweler 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.200
 to the newspaper 'he and the guardians 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.060
 they walked nervously before the door of 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.370
 that room 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.150
 they did not hear the sounds of the tools 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:27.660
 who worked the stone with blows and 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:31.620
 very soft rubs 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.420
 they wondered what he was being and what 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.860
 is what would happen if the old man 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.009
 cheated 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.620
 after week agreed the 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:44.919
 old man left the room 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.500
 the king and the guardians rushed 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:51.280
 inside it to see the 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.760
 work of the mysterious jeweler to the king is 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.540
 Tears of pure joy 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:01.510
 his jewel had become something 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.400
 incomparably more beautiful and valuable 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:07.020
 that before 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:10.000
 the old man had engraved on the diamond 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.700
 a perfect rose 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.220
 and the crack that previously divided the jewel 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.520
 in half it had become the 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:22.060
 stem of the rose 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:26.320
 this is how God heals us works in 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:29.560
 our biggest flaw and it makes it 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:35.400
 and with him to us 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.400
 in something perfect and beautiful 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:43.080
 God bless you and keep well 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.590
 do not stop putting in your hands 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:53.810
 our defects so that he the 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:53.810
 transform into something beautiful and beautiful 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.050
 and
