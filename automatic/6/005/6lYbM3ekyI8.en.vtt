 Farms from 28 EU countries 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.130
 the result of the conversation is so disappointing 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.020
 that a number of states have already openly declared 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.060

 interventions are fruits and vegetables the most 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.680

 coming back from the Russian border 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.130

 pulling the whole agricultural sector 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.850
 hope is just that by that time

 will introduce new sanctions against Russia 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.500
 of particular concern are measures in

 the attitude of Russian banks is hidden 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.040

 the result is a spiral 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.020
 which harms economic relations 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.820
 and does not benefit anyone
