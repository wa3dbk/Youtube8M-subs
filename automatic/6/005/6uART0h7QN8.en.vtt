hi today I'm going to show you how to
make<00:00:06.250> a<00:00:06.460> 3d<00:00:07.089> origami<00:00:07.330> snowflake<00:00:08.230> you<00:00:08.950> will

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.100 
make a 3d origami snowflake you will

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.070 
make a 3d origami snowflake you will
need<00:00:09.280> a<00:00:09.840> piece<00:00:10.840> of<00:00:10.870> paper<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:13.750> can<00:00:13.900> use

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
need a piece of paper you can use

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.730 
need a piece of paper you can use
origami<00:00:14.500> paper<00:00:14.799> if<00:00:15.099> you'd<00:00:15.309> like<00:00:15.810> scissors<00:00:16.810> and

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
origami paper if you'd like scissors and

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.620 
origami paper if you'd like scissors and
tape<00:00:20.550> first<00:00:21.550> we<00:00:21.820> have<00:00:21.970> to<00:00:22.000> make<00:00:22.270> our<00:00:22.300> paper

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
tape first we have to make our paper

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.990 
tape first we have to make our paper
into<00:00:22.989> a<00:00:23.020> square<00:00:23.410> so<00:00:24.250> what<00:00:24.369> you're<00:00:24.550> going<00:00:24.730> to<00:00:24.849> do

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
into a square so what you're going to do

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.530 
into a square so what you're going to do
is<00:00:25.779> fold<00:00:26.619> it<00:00:26.800> into<00:00:27.160> like<00:00:27.579> a<00:00:27.610> triangle<00:00:27.970> shape

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:28.540 
is fold it into like a triangle shape

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:46.650 
is fold it into like a triangle shape
and<00:00:28.750> match<00:00:29.470> up<00:00:29.680> the<00:00:29.710> edges<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.820> you<00:00:46.480> should

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
and match up the edges so you should

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.410 
and match up the edges so you should
have<00:00:46.750> something<00:00:46.960> looks<00:00:47.290> like<00:00:47.590> this<00:00:47.890> and<00:00:48.420> what

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
have something looks like this and what

00:00:49.420 --> 00:01:07.010 
have something looks like this and what
you<00:00:49.540> want<00:00:49.690> to<00:00:49.780> do<00:00:49.900> is<00:00:50.020> cut<00:00:50.200> the<00:00:50.230> rectangle<00:00:50.980> off

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.460 

so<00:01:08.020> now<00:01:08.170> you<00:01:08.260> should<00:01:08.650> have<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:10.240> book<00:01:10.570> so<00:01:11.380> if

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
so now you should have this book so if

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.290 
so now you should have this book so if
you're<00:01:11.650> using<00:01:11.830> origami<00:01:12.400> paper<00:01:12.670> you're<00:01:13.090> going

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
you're using origami paper you're going

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.330 
you're using origami paper you're going
to<00:01:13.360> fold<00:01:13.570> this<00:01:13.690> square<00:01:14.140> in<00:01:14.260> half<00:01:14.320> so<00:01:15.070> you<00:01:15.159> got<00:01:15.310> a

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
to fold this square in half so you got a

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.219 
to fold this square in half so you got a
triangle<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.880> if<00:01:19.000> you<00:01:19.180> use<00:01:19.229> rectangular

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
triangle but if you use rectangular

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.250 
triangle but if you use rectangular
paper<00:01:20.440> you<00:01:20.799> don't<00:01:21.010> have<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.280> open<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.580> square

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
paper you don't have to open the square

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.450 
paper you don't have to open the square
so<00:01:23.260> now<00:01:23.470> you're<00:01:23.650> going<00:01:23.830> to<00:01:23.890> fold<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.220> triangle

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
so now you're going to fold the triangle

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.520 
so now you're going to fold the triangle
in<00:01:24.790> half

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.350 

and<00:01:29.979> you<00:01:30.340> should<00:01:30.520> have<00:01:30.549> a<00:01:30.670> full<00:01:31.000> bed<00:01:31.150> side

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
and you should have a full bed side

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.820 
and you should have a full bed side
which<00:01:31.630> you<00:01:31.780> can't<00:01:31.990> open<00:01:32.320> up<00:01:32.409> and<00:01:32.740> two<00:01:33.729> flaps<00:01:34.830> on

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
which you can't open up and two flaps on

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.620 
which you can't open up and two flaps on
the<00:01:35.979> side<00:01:36.250> with<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.549> two<00:01:36.820> flaps<00:01:37.150> you're<00:01:37.450> going

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
the side with the two flaps you're going

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.590 
the side with the two flaps you're going
to<00:01:37.690> make<00:01:37.810> three<00:01:38.200> cuts<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.210> don't<00:01:40.420> want<00:01:40.540> to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
to make three cuts but you don't want to

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.060 
to make three cuts but you don't want to
make<00:01:40.720> them<00:01:40.930> all<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.140> way<00:01:41.380> off<00:01:41.409> so<00:01:41.799> like<00:01:41.950> you

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
make them all the way off so like you

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:59.539 
make them all the way off so like you
don't<00:01:42.100> want<00:01:42.400> to<00:01:42.460> cut<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.729> whole<00:01:42.880> thing<00:01:42.909> off

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.650 

now<00:02:00.549> you're<00:02:00.820> going<00:02:00.940> to<00:02:01.030> open<00:02:01.270> you're<00:02:01.450> trying

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
now you're going to open you're trying

going to take those kind of curl them
into<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.620> cylinder<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.980> tape<00:02:24.519> it<00:02:27.959> now

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
into a cylinder of that and tape it now

into a cylinder of that and tape it now
you're<00:02:29.110> going<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.290> flip<00:02:29.560> it<00:02:29.620> over<00:02:31.470> curl<00:02:32.470> the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
you're going to flip it over curl the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.009 
you're going to flip it over curl the
next<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.100> fly<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.760> knees<00:02:34.000> into<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.720> cylinder

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
next to fly the knees into a cylinder

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.830 
next to fly the knees into a cylinder
and<00:02:36.269> take<00:02:37.269> it<00:02:39.090> you're<00:02:40.090> going<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.299> flip<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.660> over

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
and take it you're going to flip it over

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:50.089 
and take it you're going to flip it over
and<00:02:41.170> do<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.130> same<00:02:42.310> thing<00:02:42.579> with<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.760> next<00:02:43.209> two

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.670 

and<00:02:51.099> then<00:02:51.489> flip<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.819> over<00:02:51.940> again<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.900> do<00:02:53.530> the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
and then flip it over again and do the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:05.460 
and then flip it over again and do the
same<00:02:53.830> cost<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:04.390> need<00:03:04.569> to<00:03:04.720> do<00:03:04.870> this<00:03:05.050> now<00:03:05.110> that

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
same cost you need to do this now that

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.990 
same cost you need to do this now that
you<00:03:05.560> have<00:03:05.620> your<00:03:05.769> strong<00:03:06.130> skills<00:03:06.550> like<00:03:06.760> peaches

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
you have your strong skills like peaches

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.240 
you have your strong skills like peaches
first<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:07.989> want<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.230> take<00:03:08.410> two<00:03:08.709> pieces<00:03:09.810> and

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
first you want to take two pieces and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.880 
first you want to take two pieces and
tape<00:03:12.250> them<00:03:12.370> together<00:03:12.550> so<00:03:13.180> I<00:03:13.540> use<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.680> tape

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
tape them together so I use the tape

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.860 
tape them together so I use the tape
doing<00:03:15.130> it<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:15.519> works<00:03:15.730> nicely<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:16.630> don't

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
doing it it works nicely and you don't

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.589 
doing it it works nicely and you don't
really<00:03:17.110> see<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.260> tape<00:03:17.560> so<00:03:18.310> you're<00:03:19.150> gonna<00:03:19.300> put

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
really see the tape so you're gonna put

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.890 
really see the tape so you're gonna put
your<00:03:19.630> tape<00:03:19.959> on<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.880> edge<00:03:22.060> where<00:03:22.420> you<00:03:22.600> taped

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
your tape on the edge where you taped

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.940 
your tape on the edge where you taped
your<00:03:23.110> last<00:03:23.410> tail<00:03:23.890> flap<00:03:24.220> things<00:03:25.350> out<00:03:26.350> there<00:03:26.590> and

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
your last tail flap things out there and

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.620 
your last tail flap things out there and
then<00:03:27.850> you're<00:03:28.000> going<00:03:28.209> to<00:03:28.299> put<00:03:28.600> up<00:03:29.560> 50<00:03:30.360> or<00:03:31.360> tape

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
then you're going to put up 50 or tape

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.250 
then you're going to put up 50 or tape
down<00:03:31.840> it<00:03:32.049> either<00:03:32.530> one<00:03:32.830> more<00:03:33.239> on<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.299> point

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
down it either one more on the point

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.190 
down it either one more on the point
right<00:03:35.830> here<00:03:35.890> on<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.910> same<00:03:37.120> side<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:37.720> like<00:03:37.900> the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
right here on the same side so like the

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.900 
right here on the same side so like the
tapes<00:03:38.440> on<00:03:38.650> this<00:03:38.860> side<00:03:39.069> you're<00:03:39.549> going<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:39.790> put

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
tapes on this side you're going to put

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.140 
tapes on this side you're going to put
it<00:03:40.000> on<00:03:40.120> that<00:03:40.269> this<00:03:40.690> side<00:03:40.930> not<00:03:41.319> this<00:03:41.680> one<00:03:41.950> so<00:03:45.150> and

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
it on that this side not this one so and

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:54.150 
it on that this side not this one so and
you're<00:03:47.080> going<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:47.349> tape<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:48.900> together<00:03:53.160> so

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
you're going to tape that together so

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.380 
you're going to tape that together so
when<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.400> do<00:03:54.549> your<00:03:54.700> first<00:03:54.910> two<00:03:55.150> it<00:03:55.359> should

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
when you do your first two it should

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.720 
when you do your first two it should
look<00:03:55.660> like<00:03:55.720> this<00:03:56.140> and<00:03:56.410> then<00:03:57.220> do<00:03:57.430> that<00:03:57.579> with

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
look like this and then do that with

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.479 
look like this and then do that with
this<00:03:57.760> analysis<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.630> that<00:03:58.780> looks<00:03:58.959> like<00:03:59.109> this

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
this analysis and that looks like this

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.840 
this analysis and that looks like this
when<00:04:00.489> you<00:04:00.609> type<00:04:00.790> your<00:04:00.820> last<00:04:01.239> piece<00:04:01.510> on<00:04:02.850> you're

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
when you type your last piece on you're

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.890 
when you type your last piece on you're
going<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.060> basically<00:04:04.390> do<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.750> same<00:04:04.870> thing<00:04:05.700> put

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
going to basically do the same thing put

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.069 
going to basically do the same thing put
one<00:04:07.900> tape<00:04:08.140> doughnut<00:04:08.850> which<00:04:09.850> of<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.660> one<00:04:10.840> piece

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
one tape doughnut which of the one piece

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.789 
one tape doughnut which of the one piece
and<00:04:11.500> then<00:04:12.160> on<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:12.579> piece<00:04:12.819> opposite<00:04:13.799> you're

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
and then on the piece opposite you're

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.969 
and then on the piece opposite you're
going<00:04:15.100> to<00:04:15.160> put<00:04:15.370> another<00:04:16.000> tip<00:04:16.510> to<00:04:16.930> it<00:04:17.169> so<00:04:17.950> you

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
going to put another tip to it so you

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.310 
going to put another tip to it so you
should<00:04:18.250> have<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.669> sort<00:04:19.150> of<00:04:19.209> one<00:04:19.359> but<00:04:20.200> you're

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
should have to sort of one but you're

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:27.909 
should have to sort of one but you're
only<00:04:20.440> going<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:20.739> put<00:04:20.950> one

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:49.330 

and<00:04:28.919> it<00:04:29.250> might<00:04:29.430> be<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.639> little<00:04:29.880> tight<00:04:30.150> fitting

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.400 

and<00:04:50.340> that's<00:04:50.520> how<00:04:50.729> you<00:04:50.789> make<00:04:51.650> an<00:04:53.389> Oregon<00:04:54.410> 3d

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
and that's how you make an Oregon 3d

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:10.249 
and that's how you make an Oregon 3d
stuff<00:04:55.740> like<00:05:00.919> it's<00:05:01.919> kind<00:05:02.099> of<00:05:02.160> hard<00:05:02.370> to<00:05:02.430> see<00:05:09.259> into

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
stuff like it's kind of hard to see into

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.650 
stuff like it's kind of hard to see into
watching
