00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.900
 lagging team almost did 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.060
 dress correctly but I 'm afraid to command 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.670
 was formed from elite underground 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.890
 mole troops they just don't see what have 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.960
 They appear on the base but it seems or I will give 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.860
 starts something dare and runs putting on 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.170
 calling his allies will the crust fall 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.170

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.160
 are made and the crust does not fall remains me 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.160
 80 x p 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.140
 the phenomenal luck of the red team but 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.600
 him roars their regular you from blue though 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.210
 they themselves took their boss as we are evil 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.470
 teams will fight for the so whether 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.270
 fight for him 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.040
 great question civic team 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.320
 suggests that red will go 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.260
 boss but but red come and 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.420
 tied up a fight 35 which is nothing 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.280
 good does not promise the blue team 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.200
 less boxing red team has already reached 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.030
 the citadel starts picking at the core 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.640
 blue team and oddly enough 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.430
 the players are already absolutely nothing here 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.960
 it's just a two bosses fight 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.210

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.030
 Illidana and supports suppose that 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.979
 they have no chance to win but luck 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.410
 again on the side of the red team 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.600
 one hit was not enough for the boss 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.470
 blue to win luck piece 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.570
