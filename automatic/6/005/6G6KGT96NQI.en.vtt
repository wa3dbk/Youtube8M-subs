00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.930
 what wave bands how are they good 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.840
 I hope you are very well already know that I 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.700
 I am your company extreme grunge and now 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.759
 I 'll tell you how they can overclock jr 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.400
 your amd eye processor only works for 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:18.130
 processors to md comes out good first 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.800
 what we have to do is go to the link 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.410
 that I left them down here to download 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.259
 a program that is called md overdrive 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.259
 good since we will give it below and you 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.179
 we will give in download where 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.400
 will download I do not discard it because 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.370
 I already have it sir and it comes out as it 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.600
 start downloading everything they install is 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.100
 very easy natural to the next 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.690
 next next since it does not have 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.520
 virus is from md and it comes out good 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.310
 this 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.230
 what we will have to do is minimize 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.830
 everything Everything everything 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.200
 try not to have anything open this we 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.910
 we will go to the link in the icon that left us 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.140
 in the downloaded desktop and all the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.579
 fart we will give you accept 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.890
 and we wait for him to load 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.649
 but once here loaded what 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.899
 we will have to do is press the 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.570
 little green button that you see here so that 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:16.490
 it gets so red comes out once it's tight 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.490
 we will have to go to clock and voltage 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.030
 we 're going to watch the voltage 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.240
 I want to show my processor so that 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.780
 see what is a mdf 6.300 to 3.5 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.640
 gigahertz comes out here I have it to 4.10 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.000
 because I already have it overclocked like 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.190
 you can see look 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.900
 but I'm going to show you so they can see and 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:44.130
 here is mdf 6,300 to 3.5 giga hertz is 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.590
 of 6 cores look how can 3.5 to 4.1 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.720
 this overclock this with turbo it is 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.090
 You can say good once you've seen 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.600
 that we will have to go to watch and 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.440
 voltage and then we will have to tighten the 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.430
 this 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.620
 for that multiplier of 0 cores comes out 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.710
 here look at that I leave your decision I 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.150
 I put it I had it in 305 but as I already 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.840
 I have it because I want and I saw it 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:13.500
 well you are going to go up 5 in 5 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.080
 comes out so that they do not get so 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.240
 it's worth it, do not burn your 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.010
 provider or not raise it so much so 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.440
 go up more than 10 positions company 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.660
 social is going to burn out good I'll 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:30.400
 I upload here to 4.7 I give it to apply and what 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.730

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.820
 average 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.480
 and now our blockade was 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.060
 processor we will give you to accept again 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.190
 Sirs 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.620
 and ready and stay processor 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.739

 restart it and it's already good I hope that 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.250
