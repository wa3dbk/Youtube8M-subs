00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.790
 wanted to go all the way and that a site 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.179
 who today presents his material and 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.179
 its software 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.190
 these two worlds is guillaume and 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.530
 campbell come say it I'll go 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.640
 so present my material and me and 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.439
 my software that use to do 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.810
 the videos simply I 'm going to you 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.290
 first show the material plus the 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.360
 software 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.590
 so for you and your under your eyes the 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:34.160
 laic 180 of the brand triton so who 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.330
 lets serves micro and 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.040
 helmets at the same time to taste a little 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.150
 all the music 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.680
 so I bought 70 euros on 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.170
 rueducommerce them 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.760
 frankly I'm not disappointed I thought 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.739
 I thought that since it's a low of 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.399
 range I thought it was going well 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.320
 it's not bad but then here is 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.610
 low-end but frankly it's a 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.739
 good are still and the quality of the 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.780
 microphone as you can see in 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.620
 first video is pretty pretty not bad 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.030
 for 70 euros 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.239
 so here I advise you to stop 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.420
 and then to film my sheet music 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.880
 xbox i'm using the hd capture guen which 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.320
 is really not bad because he has the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.630
 particularity of filming on 1 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.220
 how to say a hard drive I you 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.420
 explains in fact there is no need 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.430
 pc just plug a disk 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.950
 hard or turn it on you have a 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.830
 remote control and you press wii 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.800
 strings and here is the video on cergy on 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.740
 the audio disc so that was it 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.640
 the materials after you speak fast 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.790
 I'm going to show you so 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.880
 here is my pc so in fact it's a pc 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.360
 I mounted that I paid 300 euros 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:50.320
 and ivo ci would already be riding it was worth 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.320
 405 450 euros I think so it's with 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.660
 I think senna is noon and with a 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.030
 good khadiga drama processor because to de 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.259
 famous disassembly and that against 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.710
 for games everything that is 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.500
 battlefield will not stop but nice is 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.929
 not bad for the money you spend 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.759
 now to ball software and that's it 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.530
 we find ourselves for software 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:17.269
 so it's going to be very simple for 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.100
 capture my computer or my office and 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.620
 the game of knock hits what is a very 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.730
 good software but takes up space 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.519
 level 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.400
 video or so captures asia yes strings that 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:31.340
 takes less space but who have a little 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.840
 weird enough to handle vitro but 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.840
 so here you have often hit 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.890
 then for my montages I use so 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.269
 either after effect or sony vegas pro i 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.560
 say a lot signed vegas pro because 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.290
 I find fire after effect is more 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.090
 for montages with DVDs to 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.180
 special effects that for now I 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.090
 do not need then for all that 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.670
 is different for the photos that I'm saying 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.870
 photoshop cs5 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.060
 I also have 2.6 and to do some 3D rendering 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.519
 I have cinema 4d like everyone I 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.519
 think that now send his debut 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:10.190
 pretty basic sky who who are very 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:14.109
 practices and so I'm so all 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.400
 the days to make you happy 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:19.310
