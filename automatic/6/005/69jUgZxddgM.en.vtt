00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.290

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.950
 three objects that is a keychain a mini 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.580
 puzzle and this that is like a 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:21.400
 applauded I think I do not know what it's called 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.780
 here you must not even the name not I thought that 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.030
 I was going to leave one of the figures that 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.659
 it came in the box then we see what 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.560
 well there are already six minimums are six 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.049
 is how it would be complete we have left 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.680
 the two very funny minutes well in the 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.770
 first name 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:46.140
 it's not just that minions and the brand 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.790
 well this league came inside the package 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.890
 no truth struck me already 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.010
 I was going to throw and then I realized that it was 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.510
 part d 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.510
 the collectible that came in 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.030
 does not work very well if what you intend 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.400
 is to make noise I think it is not successful and 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.360
 this is the first collectible that comes out 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:14.690
 let's see the second huevito of whom 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.010
 of surprise go luck apparently me 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.000
 he touched the same 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:27.050
 in a pack of two both the same 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.710
 prize go luck 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:34.190
 then we will remain with the doubt of 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.590
 how many make up the collection you have to 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.450
 look cleger says goodbye a little 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.300
 disappointed goodbye 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.129
 and that they are sick I could not stay 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.800
 with the doubt and I wanted to get rid of the thorn 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:53.019
 I went to buy another one and finally it came out 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:56.010
 a figure of children no longer as it is 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:01.110
 strange applause what 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.560
 it does not make noise but good see 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:09.500
 and this one has like 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:11.920
 effect just touches and changes the grimace of 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.920
 face 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.000
 and here we can define how many are 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.730
 which here comes out as the instructive 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.610
 how the truth arises to arm them is 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.590
 quite pretty simple and let's see are 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.700
 all these 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.700
 They are 8 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.180
 Y 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.180
 3 extra 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.410
 what would be the key ring the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:47.110
 puzzle and the clapper very much 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.050
 better the figures I hope you 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.110
 have luck and without battling it out 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.510
 the 8 figures of flown the truth that 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.120
 They are super recommended because they are 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.310
 well detailed, well detailed 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.909
 Textured 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:07.909
 here the simple one already says goodbye 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.909
