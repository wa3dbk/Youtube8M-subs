00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.529
 healthy 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:32.690

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:35.360
 take a review should be okay here it is ours 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.650
 gel with the first thing you want to say he 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.450
 terribly heavy 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.210
 I specially made scales now we 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.210
 weigh let's see how much weight difference 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:01:00.370
 adapter 165 grams owner there are 100 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:05.030
 at night very hard and very hard 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.610
 nasty heavy thing why are you iron 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.090
 but really not too hard on it 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:15.800
 term harder 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.470
 small heavy iron house with your own 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.690
 I realized that it was now become from 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.400
 Last review, my camera has grown and 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:28.160
 now it's 450 to 500 d yes he is so soon 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.330
 up to 3 stamp you will get the difference from you 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.330
 small unsuccessfully 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.380
 this one will please you with some 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.380
 but video 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.290
 will be friend 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.290
 after all 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.650
 the next thing I want to note is focusing 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.459
 ring in the first spinning very very 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:37.959
 tight whining creature 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.190
 in the second course of the ring somewhere 270 degrees 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.110
 to the minimum distance 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:48.730
 focusing focus on 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:49.780
 infinity need yes take the diaphragm 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.390
 there are two rings 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.959
 and the first is written the value of the diaphragm 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.900
 the second ring is simple and and it closes it 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.910
 should work like that first ring you 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.600
 set the value you need 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.790
 aperture 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.890
 authors you can vary from 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.920
 fully open until installed 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.530
 the values on my copy are nichrome 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.390
 does not work therefore at any value i 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.459
 can i just open close 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.400
 it's pretty convenient because 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.030
 ring it rotates on clicks and you 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:26.049
 can right in real time 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:29.049
 aperture he said in real time in 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.570
 real hello but it seems to me 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.810
 applicable more for video king photo 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.040
 this lens has a whole bunch 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.220
 modifications starting from the very first 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:46.109
 versions Helios 44 and ending there 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:47.380
 versions 44 n44 644 did not please 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:51.130
 44's 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.200
 I have version 44 2 already understood those for me 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.060
 so they are really nothing of each other 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.359
 all fifty eight are different 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.630
 millimeters all aperture 2 like this is not 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.069
 different about enlightenment techno drocher 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.980

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.460
 blue enlightenment which 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:13.100
 used on newer versions 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:16.800
 it seems all but complete garbage but because 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:20.070
 enlightenment oh yeah almost forgot worth 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.970

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.130

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.970
