apparently<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.179> just<00:02:09.390> saying<00:02:09.629> no<00:02:09.869> no<00:02:10.110> no<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:11.009> a

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
apparently is just saying no no no to a

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.530 
apparently is just saying no no no to a
fifth<00:02:11.370> fight<00:02:11.610> with<00:02:11.760> Pacquiao<00:02:12.180> he's<00:02:12.420> not

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
fifth fight with Pacquiao he's not

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.610 
fifth fight with Pacquiao he's not
interested<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:13.140> that

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
interested in that

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.610 
interested in that
so<00:02:14.610> if<00:02:14.970> Marquez<00:02:15.840> don't<00:02:16.080> want<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.290> play<00:02:16.379> ball

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
so if Marquez don't want to play ball

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.110 
so if Marquez don't want to play ball
and<00:02:16.709> obviously<00:02:17.250> Marquez<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.970> obvious

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
and obviously Marquez is the obvious

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.210 
and obviously Marquez is the obvious
choice<00:02:18.299> for<00:02:18.540> Pacquiao's<00:02:19.140> next<00:02:19.409> opponent<00:02:19.860> that

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
choice for Pacquiao's next opponent that

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.820 
choice for Pacquiao's next opponent that
is<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.549> most<00:02:20.670> obvious<00:02:20.970> choice<00:02:21.480> because<00:02:21.830> he

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
is the most obvious choice because he

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.440 
is the most obvious choice because he
wants<00:02:23.129> to<00:02:23.159> avenge<00:02:23.519> that<00:02:23.610> loss<00:02:23.760> i<00:02:24.060> know<00:02:24.120> that

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
wants to avenge that loss i know that

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.470 
wants to avenge that loss i know that
knock<00:02:24.810> out<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.170> feet<00:02:25.379> is<00:02:25.650> always<00:02:26.549> gonna<00:02:27.090> sit

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
knock out the feet is always gonna sit

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.630 
knock out the feet is always gonna sit
uncomfortably<00:02:27.750> with<00:02:28.739> manny<00:02:28.950> pacquiao<00:02:29.400> he

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
uncomfortably with manny pacquiao he

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.300 
uncomfortably with manny pacquiao he
wants<00:02:29.879> to<00:02:29.970> avenge<00:02:30.299> it<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.629> put<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:30.810> right<00:02:31.310> but

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
wants to avenge it and put it right but

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.039 
wants to avenge it and put it right but
mark<00:02:32.849> is<00:02:33.030> not<00:02:33.299> willing<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.599> give<00:02:33.810> him<00:02:33.959> a

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
mark is not willing to give him a

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.770 
mark is not willing to give him a
rematch<00:02:34.409> some<00:02:35.370> people<00:02:35.790> are<00:02:35.909> saying<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.360> that

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
rematch some people are saying that that

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.119 
rematch some people are saying that that
is<00:02:36.930> really<00:02:37.549> bad<00:02:39.019> bad<00:02:40.019> taste<00:02:40.379> by<00:02:40.620> Marquez

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
is really bad bad taste by Marquez

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.690 
is really bad bad taste by Marquez
because<00:02:42.290> yes<00:02:43.290> Pacquiao<00:02:43.799> did<00:02:44.129> school<00:02:44.489> some

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
because yes Pacquiao did school some

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.640 
because yes Pacquiao did school some
highly<00:02:45.000> controversial<00:02:45.510> wins<00:02:45.870> over<00:02:46.170> markets

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
highly controversial wins over markets

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.470 
highly controversial wins over markets
but<00:02:46.829> he<00:02:46.920> was<00:02:47.069> willing<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.370> rematch<00:02:47.940> mark<00:02:48.239> as

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
but he was willing to rematch mark as

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.110 
but he was willing to rematch mark as
each<00:02:48.629> and<00:02:48.900> every<00:02:49.109> time<00:02:49.290> out<00:02:49.530> by<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.519> one<00:02:50.790> time

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
each and every time out by the one time

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.990 
each and every time out by the one time
that<00:02:51.150> Marquez<00:02:52.019> schools<00:02:52.349> a<00:02:52.470> win<00:02:52.650> now<00:02:53.489> he<00:02:53.549> don't

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
that Marquez schools a win now he don't

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000 
that Marquez schools a win now he don't
want<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.299> rematch<00:02:54.690> pakiya<00:02:55.290> but<00:02:55.620> at<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.799> same

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
want a rematch pakiya but at the same

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.410 
want a rematch pakiya but at the same
time<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.489> can<00:02:56.640> see<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:56.910> for<00:02:57.060> Marquez

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
time I can see it for Marquez

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.869 
time I can see it for Marquez
perspective<00:02:58.140> because<00:02:58.890> he<00:02:59.250> feels<00:02:59.459> like<00:02:59.609> he

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
perspective because he feels like he

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.349 
perspective because he feels like he
beat<00:03:00.120> Pacquiao<00:03:00.599> at<00:03:00.840> least<00:03:01.049> twice<00:03:01.440> before<00:03:02.359> that

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
beat Pacquiao at least twice before that

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.899 
beat Pacquiao at least twice before that
full<00:03:03.659> fight<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.260> he<00:03:05.220> wasn't<00:03:05.430> given<00:03:05.819> the

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
full fight and he wasn't given the

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.210 
full fight and he wasn't given the
decision<00:03:06.329> on<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.540> scorecards<00:03:07.170> it's<00:03:07.769> only<00:03:08.010> in

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
decision on the scorecards it's only in

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.490 
decision on the scorecards it's only in
the<00:03:08.250> in<00:03:08.879> the<00:03:08.909> full<00:03:09.450> fight<00:03:09.750> where<00:03:10.140> he<00:03:10.170> knocked

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
the in the full fight where he knocked

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.470 
the in the full fight where he knocked
pacquiao<00:03:10.739> out<00:03:11.220> that<00:03:11.700> he<00:03:11.790> was<00:03:11.940> actually<00:03:11.970> able

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
pacquiao out that he was actually able

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.670 
pacquiao out that he was actually able
to<00:03:12.870> score<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.470> an<00:03:13.739> official<00:03:14.609> win<00:03:14.819> over<00:03:15.180> Pacquiao

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
to score a an official win over Pacquiao

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.809 
to score a an official win over Pacquiao
so<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:16.769> Marquez<00:03:17.129> his<00:03:17.280> mind<00:03:17.489> he's<00:03:17.609> probably

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
so in Marquez his mind he's probably

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.640 
so in Marquez his mind he's probably
thinking<00:03:17.940> you<00:03:18.299> know<00:03:18.419> what<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:18.810> don't<00:03:19.500> need<00:03:19.590> to

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
thinking you know what I don't need to

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.409 
thinking you know what I don't need to
get<00:03:19.829> rubbed<00:03:20.040> on<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.220> scorecards<00:03:20.760> again<00:03:21.000> to

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
get rubbed on the scorecards again to

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.030 
get rubbed on the scorecards again to
hell<00:03:21.569> with<00:03:21.720> Pacquiao<00:03:22.109> I've<00:03:22.290> got<00:03:22.470> my<00:03:22.590> victory<00:03:23.010> I

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
hell with Pacquiao I've got my victory I

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.309 
hell with Pacquiao I've got my victory I
got<00:03:23.280> what<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:23.489> wanted<00:03:23.790> I'm<00:03:24.000> done<00:03:24.750> with<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:25.079> guy

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
got what I wanted I'm done with that guy

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.839 
got what I wanted I'm done with that guy
you<00:03:25.919> know<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.220> could<00:03:26.400> see<00:03:26.579> where<00:03:26.760> he's

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
you know and I could see where he's

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.580 
you know and I could see where he's
coming<00:03:26.880> from<00:03:27.180> in<00:03:27.569> that<00:03:28.019> sense<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.440> can

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
coming from in that sense I can

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.159 
coming from in that sense I can
definitely<00:03:28.709> see<00:03:29.069> where<00:03:29.190> he's<00:03:29.310> coming<00:03:29.370> from

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:30.169 
definitely see where he's coming from

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.460 
definitely see where he's coming from
but<00:03:31.169> as<00:03:31.349> I<00:03:31.889> say<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.549> marquez<00:03:32.940> thing<00:03:33.840> is<00:03:34.019> not<00:03:34.379> on

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
but as I say the marquez thing is not on

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.839 
but as I say the marquez thing is not on
the<00:03:34.560> table<00:03:34.739> Marquez<00:03:35.310> ain't<00:03:35.459> gonna<00:03:35.639> fight

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
the table Marquez ain't gonna fight

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.569 
the table Marquez ain't gonna fight
pacquiao<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:36.540> it's<00:03:37.079> Eva<00:03:37.410> provodnikov<00:03:38.010> Bradley

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
pacquiao so it's Eva provodnikov Bradley

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.569 
pacquiao so it's Eva provodnikov Bradley
and<00:03:39.319> obviously<00:03:40.319> he<00:03:41.010> would<00:03:41.160> still<00:03:41.370> like<00:03:41.549> a

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
and obviously he would still like a

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.939 
and obviously he would still like a
fight<00:03:41.819> with<00:03:41.970> Floyd<00:03:42.209> Mayweather<00:03:42.269> I<00:03:42.870> can't<00:03:43.769> see

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
fight with Floyd Mayweather I can't see

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
do believe that after the third marquez

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.460 
do believe that after the third marquez
fight<00:04:11.489> Floyd<00:04:12.060> was<00:04:12.359> very<00:04:12.810> serious<00:04:13.319> about

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
fight Floyd was very serious about

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.589

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
fighting Manny Pacquiao and he did call

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.930 
fighting Manny Pacquiao and he did call
him<00:04:15.720> out<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.079> at<00:04:16.199> the<00:04:16.289> time<00:04:16.579> bob<00:04:17.579> arum<00:04:17.789> said

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
him out and at the time bob arum said

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.439 
him out and at the time bob arum said

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
all we can't get McConkey and not a big

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.930 
all we can't get McConkey and not a big
enough<00:04:21.539> venue<00:04:22.440> together<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.159> disdain<00:04:23.520> or<00:04:23.550> I

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
enough venue together and disdain or I

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.640 
enough venue together and disdain or I
think<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.300> was<00:04:24.419> just<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.719> case<00:04:24.870> of<00:04:24.930> Pacquiao<00:04:25.469> at

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
think it was just a case of Pacquiao at

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.540 
think it was just a case of Pacquiao at
the<00:04:25.710> time<00:04:25.950> being<00:04:26.849> low<00:04:27.090> on

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
the time being low on

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.339 
the time being low on
pacquiao<00:04:28.210> and<00:04:28.270> arrow<00:04:28.539> be<00:04:28.750> low<00:04:28.990> on<00:04:29.020> confidence

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
pacquiao and arrow be low on confidence

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.920 
pacquiao and arrow be low on confidence
after<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:30.159> third<00:04:30.479> marquez<00:04:31.479> fight<00:04:31.509> with

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
after the third marquez fight with

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.589 
after the third marquez fight with
pacquiao<00:04:32.289> looked<00:04:32.560> bad<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:33.180> they<00:04:34.180> just<00:04:34.210> didn't

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
pacquiao looked bad and they just didn't

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.149 
pacquiao looked bad and they just didn't
fancy<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:34.960> fight<00:04:35.229> at<00:04:35.379> that<00:04:35.500> particular<00:04:35.650> time

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159 
fancy the fight at that particular time

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:40.170 
fancy the fight at that particular time
that's<00:04:36.879> why<00:04:37.000> I<00:04:37.030> believe<00:04:38.639> but<00:04:39.639> right<00:04:39.970> now<00:04:40.150> I

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
that's why I believe but right now I

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.930 
that's why I believe but right now I
believe<00:04:40.449> that<00:04:40.780> it's<00:04:40.930> Floyd<00:04:41.259> who<00:04:41.560> is<00:04:41.940> blocking

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
believe that it's Floyd who is blocking

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.610 
believe that it's Floyd who is blocking
the<00:04:42.970> fact<00:04:43.270> from<00:04:43.389> taking<00:04:43.750> place<00:04:43.900> because<00:04:44.199> of

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
the fact from taking place because of

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.339 
the fact from taking place because of
ego<00:04:45.310> or<00:04:45.520> whatever<00:04:45.849> is<00:04:46.180> he's<00:04:46.840> just<00:04:47.020> not<00:04:47.199> willing

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
ego or whatever is he's just not willing

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:50.790 
ego or whatever is he's just not willing
to<00:04:47.560> work<00:04:47.680> with<00:04:47.740> Bob<00:04:48.099> Arum<00:04:48.400> right<00:04:48.580> now<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:50.440> yeah

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
looks like pack yells probably gonna

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.559

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
the only two options it seems at the

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.640 
the only two options it seems at the
moment<00:04:57.280> and<00:04:57.460> I<00:04:58.449> would<00:04:58.810> personally<00:04:59.020> rather<00:04:59.409> see

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
moment and I would personally rather see

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.110 
moment and I would personally rather see
the<00:04:59.770> Bradley<00:05:00.099> fight<00:05:00.310> not<00:05:00.580> because<00:05:00.849> I<00:05:00.940> feel

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
the Bradley fight not because I feel

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.459 
the Bradley fight not because I feel
like<00:05:01.150> Pacquiao's<00:05:01.690> got<00:05:01.870> anything<00:05:02.050> to<00:05:02.169> prove

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:02.469 
like Pacquiao's got anything to prove

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.680 
like Pacquiao's got anything to prove
but<00:05:02.830> simply<00:05:03.729> because<00:05:03.909> he's<00:05:04.300> already<00:05:04.509> he's

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
but simply because he's already he's

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.159 
but simply because he's already he's
been<00:05:04.900> there<00:05:05.050> done<00:05:05.259> that<00:05:05.289> and<00:05:06.659> if<00:05:07.659> he<00:05:07.930> don't

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
been there done that and if he don't

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.249 
been there done that and if he don't
fight<00:05:09.270> provodnikov<00:05:10.270> and<00:05:10.750> if<00:05:10.810> he<00:05:10.870> does<00:05:11.050> fight

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
fight provodnikov and if he does fight

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:12.689 
fight provodnikov and if he does fight
Bradley<00:05:11.650> that<00:05:11.800> means<00:05:11.979> providing<00:05:12.340> a<00:05:12.400> coffee<00:05:12.550> is

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
Bradley that means providing a coffee is

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.309 
Bradley that means providing a coffee is

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:14.319 
free to Phi Brenda reels and that's a

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:19.050 
free to Phi Brenda reels and that's a
fight<00:05:14.530> that<00:05:16.020> Barbara's<00:05:17.020> said<00:05:17.770> can<00:05:18.069> happen<00:05:18.490> so
