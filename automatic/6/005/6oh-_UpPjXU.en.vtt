00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.720
The Balkan girls, they like to party

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.800
Like nobody, like nobody

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.760
It's time for me to unwind

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.520
I'm gonna start my weekend
with gin tonic and lime

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.160
My girls take me for a ride

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.000
Ready to party and looking so fine

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.320
I wonder if beyond this

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.600
There could be something better

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.360
'Cause I feel so good tonight

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.960
Don't wanna end this night

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.280
The balkan girls, they like to party

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.360
Like nobody, like nobody

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.640
The groovy light, will shine all night

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.640
The balkan girls, they like to party

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.760
Like nobody, like nobody

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.200
The groovy light, will shine all night

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.080
My hips are ready to glow

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.400
This record is so hot
and I have so much to show

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.320
I'll find a boy for a kiss

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.160
Who knows, maybe,
he'll be my prince...

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.560
I wonder if beyond this

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.240
There could be something better

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.560
'Cause I feel so good tonight

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.200
Don't wanna end this night

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.400
The balkan girls, they like to party

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.520
Like nobody, like nobody

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.680
The groovy light, will shine all night

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.760
The balkan girls, they like to party

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.880
Like nobody, like nobody

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.240
The groovy light, will shine all night

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.280
If you little find out

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.040
What love is about

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.800
And if you're a lonely baby

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.840
Just open your mind,
you're one of a kind

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.520
You've got to live your life...
