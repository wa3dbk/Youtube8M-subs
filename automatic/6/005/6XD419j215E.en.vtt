tutorial it's just going to be very

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460 
tutorial it's just going to be very
simple<00:01:21.060> very<00:01:21.210> basic<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.049> get<00:01:22.170> back<00:01:22.290> into

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
simple very basic just to get back into

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.690 
simple very basic just to get back into
the<00:01:22.619> swing<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.890> things<00:01:23.509> one<00:01:24.509> user<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.140> past

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
the swing of things one user in the past

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.130 
the swing of things one user in the past
suggested<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.759> better<00:01:26.970> way<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.210> doing<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
suggested a better way of doing the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.950 
suggested a better way of doing the
actual<00:01:28.380> pause<00:01:28.710> menu<00:01:28.979> itself<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.750> just

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
actual pause menu itself and it just

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.340 
actual pause menu itself and it just
saves<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:32.549> little<00:01:33.119> bit<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.360> code<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.930> it's<00:01:34.259> a

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
saves on a little bit of code and it's a

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.560 
saves on a little bit of code and it's a
little<00:01:34.590> better<00:01:34.740> organized<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:36.240> I'm<00:01:36.420> just

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
little better organized so I'm just

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.120 
little better organized so I'm just
gonna<00:01:36.659> go<00:01:36.960> over<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.170> sorry<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.860> don't

while<00:01:47.369> back<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:48.119> believe<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:50.329> it<00:01:51.329> was<00:01:51.479> kind<00:01:51.689> of

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
while back I believe and it was kind of

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.840 
while back I believe and it was kind of
messy<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:52.170> had<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> lot<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.729> different<00:01:53.729> if

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
messy we had a lot of different if

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.450 
messy we had a lot of different if
statements<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.420> stuff<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.920> better<00:01:56.189> to

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
statements and stuff and it is better to

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.639 
statements and stuff and it is better to
use<00:01:56.490> actual<00:01:57.299> switch<00:01:57.630> statements<00:01:58.140> which<00:01:58.320> I

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
use actual switch statements which I

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.260 
use actual switch statements which I
didn't<00:01:59.040> really<00:01:59.219> think<00:01:59.340> about<00:01:59.460> using<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.090> in

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
didn't really think about using this in

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.929 
didn't really think about using this in
the<00:02:00.360> past<00:02:00.570> for<00:02:01.049> an<00:02:01.290> actual<00:02:01.469> GUI<00:02:01.890> I've<00:02:02.579> always

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
the past for an actual GUI I've always

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.730 
the past for an actual GUI I've always
used<00:02:03.479> switch<00:02:03.810> statements<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.469> different

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
used switch statements and different

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.560 
used switch statements and different
functions<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.430> different<00:02:05.549> areas<00:02:06.090> like<00:02:06.329> that

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
functions and different areas like that

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.740 
functions and different areas like that
for<00:02:06.930> calling<00:02:07.290> things<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.819> guess<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.569> a

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
for calling things so I guess this is a

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.680 
for calling things so I guess this is a
lot<00:02:10.500> better<00:02:10.679> way<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.890> set<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.370> up<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.450> pretty

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
lot better way to set this up so pretty

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.790 
lot better way to set this up so pretty
much<00:02:12.870> what<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.170> want<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.410> do

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
much what you want to do

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.940 
much what you want to do
just<00:02:14.400> replace<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.480> other<00:02:15.690> index<00:02:16.200> variable

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
just replace that other index variable

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.910 
just replace that other index variable
with<00:02:17.100> just<00:02:17.280> an<00:02:17.430> int<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.940> pretty<00:02:18.870> much<00:02:19.020> this

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
with just an int and pretty much this

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.370 
with just an int and pretty much this
menu<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.490> going<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.210> be<00:02:21.300> keeping<00:02:21.570> track<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:21.930> you

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
menu is going to be keeping track of you

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.050 
menu is going to be keeping track of you
know<00:02:22.410> which<00:02:22.710> menu<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.190> open<00:02:23.550> at<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.760> current

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
know which menu is open at the current

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.270 
know which menu is open at the current
time

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
time

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.850 
time
so<00:02:26.280> each<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:27.270> each<00:02:27.420> number<00:02:27.750> will<00:02:27.960> represent<00:02:28.500> a

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
so each so each number will represent a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.050 
so each so each number will represent a
different<00:02:29.580> menu<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:30.150> will<00:02:30.300> be<00:02:30.450> open<00:02:30.750> and

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
different menu that will be open and

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.390 
different menu that will be open and
these<00:02:33.060> are<00:02:33.240> just<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.720> GUI<00:02:34.230> buttons<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:35.280> when

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
these are just the GUI buttons so when

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.150 
these are just the GUI buttons so when
you<00:02:35.490> press<00:02:35.640> them<00:02:35.850> now<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.420> assigns<00:02:36.950> menu<00:02:37.950> a

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
you press them now it assigns menu a

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.000 
you press them now it assigns menu a
number<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.450> one<00:02:39.960> is<00:02:40.110> going<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.410> be<00:02:40.530> equal<00:02:40.980> to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
number so one is going to be equal to

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.940 
number so one is going to be equal to
index<00:02:41.940> two<00:02:42.870> creatures<00:02:43.640> three<00:02:45.440> backbag<00:02:46.470> are

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
index two creatures three backbag are

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.780 
index two creatures three backbag are
just<00:02:47.550> bag<00:02:47.760> whatever<00:02:48.120> backpack<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.400> on<00:02:50.580> and

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
just bag whatever backpack and so on and

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.880 
just bag whatever backpack and so on and
so<00:02:50.970> forth<00:02:51.270> so<00:02:51.540> if<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.170> just<00:02:52.320> go<00:02:52.440> down<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.740> list

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
so forth so if you just go down the list

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.590 
so forth so if you just go down the list
each<00:02:53.280> one<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.730> we<00:02:53.820> click<00:02:54.000> on<00:02:54.210> will<00:02:54.390> change

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
each one that we click on will change

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.330 
each one that we click on will change
that<00:02:54.750> number<00:02:54.960> and<00:02:55.320> it'll<00:02:55.590> display<00:02:55.890> a

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
that number and it'll display a

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.820 
that number and it'll display a
different<00:02:57.920> part<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.040> inventory<00:03:00.380> now<00:03:01.380> you

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
different part of the inventory now you

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.500 
different part of the inventory now you
can<00:03:01.980> also<00:03:02.130> use<00:03:02.460> this<00:03:02.760> other<00:03:02.970> cool<00:03:03.240> statement

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
can also use this other cool statement

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.790 
can also use this other cool statement
for<00:03:03.840> actually<00:03:04.140> quitting<00:03:04.500> out<00:03:04.620> of<00:03:04.740> the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
for actually quitting out of the

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.700 
for actually quitting out of the
application<00:03:04.950> itself<00:03:05.690> for<00:03:06.690> actually<00:03:07.200> exiting

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
application itself for actually exiting

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.130 
application itself for actually exiting
the<00:03:07.860> game<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.370> this<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.360> built<00:03:09.630> in<00:03:09.780> unity

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
the game and this is a built in unity

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.320 
the game and this is a built in unity
function<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:11.310> pretty<00:03:11.550> much<00:03:11.610> as<00:03:11.910> exits

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
function and it pretty much as exits

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.080 
function and it pretty much as exits
exits<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:13.260> window<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:14.370> could<00:03:14.490> also<00:03:14.640> apply

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
exits the window you could also apply

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.880 
exits the window you could also apply
maybe<00:03:15.570> a<00:03:15.660> save<00:03:15.960> function<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.500> this<00:03:16.620> if<00:03:16.830> you

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
maybe a save function to this if you

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.580 
maybe a save function to this if you
want<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.160> be<00:03:17.250> safe<00:03:17.520> but<00:03:18.510> we<00:03:19.170> already<00:03:19.380> have<00:03:19.560> our

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
want to be safe but we already have our

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.170 
want to be safe but we already have our
save<00:03:19.890> option<00:03:20.310> here<00:03:20.550> so<00:03:20.580> if<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.000> player

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
save option here so if the player

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.970 
save option here so if the player
doesn't<00:03:21.390> want<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.660> say<00:03:21.810> then<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:22.410> know<00:03:22.739> they

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
doesn't want to say then you know they

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.380 
doesn't want to say then you know they
don't<00:03:23.130> have<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:23.700> they're<00:03:23.820> not<00:03:23.850> forced<00:03:24.300> to

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
don't have to and they're not forced to

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.270 
don't have to and they're not forced to
but<00:03:25.140> I<00:03:25.200> think<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:25.680> would<00:03:25.800> be<00:03:25.920> nice<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.190> have

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
but I think it would be nice to have

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.100 
but I think it would be nice to have
some<00:03:26.489> kind<00:03:26.670> of<00:03:26.730> pop<00:03:26.940> up<00:03:27.150> asking<00:03:27.360> if<00:03:27.810> they<00:03:27.930> want

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
some kind of pop up asking if they want

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.570 
some kind of pop up asking if they want
to<00:03:28.200> save<00:03:28.410> when<00:03:28.709> they<00:03:28.830> go<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.010> exit<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.430> game

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
to save when they go to exit the game

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.090 
to save when they go to exit the game
and<00:03:30.270> you<00:03:30.840> don't<00:03:30.989> have<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.290> just<00:03:31.500> make<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.770> exit

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
and you don't have to just make it exit

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.740 
and you don't have to just make it exit
the<00:03:32.220> application<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.850> could<00:03:32.970> actually<00:03:33.120> exits

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
the application it could actually exits

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.650 
the application it could actually exits
the<00:03:34.020> main<00:03:34.530> menu<00:03:34.950> or<00:03:34.980> something<00:03:35.400> like<00:03:35.640> that<00:03:35.700> but

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
the main menu or something like that but

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.729 
the main menu or something like that but
I<00:03:36.690> guess<00:03:36.989> for<00:03:37.320> a<00:03:38.660> PC<00:03:39.660> title<00:03:40.080> or<00:03:40.320> something<00:03:40.650> like

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
I guess for a PC title or something like

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.380 
I guess for a PC title or something like
that<00:03:40.800> you<00:03:41.190> probably<00:03:41.370> want<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.790> just<00:03:41.850> exit<00:03:42.330> the

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
that you probably want to just exit the

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.100 
that you probably want to just exit the
game<00:03:42.660> in<00:03:42.989> some<00:03:43.350> way<00:03:43.500> with<00:03:43.739> a<00:03:43.770> button<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:45.110> now

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
game in some way with a button and now

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.720 
game in some way with a button and now
we'll<00:03:46.290> go<00:03:46.410> down<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.680> here<00:03:46.950> so<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.430> switch

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
we'll go down to here so a switch

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.280 
we'll go down to here so a switch
statement<00:03:47.970> which<00:03:48.540> we've<00:03:48.750> used<00:03:49.020> in<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.230> past

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
statement which we've used in the past

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.670 
statement which we've used in the past
it<00:03:50.040> pretty<00:03:50.640> much<00:03:50.850> whatever<00:03:51.330> this<00:03:51.989> variable<00:03:52.440> is

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
it pretty much whatever this variable is

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.940 
it pretty much whatever this variable is
so<00:03:53.430> menu<00:03:54.090> so<00:03:54.480> whatever<00:03:54.750> number<00:03:54.840> that<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.650> it's

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
so menu so whatever number that is it's

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.220 
so menu so whatever number that is it's
going<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.250> you<00:03:56.970> know<00:03:57.090> call<00:03:57.540> what's<00:03:57.810> ever<00:03:57.959> in

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
going to you know call what's ever in

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.460 
going to you know call what's ever in
there<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.680> then<00:03:59.340> break<00:03:59.820> off<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.390> not<00:04:01.260> call

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
there and then break off and not call

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.620 
there and then break off and not call
the<00:04:01.590> rest<00:04:01.770> of<00:04:01.890> this<00:04:01.980> code<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:02.940> unlike<00:04:03.360> an<00:04:03.480> if

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
the rest of this code so unlike an if

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.620 
the rest of this code so unlike an if
statement<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:04.770> pretty<00:04:05.040> much<00:04:05.190> just<00:04:05.250> calls<00:04:05.700> one

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
statement it pretty much just calls one

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.060 
statement it pretty much just calls one
of<00:04:06.780> these<00:04:06.930> things<00:04:07.230> or<00:04:07.650> if<00:04:08.459> you<00:04:08.580> have<00:04:08.820> I<00:04:09.120> guess

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
of these things or if you have I guess

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.680 
of these things or if you have I guess
multiple<00:04:11.070> statements<00:04:11.370> with<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.420> same

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
multiple statements with that same

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.030 
multiple statements with that same
number<00:04:12.900> so<00:04:13.500> if<00:04:15.500> actually<00:04:16.500> know<00:04:16.650> what<00:04:16.859> am<00:04:16.950> I

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
number so if actually know what am I

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.020 
number so if actually know what am I
saying

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
saying

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.070 
saying
for<00:04:18.480> the<00:04:18.570> case<00:04:18.810> one<00:04:19.530> that<00:04:20.430> in<00:04:20.700> s<00:04:20.940> equal<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.750> what

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
for the case one that in s equal to what

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.330 
for the case one that in s equal to what
that<00:04:22.200> int<00:04:22.500> is<00:04:23.060> so<00:04:24.060> if<00:04:24.390> our<00:04:24.930> menu<00:04:25.770> equals<00:04:26.100> one

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
that int is so if our menu equals one

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.370 
that int is so if our menu equals one
it's<00:04:26.700> going<00:04:27.030> to<00:04:27.120> call

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
it's going to call

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.080 
it's going to call
this<00:04:27.830> case<00:04:28.070> statement<00:04:28.490> because<00:04:28.670> it's<00:04:28.850> one

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
this case statement because it's one

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.340 
this case statement because it's one
there<00:04:29.990> if<00:04:30.500> it's<00:04:30.800> two<00:04:31.070> three<00:04:31.580> four<00:04:32.000> etc<00:04:32.350> and

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
there if it's two three four etc and

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.820 
there if it's two three four etc and
it'll<00:04:33.590> only<00:04:33.740> display<00:04:34.370> that<00:04:35.240> stuff<00:04:35.560> so<00:04:36.560> it's

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
it'll only display that stuff so it's

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.670 
it'll only display that stuff so it's
just<00:04:36.950> going<00:04:37.190> to<00:04:37.280> display<00:04:37.490> GUI<00:04:37.910> box<00:04:38.210> for<00:04:38.450> now<00:04:38.680> we

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
just going to display GUI box for now we

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.320 
just going to display GUI box for now we
can<00:04:39.830> add<00:04:39.950> other<00:04:40.130> stuff<00:04:40.310> to<00:04:40.820> this<00:04:41.000> in<00:04:41.240> the

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
can add other stuff to this in the

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.020 
can add other stuff to this in the
future<00:04:41.720> if<00:04:41.840> we<00:04:41.990> really<00:04:42.200> want<00:04:42.440> to<00:04:43.000> for<00:04:44.000> our

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
future if we really want to for our

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.450 
future if we really want to for our
actual<00:04:44.360> menu<00:04:44.660> itself<00:04:45.140> so<00:04:45.770> we<00:04:45.890> don't<00:04:46.070> just<00:04:46.280> have

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
actual menu itself so we don't just have

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.520 
actual menu itself so we don't just have
to<00:04:46.610> display<00:04:46.940> GUI<00:04:47.210> box<00:04:47.480> we<00:04:47.720> could<00:04:47.870> go<00:04:48.020> down<00:04:48.170> here

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
to display GUI box we could go down here

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.550 
to display GUI box we could go down here
at<00:04:48.740> another<00:04:49.310> line<00:04:49.640> add<00:04:50.030> maybe<00:04:50.540> more<00:04:51.290> GUI

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
at another line add maybe more GUI

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.560 
at another line add maybe more GUI
buttons<00:04:52.010> or<00:04:52.370> whatever<00:04:52.700> we<00:04:52.910> need<00:04:53.120> for<00:04:53.420> that

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
buttons or whatever we need for that

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.430 
buttons or whatever we need for that
menu<00:04:53.960> and<00:04:55.300> also<00:04:56.300> within<00:04:56.630> here<00:04:57.140> we<00:04:57.320> could

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
menu and also within here we could

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.560 
menu and also within here we could
probably<00:04:57.740> also<00:04:58.220> add<00:04:58.370> other<00:04:58.640> statements<00:04:59.450> and

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
probably also add other statements and

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.870 
probably also add other statements and
stuff<00:04:59.750> for<00:04:59.930> displaying<00:05:00.320> different<00:05:00.440> things

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
stuff for displaying different things

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.670 
stuff for displaying different things
but<00:05:01.880> that'll<00:05:02.240> be<00:05:02.360> in<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:02.570> future<00:05:02.960> for<00:05:03.320> adding

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
but that'll be in the future for adding

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.470 
but that'll be in the future for adding
different<00:05:04.070> stuff<00:05:04.340> and<00:05:04.960> if<00:05:05.960> you<00:05:07.090> yeah<00:05:08.090> and<00:05:08.300> then

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
different stuff and if you yeah and then

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.510 
different stuff and if you yeah and then
just<00:05:08.750> this<00:05:09.200> update<00:05:09.620> codes<00:05:09.860> just<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:10.280> same<00:05:10.490> for

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
just this update codes just the same for

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.660 
just this update codes just the same for
displaying<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.660> actual<00:05:12.200> GUI<00:05:12.440> itself<00:05:12.890> so

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
displaying the actual GUI itself so

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.630 
displaying the actual GUI itself so
pretty<00:05:13.940> much<00:05:14.120> nothing<00:05:14.420> has<00:05:14.900> really<00:05:14.930> changed

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
pretty much nothing has really changed

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.490 
pretty much nothing has really changed
since<00:05:16.640> last<00:05:16.730> time<00:05:17.150> it's<00:05:17.840> just<00:05:18.140> kind<00:05:18.320> of<00:05:18.380> an

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
since last time it's just kind of an

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.090 
since last time it's just kind of an
improvement<00:05:18.890> over<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.580> previous<00:05:19.910> one<00:05:21.010> so<00:05:22.010> if

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
improvement over the previous one so if

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.420 
improvement over the previous one so if
we<00:05:22.190> go<00:05:22.340> back<00:05:22.520> in<00:05:22.670> the<00:05:22.760> game<00:05:23.110> press<00:05:24.110> P

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
we go back in the game press P

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.010 
we go back in the game press P
everything<00:05:25.430> displays<00:05:25.820> the<00:05:26.030> same<00:05:26.270> you<00:05:26.840> might

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
everything displays the same you might

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.350 
everything displays the same you might
get<00:05:27.170> a<00:05:27.200> better<00:05:27.380> performance<00:05:28.190> out<00:05:28.550> of<00:05:28.640> using<00:05:29.240> it

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
get a better performance out of using it

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.220 
get a better performance out of using it
this<00:05:29.540> way<00:05:29.780> and<00:05:30.070> whatnot<00:05:31.510> and<00:05:32.510> yeah<00:05:32.990> that's

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
this way and whatnot and yeah that's

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.680 
this way and whatnot and yeah that's
pretty<00:05:33.380> much<00:05:33.500> it<00:05:33.860> for<00:05:33.950> this<00:05:34.340> tutorial<00:05:34.610> I<00:05:35.270> also

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
pretty much it for this tutorial I also

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:36.940 
pretty much it for this tutorial I also
want<00:05:35.930> to<00:05:35.990> talk<00:05:36.140> about<00:05:36.200> a<00:05:36.410> few<00:05:36.680> other<00:05:36.710> things

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
want to talk about a few other things

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.070 
want to talk about a few other things
I'm<00:05:37.520> still<00:05:37.790> working<00:05:38.090> on<00:05:38.240> how<00:05:38.840> to<00:05:38.900> actually

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
I'm still working on how to actually

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.080 
I'm still working on how to actually
improve<00:05:39.740> the<00:05:40.010> combat<00:05:40.610> system<00:05:40.790> itself<00:05:41.360> with

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
improve the combat system itself with

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.000 
improve the combat system itself with
using<00:05:44.090> attacks<00:05:44.390> for<00:05:44.570> each<00:05:44.690> monster<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.410> kind<00:05:45.950> of

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
using attacks for each monster I kind of

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.770 
using attacks for each monster I kind of
have<00:05:46.310> been<00:05:46.340> running<00:05:46.790> into<00:05:46.910> some<00:05:47.180> errors<00:05:47.540> with

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
have been running into some errors with

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.160 
have been running into some errors with
that<00:05:47.990> I<00:05:48.760> guess<00:05:49.760> I<00:05:49.940> have<00:05:50.630> to<00:05:50.660> code<00:05:50.930> it<00:05:51.080> a

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
that I guess I have to code it a

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.750 
that I guess I have to code it a
different<00:05:51.560> way<00:05:51.590> or<00:05:51.830> find<00:05:52.070> a<00:05:52.160> more<00:05:52.310> simple<00:05:52.670> way

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
different way or find a more simple way

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.540 
different way or find a more simple way
of<00:05:52.790> doing<00:05:53.060> that<00:05:53.390> because<00:05:54.350> it<00:05:54.890> gets<00:05:55.070> kind<00:05:55.400> of

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
of doing that because it gets kind of

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.190 
of doing that because it gets kind of
confusing<00:05:55.700> when<00:05:56.240> you're<00:05:56.390> working<00:05:56.720> with<00:05:56.750> you

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
confusing when you're working with you

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.440 
confusing when you're working with you
know<00:05:57.350> multiple<00:05:57.740> arrays<00:05:58.280> and<00:05:58.670> classes<00:05:59.210> and

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
know multiple arrays and classes and

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.550 
know multiple arrays and classes and
stuff<00:05:59.690> and<00:05:59.870> trying<00:06:00.080> to<00:06:00.140> mix<00:06:00.320> that<00:06:00.500> all

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
stuff and trying to mix that all

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.470 
stuff and trying to mix that all
together<00:06:00.800> you're<00:06:01.610> going<00:06:01.880> to<00:06:01.970> get<00:06:02.090> some<00:06:02.330> kind

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
together you're going to get some kind

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.660 
together you're going to get some kind
of<00:06:02.600> error<00:06:02.960> so<00:06:03.560> maybe<00:06:03.800> I'll<00:06:03.980> plan<00:06:04.190> out<00:06:04.340> a<00:06:04.370> better

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:04.670 
of error so maybe I'll plan out a better

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.090 
of error so maybe I'll plan out a better
way<00:06:04.850> of<00:06:04.880> doing<00:06:05.240> that<00:06:05.360> but<00:06:06.260> I<00:06:06.290> think<00:06:06.410> in<00:06:06.830> the

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
way of doing that but I think in the

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.280 
way of doing that but I think in the
future<00:06:07.280> I<00:06:07.790> do<00:06:07.850> want<00:06:08.210> to<00:06:08.240> focus<00:06:08.390> on<00:06:08.690> a<00:06:08.720> few<00:06:09.080> other

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
future I do want to focus on a few other

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.880 
future I do want to focus on a few other
things<00:06:09.380> before<00:06:10.130> I<00:06:10.160> get<00:06:10.400> back<00:06:10.580> into<00:06:10.910> the<00:06:11.000> combat

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890 
things before I get back into the combat

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.440 
things before I get back into the combat
definitely<00:06:12.890> an<00:06:12.980> inventory<00:06:13.280> system<00:06:13.790> where<00:06:14.330> we

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
definitely an inventory system where we

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.300 
definitely an inventory system where we
can<00:06:14.540> actually<00:06:14.900> store<00:06:15.170> items<00:06:15.590> and<00:06:15.890> we<00:06:15.980> can<00:06:16.130> go

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
can actually store items and we can go

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.060 
can actually store items and we can go
to<00:06:16.370> a<00:06:16.460> shop<00:06:16.760> and<00:06:17.030> each<00:06:17.990> shop<00:06:18.410> nBC<00:06:19.040> has

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
to a shop and each shop nBC has

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.240 
to a shop and each shop nBC has
different<00:06:19.970> items<00:06:20.270> that<00:06:20.420> you<00:06:20.510> can<00:06:20.660> buy<00:06:20.690> and

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
different items that you can buy and

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.560 
different items that you can buy and
I'll<00:06:22.250> probably<00:06:22.520> be<00:06:22.760> setting<00:06:23.060> that<00:06:23.180> up<00:06:23.240> in<00:06:23.450> the

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
I'll probably be setting that up in the

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.660 
I'll probably be setting that up in the
future<00:06:23.930> that's<00:06:24.170> something<00:06:24.560> I'm<00:06:24.890> more<00:06:25.340> looking

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:25.670 
future that's something I'm more looking

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.780 
future that's something I'm more looking
forward<00:06:26.060> to<00:06:26.300> also<00:06:27.110> maybe<00:06:27.380> a<00:06:27.770> mechanic<00:06:28.550> for<00:06:28.730> the

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:28.790 
forward to also maybe a mechanic for the

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.480 
forward to also maybe a mechanic for the
bicycle<00:06:29.510> so<00:06:29.960> you<00:06:30.170> can<00:06:30.410> write<00:06:30.950> around<00:06:31.160> a<00:06:31.340> lot

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
bicycle so you can write around a lot

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.910 
bicycle so you can write around a lot
faster<00:06:32.000> than<00:06:32.030> you<00:06:32.270> would<00:06:32.420> walking<00:06:32.870> and<00:06:33.080> stuff

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:33.920 
faster than you would walking and stuff

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.370 
faster than you would walking and stuff
like<00:06:34.160> that
