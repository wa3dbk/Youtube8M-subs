00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
can be sharpened but if it's this rail

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.080 
can be sharpened but if it's this rail
is<00:00:59.810> smooth<00:01:00.440> with<00:01:01.220> the<00:01:01.340> rest<00:01:01.580> of<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:01.850> blade

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
is smooth with the rest of the blade

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.140 
is smooth with the rest of the blade
here<00:01:02.540> and<00:01:02.690> back<00:01:03.189> then<00:01:04.189> no<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.670> blade<00:01:04.879> cannot

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
here and back then no the blade cannot

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.030 
here and back then no the blade cannot
be<00:01:05.330> sharpened<00:01:05.750> again<00:01:05.930> I<00:01:05.960> can<00:01:06.290> see<00:01:06.500> that<00:01:06.740> here

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
be sharpened again I can see that here

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.480 
be sharpened again I can see that here
with<00:01:07.670> this<00:01:07.850> blade<00:01:08.590> you<00:01:09.590> can<00:01:09.770> see<00:01:10.039> where<00:01:10.340> the

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
with this blade you can see where the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.149 
with this blade you can see where the
rail<00:01:11.179> is<00:01:11.479> basically<00:01:11.960> smooth<00:01:12.499> with<00:01:12.829> the<00:01:12.950> rest

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
rail is basically smooth with the rest

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.669 
rail is basically smooth with the rest
of<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.460> blade<00:01:13.700> over<00:01:13.999> here<00:01:14.899> it's<00:01:15.049> really<00:01:15.289> shiny

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
of the blade over here it's really shiny

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.700 
of the blade over here it's really shiny
it's<00:01:16.130> real<00:01:16.310> smooth<00:01:16.869> as<00:01:17.869> you<00:01:17.960> can<00:01:18.140> see<00:01:18.350> this<00:01:18.560> is

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
it's real smooth as you can see this is

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.139 
it's real smooth as you can see this is
the<00:01:18.829> parts<00:01:19.130> that<00:01:19.219> are<00:01:19.399> sharpened<00:01:19.850> is<00:01:19.969> this

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
the parts that are sharpened is this

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.649 
the parts that are sharpened is this
rail<00:01:20.420> here<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:20.990> this<00:01:21.109> front<00:01:21.380> rail<00:01:21.560> here<00:01:22.659> the

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
rail here and this front rail here the

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.319 
rail here and this front rail here the
only<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.990> other<00:01:24.429> way<00:01:25.429> a<00:01:25.460> blade<00:01:25.789> cannot<00:01:26.149> be

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
only the other way a blade cannot be

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.809 
only the other way a blade cannot be
sharpened<00:01:26.920> as<00:01:27.920> you<00:01:28.039> can<00:01:28.159> see<00:01:28.340> with<00:01:28.460> this<00:01:28.579> blade

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:28.819 
sharpened as you can see with this blade

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:32.919 
sharpened as you can see with this blade
here<00:01:29.299> it<00:01:29.539> has<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:30.079> rail<00:01:31.119> but<00:01:32.119> look<00:01:32.689> at<00:01:32.810> the

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
here it has the rail but look at the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:35.770 
here it has the rail but look at the
rust<00:01:33.170> pits<00:01:33.530> here<00:01:34.030> if<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:35.119> have<00:01:35.270> excessive

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
rust pits here if you have excessive

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.289 
rust pits here if you have excessive
rust<00:01:36.560> on<00:01:36.799> your<00:01:37.189> on<00:01:37.280> your<00:01:37.340> blade<00:01:37.700> where<00:01:38.119> you've

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
rust on your on your blade where you've

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.260 
rust on your on your blade where you've
left<00:01:38.479> it<00:01:38.659> outside<00:01:38.840> in<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.619> moisture<00:01:40.219> I<00:01:40.399> mean

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
left it outside in the moisture I mean

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.550 
left it outside in the moisture I mean
I'm<00:01:41.389> talking<00:01:41.539> about<00:01:41.689> where<00:01:41.929> it's<00:01:42.049> caked<00:01:42.350> on

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
I'm talking about where it's caked on

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.469 
I'm talking about where it's caked on
then<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.310> blade<00:01:43.490> should<00:01:43.700> not<00:01:43.880> be<00:01:44.030> sharpened

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
then the blade should not be sharpened

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.809 
then the blade should not be sharpened
again<00:01:44.659> because<00:01:45.079> you're<00:01:45.859> going<00:01:46.039> to<00:01:46.100> have<00:01:46.340> huge

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
again because you're going to have huge

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.929 
again because you're going to have huge
pits<00:01:47.240> in<00:01:47.869> your<00:01:48.200> blade<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.859> it's<00:01:49.729> going<00:01:49.880> to

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
pits in your blade and it's going to

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.699 
pits in your blade and it's going to
cause<00:01:50.119> streaking<00:01:50.719> in<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:50.869> hair<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:51.469> grabbing

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:51.709 
cause streaking in the hair and grabbing

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.289 
cause streaking in the hair and grabbing
of<00:01:52.039> the<00:01:52.130> hair<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:52.579> it<00:01:52.670> just<00:01:52.700> isn't<00:01:52.999> going<00:01:53.149> to

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
of the hair and it just isn't going to

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.149 
of the hair and it just isn't going to
cut<00:01:53.509> right<00:01:53.719> for<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:54.109> I'm<00:01:54.560> talking<00:01:54.799> about<00:01:54.889> if

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
cut right for you I'm talking about if

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.429 
cut right for you I'm talking about if
you<00:01:55.280> have<00:01:55.490> light<00:01:56.149> rust<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:56.869> know<00:01:56.990> that<00:01:57.170> can<00:01:57.319> be

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
you have light rust you know that can be

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.319 
you have light rust you know that can be
sharpened<00:01:57.829> out<00:01:58.039> but<00:01:58.909> if<00:01:58.999> you<00:01:59.030> have<00:01:59.299> a

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
sharpened out but if you have a

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.050
