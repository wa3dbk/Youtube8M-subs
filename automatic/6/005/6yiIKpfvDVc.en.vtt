00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.410
 as it's good finally I bought the 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.900
 famous green coffee that says he has 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.030
 so many slimming properties 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.420
 this is the grain 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:23.010
 as we put it so that they see the 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.010
 problem signing with the tablets 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.679
 they look like coffee beans but they have 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.679
 a color like soybeans 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.740
 up to the little bag 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.360
 almost about everything good and according to me 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:52.740
 informs the person I bought it in a 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.320
 dietary that this produces satiety 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.460
 he says that well there are some chewing gum 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.000
 that are sold that have to do with a 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.040
 remedy that was to lose weight and 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.110
 well those chewing gums are castroneves 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.660
 no but they are quite expensive we are going to 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.700
 try this or according to the guy from the 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.090
 dietetics do not buy a dietitian the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.620
 kilo was at 140 pesos 100 grams 14 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.660
 pesos 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.420
 and the design has a smell of coffee I do not know 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.550
 I find it honestly I 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.480
 I need it as a porotito 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.940
 as yours as something like that and now 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.930
 I'm going to prepare it as we prepare it 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.990
 says that 30 or so grains come together 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.920
 a little handful of those 30 of 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.000
 grains are placed in a liter of water and 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.100
 let it boil 15 minutes 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.080
 all that comes out after it boils 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.470
 then school can be saved in the 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.930
 refrigerator 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.970
 and says you have to take only two cups 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.700
 per day 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.530
 what I 'm going to do good in the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.360
 moment that I am hungrier so 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.970
 general is for being like this at night 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.590
 or the morning I can spend quietly without 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.860
 problems so I'm going to take a 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.020
 cup I calculate more or less after the 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.150
 lunch and I'm going to take one after 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.730
 I think the dinner parties are the most 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.680
 adequate to avoid good now the 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.000
 I'm going to prepare and I'm going to show you how 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.070
 I prepare it I think it does not have much 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.070
 science but good illusion little and the 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.230
 resign and we are already in the how section 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.060
 do you tube pin carmen are I already have 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.790
 back I realized it does not matter after 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.040
 for the next where the painted nails 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.560
 they have first place and we have to put 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.600
 a liter of water a liter of water but 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.510
 we have to use filtered water because 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:45.420
 because the filtered water is better 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.420
 prevent strong flavors 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.260
 if you put your filtered water in half 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.170
 liter 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.170
 then we put another half a liter 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:09.450
 we are putting water 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.569
 I think this television without 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.270
 assistant is complicated seen is 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.740
 nonexistent is complicated we put it in 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.370
 the car 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.370
 all right 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.230
 we take a handful 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:36.640
 a handful of kampala and a handful of 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.480
 hunters or I'm going to put this wrong all 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.950
 the ones in this case a little hand 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.580
 pretty good and now we're going to 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.580
 put on fire 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.300
 I asked him if it was all cold 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.430
 we have fire 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.400
 Y 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.400
 we put the cat 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.780
 when it starts to boil 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.780
 see you 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.870
 in 15 minutes 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.510
 and in the other the post 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.690
 let's stop the fire 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:45.089
 as the instructions say so 

00:04:42.489 --> 00:04:45.089
 to strain 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.740
 the color is greenish 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.030
 and we get that they give as well as 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:05.160
 I do not know as if the color is a weird case 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.670
 what will happen if we do the procedure 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.620
 of typical coffee but no more than a grain 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.479
 in 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.720
 if we do the coffee procedure 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:18.340
 typical how it will look good now I'm going to 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.260
 try it and tell them 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.720
 and they told me you can not sweeten it with 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.610
 morante so good now see you 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.710
 we serve ourselves, we use a little 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.530
 we tried and having face 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.260
 Here we are sitting with the cup with 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:35.919
 green tea and I'm going to put a 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.710
 little bit of sweetener because he said 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.290
 the boy of dietetics could tea 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.229
 green they say it's taken by all 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.540
 famous women of hollywood clear them 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.430
 even if it's ugly they have millions of 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.150
 dollars that justifies that sacrifice 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:55.800
 It's not my case so well I'm going to 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:06:00.449
 put a couple of sachets of sweeteners 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:02.460
 let's see what happens with two envelopes that 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:07.520
 what I usually use to take 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.520
 any lie 1 2 3 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:17.430
 in future to prove that man 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.200
 not all good 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:23.540
 but drop those extra pounds 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.540
 we have no longer the next era
