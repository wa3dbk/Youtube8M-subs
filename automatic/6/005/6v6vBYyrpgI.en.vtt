00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:05.659
 m 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.969
 Juliette her tables is not a place 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.460
 to play I have to give flame without 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.110
 drug is not his fault 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.970
 all other gambling places are 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.770
 already taken and she can not play on 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.770
 a chair they are also all 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.180
 taken from elsewhere there is no longer a single 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.019
 place that is not occupied by a 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.290
 animal is a month it becomes juliette 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:37.090
 I'll give you food is made 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.090
 be careful when opening the cupboard that 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:55.070
 fills without laughing and hi the girls 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.100
 henri would like to talk to you so much better he 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.539
 must we also speak to him at the same time 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.449
 know that you use a turtle like 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:06.860
 give lcl cgc henry before you 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.600
 say anything you have to 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.090
 know that the first aid station is full 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.979
 you have to enlarge it good what are you 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.940
 wanted to tell us that we need to enlarge the 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.289
 rescue station that is packed 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.759
 you worked so hard that it's 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.580
 you who will decide what you 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.020
 want to build 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.319
 See you tomorrow to discuss your 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.319
 ideas 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:30.689
 I think it's useless to tell you 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.520
 What's the problem 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.020
 animals get bored they need more 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.179
 equipment for exercising 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.829
 what we really need are 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.090
 equipment that will prepare them to be 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.009
 released in the jungle 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.229
 I think the biggest problem is 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.560
 lack of space especially so that 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.479
 birds build their salt nest the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.319
 son if we manage to heal 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.030
 some diseases 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.679
 many of these animals will no longer have 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.359
 need for treatment we need a 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.399
 largest research laboratory 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.500
 super it is missing that is dead for 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.069
 give us a fifth idea or is 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.179
 she besides 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:06.000
 I arrive and with no bones the animals do not 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:09.060
 are neither back looking legs 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.780
 before boredom no place goes before 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.610
 the research 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.680
 but if we focus on research 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.799
 we will not need more mates 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.510
 I'm going to start my sketch and me 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.519
 I will take notes this will be 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.079
 much clearer you will change everything 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.790
 of opinion when you have seen massu by 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.470
 ideas on paper the same for me 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.250
 we can all work on our 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.209
 ideas but we have to stay welded 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:36.269
 as a group 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:38.730
 okay we need two bigger ones 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.319
 birdhouses like this one a safe place 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.940
 where the birds will nest and 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.260
 will rest we must incite the 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.329
 animals to feed themselves as in the 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.799
 nature it will occupy them he prepares them to 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.599
 to be released in the jungle 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.849
 I know that an animal spa can 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.799
 look strange but play in the water 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.280
 do them good and it improves their 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.230
 hygiene 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.419
 if we want to avoid having too much 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.160
 work it is necessary to succeed in preventing 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:00.930
 cure diseases 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.669
 this playground will help animals to 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.669
 stay active and heal quickly 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:16.200
 excellent idea your shrine I'm going 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.879
 order the materials immediately and 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.260
 we can get to work for a 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.829
 I'm glad we did not 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.450
 agree 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:29.060
 yes we do not work together 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.060
 found to work together
