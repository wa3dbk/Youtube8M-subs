00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
going to mill flat spot on here down

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.529 
going to mill flat spot on here down
about<00:00:17.939> half<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.540> distance<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.290> that<00:00:20.300> of<00:00:21.300> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
about half the distance of that of the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.070 
about half the distance of that of the
web<00:00:21.720> between<00:00:22.289> on<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:22.980> sand<00:00:23.340> wire<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:25.050> that

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
web between on the sand wire so that

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.769 
web between on the sand wire so that
then<00:00:25.440> I<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.859> nice<00:00:26.130> flat<00:00:26.460> surface<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.210> weld

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
then I have a nice flat surface to weld

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.269 
then I have a nice flat surface to weld
on<00:00:28.020> to<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.730> piece<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.939> flat<00:00:30.150> bar<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:31.279> then

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
on to this piece of flat bar and then

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:41.390 
on to this piece of flat bar and then
that'll<00:00:32.610> be<00:00:32.730> my<00:00:32.910> new<00:00:36.290> D<00:00:37.290> block<00:00:39.620> all<00:00:40.620> goes<00:00:41.010> well

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
that'll be my new D block all goes well

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.020 
that'll be my new D block all goes well
I'll<00:00:42.080> be<00:00:43.080> able<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.409> find<00:00:43.799> 45<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.790> thing

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
I'll be able to find 45 on that thing

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.789 
I'll be able to find 45 on that thing
really<00:00:45.570> rapidly<00:00:47.330> so<00:00:48.330> here<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.659> go<00:00:48.839> I<00:00:49.140> haven't

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:49.799 
really rapidly so here we go I haven't

00:00:49.799 --> 00:01:58.039 
really rapidly so here we go I haven't
read<00:00:49.979> this<00:00:50.159> thing<00:00:50.400> in<00:00:50.519> a<00:00:50.580> while<00:00:50.760> so

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.960 

roughly<00:01:59.049> set<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.770> will<00:02:03.009> sit<00:02:03.310> on<00:02:03.340> there<00:02:03.729> like

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
roughly set that will sit on there like

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:39.530 
roughly set that will sit on there like
so

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:47.910 

all<00:02:40.540> right<00:02:41.099> we'll<00:02:42.099> check<00:02:42.129> around<00:02:42.519> out<00:02:46.920> one

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
all right we'll check around out one

00:02:47.920 --> 00:03:03.599 
all right we'll check around out one
down<00:02:48.159> 145<00:02:59.969> it's<00:03:00.969> on<00:03:01.120> 45<00:03:01.840> be<00:03:02.769> Noble

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
down 145 it's on 45 be Noble

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:20.879 
down 145 it's on 45 be Noble
push<00:03:04.599> it<00:03:04.870> back<00:03:05.549> that's<00:03:06.549> 45<00:03:17.189> piece<00:03:18.189> cake<00:03:18.549> right
