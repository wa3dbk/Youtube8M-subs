00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.130 
like an ocean beach type paint job
then<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:13.920> Mystery<00:02:14.250> Machine<00:02:14.629> it<00:02:15.629> is<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.989> new

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
then the Mystery Machine it is the new

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.199 
then the Mystery Machine it is the new
one<00:02:16.319> it's<00:02:16.859> this<00:02:17.099> year's<00:02:17.340> version<00:02:17.579> I<00:02:17.939> wasn't

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
one it's this year's version I wasn't

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.369 
one it's this year's version I wasn't
able<00:02:18.269> to<00:02:18.450> get<00:02:18.540> one<00:02:18.719> last<00:02:18.750> year<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.349> was

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
able to get one last year so I was

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.920 
able to get one last year so I was
pretty<00:02:19.560> excited<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:20.629> think<00:02:21.629> it<00:02:21.719> only<00:02:21.810> makes

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
pretty excited I think it only makes

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.979 
pretty excited I think it only makes
sense<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:23.000> those<00:02:24.000> two<00:02:24.239> should<00:02:24.299> race<00:02:24.659> it<00:02:24.870> out

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
sense that those two should race it out

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.929 
sense that those two should race it out
