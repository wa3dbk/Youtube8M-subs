00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello everyone we find ourselves this 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.759
 evening for a new video I put the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.250
 artificial light because it has to 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.200
 to be not far from midnight and I do not arrive 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.880
 not to sleep because of the heat then 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.549
 I thought why not turn them 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.520
 a video now so here I am 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.590
 had a great idea because actually it's 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.760
 the night that brings counsel and there it comes 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.340
 brought me advice 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.970
 and it just falls well though it is not 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.400
 come in the head for you to do it 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.520
 now since these gifts are in 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.649
 the times in fact so it came to me 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.559
 because I thought back when grandpa he 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.559
 had his boat there come keys and 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.719
 with a trick actually for if she ever 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.629
 falls in dawn to his fleet and me 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.399
 I had a helluva good idea it's from 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.110
 make that because right now everything 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.480
 the world goes to the beach at the pool or 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.460
 in the rivers and not to lose his 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.430
 Keys in the water I have a little 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.329
 trick for you one says to irin then 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.589
 to do this we will need one of a 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:09.060
 surprised kinder surprise of a small 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.159
 rope of a string of an attachment 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.460
 ribbon the stuff that I never know 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.920
 what is it called and a care of a 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.590
 hangs keychains or so either 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.640
 just a link a big links so 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.650
 you already have a keychain to your keys 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.430
 so to do that we will need so 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.520
 from our stuff to kinder surprise and we're going 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.799
 to be able to make a hole at the top at 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:41.600
 middle like that it's going to be super delicate 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.600
 great be careful not hurt 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:50.899
 so here I am putting this clip there 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.899
 and this is our or fr 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.290
 then we will go there 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.350
 cord 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:02.890
 so if you do not get it take to 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.659
 using a needle that's what I 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.119
 will do because there I do not believe that 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.140
 I will get there like this 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.000
 so here's once you have 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.130
 get your son back like these to 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.690
 using a needle you will do it 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:21.610
 a group I do and the others then 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.150
 here you can also cut off what 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.970
 exceeds 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.030
 and that gives you that for now so 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.760
 you will be able to cut length 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.420
 wanted precisely to perfect a too 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:40.209
 long keychains either that's like 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:42.400
 these and put there the eighth ribbon and 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.620
 so once it's done here you are 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.660
 will be able to put on the jersey or 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:52.209
 gist the crook to door keys and that's it 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.250
 so what it gives is so you 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.209
 can of course the decor and if you 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.850
 do not want to leave that there 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.670
 so if the keys will sink the plug 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.070
 it will float since it is filled 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.810
 of air so the keys will not be lost 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:09.850
 in the water in the fountains in the 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:12.579
 lakes in the east in the sea that's it and 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.260
 for the second use for the beach 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.950
 it's very useful 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.930
 because just to use it 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.040
 we can separate ourselves back 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.829
 serve it can be used 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.540
 it can also be used as a small 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.070
 wallet so if you're at the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.489
 beach you do not want to take too much 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.040
 money 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.940
 well, you just have to put it right 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.489
 two small pieces of two euros per 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.940
 example a euro and you have your 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.100
 little change on your key ring so 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.359
 this is like these up and you have 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.799
 your little wallet 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.230
 so I put some pieces of 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.900
 centimes that's all I have left 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:54.609
 a token to go shopping 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.920
 So here is my little keychain 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.409
 I hope this idea is this little 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.599
 tip will have made you happy for not 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.880
 lose your keys tell me what you 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.570
 have thought 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.640
 only comes back from my evening idea 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.890
 that's thanks 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.420
 thanks to my grandpa's keys on his boat 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.910
 so I do not know why I think about that 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.209
 and I said to myself we're going to be able to 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.760
 make one and we did it this is what 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.940
 keychain that has dual utility 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.850
 firstly do not run the keys and 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.970
 secondly fear also serve as small 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.490
 wallet on the beach why one 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.830
 is a lot of money we end up 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:40.200
 in my kitchen for the final crash test 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:42.030
 so a big vase the keys with the 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.950
 famous keychain we made for you 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.020
 to prove that precisely that can fall 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.650
 in everything possible 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.930
 it will not flow here so the keys do not 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.370
 will not cast all the water bottom 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.370
 since with its fleet 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:06.130
 so you see that the lightning does not 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:12.610
 do not touch the bottom here stop here 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:12.610
 here we are 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.099
 m 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.430
 and even with a little bit of money 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.870
 in it does not flow here I hope 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.460
 that it will have made you happy and we 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.880
 find again very quickly for other videos 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.880
 ciao
