really as brilliant I think all sheath
knives<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.090> design<00:00:51.449> should<00:00:51.690> come<00:00:52.050> with

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
knives in this design should come with

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.889 
knives in this design should come with
handles<00:00:52.590> Search's<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.789> although<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.539> know<00:00:54.690> it

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
handles Search's this although I know it

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.900 
handles Search's this although I know it
will<00:00:55.020> limit<00:00:55.170> variety<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.920> all<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:56.370> it's

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
will limit variety and all that but it's

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.389 
will limit variety and all that but it's
this<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.480> grip<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.079> good<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.590> good

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.840 
you could see it's there it's fairly
heavy<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.560> weighs<00:01:29.369> 13<00:01:29.820> ounces<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:31.020> about<00:01:31.850> 370

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
heavy it weighs 13 ounces so about 370

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.859 
heavy it weighs 13 ounces so about 370
grams<00:01:33.560> but<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.920> has<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> very<00:01:35.670> solid<00:01:36.150> feel<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.720> it

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
grams but it has a very solid feel to it

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.350 
grams but it has a very solid feel to it
it's<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.409> really<00:01:38.220> like<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.549> knife<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:38.939> it's
