00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 with situations not very comfortable but that 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.620
 ended and ended before football and 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.389
 ended before a person and a goal 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.889
 Well the most important thing for that reason 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.289
 good night thank you very much I think 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.600
 about the games we play first 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.020
 very well and the world the Romans very well 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.420
 out there we express the subtraction of them in 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.490
 the second time we had planned 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.820
 the week double line four if 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.289
 I win with three forwards I think 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.270
 we suffer a little in the balls 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.149
 arrested however in the end I very much think 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.559
 well deserved against a great rival the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.559
 best team in colombia in the last 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.390
 year and a half by points for achievements with 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.690
 a great participation liberators cup 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.300
 in court of them I think that very 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.829
 proud of the boys because 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.149
 they executed the plan very well that 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.289
 we had decided during the week of 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.090
 those of us who had the opportunity 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.329
 inside the stadium 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.070
 seeing the magnitude of what is the the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.290
 visual of the game and a very strategy 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.670
 clear of national national bet by 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.450
 have a national internal game today 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.640
 I try to have 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.039
 prominence inside that will provide 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.020
 the possibility of holding the ball 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:14.100
 administer it and arrive as it came was 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.289
 a very clear and very 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.539
 different from what was done in Medellin 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:21.240
 but consistent with the party that I 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.310
 I have visualized I am not correct what 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.759
 first we decided five days ago 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.009
 was that in the best of scenarios and 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.689
 let's start this game with the 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.390
 forward marc with the front with the 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.030
 fastest point of all to try to 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.610
 have more speed then that's why we 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.260
 we decided for jefferson the second what 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.330
 that you very well analyzer 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.090
 and we thought that initially 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.180
 they go home with 31 in the middle and they 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.130
 we level that same structure on 31st 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.720
 us alexander sherman to the 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.380
 left and right and manuel and in 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.660
 half point to try at least 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.790
 match them and try to take advantage of them 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.850
 in the cumulus internal game well the 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.260
 like it and then so have possibility 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.240
 also to have external play with 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.040
 they were because we think they 're going to 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.200
 reference very well because it was the play 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.200
 most influential in our area then 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.000
 I think the other hold the line of 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.370
 three because he knows Santa Fe very well 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.280
 the very good forwards jefferson 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.250
 wilder like the unchecks of breaking a 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.680
 great pitcher as well then we 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.780
 we protected in that way and the truth 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.570
 such as with the party with 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.330
 two games against tolima limit to these 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.760
 two forwards to two for two decks 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.860
 of rupture I think the team says a lot 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.530
 defensively I tested the healthy people of 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.540
 soccer the people who bring teaching the 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.430
 positive people the people that do she 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.340
 have to continue committed to 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.680
 this means I want to know that yes 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.569
 go carlos osorio as coach of 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.569
 athletic national good now 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.670
 we make a difficult decision 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.540
 after the game against tolima in the 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.700
 that we lost to 4 to 0 and going to the game 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.070
 against millionaires when we get to two 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.070
 very good offers but we take the 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.460
 decision to leave everything to succeed 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:21.030
 here and I think today more than justifiable 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.790
 that decision happy with that decision and 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.940
 now to try to bet on the cup 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.940
 South American 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.640
 weekend we plan to go to peru 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:37.170
 ayacucho inti gas and already prepares the egg 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.340
 against the end of the month and obviously 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.860
 try to take an active rest with 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.400
 the group and start the Colombian tournament 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.010
 Postobon league 2 starts or goes then 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.709
 it's already almost over time probe 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.540
 then rest then enjoy 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.069
 always keep in mind as I told you before that 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.930
 from where we are 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.550
 we support everything this circuit 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.519
 football of the future than it is 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.340
 athletic national thank you very much the 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:07.299
 true that we appreciate very much we value 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.640
 much the support they give us and successes for 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.470
 all that was Juan Carlos Osorio type 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.760
 of the soccer champion technician 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.790
 Colombian professional boys you 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.870
 the Danish has played is dancing 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.870
 only for change
