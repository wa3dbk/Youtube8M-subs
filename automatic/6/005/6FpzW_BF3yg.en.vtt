00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.140
 greetings draw the lessons like a 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.180
 box that we're going to remove that and nothing else and 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.899
 nothing less than a review of a monster 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.930
 that is fantastic and make the mold 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.759
 and it's the biggest mold more food very 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.520
 effective this more armor but good 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.680
 this this is very very great and take for 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.119
 why because it adds food that 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.970
 here we are going to take us out of what will be 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.860
 put mani temps and the food well let's go 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.259
 to teach them some functions of what 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.890
 be the way in silao food not 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.959
 because then he does not have more cases just 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.850
 you eat it and they revive you and well 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.830
 we are in the degree that it will be 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.470
 fantastic things that this mode brings us 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.060
 and then before all the things more more 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.040
 great thing that brings us this way is that 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.519
 because the masters and pizza cutter 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.500
 pizza you either give an idea of ​​how 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.420
 is this and then as you come to install that 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.980
 will be the pizza do not try to remove it 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.170
 with your hand again once you bet 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.060
 because it's going to be the blog launcher and 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.640
 So we have to go up is a little bit of volume 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.530
 here see very well and once doing 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.390
 this they only listen 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.160
 to Caesar it 's as if they were 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.350
 eating something but it is very very cool 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.270
 also what will be the knife the 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.010
 which kills two strokes in any way 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.630
 for example this a cow and we will go to 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.220
 kill her they will go because so far because 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.740
 we go the community because I did not want 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.989
 because I'm a wagon and that's why he loves 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.580
 the knife is very fast and so 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.860
 the best part is that it is not that 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.020
 it is spent and therefore it has craft eos without 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.060
 bad I do not understand and another thing also that 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.069
 whatever it is then thrown of wood at 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.650
 touch any block or any grilled 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.970
 and no no no more the wooden one when touching 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.130
 any block goes to what will be 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.200
 lettuce and salt, so let's go 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.090
 need to crafter some things for 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.880
 example the salt is for kraft and some 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.450
 type of oil when it will serve then 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:29.209
 pretty bad as you see is the oil of the 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.130
 mayonnaise which oil and well it is very very 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.569
 great sincerely, that is, any 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.190
 block with which you touch any block 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:38.810
 with what will be then with the hoe this 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.390
 it's not going to come out castrating it then go out and then 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.390
 lettuce and if it's very very great gentlemen 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.100
 and because nothing that's all it is there that 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.660
 for there not to be revealed as a 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.220
 eating them will say why not 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.040
 They have more self 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.350
 the food is only graphic because with 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.840
 bread and fish with pork chop 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.260
 pork with a chop of what would be 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.960
 of this thing that roast pork but 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.700
 of cow and cow backup so 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.650

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.360
