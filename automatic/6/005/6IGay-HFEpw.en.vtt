00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
they're finally growing good now this is

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.289

in<00:01:20.210> talking<00:01:21.050> that<00:01:21.259> to<00:01:21.470> me<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.890> these<00:01:24.890> are

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299

Tabasco<00:01:28.509> on<00:01:30.039> the<00:01:31.039> Marconi's<00:01:31.759> I've<00:01:32.030> had<00:01:32.270> to

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
Tabasco on the Marconi's I've had to

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.980 
Tabasco on the Marconi's I've had to
pick<00:01:32.630> off<00:01:32.840> some<00:01:33.470> early<00:01:33.830> peppers<00:01:34.720> so<00:01:35.720> I<00:01:35.750> could

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
pick off some early peppers so I could

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.740 
pick off some early peppers so I could
allow<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.259> plants<00:01:36.799> to<00:01:36.830> use<00:01:37.310> their<00:01:37.610> energy<00:01:37.789> to

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
allow the plants to use their energy to

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.059 
allow the plants to use their energy to
produce<00:01:38.929> a<00:01:39.350> stronger<00:01:39.679> plant<00:01:41.470> so<00:01:42.470> keep<00:01:42.860> that<00:01:43.009> in

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
produce a stronger plant so keep that in

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.289 
produce a stronger plant so keep that in
mind<00:01:43.220> if<00:01:43.580> you're<00:01:43.700> planning<00:01:43.909> on<00:01:44.060> doing

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
first few peppers on these big varieties

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.130 
first few peppers on these big varieties
to<00:01:48.920> get<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.220> plant<00:01:49.490> nice<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:50.229> large<00:01:52.990> this<00:01:53.990> is

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
to get the plant nice and large this is

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.560 
to get the plant nice and large this is
my<00:01:54.259> Jamaican<00:01:54.530> hot<00:01:54.799> chocolate<00:01:56.680> uh<00:01:57.729> very<00:01:58.729> nice

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
one talking Natsume you can't really see

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.009 
one talking Natsume you can't really see
it<00:02:06.799> but<00:02:06.950> there's<00:02:07.219> a<00:02:07.490> bunch<00:02:08.269> of<00:02:08.450> green<00:02:08.720> little

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
it but there's a bunch of green little

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.359 
it but there's a bunch of green little
peppers<00:02:09.380> in<00:02:09.500> there<00:02:09.619> about<00:02:09.829> an<00:02:09.950> inch<00:02:10.070> or<00:02:10.340> so

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
peppers in there about an inch or so

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.449 
peppers in there about an inch or so
long<00:02:11.200> they're<00:02:12.200> buried<00:02:12.590> in<00:02:12.680> their<00:02:15.070> new<00:02:16.070> Mexican

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
long they're buried in their new Mexican

long they're buried in their new Mexican
variety<00:02:16.880> again<00:02:18.130> this<00:02:19.130> was<00:02:19.310> wilting<00:02:19.609> a<00:02:19.820> little

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
variety again this was wilting a little

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.699 
variety again this was wilting a little
bit<00:02:20.209> so<00:02:20.630> I'll<00:02:20.720> probably<00:02:20.930> have<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.170> water<00:02:21.440> that

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
bit so I'll probably have to water that

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.780 
bit so I'll probably have to water that
one<00:02:21.859> later<00:02:22.250> on<00:02:22.430> today<00:02:23.769> but<00:02:24.769> as<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.400> can<00:02:25.549> see

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
one later on today but as you can see

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.970 
one later on today but as you can see
there's<00:02:26.600> no<00:02:26.750> evidence<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:27.350> hail<00:02:27.620> damage

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
there's no evidence of that hail damage

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.440 
there's no evidence of that hail damage
anymore

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
anymore

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
anymore
the<00:02:30.109> stunted<00:02:30.590> growth<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:31.069> was<00:02:31.220> is<00:02:31.459> no<00:02:31.640> longer

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.270 

Ixtapa

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.559 

jalapeno<00:02:41.260> this<00:02:42.260> one's<00:02:42.550> growing<00:02:43.550> I<00:02:43.849> decided

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
jalapeno this one's growing I decided

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.210 
jalapeno this one's growing I decided
not<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.840> pull<00:02:45.170> off<00:02:45.319> any<00:02:45.530> peppers<00:02:45.950> on<00:02:46.069> these

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
not to pull off any peppers on these

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.449 
not to pull off any peppers on these
because<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:48.230> plants<00:02:48.530> look<00:02:48.650> pretty<00:02:48.890> good<00:02:49.129> and

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
because the plants look pretty good and

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.210 
because the plants look pretty good and
I<00:02:50.390> think<00:02:50.599> these<00:02:50.720> peppers<00:02:51.190> as<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:52.370> can<00:02:52.519> see<00:02:52.730> I

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
I think these peppers as you can see I

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.610 
I think these peppers as you can see I
think<00:02:55.220> they're<00:02:55.580> more<00:02:55.840> likely<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:57.050> keep

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
think they're more likely to keep

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.040 
think they're more likely to keep
producing<00:02:58.000> than<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.150> big<00:02:59.360> varieties<00:02:59.840> like

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
producing than the big varieties like

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:07.330 
producing than the big varieties like
the<00:03:00.530> Big<00:03:00.739> Jim<00:03:00.980> in<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.750> Marconi's<00:03:06.340> Marconi

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
the Big Jim in the Marconi's Marconi

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.600 
the Big Jim in the Marconi's Marconi

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
the first time I've tried this method of

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.740 
the first time I've tried this method of
growing<00:05:31.520> all<00:05:31.790> these<00:05:31.910> tomatoes<00:05:32.210> in<00:05:32.540> one

growing all these tomatoes in one
location<00:05:33.170> like<00:05:33.380> this<00:05:33.710> I've<00:05:34.370> got<00:05:36.010> 14<00:05:37.010> tomato

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
location like this I've got 14 tomato

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.140 
location like this I've got 14 tomato
plants<00:05:38.330> in<00:05:38.420> here<00:05:38.690> and<00:05:38.950> they<00:05:39.950> all<00:05:40.130> are<00:05:40.880> doing

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
plants in here and they all are doing

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:48.659 
plants in here and they all are doing
just<00:05:41.930> wonderful

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:53.129 

so<00:05:49.300> one<00:05:49.539> last<00:05:49.810> look<00:05:51.090> and<00:05:52.090> my<00:05:52.330> tomatoes<00:05:52.840> and

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
so one last look and my tomatoes and

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.429 
so one last look and my tomatoes and
peppers<00:05:53.379> which<00:05:53.979> I'm<00:05:54.219> very<00:05:54.520> pleased<00:05:54.849> with<00:05:55.439> the

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:56.439 
peppers which I'm very pleased with the

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.399 
peppers which I'm very pleased with the
growth<00:05:56.710> was<00:05:57.069> slower<00:05:57.460> this<00:05:58.449> year<00:05:58.810> than<00:05:59.139> it<00:05:59.259> has

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
growth was slower this year than it has

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:04.860 
growth was slower this year than it has
been<00:05:59.620> in<00:05:59.740> the<00:05:59.830> past<00:06:00.930> but<00:06:01.930> I<00:06:03.539> guess<00:06:04.539> that's<00:06:04.779> the

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
been in the past but I guess that's the

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:05.489 
been in the past but I guess that's the
way<00:06:04.960> it<00:06:05.080> goes

00:06:05.489 --> 00:06:05.499 
way it goes

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:09.239 
way it goes
and<00:06:06.300> they<00:06:07.300> recovered<00:06:07.779> from<00:06:07.960> the<00:06:08.080> hail<00:06:08.259> very

00:06:09.239 --> 00:06:09.249 
and they recovered from the hail very

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:11.610 
and they recovered from the hail very
nicely<00:06:09.569> even<00:06:10.569> though<00:06:10.779> they<00:06:10.930> looked<00:06:11.139> very<00:06:11.259> bad

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
nicely even though they looked very bad

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.999 
nicely even though they looked very bad
for<00:06:11.949> about<00:06:12.159> a<00:06:12.189> month<00:06:12.460> after<00:06:12.819> that<00:06:13.800> so<00:06:14.800> that

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.009 
for about a month after that so that

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.360 
for about a month after that so that
just<00:06:15.189> goes<00:06:15.310> to<00:06:15.370> show<00:06:15.550> you<00:06:16.349> somebody<00:06:17.349> once<00:06:18.249> said

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
just goes to show you somebody once said

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.050 
just goes to show you somebody once said
to<00:06:18.550> me<00:06:19.169> if<00:06:20.169> I<00:06:20.319> remembered<00:06:20.710> your<00:06:20.860> name<00:06:20.889> I<00:06:21.400> would

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
to me if I remembered your name I would

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.170 
to me if I remembered your name I would
say<00:06:22.300> it<00:06:23.129> what<00:06:24.129> doesn't<00:06:24.460> kill<00:06:24.669> and<00:06:24.879> makes<00:06:25.029> them

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
say it what doesn't kill and makes them

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.730 
say it what doesn't kill and makes them
stronger<00:06:25.509> and<00:06:25.840> I<00:06:25.960> guess<00:06:26.139> that's<00:06:26.349> true<00:06:26.580> so<00:06:28.740> this

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
stronger and I guess that's true so this

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.769 
stronger and I guess that's true so this
is<00:06:29.949> my<00:06:30.129> latest<00:06:30.340> installment<00:06:31.029> I<00:06:31.120> think<00:06:31.419> today

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.619 
chemically fertilize these once a week I
just<00:06:47.740> picked<00:06:48.610> up<00:06:48.729> whatever<00:06:49.029> I<00:06:49.120> could<00:06:49.270> find<00:06:49.449> I'm

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:51.189 
sure Miracle Grow would work nice but

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:54.570

00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 
seems to be working just fine so I

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.909 
seems to be working just fine so I
couple<00:07:00.339> that<00:07:00.520> with<00:07:00.719> using<00:07:01.719> some<00:07:01.930> organic

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 
couple that with using some organic

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:05.909 
couple that with using some organic
fertilizers<00:07:03.460> in<00:07:03.580> there<00:07:03.789> and<00:07:04.259> I<00:07:05.259> don't<00:07:05.379> see<00:07:05.770> any

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 
fertilizers in there and I don't see any

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:07.889 
fertilizers in there and I don't see any
problem<00:07:06.339> I<00:07:06.520> should<00:07:07.029> mention<00:07:07.149> real<00:07:07.509> quick<00:07:07.719> to

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:07.899 
problem I should mention real quick to

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:10.559 
problem I should mention real quick to
that<00:07:08.639> for<00:07:09.639> the<00:07:09.729> tomatoes<00:07:10.120> it's<00:07:10.300> really

00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:10.569 
that for the tomatoes it's really

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:13.139 
that for the tomatoes it's really
important<00:07:11.199> that<00:07:11.830> they<00:07:12.009> have<00:07:12.039> calcium<00:07:12.729> in<00:07:12.939> the

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:13.149 
important that they have calcium in the

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:14.969 
important that they have calcium in the
soil<00:07:13.180> otherwise<00:07:14.110> they<00:07:14.349> get<00:07:14.469> something<00:07:14.830> called

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:14.979 
soil otherwise they get something called

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:18.510 
soil otherwise they get something called
blossom<00:07:15.520> end<00:07:15.669> rot<00:07:16.500> so<00:07:17.500> what<00:07:17.680> I<00:07:17.710> did<00:07:17.800> to<00:07:18.279> make

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 
blossom end rot so what I did to make

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.689 
blossom end rot so what I did to make
sure<00:07:18.699> that<00:07:18.879> wouldn't<00:07:19.149> happen<00:07:19.300> is<00:07:19.719> I<00:07:20.169> put<00:07:20.439> in<00:07:20.699> a

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:21.699 
sure that wouldn't happen is I put in a

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:25.409 
sure that wouldn't happen is I put in a
bone<00:07:22.479> meal<00:07:22.750> and<00:07:23.610> put<00:07:24.610> in<00:07:24.729> bone<00:07:24.909> meal<00:07:25.120> in<00:07:25.300> the

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:25.419 
bone meal and put in bone meal in the

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:27.899 
bone meal and put in bone meal in the
soil<00:07:25.659> every<00:07:25.960> year<00:07:26.229> and<00:07:26.550> you<00:07:27.550> won't<00:07:27.699> have<00:07:27.849> that

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:27.909 
soil every year and you won't have that

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:31.800 
soil every year and you won't have that
