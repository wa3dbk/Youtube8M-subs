 exhibition category breast yes the truth 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.220
 walter very happy with how he 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.950
 developed the exhibition the truth that 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.390
 the spectacular organizing commission 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.980
 jorge goiter with all the people helped 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.360
 putting a barbarian push to the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.460
 exposition 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.980
 as for the horses good very 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.510
 I already told you before I 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.600
 there were three copies in each 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.310
 category in both males and females 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.660
 I liked them a lot I liked them a lot 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.160
 it seems to me a kind of animal defined and 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.680
 It is what I think we are looking not 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.420
 entering a bit in the ruling of your swear 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.570
 What can I say about a high male champion? 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.800
 in this case after female and neutered 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.350
 watch the macho championship 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.170
 and I opted for the three foals that were 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.080
 chosen in his category the male champion 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.390
 I found a horse of a structure 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.640
 barbarian very good measures very 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.080
 harmonious in its whole a horse 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.510
 from a trunk of good volume and very well 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.210
 accompanied by its low and very 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.450
 distinguished in his previous also 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.540
 I liked the reserved one I liked there 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.340
 I did not have the softness in in the joints 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.550
 that he had in his champion top unit 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.259
 male but a horse also from a 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.330
 very important previous train and the 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.610
 horse that best road of all 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.770
 positions that I liked very well 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.560
 angled in its lows so I was very 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.989
 according to also third best the third 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.120
 better a horse that did not have the 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.069
 distinction of the first two in its 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.140
 previous train west than in the jura 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.290
 express that for me it is very important 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.319
 that have a neck this distinguished in 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.280
 that category 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.680
 because they have a lot to do with the 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.439
 evolution not but the truth that a 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.780
 horse of a very cute trunk this one 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.670
 important rump we look good 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.420
 descended a leg well put me 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.420
 he liked a lot too 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.560
 entering the females a gorosito the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.540
 females the female champion loved the 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.060
 kind of mares that I like that I 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.010
 like to have the herd is a mare of 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.080
 a spectacular top line one 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:01.030
 rump wide and with a just inclination 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.880
 very very happy a spectacular volume 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.040
 the truth that is a mare I think we 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.820
 would have everyone in the herd the 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.230
 reserved the reserved a little bit had a 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.930
 neck a little cuter than the champion 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.270
 out there he did not have the harmony that the 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.850
 champion nor the softness in his line 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.370
 superior nor the volume but a mare 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.400
 also distinguished with a lot of class with 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.410
 very good low and was the best in the 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.950
 function in meekness to be better 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:33.330
 the third best was a filly that 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.040
 the 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.180
 the difference quite in the two 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.940
 first I think it was not up to the 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.430
 of those two mares but it's a mare of 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.680
 Cute kind of cute profile 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.630
 I would like to see them in garland a couple of 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.400
 years but a very feminine mare that 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.400
 I think it can have a good development 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.510
 when what was the championship of 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.390
 horses the castrated champion was the one 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.879
 meets more points in morphology and 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.730
 function so I think that with that was the 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.230
 horse of the best horse a very prolix 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.540
 neat in all his movements the most 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.400
 skillfully side horse that 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.069
 he is always under the command of the rider 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.569
 in truth that also a lot 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.180
 big difference between the champion and the 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.489
 others and the reserved is reserved in a 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.440
 cute well structured horse out there 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.320
 I did not have the ease of the first but a 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.590
 very cute castrated also be better the 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.670
 third best is also a horse of 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.860
 good structure 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.590
 but relegate it for just the others 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.150
 because he also had less less 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.790
 displacement was a little horse 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.560
 stiffer but a good horse of 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.820
 work also excellent the 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.490
 facilities of this place really 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.980
 very well organized by sportive 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.580
 equal leisure to the commission here from 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.680
 the presidency say the committee 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.390
 manager of the rural society here 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.210
 how did you think that as you saw all the 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.010
 issue of facilities the truth that the 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.780
 Some facilities are spectacular 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.390
 lend to develop the exhibition 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:06.210
 this barbarian 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.860
 the caballada accompanied accompanied a lot 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.300
 As I told you 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.820
 the three more and the three females 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.139
 they liked to come in and I was very 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.349
 agree with 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.449
 with the row and I step into categories 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.849
 also that he had four or five leagues 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.379
 very good level that out there is not very 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:26.650
 common in exhibitions that are 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:28.779
 complex categories but the truth that 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.569
 today as he accompanied all the 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:33.819
 facilities the desire to do the 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.400
