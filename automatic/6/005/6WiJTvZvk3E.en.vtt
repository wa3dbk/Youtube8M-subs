00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
minutes which I did and I think one of

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.370 
minutes which I did and I think one of
the<00:03:53.220> things<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.790> it's<00:03:54.690> telling<00:03:54.930> me<00:03:55.109> to<00:03:55.170> do

the things that it's telling me to do

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.250 
the things that it's telling me to do
that<00:03:55.530> for<00:03:55.579> is<00:03:56.579> because<00:03:56.910> they<00:03:57.840> don't<00:03:58.019> want<00:03:58.200> me

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
that for is because they don't want me

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.140 
that for is because they don't want me
to<00:03:58.380> burn<00:03:58.650> my<00:03:58.920> mouth<00:03:59.190> this<00:03:59.700> is<00:03:59.850> steaming
