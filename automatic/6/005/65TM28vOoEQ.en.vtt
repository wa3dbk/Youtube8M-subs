00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.189
 yes hello and welcome back to one 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.260
 new year to a new presentation 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.200
 one of my surprise characters 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.839
 it is again a hard plastic february 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.220
 and it's like you can see 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.570
 smurf and it is actually the 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.859
 referee smurf out of the soul 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.050
 the football bad of 1988 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.539
 yes, and the figurine does not mean something like that 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.480
 daddy smurf but really 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.489
 umpire stupid, there I am 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.610
 again informed about it and yes so 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:44.850
 the figurine looks like this out of the series 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.800
 the soccer boots from 1988 of course 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.719
 1988 is a little bit over it 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.899
 This is a bit like books too 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.550
 In the years you can see that 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.640
 a lonely place for example here 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.899
 on the finger act a bit chipped 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.609
 lay this is of course hand-painted too 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.519
 We have a whistle when I am 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:10.799
 now about camera display correctly 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.299
 can see some paint abrasion cupid 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.770
 is a bit farewell to 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.900
 back puschel tails of the smurf 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.759
 but still as yet still 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.060
 set up that condition as I think 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.430
 especially because as a child, I'm more or less 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.740
 less synonymous with my usual 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.150
 played 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.439
 to the catalog price this football struck 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.470
 By the way, that's an original one 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:45.140
 you always recognize on the feet consists 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:48.300
 here on it peyo 1988 ferrero of 1989 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.710
 hard to say 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.710
 yes and he is 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.010
 Papa Smurf the referee stump 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.660
 great that when I'm in the camera 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.400
 do not let that irritate you, yes 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.570
 catalog price seven euros if this 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.380
 really step in a good condition 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.150
 would 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.970
 unfortunately you are not with me because of me 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.100
 as I said before, have played with it 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.040
 bothers me personally is I am 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.050
 quite happy at this've figurine 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.610
 and even if I get those seven euros 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.270
 would not achieve with this figure 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.530
 even if I wanted to sell it 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.570
 which of course I do not want 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.040
 I just want a little one 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.980
 Collection here present at youtube 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:41.330
 and today is just the Spanish 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:43.040
 referee smurf and leaves 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.290
 you liked commented if you 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.610

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.980

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.550
