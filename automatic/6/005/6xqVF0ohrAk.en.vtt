00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.300 
Alaska planes and I want to kind of
defeat<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.060> purpose<00:01:54.210> if<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.170> really<00:01:55.859> don't<00:01:56.039> use

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
defeat the purpose if I really don't use

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.989 
defeat the purpose if I really don't use
them<00:01:57.409> here's<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.530> regional<00:01:58.979> side<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.850> know

00:01:59.989 --> 00:01:59.999 
them here's the regional side you know

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.449 
them here's the regional side you know
smart<00:02:00.450> crafts<00:02:00.979> wish<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.130> would<00:02:02.219> have<00:02:02.340> been

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
smart crafts wish it would have been

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:05.649 
smart crafts wish it would have been
bigger<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:03.030> kind<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.600> ran<00:02:03.719> out<00:02:03.749> of<00:02:03.929> room<00:02:04.459> and

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
bigger but kind of ran out of room and

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.100 
bigger but kind of ran out of room and
the<00:02:06.659> Delta<00:02:07.079> terminal<00:02:07.970> which<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.360> guess<00:02:09.810> I'll<00:02:09.990> go

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
the Delta terminal which I guess I'll go

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.980 
the Delta terminal which I guess I'll go
through<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.500> lighting<00:02:10.890> right<00:02:11.070> now<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.990> guess

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
through the lighting right now I guess

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.050 
through the lighting right now I guess
it's<00:02:13.200> not<00:02:13.320> as<00:02:13.500> complicated<00:02:14.010> as<00:02:14.460> they<00:02:14.640> may<00:02:14.790> look

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
it's not as complicated as they may look

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.570 
it's not as complicated as they may look
okay<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.080> mess<00:02:16.290> up<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.680> whole<00:02:16.830> layout<00:02:17.220> here

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
okay so I mess up the whole layout here

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.240 
okay so I mess up the whole layout here
but<00:02:17.900> here's<00:02:18.900> pretty<00:02:19.350> much<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.680> underside<00:02:20.220> of

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
but here's pretty much the underside of

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.640

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
that hard I'm gonna set this down here's

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.880 
that hard I'm gonna set this down here's
the<00:02:43.140> FedEx<00:02:44.000> of<00:02:45.000> cargo<00:02:45.480> area<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:46.020> guess<00:02:46.710> since

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
the FedEx of cargo area I guess since

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.370 
the FedEx of cargo area I guess since
I'm<00:02:47.040> kind<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.340> basing<00:02:47.730> this<00:02:47.850> Airport<00:02:48.360> off<00:02:48.510> LAX

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
I'm kind of basing this Airport off LAX

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.740 
I'm kind of basing this Airport off LAX
I<00:02:49.740> guess<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.520> only<00:02:50.670> seems<00:02:50.970> right<00:02:51.210> to<00:02:51.240> kind<00:02:51.600> of

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
I guess it only seems right to kind of

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.560 
I guess it only seems right to kind of
use<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.320> axe<00:02:52.560> even<00:02:52.950> though<00:02:53.550> I<00:02:53.580> have<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:54.180> bunch

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
use that axe even though I have a bunch

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.290 
use that axe even though I have a bunch
of<00:02:54.750> other<00:02:54.930> cargo<00:02:55.440> planes<00:02:55.740> that<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.490> probably

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
of other cargo planes that I probably

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.260 
of other cargo planes that I probably
have<00:02:57.570> never<00:02:57.870> even<00:02:58.110> showed<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.710> guys<00:02:58.740> and<00:02:59.520> as

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
have never even showed you guys and as

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.750 
have never even showed you guys and as
you<00:03:00.570> could<00:03:00.750> tell<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:01.260> don't<00:03:01.560> have<00:03:01.770> any<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.460> don't

you could tell I don't have any I don't

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.340 
you could tell I don't have any I don't
have<00:03:02.880> any<00:03:03.000> accessories<00:03:03.600> set<00:03:03.840> up<00:03:03.960> right<00:03:04.200> now

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
have any accessories set up right now

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.710 
have any accessories set up right now
usually<00:03:05.070> they'll<00:03:05.460> have<00:03:05.640> little<00:03:06.000> cars<00:03:06.360> there

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.100 
usually they'll have little cars there
whatnot<00:03:07.380> but<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:08.300> just<00:03:09.300> kind<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.510> wanted<00:03:10.020> to

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
whatnot but I just kind of wanted to

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.730 
whatnot but I just kind of wanted to
make<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.320> quick<00:03:10.680> setup<00:03:10.950> here<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.370> show<00:03:11.580> you<00:03:11.640> guys

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
make a quick setup here to show you guys

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.320 
make a quick setup here to show you guys
and<00:03:13.740> as<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.190> could<00:03:14.340> tell<00:03:14.520> I<00:03:14.580> still<00:03:14.640> need<00:03:15.120> more

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
and as you could tell I still need more

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.840 
and as you could tell I still need more
bridges<00:03:15.660> here<00:03:16.080> I<00:03:16.260> mean<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:16.980> don't<00:03:17.130> have<00:03:17.250> any<00:03:17.520> air

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
bridges here I mean I don't have any air

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.260 
bridges here I mean I don't have any air
southwest<00:03:18.720> terminal<00:03:19.230> still<00:03:19.470> needs<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.770> couple

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
southwest terminal still needs a couple

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.830 
southwest terminal still needs a couple
and<00:03:21.270> I<00:03:21.540> think<00:03:21.750> there's<00:03:21.900> one<00:03:22.170> missing<00:03:22.440> there

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
and I think there's one missing there

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.770 
and I think there's one missing there
but<00:03:24.840> yeah<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.770> is<00:03:26.030> United<00:03:27.030> in<00:03:27.120> my<00:03:27.270> American

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
but yeah this is United in my American

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.720 
but yeah this is United in my American
side<00:03:28.050> wish<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.530> would<00:03:28.650> be<00:03:28.830> bigger<00:03:29.100> but<00:03:29.430> again<00:03:29.700> I

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
side wish it would be bigger but again I

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.990 
side wish it would be bigger but again I
ran<00:03:30.000> out<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.270> room<00:03:30.710> the<00:03:31.730> international<00:03:32.730> side

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
ran out of room the international side

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.810 
ran out of room the international side
which<00:03:33.810> I'm<00:03:34.160> lately<00:03:35.160> I've<00:03:35.250> been<00:03:35.400> buying<00:03:35.580> a<00:03:35.790> lot

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
which I'm lately I've been buying a lot

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.550 
which I'm lately I've been buying a lot
of<00:03:36.150> international<00:03:36.630> planes<00:03:37.200> because<00:03:37.410> I

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
of international planes because I

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.190 
of international planes because I
figured<00:03:38.010> also<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.400> mean<00:03:38.640> if<00:03:39.300> I<00:03:39.480> really<00:03:39.780> do<00:03:39.960> want

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
figured also I mean if I really do want

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.580 
figured also I mean if I really do want
to<00:03:40.290> make<00:03:40.470> other<00:03:40.680> acts<00:03:41.040> beyond<00:03:41.520> the

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
to make other acts beyond the

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
to make other acts beyond the
International<00:03:43.590> planes<00:03:43.860> is<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.220> only<00:03:44.370> way

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
International planes is the only way

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.880 
International planes is the only way
I'll<00:03:44.760> be<00:03:44.790> able<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.180> really<00:03:45.600> I<00:03:47.180> guess<00:03:48.860> make<00:03:49.860> the

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
I'll be able to really I guess make the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.680 
I'll be able to really I guess make the
distinct<00:03:51.560> distinction<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.830> don't<00:03:52.980> know<00:03:53.690> you

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
distinct distinction I don't know you

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.630 
distinct distinction I don't know you
guys<00:03:54.840> know<00:03:55.020> what<00:03:55.140> I'm<00:03:55.200> trying<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.470> say<00:03:55.710> so
