issues and I believe that the Bible has
answers<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.559> right<00:00:58.680> now<00:00:58.859> let's<00:00:59.070> take

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219

answers for that so right now let's take
a<00:00:59.250> look<00:00:59.430> at<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.550> question<00:00:59.879> we<00:01:00.030> have<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.270> and

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
a look at the question we have here and

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.700 
a look at the question we have here and
it<00:01:01.500> says<00:01:01.789> should<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> Christian<00:01:03.300> get<00:01:03.719> tattoos

scripture no tattoos no drinking but

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.190 
scripture no tattoos no drinking but
that's<00:02:35.730> just<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.060> type<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.300> person<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.870> am

that's just the type of person I am

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.710 
that's just the type of person I am
but<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.280> Bible<00:02:38.610> doesn't<00:02:38.640> say<00:02:38.970> in<00:02:39.209> chapter<00:02:39.450> and

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
but the Bible doesn't say in chapter and

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.810 
but the Bible doesn't say in chapter and
verse<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:40.200> it's<00:02:40.380> wrong<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.430> little

drink of wine here or there now that

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.020 
drink of wine here or there now that
doesn't<00:02:43.770> mean<00:02:44.010> I'm<00:02:44.220> saying<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.760> should<00:02:44.940> go

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
doesn't mean I'm saying you should go

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.590 
doesn't mean I'm saying you should go
and<00:02:45.180> do<00:02:45.330> it

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
and do it

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.199 
and do it
but<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.380> scripture<00:02:46.709> gives<00:02:47.010> us<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.370> very<00:02:47.670> clear

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
but the scripture gives us a very clear

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.330 
but the scripture gives us a very clear
perspective<00:02:48.450> on<00:02:49.200> these<00:02:49.830> sort<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.280> things

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
perspective on these sort of things

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.550 
perspective on these sort of things
where<00:02:50.820> Paul<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.120> writing<00:02:51.480> he<00:02:51.690> says<00:02:51.900> hey<00:02:52.080> you

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
where Paul is writing he says hey you

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.100 
where Paul is writing he says hey you
say<00:02:52.800> you're<00:02:52.980> allowed<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.640> do<00:02:53.820> many<00:02:54.090> things<00:02:54.209> but

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
say you're allowed to do many things but

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.570 
say you're allowed to do many things but
that<00:02:55.230> doesn't<00:02:55.590> mean<00:02:55.709> everything<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.400> do

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
that doesn't mean everything that you do

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.360 
that doesn't mean everything that you do
is<00:02:56.730> beneficial<00:02:57.269> so<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.320> question<00:02:58.739> is<00:02:58.890> not<00:02:59.040> can

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
is beneficial so the question is not can

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.780 
is beneficial so the question is not can
I<00:02:59.850> do<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.989> question<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.590> should<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.220> do<00:03:02.430> it

I do it the question is should I do it
is<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.510> beneficial<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.410> even<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:04.739> some<00:03:04.980> points

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
is it beneficial and even in some points

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.830 
is it beneficial and even in some points
of<00:03:05.400> scripture<00:03:05.760> talks<00:03:06.030> about<00:03:06.180> causing<00:03:06.750> your

now obviously you draw the line

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.290 
now obviously you draw the line
somewhere<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.620> they<00:03:10.800> have<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.130> take

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300

get tattoos all over their body you know
and<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.750> doesn't<00:03:31.140> look<00:03:31.320> very<00:03:31.620> good<00:03:31.829> in<00:03:31.980> my

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
and it doesn't look very good in my

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.009 
and it doesn't look very good in my
opinion<00:03:32.220> but<00:03:32.760> that's<00:03:33.030> my<00:03:33.329> opinion<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:33.900> the

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
opinion but that's my opinion and the

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.350 
opinion but that's my opinion and the
scripture<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:35.400> scripture<00:03:35.760> teaches

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
scripture the scripture teaches

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.880 
scripture the scripture teaches
just<00:03:36.750> because<00:03:37.019> you<00:03:37.110> can<00:03:37.350> doesn't<00:03:37.560> mean<00:03:37.769> you

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
just because you can doesn't mean you

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.740 
just because you can doesn't mean you
should<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.579> I<00:03:38.730> think<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:39.360> have<00:03:39.600> to

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
should and I think that you have to

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.300 
should and I think that you have to
remember<00:03:39.870> too<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.709> your<00:03:40.829> body<00:03:41.100> is<00:03:41.280> the

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
remember too that your body is the

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.940 
remember too that your body is the
temple<00:03:41.459> of<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.390> Holy<00:03:42.600> Spirit<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.829> it

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
temple of the Holy Spirit and that it

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.170 
temple of the Holy Spirit and that it
doesn't<00:03:44.160> belong<00:03:44.549> to<00:03:44.610> you

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
doesn't belong to you

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.390 
doesn't belong to you
so<00:03:45.299> I<00:03:45.329> say<00:03:45.600> before<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:45.930> put<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.200> tattoo<00:03:46.470> on<00:03:46.709> you

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
so I say before you put a tattoo on you

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.750 
so I say before you put a tattoo on you
should<00:03:47.610> probably<00:03:47.880> ask<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.600> owner
