he's uh he's a pretty skinny figure
which<00:00:33.829> makes<00:00:34.040> sense<00:00:34.309> I<00:00:34.430> guess<00:00:34.460> I<00:00:34.850> really<00:00:35.450> like

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
which makes sense I guess I really like

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.479 
which makes sense I guess I really like
the<00:00:35.690> base<00:00:35.899> that<00:00:36.170> they<00:00:36.320> gave<00:00:36.469> him<00:00:36.620> he's<00:00:37.309> got

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
the base that they gave him he's got

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.100 
the base that they gave him he's got
that<00:00:37.610> kind<00:00:37.850> of<00:00:38.590> swirling<00:00:39.590> mountain<00:00:40.370> base

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
that kind of swirling mountain base

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.950 
that kind of swirling mountain base
pretty<00:00:42.110> good<00:00:42.260> detail<00:00:42.850> so<00:00:43.850> yeah<00:00:44.000> it<00:00:44.719> kind<00:00:44.930> of

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
pretty good detail so yeah it kind of

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.540 
pretty good detail so yeah it kind of
sucks<00:00:45.170> that<00:00:45.350> there's<00:00:45.500> no<00:00:45.590> play<00:00:45.860> set<00:00:46.160> for

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
sucks that there's no play set for

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.700 
sucks that there's no play set for
Nightmare<00:00:47.360> Before<00:00:47.390> Christmas<00:00:47.660> this<00:00:48.649> is

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
Nightmare Before Christmas this is

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.049 
Nightmare Before Christmas this is
literally<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.309> only<00:00:49.399> figure<00:00:49.670> that's<00:00:49.910> been

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
literally the only figure that's been

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.029 
literally the only figure that's been
announced<00:00:50.210> so<00:00:50.510> far<00:00:50.539> I<00:00:50.780> imagine<00:00:51.680> this<00:00:51.739> is<00:00:51.829> only

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
announced so far I imagine this is only

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.400 
announced so far I imagine this is only
figure<00:00:52.219> they<00:00:52.309> plan<00:00:52.489> on<00:00:52.520> releasing<00:00:52.789> for<00:00:53.149> it<00:00:53.410> but

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
figure they plan on releasing for it but

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.720 
figure they plan on releasing for it but
yeah<00:00:54.559> I<00:00:54.590> mean<00:00:54.920> you<00:00:55.070> just<00:00:55.160> kind<00:00:55.280> of<00:00:55.370> get<00:00:55.489> to<00:00:55.550> play

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
yeah I mean you just kind of get to play

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.340 
yeah I mean you just kind of get to play
around<00:00:55.910> in<00:00:56.059> the<00:00:56.120> toy<00:00:56.359> box<00:00:56.600> with<00:00:56.930> him<00:00:57.109> and

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
around in the toy box with him and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.549 
around in the toy box with him and
there's<00:00:58.100> no<00:00:58.719> no<00:00:59.719> actual<00:01:00.019> play<00:01:00.170> set<00:01:00.379> and<00:01:00.530> I

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
there's no no actual play set and I

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:01.930 
there's no no actual play set and I
think<00:01:00.739> I<00:01:00.859> that's<00:01:01.309> kind<00:01:01.609> of<00:01:01.640> gonna<00:01:01.789> be<00:01:01.850> a

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
think I that's kind of gonna be a

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.670 
think I that's kind of gonna be a
problem<00:01:02.390> with<00:01:02.510> Disney<00:01:02.809> infinity<00:01:02.930> for<00:01:03.410> me<00:01:03.500> and

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
problem with Disney infinity for me and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.630 
problem with Disney infinity for me and
I'm<00:01:03.739> sure<00:01:03.890> a<00:01:03.920> lot<00:01:04.070> of<00:01:04.100> people<00:01:04.220> will<00:01:04.400> probably

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
I'm sure a lot of people will probably

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.270 
I'm sure a lot of people will probably
agree<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:05.930> toy<00:01:06.050> box<00:01:06.230> is<00:01:06.470> kind<00:01:06.680> of<00:01:06.800> cool<00:01:06.950> but

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
agree the toy box is kind of cool but

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.340 
agree the toy box is kind of cool but
it's<00:01:07.400> definitely<00:01:07.550> not<00:01:07.790> as<00:01:08.240> fun<00:01:08.780> as<00:01:08.960> playing<00:01:09.230> in

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
it's definitely not as fun as playing in

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.870 
it's definitely not as fun as playing in
an<00:01:09.440> actual<00:01:09.710> playset

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
an actual playset

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.090
