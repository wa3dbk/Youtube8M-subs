it is not sealed website not sealed so I

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.640 
it is not sealed website not sealed so I
do<00:01:42.710> like<00:01:43.130> that<00:01:43.160> this<00:01:44.150> is<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:44.390> four-way<00:01:44.900> and<00:01:45.320> I<00:01:45.590> do

the<00:01:47.990> three<00:01:48.170> bundles<00:01:48.440> I<00:01:48.710> think<00:01:48.950> if<00:01:49.070> I<00:01:49.190> have<00:01:49.340> four

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670

the three bundles I think if I have four
bundles<00:01:49.910> it<00:01:50.390> would<00:01:50.510> have<00:01:50.600> been<00:01:50.720> too<00:01:50.900> much<00:01:51.020> hair

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
through bundles our definitely

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.790 
through bundles our definitely
to<00:05:10.759> get<00:05:10.880> a<00:05:10.910> closure<00:05:11.419> I<00:05:11.539> wouldn't<00:05:11.930> say<00:05:12.080> get

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
to get a closure I wouldn't say get

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.589

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
three bundles without a closure because

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.640 
three bundles without a closure because
you<00:05:17.599> might<00:05:17.780> not<00:05:17.930> have<00:05:17.990> enough<00:05:18.259> here<00:05:18.440> unless

you have a small head especially if you
have<00:05:20.210> a<00:05:20.330> bigger<00:05:20.569> size<00:05:20.900> and<00:05:21.169> then<00:05:21.530> you're

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
have a bigger size and then you're

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.140 
have a bigger size and then you're
definitely<00:05:21.979> four<00:05:22.430> bundles<00:05:22.639> if<00:05:22.910> you're<00:05:23.000> not
