00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
you can eed to move one of those out of

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.949 
you can eed to move one of those out of
the<00:02:51.580> way<00:02:51.610> these<00:02:52.000> out<00:02:52.209> of<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.390> way<00:02:52.480> we're<00:02:52.810> just

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
the way these out of the way we're just

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.370 
the way these out of the way we're just
gonna<00:02:53.080> lay<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.680> on<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.190> wax<00:02:54.519> paper<00:02:55.230> okay<00:02:56.230> now

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
gonna lay it on the wax paper okay now

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.870 
gonna lay it on the wax paper okay now
this<00:02:56.500> is<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.680> next<00:02:56.920> step<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:57.340> it's<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.489> little

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
this is the next step so it's a little

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.280 
this is the next step so it's a little
while<00:02:58.120> here<00:02:58.269> I'll<00:02:58.360> leave<00:02:58.480> these<00:02:58.570> on<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:58.870> how

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
while here I'll leave these on it how

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.110 
while here I'll leave these on it how
long<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.620> then<00:02:59.709> you're<00:02:59.800> gonna<00:03:00.070> want<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.489> brush

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
long and then you're gonna want to brush

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.970 
long and then you're gonna want to brush
out<00:03:01.390> so<00:03:01.750> that<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.140> know<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.380> little<00:03:02.530> windows

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
out so that you know the little windows

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.860 
out so that you know the little windows
in<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.430> lace<00:03:03.640> so<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.239> windows<00:03:04.540> in<00:03:04.720> the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
in the lace so that the windows in the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.380 
in the lace so that the windows in the
lace<00:03:05.050> are<00:03:05.320> pop<00:03:06.040> because<00:03:06.430> what<00:03:06.790> happens<00:03:07.150> is<00:03:07.269> the

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
lace are pop because what happens is the

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.360 
lace are pop because what happens is the
glue<00:03:07.720> actually<00:03:08.080> creates<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:08.800> little<00:03:09.010> window<00:03:09.310> so

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
glue actually creates a little window so

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.420 
glue actually creates a little window so
if<00:03:09.550> I<00:03:09.610> fix<00:03:10.360> us<00:03:10.540> up<00:03:10.720> oh<00:03:10.900> sure<00:03:11.290> yeah<00:03:11.739> some<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.310> them
