00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
shortcomings as I said in my review back

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.890 
shortcomings as I said in my review back
in<00:01:07.979> October<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.580> can't<00:01:09.000> recommend<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.720> but

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
in October I can't recommend it but

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.140 
in October I can't recommend it but
regardless<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.590> what<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.740> say<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.460> will<00:01:11.790> still

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150

sell and plenty of people will buy it
the<00:01:14.640> question<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.270> does<00:01:15.810> its<00:01:16.020> low<00:01:16.259> entry<00:01:16.740> price

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
