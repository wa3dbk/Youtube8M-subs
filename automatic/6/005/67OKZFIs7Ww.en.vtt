these products change up quite a bit but

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.770 
these products change up quite a bit but
at<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.790> moment<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.300> what<00:00:09.420> I've<00:00:09.660> been

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
shower I like to put my hair up in a

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.179 
shower I like to put my hair up in a
little<00:00:15.839> turban<00:00:16.800> towel<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:19.010> sometimes<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.130> do

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
little turban towel and sometimes I do

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.859 
little turban towel and sometimes I do
my<00:00:20.369> makeup<00:00:20.699> with<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:20.970> on<00:00:21.119> sometimes<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.720> don't

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
my makeup with this on sometimes I don't

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.590 
my makeup with this on sometimes I don't
it<00:00:22.140> really<00:00:22.320> just<00:00:22.500> depends<00:00:22.890> but<00:00:23.400> today<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.269> left

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
it really just depends but today I left

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.810 
it really just depends but today I left
it<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:24.869> while<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.199> got<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> rest<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.519> my<00:00:26.609> face

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
it on while I got the rest of my face

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.910 
it on while I got the rest of my face
ready<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.420> now<00:00:27.570> I'm<00:00:27.779> just<00:00:28.019> squeezing<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
ready and now I'm just squeezing the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.609 
ready and now I'm just squeezing the
excess<00:00:29.460> moisture<00:00:29.849> out<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.510> my<00:00:30.660> hair<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.590> it

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
excess moisture out of my hair so it

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.110 
excess moisture out of my hair so it
doesn't<00:00:31.949> drip<00:00:32.160> all<00:00:32.340> over<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> place<00:00:32.880> which

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
doesn't drip all over the place which

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.700 
doesn't drip all over the place which
it's<00:00:33.390> still<00:00:33.510> probably<00:00:34.020> well<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> little<00:00:34.559> bit

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
it's still probably well a little bit

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.100 
it's still probably well a little bit
but<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.579> helps<00:00:35.910> get<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.450> be<00:00:36.600> more<00:00:36.780> damp

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
but this helps get it to be more damp

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.540 
but this helps get it to be more damp
and<00:00:37.350> not<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.829> dripping<00:00:38.250> still<00:00:38.899> and<00:00:40.399> then<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and not like dripping still and then the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.250 
and not like dripping still and then the
first<00:00:41.790> thing<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.600> use<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.140> this

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
first thing that I like to use is this

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.790 
first thing that I like to use is this
organics<00:00:44.040> nourishing<00:00:44.730> coconut<00:00:45.210> milk<00:00:45.739> this<00:00:46.739> is

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
organics nourishing coconut milk this is

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.670 
organics nourishing coconut milk this is
basically<00:00:47.399> an<00:00:47.700> anti<00:00:48.180> breakage<00:00:48.450> serum<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.410> I

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
basically an anti breakage serum but I

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.619 
basically an anti breakage serum but I
have<00:00:50.219> had<00:00:50.399> really<00:00:50.430> good<00:00:50.910> results<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.449> this

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
have had really good results with this

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.279 
have had really good results with this
helping<00:00:52.590> my<00:00:53.100> split<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.149> think<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:55.079> good

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
helping my split in so I think it's good

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.560 
helping my split in so I think it's good
for<00:00:55.559> preventing<00:00:55.739> breakage<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:57.210> me<00:00:57.360> I've

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
for preventing breakage but for me I've

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.479 
for preventing breakage but for me I've
actually<00:00:57.870> noticed<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.500> difference<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:59.100> split

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
actually noticed a difference with split

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.090 
actually noticed a difference with split
ends<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:01.050> put<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> few<00:01:01.530> pumps<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.980> that

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
ends and I just put a few pumps of that

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.160 
ends and I just put a few pumps of that
into<00:01:02.430> my<00:01:02.520> hair<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.940> then<00:01:03.120> kind<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.510> run<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.899> in

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
into my hair and then kind of run it in

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.649 
into my hair and then kind of run it in
the<00:01:04.409> bottom<00:01:05.010> half<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.880> my<00:01:06.090> hair<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.360> guess

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
the bottom half of my hair I guess

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.570 
the bottom half of my hair I guess
probably<00:01:06.990> more<00:01:07.260> than<00:01:07.380> half<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.159> know

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
probably more than half but you know

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.310 
probably more than half but you know
what<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.729> mean<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.360> don't<00:01:09.420> put<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
scalp but other than that I just put it

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.880 
scalp but other than that I just put it
in<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.790> bottom<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.500> just<00:01:16.500> especially

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
in the bottom and just especially

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:26.240 
in the bottom and just especially
concentrate<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.880> at<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> very<00:01:18.299> ends<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:26.009> next

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
don't know how much this does on its own

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.990 
don't know how much this does on its own
to<00:01:40.650> be<00:01:40.740> honest<00:01:41.100> because<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.520> don't<00:01:41.700> really<00:01:41.970> ever

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
to be honest because I don't really ever

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.460 
to be honest because I don't really ever
use<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.630> its<00:01:42.780> own<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.960> use<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.350> in

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
use it on its own I use it in

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.260 
use it on its own I use it in
conjunction<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.399> lot<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.670> other<00:01:44.820> products

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
conjunction with a lot of other products

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.870 
conjunction with a lot of other products
but<00:01:45.570> my<00:01:46.259> hair<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.649> usually<00:01:46.829> really<00:01:47.250> soft<00:01:47.549> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
but my hair is usually really soft and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.500 
but my hair is usually really soft and
silky<00:01:48.540> and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
silky and

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.690
