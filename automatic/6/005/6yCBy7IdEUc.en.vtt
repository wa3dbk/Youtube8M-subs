together let's hear what happens if we

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.540 
together let's hear what happens if we
just<00:00:44.969> turn<00:00:45.269> on<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.140> hammer<00:00:46.800> microphones<00:00:47.370> here

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
just turn on the hammer microphones here

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.149 
just turn on the hammer microphones here
the<00:00:47.670> hammer<00:00:49.789> okay<00:00:50.789> let's<00:00:51.420> add<00:00:51.629> or<00:00:52.320> change<00:00:52.710> that

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
the hammer okay let's add or change that

00:00:53.159 --> 00:01:00.880 
the hammer okay let's add or change that
to<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.399> mid<00:00:53.789> side<00:00:56.329> same<00:00:57.329> thing<00:00:57.359> the<00:00:57.629> space<00:00:57.869> pair

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.079 

same<00:01:01.890> thing<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:02.189> room<00:01:02.399> mics<00:01:02.609> you'll<00:01:02.909> have<00:01:03.000> to

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
same thing with room mics you'll have to

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.120 
same thing with room mics you'll have to
forgive<00:01:03.329> my<00:01:03.510> playing<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:06.330> then<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.979> can

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
forgive my playing and then we can

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.249 
forgive my playing and then we can
combine<00:01:08.640> these<00:01:08.820> together<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.600> here's<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
combine these together so here's the

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.180 
combine these together so here's the
sound<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> hammer<00:01:11.009> mics<00:01:12.890> here<00:01:13.890> they<00:01:14.039> are

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
sound of the hammer mics here they are

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:24.670 
sound of the hammer mics here they are
with<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.640> spaced<00:01:14.970> pair

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.800 

and<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.760> add<00:01:26.940> in<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.420> room<00:01:27.600> mics

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
and then you can add in the room mics

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:46.730 
and then you can add in the room mics
with<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:44.210> let's<00:01:45.210> hear<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.780> mid<00:01:46.410> side

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
with that let's hear just the mid side

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:58.250 
with that let's hear just the mid side
on<00:01:47.100> their<00:01:47.520> own<00:01:55.520> pretty<00:01:56.520> good<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.970> can<00:01:57.120> add<00:01:57.330> the

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
on their own pretty good you can add the

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.840 
on their own pretty good you can add the
room<00:01:58.500> mics<00:01:58.710> with<00:01:58.890> those<00:01:59.040> as<00:01:59.250> well

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.190 

let's<00:02:05.850> explain<00:02:06.180> some<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.420> these<00:02:06.570> microphone

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
let's explain some of these microphone

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.020 
let's explain some of these microphone
perspectives<00:02:07.740> hammer<00:02:08.220> mics<00:02:08.460> are<00:02:08.640> obviously

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
perspectives hammer mics are obviously

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.390 
perspectives hammer mics are obviously
right<00:02:09.300> over<00:02:09.540> top<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.960> piano<00:02:10.110> hammers<00:02:10.679> they

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
right over top of the piano hammers they

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.450 
right over top of the piano hammers they
sound<00:02:11.640> like<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:12.170> mid<00:02:13.170> side<00:02:13.410> is<00:02:13.590> just<00:02:13.950> outside

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
sound like this mid side is just outside

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.220 
sound like this mid side is just outside
the<00:02:14.640> piano<00:02:14.970> where<00:02:15.240> we<00:02:15.390> have<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.840> microphone

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
the piano where we have a microphone

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.110 
the piano where we have a microphone
pair<00:02:17.190> called

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
pair called

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.320 
pair called
ms<00:02:18.540> space<00:02:19.410> paris<00:02:19.890> outside<00:02:20.490> of<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.670> piano<00:02:21.060> with

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
ms space paris outside of the piano with

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.870 
ms space paris outside of the piano with
just<00:02:22.310> microphones

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
just microphones

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:32.750 
just microphones
separated<00:02:24.660> from<00:02:24.690> one<00:02:24.960> another<00:02:31.280> room<00:02:32.280> mics<00:02:32.520> are

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
separated from one another room mics are

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.120 
separated from one another room mics are
the<00:02:33.150> room<00:02:33.390> mics<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:33.989> studio<00:02:34.590> hands<00:02:35.040> the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
the room mics in the studio hands the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:43.580 
the room mics in the studio hands the
studio<00:02:35.459> grand<00:02:35.730> piano

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.560 

and<00:02:44.590> then<00:02:45.250> we<00:02:45.460> can<00:02:45.580> combine<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:45.940> with<00:02:46.150> any

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
and then we can combine that with any

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.170 
and then we can combine that with any
other<00:02:47.160> perspective<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:48.340> we<00:02:48.370> have<00:02:48.520> hammer<00:02:48.820> and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
other perspective so we have hammer and

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:58.920 
other perspective so we have hammer and
room<00:02:55.950> plus<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:57.280> can<00:02:57.430> control<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:58.150> volume<00:02:58.420> of

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
room plus I can control the volume of

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.740 
room plus I can control the volume of
any<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.260> these<00:02:59.380> let's<00:02:59.710> do<00:03:00.220> just<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.240> hammer

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
any of these let's do just the hammer

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.880 
any of these let's do just the hammer
mics<00:03:01.990> on<00:03:02.140> their<00:03:02.290> own<00:03:02.820> with<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:03.940> room<00:03:04.120> mics<00:03:04.890> now

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
mics on their own with the room mics now

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.960 
mics on their own with the room mics now
let's<00:03:06.100> change<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.640> volume<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:12.370> here<00:03:12.610> is<00:03:12.700> way

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
let's change the volume so here is way

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:28.810 
let's change the volume so here is way
too<00:03:13.030> much<00:03:13.270> room

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.640 

beautiful<00:03:29.820> control<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.480> have<00:03:30.990> all<00:03:31.320> these

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
beautiful control and have all these

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:42.820 
beautiful control and have all these
microphones<00:03:32.420> pairs<00:03:33.420> playing<00:03:33.930> back<00:03:34.140> together

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.580 

and<00:03:44.090> their<00:03:45.090> phase<00:03:45.450> aligned<00:03:45.840> extremely

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
and their phase aligned extremely

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.360 
and their phase aligned extremely
efficient<00:03:47.100> incredibly<00:03:47.940> affordable<00:03:49.370> produced
