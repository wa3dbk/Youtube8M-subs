saw<00:01:47.600> in<00:01:48.600> my<00:01:48.930> gypsy<00:01:49.680> danger<00:01:50.460> um<00:01:50.900> video<00:01:51.900> he<00:01:52.380> has<00:01:52.530> a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
saw in my gypsy danger um video he has a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.609 
saw in my gypsy danger um video he has a
nuclear<00:01:52.979> reactor<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.490> he<00:01:53.580> can<00:01:53.729> explode<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:55.200> he

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
nuclear reactor so he can explode but he

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.640 
nuclear reactor so he can explode but he
does<00:01:55.800> not<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> nuclear<00:01:56.790> reactor<00:01:57.650> because

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
does not have a nuclear reactor because

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.560 
does not have a nuclear reactor because

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
it doesn't explode so does the crimson

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.200 
it doesn't explode so does the crimson
typhoon<00:02:00.780> doesn't<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.920> any<00:02:02.250> nuclear<00:02:02.670> reactor

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
typhoon doesn't have any nuclear reactor

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.719
