00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:12.960
 Hello everyone and today we have a review of the game 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.580
 for android battlefield ank this game 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.820
 seemed to me quite interesting 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.500
 Well 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.090
 interesting plan graphics are not in the plan 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.550
 gameplay is what the review will be pretty 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.439
 I still want to show fast 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.570
 graphics because this is the main thing 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:30.090
 this game so the task yet no missions 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.469
 also just changing killing tanks look 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.210
 on graphics and everything is still beta 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.450
 that’s actually starving we can ride 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.580
 turn credited current 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.580
 shots although you can forget to add 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.379
 . trees as you can see, too, everything is transparent 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:56.719
 imposed i could already on specifics 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.729
 killers are the best but for such 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.250
 hodgepodge which are lined up by ordinary 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:04.059
 unprofessional developers group 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.070
 it is of course very very 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.880
 as we see the creation of these is not on top 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.039
 our life has been 100 exhibitions 91 yet 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:20.600
 which at night does not affect him even a little 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:24.500
 languages it was throw like that shorter 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.929
 chase the game is limited if someone 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.789
 wants to call for grandfather and still see 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:33.170
 it will not be their tanks either 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.630
 proportional American more 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.140
 our Russians are always generally in size 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.819
 fits 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:46.520
 I want numbers to drive, but those houses 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:50.400
 go tanks it back me left you 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.350
 look i drive up but no 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.350
 oh how to rot this wall 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.909
 above us did not move 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.890
 it's just a wall and so on 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.990
 closed space home of some kind 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.090
 the cool graphics and good gameplay without 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.280
