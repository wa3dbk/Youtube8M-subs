obviously a lot of changes all the

obviously a lot of changes all the

so<00:02:20.060> cosmetically<00:02:21.050> it's<00:02:21.200> had<00:02:21.349> a<00:02:21.380> fairly

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
so cosmetically it's had a fairly

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.220 
so cosmetically it's had a fairly
enormous<00:02:22.040> upgrade<00:02:22.599> but<00:02:23.599> I<00:02:23.690> believe<00:02:23.959> that<00:02:23.989> the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
enormous upgrade but I believe that the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.750 
enormous upgrade but I believe that the
powers<00:02:24.590> had<00:02:24.709> an<00:02:24.800> upgrade<00:02:24.950> tool<00:02:25.430> you're

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
powers had an upgrade tool you're

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.250 
powers had an upgrade tool you're
pushing<00:02:26.030> out<00:02:26.120> some<00:02:26.300> pretty<00:02:26.480> serious<00:02:26.750> numbers

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
pushing out some pretty serious numbers

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.960 
pushing out some pretty serious numbers
these<00:02:27.440> days<00:02:27.739> or<00:02:27.890> you're<00:02:28.010> pushing<00:02:28.340> big<00:02:28.640> numbers

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
these days or you're pushing big numbers

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.510 
these days or you're pushing big numbers
before<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.599> I<00:02:29.750> believe<00:02:30.470> that<00:02:30.500> war<00:02:30.860> 440<00:02:31.340> did

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
before and I believe that war 440 did

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.949 
before and I believe that war 440 did
make<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:31.760> into<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.150> eights<00:02:32.300> but<00:02:32.569> now<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:32.840> look

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
make it into the eights but now you look

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.040 
make it into the eights but now you look
at<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.290> lot<00:02:33.590> quicker<00:02:33.709> than<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.690> yeah<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.900> is

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
at it a lot quicker than that yeah it is

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.630 
at it a lot quicker than that yeah it is
look<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.470> engines<00:02:36.830> certainly<00:02:37.130> making<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.520> lot

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
look the engines certainly making a lot

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.699 
look the engines certainly making a lot
of<00:02:37.730> power<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.270> making<00:02:38.959> power<00:02:39.260> wasn't<00:02:39.560> the

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
of power and making power wasn't the

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.250 
of power and making power wasn't the
problem<00:02:40.040> for<00:02:40.220> us<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:41.150> old<00:02:41.390> combination<00:02:42.140> which

problem for us the old combination which

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
was 500 cubes like this one it might

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
with Drag Week that a lot of people

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.570 
with Drag Week that a lot of people
probably<00:03:09.440> don't<00:03:09.650> realize<00:03:09.769> though<00:03:10.250> is<00:03:10.549> that

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
probably don't realize though is that

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.789 
probably don't realize though is that
the<00:03:11.209> car<00:03:11.390> isn't<00:03:11.630> trailered<00:03:12.110> you've<00:03:12.590> got<00:03:12.739> to

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
the car isn't trailered you've got to

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.680 
the car isn't trailered you've got to
actually<00:03:13.069> tell<00:03:13.310> everything<00:03:13.610> behind<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.269> and

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
actually tell everything behind you and

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.539 
actually tell everything behind you and
you<00:03:14.870> got<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.049> race<00:03:15.170> on<00:03:15.350> radials<00:03:15.830> as<00:03:15.920> you<00:03:16.400> would

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
you got to race on radials as you would

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.190 
you got to race on radials as you would
drive<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.910> on<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.030> street<00:03:17.150> because<00:03:18.019> they<00:03:18.079> can

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
drive it on the street because they can

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.460
