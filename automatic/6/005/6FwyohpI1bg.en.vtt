located<00:00:01.380> right<00:00:01.560> beside<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:02.159> stairs<00:00:02.399> is<00:00:02.820> the

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
located right beside the stairs is the

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.660 
located right beside the stairs is the
access<00:00:03.449> panel<00:00:04.290> which<00:00:04.589> I've<00:00:04.799> removed<00:00:05.190> for<00:00:05.549> the

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
access panel which I've removed for the

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.390 
access panel which I've removed for the
back<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.779> water<00:00:06.990> heater<00:00:07.319> let's<00:00:07.950> give<00:00:08.250> you

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
back of the water heater let's give you

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.370 
back of the water heater let's give you
a<00:00:08.730> look<00:00:09.719> there<00:00:11.599> if<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:12.719> look<00:00:12.929> straight<00:00:13.139> down

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
a look there if you look straight down

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.220 
a look there if you look straight down
there<00:00:14.040> you'll<00:00:14.370> see<00:00:15.289> the<00:00:16.289> valve<00:00:16.590> bypass<00:00:17.400> valve

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
there you'll see the valve bypass valve

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.080 
there you'll see the valve bypass valve
so<00:00:19.230> if<00:00:19.380> you're<00:00:19.529> winterizing<00:00:20.010> trailer<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.029> can

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
so if you're winterizing trailer you can

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.380 
so if you're winterizing trailer you can
switch<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.380> bypass<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.180> drain<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
switch that to bypass and drain the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.009 
switch that to bypass and drain the
water<00:00:24.600> heater<00:00:26.029> over<00:00:27.029> here<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.660> see<00:00:27.869> that

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
water heater over here you can see that

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.840 
water heater over here you can see that
that<00:00:28.470> shiny<00:00:30.769> tube<00:00:31.769> going<00:00:32.070> down<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.700> coming

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
that shiny tube going down is coming

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.639 
that shiny tube going down is coming
from<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.329> furnace<00:00:33.750> which<00:00:33.960> lives<00:00:34.260> next<00:00:34.590> door

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
from the furnace which lives next door

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.970 
from the furnace which lives next door
and<00:00:35.160> down<00:00:35.940> into<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> underbelly<00:00:39.500> and<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.559> whole

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
and down into the underbelly and a whole

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.220 
and down into the underbelly and a whole
slew<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.399> electrical<00:00:42.090> wires<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:46.590> plumbing

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
slew of electrical wires and plumbing

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:57.529 
slew of electrical wires and plumbing
but<00:00:49.230> pretty<00:00:49.620> easy<00:00:49.829> access<00:00:56.120> here<00:00:57.120> I'll<00:00:57.300> show

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
but pretty easy access here I'll show

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.979 
but pretty easy access here I'll show
you<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.800> guts<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.039> refrigerator<00:00:59.989> there's

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
you the guts of the refrigerator there's

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.920 
you the guts of the refrigerator there's
an<00:01:01.109> access<00:01:01.530> panel<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> outside<00:01:04.790> and

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
an access panel on the outside and

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.550 
an access panel on the outside and
basically<00:01:06.930> no<00:01:07.500> corrosion<00:01:09.380> nothing<00:01:10.380> looks

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
basically no corrosion nothing looks

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.520 
basically no corrosion nothing looks
like<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:10.920> gotten<00:01:11.280> overly<00:01:11.670> hot<00:01:12.530> everything's

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
like it's gotten overly hot everything's

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.820 
like it's gotten overly hot everything's
been<00:01:13.830> good<00:01:14.360> in<00:01:15.360> there<00:01:15.659> every<00:01:16.229> once<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.619> while

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
been good in there every once in a while

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.890 
been good in there every once in a while
I'll<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.250> clean<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.119> out<00:01:18.390> make<00:01:18.600> sure<00:01:18.630> no

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
I'll just clean it out make sure no

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.640 
I'll just clean it out make sure no
spiders<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.590> gotten<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:19.950> there<00:01:20.330> any<00:01:21.330> debris

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
spiders have gotten in there any debris

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.120 
spiders have gotten in there any debris
that's<00:01:22.650> been<00:01:22.890> pretty<00:01:23.220> easy<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.610> maintain<00:01:23.820> and

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
that's been pretty easy to maintain and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.170 
that's been pretty easy to maintain and
here<00:01:26.130> we<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.549> water<00:01:26.790> heater<00:01:28.850> same<00:01:29.850> thing

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
here we have the water heater same thing

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.990 
here we have the water heater same thing
not<00:01:30.450> too<00:01:30.630> much<00:01:30.810> corrosion<00:01:31.170> showing<00:01:32.070> or<00:01:32.850> any

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
not too much corrosion showing or any

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.969 
not too much corrosion showing or any
overheating<00:01:33.659> or<00:01:34.520> nothing<00:01:35.520> getting<00:01:35.700> too<00:01:35.970> hot

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
overheating or nothing getting too hot

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.390 
overheating or nothing getting too hot
up<00:01:37.979> here<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:39.200> safety<00:01:40.200> release<00:01:40.619> valve

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
up here we have the safety release valve

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.300 
up here we have the safety release valve
pressure<00:01:42.030> release<00:01:42.390> valve<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.920> does<00:01:44.100> its

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
pressure release valve and it does its

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.670 
pressure release valve and it does its
job<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:45.390> pressure<00:01:45.659> builds<00:01:46.049> too<00:01:46.229> much<00:01:46.409> it'll

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
job the pressure builds too much it'll

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.289 
job the pressure builds too much it'll
drip<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.979> bit<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.310> water<00:01:47.490> down<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:50.090> right<00:01:51.090> in

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
drip a bit and water down and right in

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.080 
drip a bit and water down and right in
here<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.810> anode<00:01:52.290> had<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.950> change<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.549> once<00:01:53.880> and

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
here the anode had to change it once and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.200 
here the anode had to change it once and
in<00:01:57.090> here<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.320> access<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.310> element<00:02:00.030> I've

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
in here you can access the element I've

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.910 
in here you can access the element I've
pulled<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.630> out<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.960> cleaned<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.439> once<00:02:01.619> also

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
pulled it out and cleaned it once also

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.469 
pulled it out and cleaned it once also
if<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.070> can<00:02:05.219> see<00:02:05.250> here<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:05.880> that's<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
if you can see here but that's the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.650 
if you can see here but that's the
on/off<00:02:07.200> switch<00:02:07.619> which<00:02:08.060> I<00:02:09.060> guess<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.420> would<00:02:09.509> be

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
on/off switch which I guess it would be

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.089 
on/off switch which I guess it would be
a<00:02:09.690> little<00:02:09.989> more<00:02:10.140> convenient<00:02:10.530> if<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.009> was

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
a little more convenient if it was

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.620 
a little more convenient if it was
inside<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.760> trailer

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
inside the trailer

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.030 
inside the trailer
so<00:02:12.750> every<00:02:13.050> time<00:02:13.230> they<00:02:13.380> want<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.620> turn<00:02:13.770> the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
so every time they want to turn the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.620 
so every time they want to turn the
electric<00:02:14.400> on<00:02:14.580> or<00:02:14.790> off<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.150> have<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.330> cut<00:02:15.480> my

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
electric on or off I have to cut my

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.350 
electric on or off I have to cut my
switch<00:02:15.990> this<00:02:16.200> switch<00:02:16.260> but<00:02:16.860> that's<00:02:17.850> really<00:02:18.090> no

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
switch this switch but that's really no

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.220 
switch this switch but that's really no
big<00:02:18.570> deal<00:02:19.130> other<00:02:20.130> than<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.930> it's<00:02:21.930> worked

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
big deal other than that it's worked

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.620 
big deal other than that it's worked
great
