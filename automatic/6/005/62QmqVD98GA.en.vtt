00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.169 
those mountains I'm not entirely sure
where<00:02:07.259> I'll<00:02:07.380> end<00:02:07.560> up<00:02:07.799> or<00:02:08.399> how<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.640> get<00:02:08.849> over

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
where I'll end up or how to get over

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.330 
where I'll end up or how to get over
there<00:02:09.360> but<00:02:09.780> I'm<00:02:10.020> taking<00:02:10.530> one<00:02:10.709> step<00:02:10.860> at<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.250> time

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
there but I'm taking one step at a time

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.820 
there but I'm taking one step at a time
which<00:02:11.819> is<00:02:11.849> kind<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.900> my<00:02:13.080> philosophy<00:02:13.260> for

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
which is kind of my philosophy for

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.420 
which is kind of my philosophy for
whole<00:02:14.130> journey<00:02:14.600> I<00:02:15.600> guess<00:02:16.500> I'll<00:02:16.860> see<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.160> on

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
whole journey I guess I'll see you on

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.820 
whole journey I guess I'll see you on
the<00:02:17.520> other<00:02:17.550> side
