showcasing<00:00:23.519> basically<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.050> booster<00:00:25.050> system

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
showcasing basically a booster system

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.040 
showcasing basically a booster system
the<00:00:26.369> thing<00:00:26.580> about<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:26.939> booster<00:00:27.330> system<00:00:27.480> it's

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
the thing about this booster system it's

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.910 
the thing about this booster system it's
not<00:00:28.260> really<00:00:28.529> effective<00:00:29.070> like<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.890> you<00:00:31.890> know

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
not really effective like on a you know

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.830 
not really effective like on a you know
just<00:00:32.219> horizontal<00:00:33.000> flatland

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
just horizontal flatland

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.920 
just horizontal flatland
you<00:00:34.200> know<00:00:34.320> direction<00:00:34.920> kind<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.370> thing<00:00:35.930> where

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
you know direction kind of thing where

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.400 
you know direction kind of thing where
it<00:00:37.020> really<00:00:37.290> does<00:00:37.500> excel<00:00:37.890> though<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:39.410> fly

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
it really does excel though is on fly

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.910 
it really does excel though is on fly
guy<00:00:40.710> fly<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.820> an<00:00:42.570> incline<00:00:43.050> but<00:00:43.559> let<00:00:43.710> me<00:00:43.770> show

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
guy fly is on an incline but let me show

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.470 
guy fly is on an incline but let me show
you<00:00:43.980> basically<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> main<00:00:45.030> concept

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
you basically this is the main concept

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.450 
you basically this is the main concept
now<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.379> redstone<00:00:46.770> torches<00:00:47.100> under<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
now you have redstone torches under the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.520 
now you have redstone torches under the
powered<00:00:47.789> rails

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
powered rails

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.220 
powered rails
you're<00:00:49.530> gonna<00:00:49.649> hit<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.640> button<00:00:51.050> climb<00:00:52.050> in

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
you're gonna hit this button climb in

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.170 
you're gonna hit this button climb in
your<00:00:52.260> cart<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.340> truck<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.579> gonna<00:00:53.850> switch

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
your cart and the truck is gonna switch

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.470 
your cart and the truck is gonna switch
and<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:55.260> go<00:00:55.440> let's<00:00:56.039> see<00:00:56.250> not<00:00:56.550> really<00:00:56.879> faster

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
and you go let's see not really faster

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.799 
and you go let's see not really faster
on<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:59.030> which<00:01:00.030> sucks<00:01:00.329> because<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.660> know

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
on this which sucks because you know

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:01.849 
on this which sucks because you know
we're<00:01:00.989> trying<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.199> figure<00:01:01.260> out<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.559> way<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.680> make

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
we're trying to figure out a way to make

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.529 
we're trying to figure out a way to make
these<00:01:02.070> things<00:01:02.129> faster<00:01:02.910> now<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.059> they<00:01:03.300> nerfed

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
these things faster now that they nerfed

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.469 
these things faster now that they nerfed
them<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:04.619> where<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.489> does<00:01:05.760> really<00:01:05.939> shine<00:01:06.330> is

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
them but where this does really shine is

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.560 
them but where this does really shine is
on<00:01:06.659> an<00:01:06.840> incline<00:01:07.580> as<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.729> can<00:01:08.850> tell<00:01:09.030> there's<00:01:09.240> no

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
on an incline as you can tell there's no

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.469 
on an incline as you can tell there's no
booster<00:01:10.200> rails<00:01:10.850> but<00:01:11.850> let<00:01:11.970> me<00:01:12.060> show<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.270> what

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
booster rails but let me show you what

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.740 
booster rails but let me show you what
this<00:01:12.600> little<00:01:13.110> thing<00:01:13.409> here<00:01:13.439> does<00:01:14.180> all<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.540> is

this little thing here does all it is is

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.050 
this little thing here does all it is is
a<00:01:15.780> button<00:01:16.229> with<00:01:16.590> some<00:01:16.799> delay<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.850> you

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
a button with some delay so that you

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.609 
a button with some delay so that you
have<00:01:18.210> time<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.450> jump<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.049> cart<00:01:19.290> that's<00:01:19.680> it

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
have time to jump in the cart that's it

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.520 
have time to jump in the cart that's it
and<00:01:22.619> we<00:01:23.430> go<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.900> tell<00:01:25.080> pretty<00:01:25.259> high

and we go so you can tell pretty high

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.490 
and we go so you can tell pretty high
for<00:01:25.560> no<00:01:26.159> booster<00:01:26.610> rails<00:01:27.140> this<00:01:28.140> thing<00:01:28.380> is

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
for no booster rails this thing is

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.390 
for no booster rails this thing is
freakin<00:01:28.890> awesome<00:01:30.170> though<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.500> seems<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.979> be<00:01:32.130> in

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400

my<00:01:32.549> experience<00:01:33.060> kind<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.570> inconsistent<00:01:34.020> on

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
my experience kind of inconsistent on

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.569 
my experience kind of inconsistent on
the<00:01:36.240> height<00:01:36.420> hey<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.590> don't<00:01:37.799> know<00:01:38.040> if<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.369> really

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
the height hey I don't know if it really

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.899 
the height hey I don't know if it really
has<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.939> do<00:01:39.119> with<00:01:39.329> how<00:01:39.750> much<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.259> car<00:01:40.500> spins<00:01:41.100> or

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
has to do with how much the car spins or

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.940 
has to do with how much the car spins or
in<00:01:42.090> what<00:01:42.299> direction<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.990> spins<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:45.110> but<00:01:46.110> yeah

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
in what direction it spins in but yeah

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.410 
in what direction it spins in but yeah
there's<00:01:47.310> sounds<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.640> I've<00:01:47.729> made<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.060> may<00:01:48.360> be

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
there's sounds that I've made it may be

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.050 
there's sounds that I've made it may be
3/4<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.380> way<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:50.280> time<00:01:50.490> as<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.759> tell

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
3/4 of the way that time as you can tell

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.539 
3/4 of the way that time as you can tell
there<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.210> made<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.600> all<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.780> way<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:53.340> just

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
there I made it all the way up so just

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.700 
there I made it all the way up so just
experiment<00:01:53.909> with<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.479> bit<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.899> then<00:01:55.229> see

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
experiment with it a bit and then see

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.160 
experiment with it a bit and then see
like<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.100> time<00:01:56.540> see<00:01:57.540> what<00:01:57.570> works<00:01:57.930> for<00:01:58.049> you

guys so beyond that I'll show you you
know<00:02:01.740> just<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.100> circle<00:02:02.430> with<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.610> rails

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
know just a circle with the rails

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.050 
know just a circle with the rails
powered<00:02:03.180> rails<00:02:03.390> on<00:02:03.600> like<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.950> cross<00:02:04.950> shape<00:02:05.219> this

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
powered rails on like a cross shape this

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.529 
powered rails on like a cross shape this
is<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.570> bun<00:02:06.810> sending<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.439> on<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> delay

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
is just a bun sending this on a delay

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.050
