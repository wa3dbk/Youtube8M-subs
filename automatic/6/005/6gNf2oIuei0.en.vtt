cucumber so first of all yes I
researched<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.800> found<00:00:16.890> out<00:00:17.400> cucumber<00:00:17.910> it's

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
researched and found out cucumber it's

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.300 
researched and found out cucumber it's
actually<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> fruit<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> market<00:00:20.189> however

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
them into small slices and that's what

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.920 
them into small slices and that's what
they<00:02:44.980> look<00:02:45.160> like<00:02:45.190> right<00:02:45.700> there<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.090> then<00:02:46.570> same

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
they look like right there and then same

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.509

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
with the apples you actually have the

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.479 
with the apples you actually have the
option<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:49.330> just<00:02:49.750> leave<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.500> skin<00:02:50.830> or<00:02:51.070> you<00:02:51.310> can

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
option to just leave the skin or you can

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.370 
option to just leave the skin or you can
peel<00:02:51.700> off<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.000> skin<00:02:52.120> as<00:02:52.720> I've<00:02:52.959> said<00:02:53.170> I'm

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
peel off the skin as I've said I'm

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.380 
peel off the skin as I've said I'm
making<00:02:53.890> this<00:02:53.950> for<00:02:54.190> my<00:02:54.340> family<00:02:54.730> so<00:02:54.790> they<00:02:55.180> don't

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
making this for my family so they don't

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.620 
making this for my family so they don't
really<00:02:55.630> like<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:57.190> skin<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:58.030> apples<00:02:58.420> for<00:02:58.570> the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
really like the skin the apples for the

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.350 
really like the skin the apples for the
skin<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.560> after<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.370> I<00:03:00.580> am<00:03:00.850> also<00:03:01.120> been

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
skin so after that I am also been

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.540 
skin so after that I am also been
cutting<00:03:01.840> them<00:03:01.989> into<00:03:02.200> small<00:03:02.530> pieces<00:03:02.739> so<00:03:03.010> so

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
cutting them into small pieces so so

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.370 
cutting them into small pieces so so
that<00:03:03.730> it<00:03:03.880> will<00:03:03.970> be<00:03:04.060> easier<00:03:04.390> to<00:03:04.630> blend<00:03:05.110> on<00:03:05.290> the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
that it will be easier to blend on the

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.560 
that it will be easier to blend on the
blender<00:03:05.680> later<00:03:05.890> on<00:03:06.070> so<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.670> portion<00:03:07.060> totally

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
blender later on so the portion totally

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.720 
blender later on so the portion totally
depends<00:03:07.959> on<00:03:08.080> you<00:03:08.260> but<00:03:08.440> in<00:03:08.590> here<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:08.890> have<00:03:09.370> here
