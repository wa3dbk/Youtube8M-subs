 Hello everyone 2 20: 00: 11,382 -&gt; 00: 00: 12,650 Today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.192
 to install a few modes 

00:00:21.686 --> 00:00:24.208
 first we go to minecraft to update it 

00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:34.237
 of while we are going to extract the file that we download 

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:37.257
 the link is in the description of the video 

00:00:41.582 --> 00:00:43.974
 Now we go to the start menu and we put% appdata% 

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:52.534
 click on .minecraft and then bin 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.063
 now we open minecraft with WinRar 

00:01:17.203 --> 00:01:18.171
 we delete META-INF 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.021
 now it has the important part 

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:30.906
 this is always the same to install the modes 

00:01:30.906 --> 00:01:32.789
 we do the same as me 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.842
 we drag the files to minecraft.jar 

00:03:47.834 --> 00:03:49.504
 these three files are the fucking ones 

00:03:49.504 --> 00:03:52.922
 in almost all things there is always something more difficult 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.600
 in teletransport we go to intro_minecraft.jar 

00:03:56.663 --> 00:03:58.528
 and we drag the folder as always 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.134
 now we go to intro_resources 

00:04:12.134 --> 00:04:14.532
 and we go to resources in the .minecraft folder 

00:04:24.573 --> 00:04:26.486
 and drag the mod to the resources folder 

00:04:41.035 --> 00:04:43.151
 we do the same with TF2Sentry_v1.0.2 

00:05:36.862 --> 00:05:39.585
 we create a folder with the name of mods in .minecraft 

00:05:49.414 --> 00:05:52.589
 and we put the two files of mod PortalGun in the folder mods 

00:06:24.944 --> 00:06:27.360
 now the folder where I am drag the files 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.918
 to minecraft.jar 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.875
 all mods are already installed 

00:06:52.876 --> 00:06:56.453
