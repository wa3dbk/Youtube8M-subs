00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
it doesn't going to do it direction so

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.230 
it doesn't going to do it direction so
I'm<00:01:44.840> doing<00:01:44.960> a<00:01:45.110> curl<00:01:45.350> if<00:01:46.009> I<00:01:46.100> get<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.399> this<00:01:46.520> point

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.210 

if<00:01:50.240> I<00:01:50.360> get<00:01:50.509> to<00:01:50.630> this<00:01:50.750> point<00:01:51.020> where<00:01:51.350> my<00:01:51.500> arm<00:01:52.009> is

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
if I get to this point where my arm is

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.249 
if I get to this point where my arm is
completely<00:01:52.700> vertical<00:01:52.970> perpendicular<00:01:53.840> the

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
completely vertical perpendicular the

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:55.779 
completely vertical perpendicular the
ground<00:01:54.500> there's<00:01:54.770> no<00:01:54.920> tension<00:01:55.310> in<00:01:55.340> my<00:01:55.430> bicep

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
ground there's no tension in my bicep

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.550 
ground there's no tension in my bicep
its<00:01:56.000> tension<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.330> my<00:01:56.420> dealt<00:01:56.659> with<00:01:57.289> no<00:01:57.380> tension

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
its tension to my dealt with no tension

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.080 
its tension to my dealt with no tension
my<00:01:57.770> bicep<00:01:58.100> so<00:01:58.220> I<00:01:58.250> actually<00:01:58.399> we<00:01:58.640> need<00:01:58.789> to<00:01:58.850> stop

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
my bicep so I actually we need to stop

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.749 
my bicep so I actually we need to stop
here<00:01:59.720> so<00:02:00.440> a<00:02:00.470> lot<00:02:00.740> of<00:02:00.830> people<00:02:01.009> will<00:02:01.130> do<00:02:01.250> a<00:02:01.460> curl

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
here so a lot of people will do a curl

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.910 
here so a lot of people will do a curl
in<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.240> conical<00:02:02.810> like<00:02:02.929> this<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:03.619> I<00:02:03.710> think

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
in the conical like this and I think

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
in the conical like this and I think
they're<00:02:04.039> getting<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.280> four<00:02:04.460> range<00:02:04.580> of<00:02:04.700> motion

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
they're getting a four range of motion

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.919 
they're getting a four range of motion
or<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.060> lot<00:02:05.149> of<00:02:05.179> things<00:02:05.270> at<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.569> top<00:02:05.630> of<00:02:05.869> the

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
or a lot of things at the top of the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.029 
or a lot of things at the top of the
range<00:02:06.049> but<00:02:06.110> reality<00:02:06.560> there's<00:02:06.679> none<00:02:06.860> so<00:02:09.039> what

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
range but reality there's none so what

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.920 
range but reality there's none so what
I've<00:02:10.130> done<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.369> I've<00:02:11.180> grabbed<00:02:11.450> this<00:02:11.630> bar

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
I've done is I've grabbed this bar

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.080 
I've done is I've grabbed this bar
because<00:02:12.319> it's<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.860> most<00:02:12.950> amazing<00:02:13.730> way<00:02:13.880> that

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
because it's the most amazing way that

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.860 
because it's the most amazing way that
I've<00:02:14.180> ever<00:02:14.299> seen

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
I've ever seen

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.660 
I've ever seen
change<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.769> strength<00:02:16.100> curve<00:02:16.370> which<00:02:16.549> we

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
change the strength curve which we

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.729 
change the strength curve which we
talked<00:02:16.850> a<00:02:16.880> lot<00:02:17.120> about<00:02:17.269> getting<00:02:18.049> strong<00:02:18.530> the

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
talked a lot about getting strong the

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.350 
talked a lot about getting strong the
extremes<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.220> shrinkers<00:02:19.670> just<00:02:20.030> grab<00:02:20.209> that

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
extremes and shrinkers just grab that

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.150 
extremes and shrinkers just grab that
you<00:02:20.989> notice<00:02:21.230> it's<00:02:21.380> very<00:02:21.680> lightweight<00:02:21.950> on

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
you notice it's very lightweight on

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.100 
you notice it's very lightweight on
there<00:02:22.280> this<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:22.519> actually<00:02:22.790> really<00:02:23.000> heavy<00:02:23.209> so

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
there this is actually really heavy so

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.479 
there this is actually really heavy so
come<00:02:24.290> all<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.500> way<00:02:24.530> up<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.799> top<00:02:24.980> reach<00:02:25.310> out

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
come all the way up to the top reach out

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.770 
come all the way up to the top reach out
to<00:02:25.580> your<00:02:25.700> chest<00:02:25.940> up<00:02:26.030> nice<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.209> tall

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
to your chest up nice and tall

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.110 
to your chest up nice and tall
except<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.650> little<00:02:27.769> taller<00:02:28.040> go<00:02:28.310> all<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.940> way<00:02:28.970> up

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
except a little taller go all the way up

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.240 
except a little taller go all the way up
that's<00:02:29.600> really<00:02:29.870> still<00:02:30.319> now<00:02:30.470> because<00:02:31.070> that

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
that's really still now because that

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.130 
that's really still now because that
weight<00:02:31.609> is<00:02:31.730> so<00:02:31.850> far<00:02:32.120> away<00:02:32.180> from<00:02:32.299> this<00:02:32.630> you

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
weight is so far away from this you

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.610 
weight is so far away from this you
still<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:33.380> lot<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.590> tension<00:02:37.120> all<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.269> way<00:02:38.359> down

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
still a lot of tension all the way down

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.120 
still a lot of tension all the way down
all<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.680> way<00:02:39.859> up

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
all the way up

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.349 
all the way up
how<00:02:40.340> does<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.549> feel<00:02:40.700> when<00:02:40.850> you<00:02:40.910> need<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.060> talk

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
how does that feel when you need to talk

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.150 
how does that feel when you need to talk
keeps<00:02:41.810> getting<00:02:42.109> harder<00:02:42.260> right<00:02:42.500> yeah<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.040> you

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
keeps getting harder right yeah and you

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.620 
keeps getting harder right yeah and you
really<00:02:43.400> can't<00:02:43.760> make<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.030> easy<00:02:44.180> at<00:02:44.329> the<00:02:44.420> top

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
really can't make it easy at the top

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.699 
really can't make it easy at the top
whereas<00:02:44.900> most<00:02:45.019> people<00:02:45.109> come<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.530> top<00:02:45.680> and

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
whereas most people come to the top and

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.130 
whereas most people come to the top and
the<00:02:45.859> kind<00:02:46.040> of<00:02:46.070> reps<00:02:46.280> typically<00:02:46.970> on<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.150> Scott

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
the kind of reps typically on a Scott

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.750 
the kind of reps typically on a Scott
