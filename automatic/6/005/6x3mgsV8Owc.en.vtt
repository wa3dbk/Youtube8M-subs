want to steal your thunder but why do

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.370 
want to steal your thunder but why do
you<00:00:12.150> think<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.599> price<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:12.960> gold<00:00:13.110> might

you think that the price of gold might
go<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.590> 800<00:00:15.800> well<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:17.310> mean<00:00:17.609> it's<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.789> tough<00:00:18.000> time

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
go to 800 well I mean it's a tough time

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.700 
go to 800 well I mean it's a tough time
for<00:00:18.510> commodity<00:00:18.930> honest<00:00:19.170> like<00:00:19.380> me<00:00:19.560> at<00:00:19.650> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
for commodity honest like me at the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.410 
for commodity honest like me at the
moment<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.039> numbers<00:00:20.369> are<00:00:20.490> moving<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:20.910> far<00:00:21.150> so

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
moment the numbers are moving so far so

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.820 
moment the numbers are moving so far so
we're<00:00:21.570> really<00:00:22.020> struggling<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.560> find<00:00:22.680> a

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
we're really struggling to find a

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.920 
we're really struggling to find a
benchmark<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.369> we<00:00:23.580> can<00:00:23.730> believe<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
benchmark that we can believe in and the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.200 
benchmark that we can believe in and the
number<00:00:25.170> i<00:00:25.199> came<00:00:25.320> up<00:00:25.529> which<00:00:25.800> was<00:00:26.010> actually<00:00:26.279> 870

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
number i came up which was actually 870

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.960 
number i came up which was actually 870
is<00:00:27.269> based<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.840> marginal<00:00:28.289> cost<00:00:28.320> of

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
is based on the marginal cost of

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.959 
is based on the marginal cost of
production<00:00:29.970> for<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.929> particular<00:00:31.109> metal

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
production for that particular metal

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:34.370 
production for that particular metal
that<00:00:32.969> would<00:00:33.149> upset<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.480> lot<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.690> people<00:00:33.780> me

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
that would upset a lot of people me

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.319 
that would upset a lot of people me
talking<00:00:34.770> about<00:00:34.829> fundamentals<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.820> gold<00:00:36.059> but

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
talking about fundamentals in gold but

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.850 
talking about fundamentals in gold but
because<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> lot<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.230> people<00:00:37.530> don't<00:00:37.710> believe

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
because a lot of people don't believe

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.190 
because a lot of people don't believe
fundamentals<00:00:38.579> applied<00:00:38.910> but<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.870> sell-off

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
fundamentals applied but in a sell-off

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.810 
fundamentals applied but in a sell-off
scenario<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.340> probably<00:00:41.579> worth

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
scenario like this is probably worth

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.000 
scenario like this is probably worth
thinking<00:00:42.149> about<00:00:42.239> tom<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.530> really<00:00:43.980> all

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
thinking about tom is this really all

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.340 
thinking about tom is this really all
into<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.700> anticipation<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.660> higher<00:00:45.899> rates<00:00:46.200> I

into in anticipation of higher rates I

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.380 
into in anticipation of higher rates I
mean<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.649> seen<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.219> many<00:00:47.460> different<00:00:47.820> asset

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390

everyone's<00:01:05.220> been<00:01:05.400> thinking<00:01:05.760> about<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
everyone's been thinking about the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.560 
everyone's been thinking about the
impact<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.260> great<00:01:07.470> debt<00:01:07.830> risk<00:01:08.299> also<00:01:09.299> some

impact of the great debt risk also some

conflicts<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.200> Eastern<00:01:10.560> Europe<00:01:11.000> so<00:01:12.000> they've

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
conflicts in Eastern Europe so they've

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.179 
conflicts in Eastern Europe so they've
been<00:01:12.659> looking<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.140> reasons<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.650> stay<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
been looking for reasons to stay in the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.859 
been looking for reasons to stay in the
space<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.700> think<00:01:14.909> one<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.240> benefits

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
space and I think one of the benefits

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.050 
space and I think one of the benefits
that<00:01:15.990> Gold's<00:01:16.439> had<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:16.799> recent<00:01:16.830> months<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.640> a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
that Gold's had in recent months is a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.820 
that Gold's had in recent months is a
very<00:01:18.509> large<00:01:18.750> sell-off<00:01:19.259> across<00:01:19.590> other

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
very large sell-off across other

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.609 
very large sell-off across other
commodities<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:21.240> base<00:01:21.509> metals<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.200> oil<00:01:22.380> for

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
commodities in base metals and oil for

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.260 
commodities in base metals and oil for
example<00:01:23.040> they've<00:01:23.159> come<00:01:23.400> off<00:01:23.520> about<00:01:23.759> twenty

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
example they've come off about twenty

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.450 
example they've come off about twenty
twenty-five<00:01:24.810> percent<00:01:24.990> since<00:01:25.770> their<00:01:26.040> local

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
twenty-five percent since their local

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.910 
twenty-five percent since their local
high<00:01:26.670> back<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.030> May<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:28.500> think<00:01:28.770> some

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
high back in May and I think some

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.649 
high back in May and I think some
investors<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.579> commodities<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.240> retreated

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
investors in commodities have retreated

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.870 
investors in commodities have retreated
into<00:01:31.020> gold<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:32.040> now<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.460> we're<00:01:32.640> getting

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
into gold but now that we're getting

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.179 
into gold but now that we're getting
closer<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.600> point<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.110> an<00:01:34.619> interest<00:01:34.950> rate

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
closer to a point of an interest rate

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.740 
closer to a point of an interest rate
height<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.670> u.s.<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.180> don't<00:01:36.329> think<00:01:36.540> gold

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
height in the u.s. I don't think gold

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.810 
height in the u.s. I don't think gold
can<00:01:36.960> hold<00:01:37.170> up<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.530> much<00:01:37.650> longer<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.310> think<00:01:38.490> I

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
can hold up for much longer so I think I

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.090 
can hold up for much longer so I think I
think<00:01:39.119> there's<00:01:39.689> probably<00:01:40.290> going<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:40.979> a

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
think there's probably going to be a

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.920

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
issue or the catalyst that we've seen

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.339 
issue or the catalyst that we've seen
just<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.549> last<00:02:26.670> few<00:02:26.939> weeks<00:02:27.209> has<00:02:27.930> been<00:02:27.959> the

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
just in the last few weeks has been the

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.050 
just in the last few weeks has been the
equity<00:02:28.650> market<00:02:28.980> collapse<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.579> there's

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
equity market collapse and there's

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.550 
equity market collapse and there's
actually<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.420> crossover<00:02:30.900> between<00:02:31.200> equity

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
actually a crossover between equity

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.619 
actually a crossover between equity
markets<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.370> commodity<00:02:32.849> trades<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.390> china

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
markets and commodity trades in china

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.990 
markets and commodity trades in china
they<00:02:34.379> have<00:02:34.560> trouble<00:02:34.980> short<00:02:35.250> selling<00:02:35.640> equities

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
they have trouble short selling equities

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.990 
they have trouble short selling equities
and<00:02:36.269> so<00:02:36.690> being<00:02:37.470> commodity<00:02:37.980> rich<00:02:38.190> we've<00:02:38.790> seen

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
and so being commodity rich we've seen

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.819 
and so being commodity rich we've seen
some<00:02:39.060> evidence<00:02:40.019> that<00:02:40.140> they're<00:02:40.530> selling

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
some evidence that they're selling

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.979 
some evidence that they're selling
commodities<00:02:41.150> just<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.239> cover<00:02:42.390> losses<00:02:42.659> in

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
commodities just to cover losses in

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.110 
commodities just to cover losses in
equities<00:02:43.379> and<00:02:43.590> that's<00:02:43.739> dumping<00:02:44.220> product<00:02:44.940> in

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
equities and that's dumping product in

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.460 
equities and that's dumping product in
the<00:02:45.209> market<00:02:45.599> and<00:02:45.629> i<00:02:45.750> think<00:02:45.959> that's<00:02:46.109> one<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.379> the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
the market and i think that's one of the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.050 
the market and i think that's one of the
short-term<00:02:46.890> pressures<00:02:47.280> on<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.549> space<00:02:47.790> at<00:02:48.000> the

short-term pressures on the space at the

steel prices will come under a pressure

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.460 
steel prices will come under a pressure
there<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:18.000> there<00:03:18.660> could<00:03:18.840> be<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.989> risk<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.379> a

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
next couple of months Tom what's the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.409 
next couple of months Tom what's the
best<00:03:32.519> trade<00:03:32.790> right<00:03:33.030> now<00:03:35.060> well<00:03:36.060> it's<00:03:36.299> a

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
best trade right now well it's a

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.030 
best trade right now well it's a
defensive<00:03:36.959> one<00:03:37.109> and<00:03:37.379> there<00:03:37.500> aren't<00:03:37.739> too<00:03:38.010> many

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
defensive one and there aren't too many

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.059 
defensive one and there aren't too many
places<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.669> hide<00:03:38.970> in<00:03:39.239> commodity<00:03:39.750> world<00:03:40.069> the

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
places to hide in commodity world the

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.129 
places to hide in commodity world the
probably<00:03:41.879> the<00:03:42.000> commodities<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.569> would<00:03:42.959> be

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
probably the commodities that would be

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.849 
probably the commodities that would be
the<00:03:43.829> most<00:03:44.790> insensitive<00:03:45.690> so<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.620> current

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
the most insensitive so the current

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.500 
the most insensitive so the current
selling<00:03:47.280> pressure<00:03:47.489> would<00:03:47.699> be<00:03:47.849> the<00:03:47.970> cold<00:03:48.209> space

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
selling pressure would be the cold space

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.110 
selling pressure would be the cold space
so<00:03:49.349> thermal<00:03:49.680> coal<00:03:49.889> and<00:03:50.160> metallurgical<00:03:50.819> coal

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
so thermal coal and metallurgical coal

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.180 
so thermal coal and metallurgical coal
are<00:03:51.480> used<00:03:51.780> in<00:03:51.959> power<00:03:52.199> generation<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.919> steel

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
are used in power generation and steel

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.430 
are used in power generation and steel
production<00:03:53.489> have<00:03:54.180> been<00:03:54.389> hammered<00:03:54.810> so<00:03:55.049> hard<00:03:55.290> in

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
production have been hammered so hard in

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.659 
production have been hammered so hard in
the<00:03:55.500> last<00:03:55.709> two<00:03:55.889> or<00:03:55.919> three<00:03:56.040> years<00:03:56.340> their

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
the last two or three years their

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.970 
the last two or three years their
downsides<00:03:57.120> quite<00:03:57.419> limited<00:03:57.780> see<00:03:58.409> if<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.829> can

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
downsides quite limited see if you can

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.920 
downsides quite limited see if you can
find<00:03:59.190> an<00:03:59.430> equity<00:03:59.879> to<00:04:00.000> invest<00:04:00.329> in<00:04:00.540> there<00:04:00.720> or

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
find an equity to invest in there or

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.589 
find an equity to invest in there or
just<00:04:00.959> pick<00:04:01.290> up<00:04:01.409> coal<00:04:01.739> itself<00:04:02.329> I'd<00:04:03.329> probably

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
just pick up coal itself I'd probably

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.629 
just pick up coal itself I'd probably
recommend<00:04:03.840> thermal<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.709> that<00:04:04.829> call<00:04:05.040> alright

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
recommend thermal and that call alright

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.159 
recommend thermal and that call alright
