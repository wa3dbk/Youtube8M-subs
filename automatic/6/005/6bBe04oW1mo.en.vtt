mine<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.890> first<00:04:03.190> wash<00:04:03.489> I<00:04:03.760> use<00:04:03.970> the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
mine and the first wash I use the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.920 
mine and the first wash I use the
equivalent<00:04:04.420> of<00:04:04.900> a<00:04:05.049> 50<00:04:05.470> P<00:04:05.650> coin<00:04:05.950> so<00:04:06.820> not<00:04:07.690> that

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
equivalent of a 50 P coin so not that

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.770 
equivalent of a 50 P coin so not that
much<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.680> then<00:04:09.040> I<00:04:09.070> do<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.519> second<00:04:09.940> rinse<00:04:10.180> and

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
much and then I do the second rinse and

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.580 
much and then I do the second rinse and
I<00:04:11.080> used<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:11.769> equivalent<00:04:12.370> of<00:04:12.549> a<00:04:13.030> 20<00:04:13.570> P<00:04:13.840> :

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
I used the equivalent of a 20 P :

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.620 
I used the equivalent of a 20 P :
you<00:04:15.130> don't<00:04:15.370> need<00:04:15.580> more<00:04:15.850> than<00:04:15.910> that<00:04:16.180> I<00:04:16.239> mean<00:04:16.390> my

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
you don't need more than that I mean my

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.110 
you don't need more than that I mean my
hair<00:04:16.780> is<00:04:16.989> just<00:04:17.320> you<00:04:17.470> know<00:04:17.519> on<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:18.669> shoulder

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
hair is just you know on the shoulder

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.490 
hair is just you know on the shoulder
probably<00:04:19.510> if<00:04:19.570> you<00:04:19.660> go<00:04:19.780> wrong<00:04:20.019> your<00:04:20.200> hair<00:04:20.380> you

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
probably if you go wrong your hair you

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.710 
probably if you go wrong your hair you
would<00:04:20.680> need<00:04:20.859> a<00:04:20.890> tiny<00:04:21.400> bit<00:04:21.820> more<00:04:22.000> but<00:04:22.419> idiot

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
would need a tiny bit more but idiot

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.350 
would need a tiny bit more but idiot
tiny<00:04:22.990> and<00:04:23.349> if<00:04:24.220> it<00:04:24.400> doesn't<00:04:24.610> rather<00:04:25.000> too<00:04:25.330> much

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
tiny and if it doesn't rather too much

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.140 
tiny and if it doesn't rather too much
don't<00:04:25.930> keep<00:04:26.289> on<00:04:26.500> putting

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
don't keep on putting

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.210 
don't keep on putting
more<00:04:27.449> product<00:04:27.960> because<00:04:28.320> this<00:04:28.710> does<00:04:29.190> not

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
more product because this does not

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.790 
more product because this does not
lather<00:04:29.910> and<00:04:30.240> as<00:04:30.389> I<00:04:30.419> said<00:04:30.750> it's<00:04:31.050> a<00:04:31.139> very<00:04:31.169> good

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
lather and as I said it's a very good

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.040 
lather and as I said it's a very good
thing<00:04:32.040> because<00:04:32.460> it<00:04:33.000> means<00:04:33.150> that<00:04:33.330> it<00:04:33.900> doesn't

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
thing because it means that it doesn't

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.990 
thing because it means that it doesn't
contains<00:04:34.560> too<00:04:34.830> many<00:04:34.979> times<00:04:35.250> your<00:04:35.490> actives<00:04:35.820> and

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
contains too many times your actives and

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.969 
contains too many times your actives and
therefore<00:04:36.509> it's<00:04:36.690> an<00:04:36.810> extreme<00:04:37.229> good<00:04:37.560> quality

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
therefore it's an extreme good quality

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.920 
therefore it's an extreme good quality
Kerastase<00:04:40.979> has<00:04:41.580> got<00:04:41.820> several<00:04:42.150> lines<00:04:42.570> I<00:04:42.900> mean

actually now added these numbers what
are<00:05:12.389> these<00:05:12.570> numbers<00:05:12.750> well<00:05:13.199> basically<00:05:13.410> they

three<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.120> four<00:05:36.419> basically<00:05:36.900> is<00:05:37.530> when<00:05:38.130> you

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
three and four basically is when you

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.390 
three and four basically is when you
have<00:05:38.810> literally<00:05:39.810> you<00:05:40.349> know<00:05:40.470> colored<00:05:41.250> your

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
hair or you use a lot of tools and

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.770 
hair or you use a lot of tools and

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
basically the cuticles are really open

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.300 
basically the cuticles are really open
so<00:05:46.500> they<00:05:46.740> actually<00:05:47.039> are<00:05:48.919> make<00:05:49.919> your<00:05:50.070> hair<00:05:50.280> look

I've<00:06:19.410> not<00:06:19.590> tried<00:06:19.770> it<00:06:20.040> yet<00:06:20.220> so<00:06:20.520> I<00:06:20.550> couldn't

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
I've not tried it yet so I couldn't

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.310 
I've not tried it yet so I couldn't
comment<00:06:21.150> on<00:06:21.390> that<00:06:21.600> is<00:06:21.780> something<00:06:21.930> that<00:06:22.140> I

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
comment on that is something that I

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.110 
comment on that is something that I
would<00:06:22.380> probably<00:06:22.920> use<00:06:23.190> in<00:06:23.430> the<00:06:23.550> future<00:06:23.730> I<00:06:23.940> mean

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
would probably use in the future I mean

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.480 
would probably use in the future I mean
I<00:06:24.180> will<00:06:24.330> try<00:06:24.600> it<00:06:24.630> out<00:06:24.840> in<00:06:25.020> the<00:06:25.110> future<00:06:25.230> and<00:06:26.070> also

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
I will try it out in the future and also

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.310 
I will try it out in the future and also
they've<00:06:26.640> got<00:06:26.790> a<00:06:26.820> serum<00:06:27.240> the<00:06:27.840> problem<00:06:28.140> with<00:06:28.260> the

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
they've got a serum the problem with the

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.380 
they've got a serum the problem with the
serum<00:06:28.650> is<00:06:28.740> that<00:06:28.920> I<00:06:29.070> read<00:06:29.310> fantastic<00:06:30.000> reviews

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
serum is that I read fantastic reviews

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.900 
serum is that I read fantastic reviews
but<00:06:30.930> it's<00:06:31.620> very<00:06:31.800> expensive<00:06:32.430> I<00:06:32.520> mean<00:06:32.670> he's<00:06:32.760> only

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
but it's very expensive I mean he's only

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.050 
but it's very expensive I mean he's only
thirty<00:06:33.390> milliliters<00:06:33.630> and<00:06:34.500> it<00:06:34.830> costs<00:06:35.190> over<00:06:35.520> 25

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
thirty milliliters and it costs over 25

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.190 
thirty milliliters and it costs over 25
pounds<00:06:36.650> even<00:06:37.650> if<00:06:37.950> you<00:06:38.070> go<00:06:38.220> online<00:06:38.400> so<00:06:39.210> I<00:06:39.630> don't

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
pounds even if you go online so I don't

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.590 
pounds even if you go online so I don't
think<00:06:40.410> I<00:06:40.440> will<00:06:40.890> actually<00:06:41.430> buy<00:06:41.820> the<00:06:41.880> one<00:06:42.210> is<00:06:42.390> far

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
think I will actually buy the one is far

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.030 
think I will actually buy the one is far
too<00:06:42.720> expensive<00:06:42.960> and<00:06:43.440> I<00:06:43.530> don't<00:06:43.590> think<00:06:43.800> that

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.040 
too expensive and I don't think that

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.730 
too expensive and I don't think that
it's<00:06:44.970> reasonable<00:06:45.300> to<00:06:45.780> spend<00:06:46.170> that<00:06:46.290> amount<00:06:46.320> of

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
it's reasonable to spend that amount of

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.260 
it's reasonable to spend that amount of
money<00:06:46.920> I<00:06:47.010> mean<00:06:47.070> unless<00:06:47.430> one<00:06:47.670> day<00:06:47.850> and<00:06:48.030> I'll<00:06:48.180> go

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270 
money I mean unless one day and I'll go

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.000 
money I mean unless one day and I'll go
completely<00:06:48.570> crazy<00:06:48.900> and<00:06:49.170> I<00:06:49.410> decided<00:06:49.770> to<00:06:49.830> give

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
completely crazy and I decided to give

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.130 
completely crazy and I decided to give
it<00:06:50.040> a<00:06:50.190> go<00:06:50.340> but<00:06:51.000> I<00:06:51.570> think<00:06:51.660> that<00:06:52.560> 30<00:06:53.370> milliliters

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.140 
it a go but I think that 30 milliliters

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.320 
it a go but I think that 30 milliliters
that<00:06:55.140> the<00:06:55.470> right<00:06:55.650> price<00:06:56.010> should<00:06:56.490> be<00:06:56.550> about<00:06:56.970> 12

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
that the right price should be about 12

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.980 
that the right price should be about 12
13<00:06:57.600> pounds<00:06:58.260> 15<00:06:58.710> considering<00:06:59.490> it<00:06:59.640> but<00:06:59.670> over<00:07:00.540> 25

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
13 pounds 15 considering it but over 25

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.380 
13 pounds 15 considering it but over 25
pounds<00:07:01.320> is<00:07:01.410> absolutely<00:07:01.830> ridiculous<00:07:02.250> so<00:07:03.060> with

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:03.390 
pounds is absolutely ridiculous so with

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.300 
pounds is absolutely ridiculous so with
regards<00:07:03.750> to<00:07:03.810> this<00:07:03.960> one<00:07:04.260> definitely<00:07:04.560> a<00:07:04.950> heater

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310 
regards to this one definitely a heater

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.510 
regards to this one definitely a heater
so<00:07:05.760> if<00:07:05.880> you<00:07:06.060> got<00:07:06.270> so<00:07:06.890> brittle<00:07:07.890> hair<00:07:08.010> chemically

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
so if you got so brittle hair chemically

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.760 
so if you got so brittle hair chemically
treated<00:07:08.940> they<00:07:09.030> are<00:07:09.090> very<00:07:09.300> weak<00:07:09.540> these<00:07:10.410> we

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
treated they are very weak these we

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.950 
treated they are very weak these we
definitely<00:07:11.250> reconcile<00:07:11.760> thought<00:07:12.420> it<00:07:12.540> was<00:07:12.720> you

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 
definitely reconcile thought it was you

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.530 
definitely reconcile thought it was you
know<00:07:13.110> absolutely<00:07:13.770> waffle<00:07:14.280> but<00:07:14.940> it<00:07:15.300> does

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:15.540 
know absolutely waffle but it does

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.260 
know absolutely waffle but it does
really<00:07:15.960> work<00:07:16.230> it<00:07:16.590> helps<00:07:17.190> a<00:07:17.370> keeping<00:07:17.850> your<00:07:18.030> hair

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270 
really work it helps a keeping your hair

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.500 
really work it helps a keeping your hair
shiny<00:07:18.860> bouncing<00:07:19.860> and<00:07:20.040> also<00:07:20.640> to<00:07:20.790> reconstruct

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:21.510 
shiny bouncing and also to reconstruct

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.780 
shiny bouncing and also to reconstruct
the<00:07:21.690> fiber<00:07:21.990> of<00:07:22.320> the<00:07:22.500> hair<00:07:22.680> I'm<00:07:23.190> not<00:07:23.250> aware<00:07:23.730> of

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:23.790 
the fiber of the hair I'm not aware of

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.910 
the fiber of the hair I'm not aware of
how<00:07:24.030> it<00:07:24.210> does<00:07:24.420> it<00:07:24.630> but<00:07:24.900> it<00:07:24.960> definitely<00:07:25.710> works

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:25.920 
how it does it but it definitely works

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.120 
how it does it but it definitely works
so<00:07:26.340> a<00:07:26.640> thumbs<00:07:27.540> up<00:07:27.780> for<00:07:27.960> me<00:07:28.170> can<00:07:28.500> I<00:07:28.590> started<00:07:29.040> it

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.130 
so a thumbs up for me can I started it

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.460 
so a thumbs up for me can I started it
again<00:07:29.370> with<00:07:29.610> this<00:07:29.820> I<00:07:30.030> much<00:07:30.300> prefer<00:07:30.750> this<00:07:31.050> line

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:31.470 
again with this I much prefer this line

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.680 
again with this I much prefer this line
to<00:07:31.770> the<00:07:31.890> crystal<00:07:32.310> is<00:07:32.460> a<00:07:32.670> thing<00:07:32.940> that<00:07:32.970> is<00:07:33.180> much

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:33.690 
to the crystal is a thing that is much

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.820 
to the crystal is a thing that is much
better<00:07:33.960> of<00:07:34.590> course<00:07:34.680> if<00:07:35.160> your<00:07:35.400> hair<00:07:35.610> is<00:07:36.000> not

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:36.830 
better of course if your hair is not

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.810 
better of course if your hair is not
chemically<00:07:37.830> treated<00:07:38.220> and<00:07:38.370> you<00:07:38.430> don't<00:07:38.640> have

chemically treated and you don't have

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.430 
chemically treated and you don't have
any<00:07:38.970> problem<00:07:39.390> you<00:07:39.570> can<00:07:39.750> look<00:07:39.900> at<00:07:39.990> the<00:07:40.080> crystal

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 
any problem you can look at the crystal

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.070 
any problem you can look at the crystal
ease<00:07:40.560> shampoo<00:07:41.310> I<00:07:41.490> would<00:07:41.970> not<00:07:42.330> go<00:07:42.690> for<00:07:42.990> the

ease shampoo I would not go for the

ease shampoo I would not go for the
