00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.009
 this card is about and then of course a remake of 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.380
 popular Kate watching TV from times of Warcraft 3 is currently the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.460
 Card from the blizzard in the foal and thus on the first page 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.260
 does it live at all? 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.320
 First of all, what is Foton the CARTES Hitzfelds player in four teams 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.870
 Each team has built a base in which it has its own main building 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.750
 regularly units Spohn 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.740
 These units can be used with money for killed units from Greven or 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.780
 expand to completely new units 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.490
 so all have in the beginning Verramschen Merians but then for one 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.660
 of the three races decide and the typical already known units 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.100
 use 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.560
 In addition to the normal units, each player buys one in seven 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.340
 randomly chosen heroes and here is the trick in detail the heroes 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.560
 For the most part, these are just too laid-back skills to throw together 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.740
 we know and the mix of the main game or the campaign 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.350
 so Kerrigan can call as Ultimate in Word Excel before and if he can 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.020
 Set progress 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.560
 In addition, the heroes are all initially from Grosseto with the same weapon 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.450
 Damage can only be changed with the purchase of new weapons 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.420
 all heroes in the beginning the same attributes differences between melee 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.410
 and ranged stores are not here 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.600
 So everything becomes a bit monotonous, especially as the heroes in the later gameplay 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.770
 bless the temporal blessing very quickly and then kill and players with you 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.760
 300 and 3 MB, these are then later quite useless from the purchase 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.640
 Of course, upgrades like heroes can not be adhered to 4 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.720
 All in all, I think the map has not worked out yet, it works 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.750
 the attention to detail especially with the heroes
