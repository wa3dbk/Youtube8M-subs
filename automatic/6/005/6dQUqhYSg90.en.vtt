tons<00:05:48.189> like<00:05:48.699> the<00:05:48.819> factory<00:05:49.179> does<00:05:49.409> but<00:05:50.409> that's

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:50.589 
tons like the factory does but that's

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:52.649 
tons like the factory does but that's
okay<00:05:50.829> it's<00:05:50.979> only<00:05:51.099> a<00:05:51.219> trunk<00:05:51.519> and<00:05:51.759> the<00:05:52.329> quarters

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659 
okay it's only a trunk and the quarters

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:55.049 
okay it's only a trunk and the quarters
are<00:05:52.719> pretty<00:05:52.989> damn<00:05:53.199> wavy<00:05:53.529> too<00:05:53.739> so<00:05:54.069> they<00:05:54.879> make<00:05:55.029> a

00:05:55.049 --> 00:05:55.059 
are pretty damn wavy too so they make a

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:57.329 
are pretty damn wavy too so they make a
good<00:05:55.239> pair<00:05:55.479> of<00:05:55.769> course<00:05:56.769> you<00:05:56.889> always<00:05:57.009> have<00:05:57.219> to

00:05:57.329 --> 00:05:57.339 
good pair of course you always have to

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:59.369 
good pair of course you always have to
expect<00:05:57.729> the<00:05:57.879> unexpected<00:05:57.909> which<00:05:58.779> is<00:05:59.019> to<00:05:59.289> be

00:05:59.369 --> 00:05:59.379 
expect the unexpected which is to be

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:02.399 
expect the unexpected which is to be
expected<00:05:59.409> in<00:05:59.979> Seoul<00:06:00.309> I<00:06:00.610> guess<00:06:01.149> it's<00:06:01.409> expected

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
expected in Seoul I guess it's expected

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:04.769 
expected in Seoul I guess it's expected
but<00:06:02.679> there<00:06:03.639> is<00:06:03.759> a<00:06:03.789> lot<00:06:03.969> of<00:06:04.089> stuff<00:06:04.299> missing<00:06:04.479> that

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:04.779
