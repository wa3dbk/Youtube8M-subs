00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.560
 hello friends continuing the theme of rip tricks 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.680
 Tutorials after Fu jam, I decided to shoot 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.869
 tlt tutorial is also very easy 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.750
 basic trick in the park should be able to 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.149
 any mixer will be like that 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.250
 with the brake and without it I will 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.410
 tell by the example of more complex 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.950
 option that is, without brake 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.899
 let's get started dedicating worse 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.270
 learn how to punch ie 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.550
 jump on the rear wheel is desirable but 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.180
 not necessarily even years not an hour to jump 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.969
 on the launcher 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.340
 You can immediately go to the tackle which should 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.100
 be your first attempts see 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.579
 driving 90 degrees shifting slightly 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.620
 I will pour out 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.530
 first land just 90 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.780
 degrees on two wheels then try 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.420
 land only on the rear wheel when 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.220
 This moves the center of gravity back legs 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.260
 arms bent straight 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.590
 all the balance you control the tension 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.990
 chains meaning you need to learn how to crush 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.060
 leading foot on the pedal and here we are again 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.670
 back to punching but there is one 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.720
 secret try standing on the stern tack 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.130
 become people's deputy and then jump into it 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.350
 experiment chain tensioning forces 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.450
 I know after several attempts with you 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.090
 Everything will turn out well if you have a brake 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.750
 that balance and on the rear wheel 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.720
 drawn at times 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.970
 further combine going 90 degrees 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.610
 move you hatch we deliver back 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.270
 hold the wheel is located behind the hands 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.020
 straight legs bent to when i'm pedal 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.480
 turn the body 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.860
 inside rolling and jumping 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.900
 if everything turns out right 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.290
 try to radius naturally choose 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.480
 smaller farm that you are not so scared 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.900
 absolutely the same ride 90 degrees 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.060
 Were up we get up on ted and here most likely 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.550
 you will be afraid of me in Prague 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.830
 back to radius but you can cheat 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.450
 on cars if they visually immediately 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.950
 jump back you can just first 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.530
 the result of the case is a matter of radius 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.670
 lower the front wheel and then 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.670
 try to jump back 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.319
 the trick is very simple and you can 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.810
 learn just a few days 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.909
 if you have trouble getting up 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.159
 on ted I would recommend to train 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.790
 it's on a subcategory because of problems so that 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.249
 jump back 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.200
 then do and punch or jump with 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:44.510
 places in radius but if you can't 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.000
 control the tension of the chain then here you 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.590
 It will only practice although it may still 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.629
 parallel to master the manual 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.629
 I already took a robe about him 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.900
 such a tutorial 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.540
 who liked it do not skimp 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.400
 Like for repost general Respect 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.290
 and of course subscribe to the channel 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.690
 yu tuba and those who did not on new 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.400
 tutorials next issue yakushevich on 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.700
 still would be a mixer course young fighter 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.690
 you disassemble such a trick as a toboggan with 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.910
 you were Dima proud 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.910
 good luck in learning and bye
