00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
and a main motor the servos in there

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.630 
and a main motor the servos in there
look<00:00:27.449> like<00:00:27.660> traditional<00:00:28.260> servos<00:00:28.680> which<00:00:29.460> is

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
look like traditional servos which is

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.279 
look like traditional servos which is
kind<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.939> unique<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.269> these<00:00:30.660> smaller<00:00:31.019> micro

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
kind of unique to these smaller micro

kind of unique to these smaller micro
helis<00:00:32.059> usually<00:00:33.059> they're<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.270> linear<00:00:33.960> drives

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
helis usually they're the linear drives

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.030 
helis usually they're the linear drives
kind<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.390> open<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.870> exposed<00:00:37.350> looking<00:00:37.739> these

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
kind of open and exposed looking these

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.610 
kind of open and exposed looking these
look<00:00:38.250> like<00:00:38.520> miniature<00:00:39.239> real<00:00:39.750> servos<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.500> we

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
look like miniature real servos that we

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.660 
look like miniature real servos that we
expect<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.100> see<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.610> most<00:00:42.270> hobby<00:00:42.930> grade

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
expect to see on most hobby grade

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.549 
expect to see on most hobby grade
helicopters<00:00:44.719> so<00:00:45.719> they're<00:00:45.989> kind<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.440> unique

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
helicopters so they're kind of unique

they<00:00:46.860> look<00:00:47.010> cool<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> controller

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.869 

when<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.840> first<00:00:52.350> bought<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.070> wasn't<00:00:53.670> sure

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
when I first bought this I wasn't sure

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.139 
when I first bought this I wasn't sure
if<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:55.020> lefty<00:00:55.530> throttle<00:00:56.250> was<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.489> normal

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
if that the lefty throttle was a normal

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.709 
if that the lefty throttle was a normal
operating<00:00:57.510> throttle<00:00:59.210> for<00:01:00.210> some<00:01:00.359> reason<00:01:00.629> in

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
operating throttle for some reason in

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.369 
operating throttle for some reason in
all<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> photos<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:02.039> was<00:01:02.219> always<00:01:02.370> down<00:01:03.379> so

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
all the photos it it was always down so

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.539 
all the photos it it was always down so
I<00:01:04.409> wasn't<00:01:04.860> sure<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.309> was<00:01:05.430> just

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
I wasn't sure if it was just

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.490 
I wasn't sure if it was just
spring-loaded<00:01:06.060> or<00:01:06.270> not<00:01:06.420> but<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.320> does

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
spring-loaded or not but it is it does

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.630 
spring-loaded or not but it is it does
act<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> regular<00:01:08.310> traditional<00:01:08.520> throttle

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
act like a regular traditional throttle

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.160

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
idea of how this thing operates one

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.140 
idea of how this thing operates one
thing<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.040> note<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.519> that<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.980> fly<00:02:35.310> bar<00:02:35.610> on

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
thing to note is that the fly bar on

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.229 
thing to note is that the fly bar on
this<00:02:36.870> helicopter<00:02:38.269> does<00:02:39.269> not<00:02:39.629> seem<00:02:40.230> to

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
this helicopter does not seem to

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.070 
this helicopter does not seem to
interfere<00:02:42.239> with<00:02:44.450> most<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.629> my<00:02:45.690> flying

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
interfere with most of my flying

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.369 
interfere with most of my flying
characteristics<00:02:47.180> which<00:02:48.180> I'm<00:02:48.840> usually<00:02:49.110> pretty

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
characteristics which I'm usually pretty

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.740 
characteristics which I'm usually pretty
smooth<00:02:49.709> most<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.190> time<00:02:50.400> with<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.760> but

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
smooth most of the time with it but

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.890 
smooth most of the time with it but
occasionally<00:02:52.910> I'll<00:02:53.910> get<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.209> little<00:02:54.420> squirrely

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
occasionally I'll get a little squirrely

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.660 
occasionally I'll get a little squirrely
and<00:02:54.930> pull<00:02:55.709> back<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.220> forward<00:02:56.700> on<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:57.030> and

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
and pull back and forward on it and

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.350 
and pull back and forward on it and
surprisingly<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:01.470> fly<00:03:01.709> bar<00:03:02.060> doesn't<00:03:03.060> really

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
surprisingly the fly bar doesn't really

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.100 
surprisingly the fly bar doesn't really
give<00:03:04.050> me<00:03:04.170> any<00:03:04.200> tail<00:03:04.530> boom<00:03:04.739> strikes<00:03:05.870> unless<00:03:06.870> I'm

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
give me any tail boom strikes unless I'm

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.750 
give me any tail boom strikes unless I'm
really<00:03:08.750> really<00:03:09.750> pushing<00:03:09.989> it<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.319> its<00:03:10.470> limits

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
really really pushing it to its limits

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.630 
really really pushing it to its limits
which<00:03:11.760> is<00:03:13.010> which<00:03:14.010> is<00:03:14.040> actually<00:03:14.489> unique

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
which is which is actually unique

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.280 
which is which is actually unique
because<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.659> had<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.140> nine<00:03:16.440> Eagles<00:03:17.239> helicopter

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
because I had a nine Eagles helicopter

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.699 
because I had a nine Eagles helicopter
solo<00:03:19.290> pro<00:03:19.640> 268<00:03:20.640> or<00:03:20.909> whatever<00:03:21.269> it<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:21.620> one<00:03:22.620> of

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
solo pro 268 or whatever it is one of

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.399 
solo pro 268 or whatever it is one of
the<00:03:22.800> smaller<00:03:23.099> versions<00:03:23.610> at<00:03:23.819> this<00:03:24.180> size<00:03:24.739> and

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
the smaller versions at this size and

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.360 
the smaller versions at this size and
that<00:03:28.409> helicopter<00:03:29.099> just<00:03:29.129> seemed<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:30.590> tail<00:03:31.590> tell

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
that helicopter just seemed to tail tell

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.410 
that helicopter just seemed to tail tell
them<00:03:32.519> strike<00:03:32.819> all<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.090> time<00:03:34.280> which<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:36.239> could

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
them strike all the time which you could

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.270 
them strike all the time which you could
change<00:03:36.659> modes<00:03:36.959> from<00:03:37.140> outdoor<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.709> indoor<00:03:38.040> mode

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
change modes from outdoor to indoor mode

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.420 
change modes from outdoor to indoor mode
on<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:38.940> helicopter<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:39.629> receiver<00:03:40.049> and

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
on that helicopter on the receiver and

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.399 
on that helicopter on the receiver and
in<00:03:41.430> indoor<00:03:41.879> mode<00:03:42.120> these<00:03:42.450> servos<00:03:42.870> were<00:03:43.080> less

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
in indoor mode these servos were less

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.589 
in indoor mode these servos were less
responsive<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.250> their<00:03:44.670> throw<00:03:45.030> distance<00:03:45.209> was

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
responsive and their throw distance was

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.839 
responsive and their throw distance was
reduced<00:03:45.959> so<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:46.769> wouldn't<00:03:47.190> really<00:03:47.280> have<00:03:47.489> that

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
reduced so you wouldn't really have that

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.699 
reduced so you wouldn't really have that
issue<00:03:48.060> but<00:03:48.450> if<00:03:48.599> you<00:03:48.690> put<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:48.989> an<00:03:49.049> out<00:03:49.170> outdoor

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
issue but if you put in an out outdoor

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.920 
issue but if you put in an out outdoor
mode<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.090> would<00:03:51.239> get<00:03:51.420> tail<00:03:51.690> doing

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
mode and you would get tail doing

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:52.990 
mode and you would get tail doing
strikes<00:03:52.140> all<00:03:52.439> the<00:03:52.560> time

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
strikes all the time

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.250 
strikes all the time
it's<00:03:54.000> just<00:03:54.330> it<00:03:54.540> was<00:03:54.629> a<00:03:54.689> wild<00:03:55.140> little

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
it's just it was a wild little

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.679 
it's just it was a wild little
helicopter<00:03:55.950> this<00:03:56.670> thing's<00:03:56.939> pretty<00:03:57.180> well<00:03:57.480> put

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
helicopter this thing's pretty well put

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.830 
helicopter this thing's pretty well put
together<00:03:58.189> it<00:03:59.189> really<00:03:59.340> does<00:03:59.640> look<00:04:00.360> just<00:04:00.390> like

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
together it really does look just like

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:08.420 
together it really does look just like
the<00:04:03.500> aligned<00:04:04.500> version<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:07.010> one<00:04:08.010> thing<00:04:08.159> I<00:04:08.250> want

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
the aligned version and one thing I want

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.050 
the aligned version and one thing I want
to<00:04:08.489> note<00:04:08.730> here<00:04:09.510> is<00:04:10.310> that<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.489> Alliant<00:04:11.939> Allah

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
to note here is that the Alliant Allah

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.270 
to note here is that the Alliant Allah
copter<00:04:13.370> t-rex<00:04:14.370> 100<00:04:15.320> has<00:04:16.320> a<00:04:16.380> bell<00:04:17.250> rotor

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
copter t-rex 100 has a bell rotor

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.539 
copter t-rex 100 has a bell rotor
so<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:18.880> fly<00:04:19.030> bar<00:04:19.269> is<00:04:19.390> actually<00:04:19.720> underneath

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
so the fly bar is actually underneath

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.510 
so the fly bar is actually underneath
the<00:04:21.549> main<00:04:21.790> blades<00:04:22.090> or<00:04:22.960> as<00:04:23.320> in<00:04:23.800> this<00:04:23.980> helicopter

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
the main blades or as in this helicopter

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.650 
the main blades or as in this helicopter
it's<00:04:24.700> on<00:04:24.820> top<00:04:25.060> it's<00:04:26.040> so<00:04:27.240> but<00:04:28.240> everything<00:04:28.330> else

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
it's on top it's so but everything else

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.180 
it's on top it's so but everything else
seems<00:04:28.930> to<00:04:28.990> look<00:04:29.170> just<00:04:29.350> like<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.830> outline

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
seems to look just like the outline

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.180 
seems to look just like the outline
aside<00:04:30.910> from<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:32.230> logo<00:04:32.620> and<00:04:32.920> everything

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
aside from the the logo and everything

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.450 
aside from the the logo and everything
else<00:04:33.340> and<00:04:34.350> unless<00:04:35.350> they're<00:04:35.590> they're<00:04:36.160> using

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
else and unless they're they're using

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.690 
else and unless they're they're using
different<00:04:36.760> motors<00:04:38.040> it<00:04:39.040> kind<00:04:39.370> of<00:04:39.400> looked<00:04:39.550> just

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
different motors it kind of looked just

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.330 
different motors it kind of looked just
like<00:04:39.730> the<00:04:39.970> line<00:04:40.680> one<00:04:41.680> more<00:04:41.710> thing<00:04:42.040> I<00:04:42.100> want<00:04:42.250> to

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
like the line one more thing I want to

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.790 
like the line one more thing I want to
add<00:04:42.490> before<00:04:42.820> I<00:04:43.030> wrap<00:04:43.240> this<00:04:43.390> video<00:04:43.570> up<00:04:43.780> is<00:04:44.200> that

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
add before I wrap this video up is that

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.380 
add before I wrap this video up is that
the<00:04:46.230> the<00:04:47.230> main<00:04:47.410> motor<00:04:47.730> has<00:04:48.730> started<00:04:49.270> to

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
the the main motor has started to

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.380 
the the main motor has started to
experience<00:04:49.780> a<00:04:50.050> bushing<00:04:50.470> wear<00:04:50.650> out

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
experience a bushing wear out

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.540 
experience a bushing wear out
I've<00:04:52.390> probably<00:04:52.630> flown<00:04:53.020> it<00:04:53.169> 30<00:04:53.380> times<00:04:53.470> maybe<00:04:54.040> 40

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
I've probably flown it 30 times maybe 40

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.880 
I've probably flown it 30 times maybe 40
and<00:04:54.760> it<00:04:55.120> would<00:04:55.240> sound<00:04:55.419> really<00:04:56.169> bad<00:04:56.200> and<00:04:56.680> the

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
and it would sound really bad and the

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.280 
and it would sound really bad and the
motor<00:04:57.220> would<00:04:57.370> slow<00:04:57.640> down<00:04:57.669> and<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.750> helicopter

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
motor would slow down and the helicopter

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.409 
motor would slow down and the helicopter
would<00:04:59.410> pretty<00:04:59.530> much<00:04:59.680> fall<00:04:59.890> out<00:05:00.100> and<00:05:00.390> hit<00:05:01.390> the

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
would pretty much fall out and hit the

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.150 
would pretty much fall out and hit the
floor<00:05:02.010> so<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:04.230> my<00:05:05.230> solution<00:05:05.650> to<00:05:05.740> that<00:05:05.770> real

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
floor so the my solution to that real

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.600 
floor so the my solution to that real
quick<00:05:06.190> was<00:05:06.669> to<00:05:06.970> put<00:05:07.810> some<00:05:08.080> clipper<00:05:08.890> hair

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
quick was to put some clipper hair

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.700 
quick was to put some clipper hair
cutting<00:05:09.820> clipper<00:05:10.150> oil<00:05:10.330> down<00:05:11.200> in<00:05:11.410> the<00:05:11.530> main

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
cutting clipper oil down in the main

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.580 
cutting clipper oil down in the main
shaft<00:05:12.360> down<00:05:13.360> on<00:05:13.540> the<00:05:13.630> pinion<00:05:13.870> and<00:05:14.110> let<00:05:14.290> it<00:05:14.380> seep

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
shaft down on the pinion and let it seep

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.770 
shaft down on the pinion and let it seep
into<00:05:14.740> the<00:05:14.890> motor<00:05:15.100> and<00:05:15.430> that<00:05:15.750> alleviated<00:05:16.750> the

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
into the motor and that alleviated the

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.800 
into the motor and that alleviated the
problem<00:05:17.260> so<00:05:17.470> we'll<00:05:17.590> see<00:05:17.770> how<00:05:17.890> long<00:05:18.040> that<00:05:18.100> lasts

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
problem so we'll see how long that lasts

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.540 
problem so we'll see how long that lasts
it<00:05:19.810> should<00:05:20.290> at<00:05:20.380> least<00:05:20.500> stop<00:05:20.800> the<00:05:20.830> wearing<00:05:21.430> away

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
it should at least stop the wearing away

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.940 
it should at least stop the wearing away
of<00:05:21.760> the<00:05:21.850> bushing<00:05:22.240> I<00:05:22.470> just<00:05:23.470> don't<00:05:23.650> think<00:05:23.830> there

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
of the bushing I just don't think there

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.440 
of the bushing I just don't think there
was<00:05:24.010> enough<00:05:26.610> oil<00:05:27.610> in<00:05:27.910> there<00:05:28.060> to<00:05:28.150> begin<00:05:28.270> with

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
was enough oil in there to begin with

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.170 
was enough oil in there to begin with
her<00:05:28.750> if<00:05:29.020> any<00:05:29.229> at<00:05:29.410> all<00:05:29.560> so<00:05:30.280> it<00:05:30.669> caused<00:05:30.910> it<00:05:31.060> to

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
her if any at all so it caused it to

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.390 
her if any at all so it caused it to
wear<00:05:31.360> out<00:05:31.510> prematurely<00:05:31.750> and<00:05:32.410> that's<00:05:33.220> it

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
wear out prematurely and that's it

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.130 
wear out prematurely and that's it
that's<00:05:33.580> my<00:05:33.700> review<00:05:34.030> of<00:05:34.090> this<00:05:34.270> helicopter<00:05:34.690> so

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
that's my review of this helicopter so

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.490 
that's my review of this helicopter so
thanks<00:05:35.800> for<00:05:35.890> watching<00:05:35.950> bye
