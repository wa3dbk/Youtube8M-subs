00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.910
 So together very cool question on one 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.089
 scale from 1 to 10 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.640
 how important to you personally is to me 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.060
 the control over your insulin level 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.410
 or how important is he generally in the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.119
 Contemplation of diet and composition so on 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.710
 a scale of 1 to 10 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.559
 meanwhile I would say 2 I have 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.329
 in my diet henn both 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.200
 I'm no one who is tried 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.050
 not very dependent on the insulin game 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.910
 So I have no problems with that 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.520
 Blood sugar with the insulin level in 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.860
 things hunger 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.160
 I can though the insulin level 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.960
 I can shoot myself relatively high 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.890
 still very much together and have 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.870
 no no flash or so so i from 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.219
 my two out of ten on that ghana 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.140
 but I would not go in and 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.909
 Now do not go out sorry 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.229
 and now just the one about Swiss 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.390
 generally the consideration 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.369
 You should watch it yourself, of course 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.250
 Foods are the low 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.409
 glycemic index and thereby yes me 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.070
 tell me the insulin level 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.720
 probably not that high 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.900
 fast let now of the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.790
 Viewed carbohydrate sources that are 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.860
 of course a lot more nutritious 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.270
 that means you should of course the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.860
 micronutrients should cover 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.420
 of course, cover the fiber and 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.049
 of course you should look that you 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.970
 give you a diet a fat reduction phase 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.369
 designed as comfortable as possible when 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.049
 if that is called now 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.380
 whole grains low chemical 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.290
 that's how it is 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.149
 also the volume is mostly I take 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.009
 For example, he has vegetables now 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.890
 almost no chemical index it 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.030
 There are exceptions I know it blablabla 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.649
 but I'll just take vegetables 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.840
 low glycemic index had her 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.820
 I can eat and eat and volume 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.710
 I eat and eat as much as I can 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.079
 So someone who needs volume then 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.640
 I need vegetables much more vegetables 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.500
 when I broke out of the house for the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.450
 health 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.730
 if i need someone who needs the volume 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.590
 I can not even do that then 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.470
 work a little differently so 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.140
 Generally it is so that 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.640
 insulin level and that is actually 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.560
 simply proven in the long-term stuff 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.970
 I take no now I do not say 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.850
 proved excuse life back 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.840
 well documented that the 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:41.270
 insulin level on a fat reduction 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.739
 phase or a weight that should 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.739
 I had to say building phase now 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.600
 I did not want to call this phase 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.630
 that actually does not matter 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.070
 or just a slow one such a very 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.830
 subordinate role 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.870
 and here you can actually go 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.120
 go personal preferences 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.570
 Of course you should and it is not 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.380
 that there is no call only with high 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.860
 molecular sugars to chuck 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.790
 you should already have a healthy one 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.650
 balanced relationship and one 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.900
 build the relationship to nutrition the 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.290
 not exactly pathological is neither again 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.459
 in the in the still in it 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.790
 the abundance, so let's say it 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.489
 times 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.580
 Generally you should not on the 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.950
 insulin level but pay attention to the 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.980
 Foods pay attention to us properly 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.810
 you can take care of and a little bit 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.950
 of course the whole diet 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.950
 Of course you can also taste it
