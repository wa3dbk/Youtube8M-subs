of stuff to show you I'll just show you
this<00:01:10.170> quickly<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:11.010> slightly<00:01:11.700> different<00:01:12.210> way<00:01:12.390> of

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
this quickly a slightly different way of

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.219 
this quickly a slightly different way of
doing<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.470> bookshelf<00:01:14.070> thing<00:01:14.450> I<00:01:15.450> tried

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
doing the bookshelf thing I tried

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.480 
doing the bookshelf thing I tried
pulling<00:01:16.439> these<00:01:16.680> away<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.280> looked

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
pulling these away but it looked

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.280 
pulling these away but it looked
terrible<00:01:18.240> because<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.930> know<00:01:19.020> there<00:01:19.200> was

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
terrible because you know there was

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.760 
terrible because you know there was
nothing<00:01:19.560> behind<00:01:19.710> them<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:21.500> what<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.530> did

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
nothing behind them so what I did

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.210 
nothing behind them so what I did
instead<00:01:23.330> of<00:01:24.330> moving<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.840> bookshelves<00:01:25.290> was<00:01:26.009> to

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
instead of moving the bookshelves was to

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.510 
instead of moving the bookshelves was to
move<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.580> floor<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.860> there<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.009> see<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
move the floor and there you can see the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.780 
move the floor and there you can see the
floor<00:01:29.700> pops<00:01:30.030> up<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:32.220> interesting<00:01:32.759> thing

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
floor pops up and the interesting thing

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.100 
floor pops up and the interesting thing
with<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:35.030> if<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.270> raise<00:01:36.540> them<00:01:36.750> all<00:01:36.900> up

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
with this is if you raise them all up

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.749 
with this is if you raise them all up
you<00:01:37.500> can<00:01:37.650> see<00:01:37.799> they<00:01:37.920> come<00:01:38.130> up<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.369> two<00:01:38.549> groups

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
you can see they come up in two groups

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.569 
you can see they come up in two groups
of<00:01:38.970> four<00:01:39.350> when<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.500> raise<00:01:40.650> them<00:01:40.799> all<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.130> it

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
of four when you raise them all up it

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.030 
of four when you raise them all up it
completely<00:01:42.090> cuts<00:01:42.479> off<00:01:42.720> all<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.560> bookshelves

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
completely cuts off all the bookshelves

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.060 
completely cuts off all the bookshelves
I<00:01:44.420> think<00:01:47.329> 315<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.619> only<00:01:49.740> get<00:01:49.920> up<00:01:50.040> to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
I think 315 and you can only get up to

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.289 
I think 315 and you can only get up to
level<00:01:50.280> 5<00:01:51.020> but<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.530> take<00:01:52.680> one<00:01:52.860> away<00:01:53.299> then

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
level 5 but if you take one away then

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.950 
level 5 but if you take one away then
you<00:01:54.689> get<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:56.180> level<00:01:57.860> 15<00:01:58.860> something<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.579> that

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
you get to level 15 something like that

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.020 
you get to level 15 something like that
and<00:02:00.960> if<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.649> swap<00:02:01.890> these<00:02:02.070> two<00:02:02.130> then<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.850> get

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
and if you swap these two then you get

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.540 
and if you swap these two then you get
to<00:02:03.060> kind<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.420> level<00:02:04.219> 35<00:02:05.219> something<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.030> that

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
to kind of level 35 something like that

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.220 
to kind of level 35 something like that
so<00:02:08.550> anyways<00:02:08.850> I'll<00:02:09.060> go<00:02:09.300> into<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.630> in<00:02:10.020> more

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
so anyways I'll go into this in more

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.970 
so anyways I'll go into this in more
