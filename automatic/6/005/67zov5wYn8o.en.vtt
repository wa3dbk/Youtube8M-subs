00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
was so sad the problem is is the tree

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.560 
was so sad the problem is is the tree
that<00:02:39.710> it<00:02:39.830> was<00:02:39.980> was<00:02:40.220> called<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.580> ficus<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.180> ficus

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
that it was was called a ficus and ficus

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.300 
that it was was called a ficus and ficus
trees<00:02:41.930> have<00:02:42.260> roots<00:02:42.290> they<00:02:42.890> kind<00:02:43.130> of<00:02:43.190> go<00:02:43.280> crazy

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
trees have roots they kind of go crazy

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.240 
trees have roots they kind of go crazy
and<00:02:43.970> they<00:02:44.060> go<00:02:44.240> everywhere<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.620> roots<00:02:45.920> were

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
and they go everywhere so the roots were

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.010 
and they go everywhere so the roots were
headed<00:02:46.610> towards<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.120> side<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.780> pool

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
headed towards the side of the pool

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.340 
headed towards the side of the pool
underground<00:02:48.920> in<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.400> dirt<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:50.360> if<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.080> roots

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
underground in the dirt and if the roots

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.290 
underground in the dirt and if the roots
hit<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.770> pool<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.280> would<00:02:52.490> push<00:02:52.760> through<00:02:53.150> the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
hit the pool it would push through the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.440 
hit the pool it would push through the
pool<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.810> destroy<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.800> pool<00:02:55.040> so<00:02:55.490> we<00:02:55.760> had<00:02:56.330> to

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
pool and destroy the pool so we had to

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.750 
pool and destroy the pool so we had to
get<00:02:56.630> rid<00:02:56.840> of<00:02:56.960> it<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.380> then<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.130> trees<00:02:58.430> over

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
get rid of it and then the trees over

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.449 
get rid of it and then the trees over
here<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.360> are<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.510> M<00:02:59.930> these<00:03:00.500> are<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.800> lemon

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
here that are the M these are the lemon

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.580 
here that are the M these are the lemon
tree<00:03:01.580> and<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.030> orange<00:03:02.330> tree<00:03:02.600> those<00:03:03.080> trees<00:03:03.380> can

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
tree and the orange tree those trees can

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.290 
tree and the orange tree those trees can
stay<00:03:03.800> because<00:03:04.160> they're<00:03:04.340> deliberately<00:03:04.760> small

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
stay because they're deliberately small

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.970 
stay because they're deliberately small
they're<00:03:05.600> called<00:03:05.810> dwarf<00:03:06.110> trees<00:03:06.560> so<00:03:06.830> they're

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
they're called dwarf trees so they're

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.340 
they're called dwarf trees so they're
small<00:03:07.340> on<00:03:07.550> purpose<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:08.510> so<00:03:08.959> their<00:03:09.110> roots

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
small on purpose and so their roots

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.840 
small on purpose and so their roots
won't<00:03:09.530> hurt<00:03:09.830> anything<00:03:10.010> but<00:03:10.310> we<00:03:10.400> had<00:03:10.610> to<00:03:10.730> get
