00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
personally I think it should should be

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.529 
personally I think it should should be
coming<00:00:52.170> out<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.590> like<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.309> first<00:00:53.940> part<00:00:54.390> of

coming out in like the first part of
April<00:00:55.260> now<00:00:55.739> my<00:00:55.860> reason<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.399> thinking<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.969> is

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
April now my reason for thinking this is

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.400 
April now my reason for thinking this is
505<00:00:58.199> games<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.980> 27<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.850> March<00:01:00.390> required<00:01:01.320> to

that<00:03:01.660> it's<00:03:01.870> coming<00:03:02.110> out<00:03:02.320> in<00:03:02.470> April<00:03:03.010> light<00:03:03.310> in

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
that it's coming out in April light in

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.550 
that it's coming out in April light in
the<00:03:03.700> first<00:03:03.940> half<00:03:04.239> of<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:04.600> for<00:03:04.810> maybe<00:03:05.020> I<00:03:05.320> really

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
the first half of it for maybe I really

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.110 
the first half of it for maybe I really
hope<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.830> is<00:03:05.980> but<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.280> might<00:03:06.400> be<00:03:06.430> longer<00:03:06.700> just

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
hope it is but it might be longer just

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.020 
hope it is but it might be longer just
it<00:03:07.270> depends<00:03:07.720> on<00:03:08.040> what<00:03:09.040> basically<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.610> depends

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
it depends on what basically it depends

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.270 
it depends on what basically it depends
on<00:03:10.120> how<00:03:10.780> long<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.110> test<00:03:11.290> intakes<00:03:11.770> and<00:03:11.980> I

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
on how long the test intakes and I

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.520 
on how long the test intakes and I
assume<00:03:12.670> it's<00:03:12.880> pretty<00:03:13.120> much<00:03:13.239> finished<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.900> how

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
assume it's pretty much finished and how

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.880 
assume it's pretty much finished and how
long<00:03:14.739> it<00:03:14.920> takes<00:03:15.220> for<00:03:16.000> Sony<00:03:16.330> and<00:03:16.660> Microsoft<00:03:16.890> to

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
long it takes for Sony and Microsoft to

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.640 
long it takes for Sony and Microsoft to
certify<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.730> game<00:03:18.970> is<00:03:19.150> ok<00:03:19.600> for<00:03:20.230> us<00:03:20.350> guys

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
assume it's coming out in April but

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.810

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
there's obviously no certainty with that

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.310 
there's obviously no certainty with that
because<00:03:31.060> I<00:03:31.360> haven't<00:03:31.780> spoke<00:03:32.080> to<00:03:32.110> the
