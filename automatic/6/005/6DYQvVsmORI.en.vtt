00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.560
 hello everyone as you can see on 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:10.769
 its screens are two types of clutch 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.910
 Organic praise I did not sew you 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.300
 tardis to two hundred and fifteen millimeters and 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:21.359
 stark ceramic manufacture i.e. 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.439
 kit what is it what is this a question of 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.330
 replacing the clutch after 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:32.460
 car 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.680
 mess of the garage workhorse getting ready 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.830
 to the competition 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:46.430
 But after replacing the engine during the transition 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:46.430
 with 16 carburetor on 18 injector completed 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:55.350
 there was a question that the clutch is not 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.260
 holds if the tension was previously possible 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.530
 go even with engine 1 and clutch 6 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.589
 pulled but the engine 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.600
 corny is not pulled all the way around until now 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.680
 it turns out the engine pulls 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:15.060
 clutch slips well 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:19.260
 about 40,000 kilometers well everyday 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:25.140
 operation give so trips trips and that 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:29.010
 dirt yes so well, a brief overview of it 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.620
 let's start with ceramics from 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.910
 metal ceramics as claimed 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.560
 stark producer 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.570
 they even have the main site written 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:44.130
 in big letters that grip 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.610
 do not kill and a couple of them probably 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.460
 myths along the way along the way of exploitation under 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.420
 frontal destroy what 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.030
 cermet unsuitable for 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:00.540
 everyday operation that turns on 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:05.340
 hard works hard coffee smoothly not 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:08.369
 train but the essence of this myth probably even 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.269
 is that the whole thing goes 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:16.970
 from the fact that people simply do not understand 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.970
 that how to even say so 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:24.370
 pure sporting grip up 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.920
 also pottery goes without a damper that is 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.520
 trite if you take the same turbo basin 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.610
 I start 200 forces have a video on the Internet 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:38.440
 even a dozen trading well power is not 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.790
 We know well, obviously more than 200 forces work. 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.440
 that the clutch like I do not know 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.320
 manufacturers will not argue 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:50.180
 just dave and falling apart and everything from 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:53.570
 the fact that the fit of the disc basket 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.140
 good and defer just can't stand 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.910
 trite it twists that's why 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.220
 use for more such sports 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.970
 machines need a clutch without damper 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.190
 but then 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.730
 everyday his already definitely not a train 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.160
 Here it will be clear and the inclusion and smoothly 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.980
 no longer touch for hit the gats either 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:18.440
 not at all well here and will destroy 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.480
 myths about such a grip that it 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.910
 trite not to ride well and 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.190
 performance let's say price 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.650
 range if you take the value that is 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.530
 set currency hour within up to five 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:36.280
 thousand rubles that is, it is a disk basket and 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:40.760
 bearing and take the manufacturer stark 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.970
 zack ordered ass taiga ordered in 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:48.190
 mix ie at that time clutch 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.550
 cost 7,000 rubles 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.459
 75 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.769
 in this case is not great here 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.200
 move on to some other clutch 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.920
 and in principle there is no other one if 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.600
 take only another manufacturer and 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:07.569
 clutch stiffness probably talk about 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:10.120
 little differences so 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.170
 here let's say baskets as far as 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.439
 understandably 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.389
 must be valet itself soft 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:19.090
 clutch by the way that's what's convenient let's say 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.280
 traffic jams a lot, never get tired 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.849
 even if you take it compare to 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.509
 standard Zhigulevsk we clutch but 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:32.849
 there is sometimes a basket by itself 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:35.830
 different in that the length of the petals themselves 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.639
 shorter grip should be already 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.669
 harder 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.610
 but I think the error in 1 will be pressed to 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:46.770
 ride around 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:49.330
 well grip baskets are alike very similar 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.900
 Nu-metal is valid if there is metal 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.840
 dvoechka that at the same grip about 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.410
 probably 3 yes probably not about 3 probably 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:04.240
 millimeters self execution well thickness 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:12.820
 disks in principle are equally hard to see 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:14.710
 weighs what's there so here 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.060
 differences over principle, and probably no 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:23.440
 Well, give the rivets 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:28.449
 rivet error in height and spring 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:31.630
 stronger no well you need to consider that 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:34.389
 the clutch has already passed forty thousand what is it 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:39.630
 if the new one is hanged seen here 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:44.490
 roughly speaking but it coexist springs 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:51.240
 we bend the petals here are clear rivets 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:54.870
 riveting yes it's the same manufacturer rather 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:57.090
 pony I understand everything but here somewhere on 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.120
 dvaechka yes that's if the whole basket 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.620
 stamped out of metal two here 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:06.060
 also 2 millimeters bent everything here already 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:10.580
 rivets somewhere but lkm and hopefully 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:14.300
 probably here if you look at it like 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:17.310
 let's move on to the disks themselves the doctors will 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.819
 Unlike disk clutch well as already 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.470
 understandable and organic also flew and 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:26.400
 pathogenesis well done 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:32.509
 with the addition of fiberglass cord and 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:34.770
 there are copper bronze chips 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:35.280
 organic because epoxy 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.229
 and 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.750
 is but next so sit down 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:43.889
 element but the main thing is probably the difference 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:45.990
 even here well lining itself 2 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:48.300
 distinguishing would you put forth the thickness itself 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.699
 metal of which on which lining 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.590
 worth it is but if you take on ignite 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:54.590
 how many of them there poltorashka on their need 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:09.630
 time is over now it's about a half 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:14.400
 millimeter will be millimeter exactly a million 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:16.830
 and then there probably somewhere so say 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:21.960
 not as much as she to pick up but visually 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:27.180
 Well I do not know do not even put her on a 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:30.690
 peace 008 probably ghetto oh well and sing 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:33.120
 the difference is probably the springs themselves 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:35.659
 that is, if the rolls are worth two 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.659
 springs 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.290
 height is greater for height is greater than tayti 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.440
 springs 

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.340
 right there is one spring they already I 

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.640
 so i guess that 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:52.650
 pursed up for a tougher such 

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:58.130
 Well, let's look at the essence of operation as well 

00:07:52.650 --> 00:08:00.690
 visually the difference here is only 4 rivets 

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.410
 here is already specifically in a circle all 

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.660
 riveted 

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:06.410
 but already damper that is damper 

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:09.240
 keeps well here you see yes yes in principle 

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:11.310
 fixing up the ether goes more but in 

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:15.920
 In general, before the following inclusions we put and 

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:15.920
 we will feel right
