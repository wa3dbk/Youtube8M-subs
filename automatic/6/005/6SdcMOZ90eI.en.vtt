with when you get this loco is the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.700 
with when you get this loco is the
instructions<00:01:03.829> of<00:01:04.039> see<00:01:05.050> where<00:01:06.050> all<00:01:06.500> the

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
detailing goes body removal and I'll see

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.469 
detailing goes body removal and I'll see
how<00:01:11.930> to<00:01:11.990> fit<00:01:12.350> a<00:01:12.530> decoder<00:01:13.009> and<00:01:13.910> all<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:16.479> aside

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
how to fit a decoder and all that aside

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:18.100 
how to fit a decoder and all that aside
from<00:01:17.750> it

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
from it

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.730 
from it
now<00:01:18.440> I've<00:01:18.680> already<00:01:18.890> detailed<00:01:19.460> this<00:01:19.670> so<00:01:20.740> the

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
now I've already detailed this so the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.870 
now I've already detailed this so the
gap<00:01:22.039> of<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.310> detailing<00:01:22.670> goes<00:01:23.030> is<00:01:23.660> empty

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
gap of the detailing goes is empty

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.310 
gap of the detailing goes is empty
obviously<00:01:25.880> now<00:01:26.060> we've<00:01:26.210> got<00:01:26.390> our<00:01:26.720> very<00:01:27.080> nice

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
obviously now we've got our very nice

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.620 
obviously now we've got our very nice
foam<00:01:28.280> insert<00:01:28.700> which<00:01:28.970> helps<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.330> protect<00:01:29.479> the

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
foam insert which helps to protect the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.670 
foam insert which helps to protect the
logo<00:01:30.970> obviously<00:01:31.970> see<00:01:32.240> that<00:01:32.270> that's<00:01:33.170> where<00:01:33.590> the

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
logo obviously see that that's where the

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.560 
logo obviously see that that's where the
detailing<00:01:34.040> goes<00:01:34.340> but<00:01:34.670> this<00:01:34.909> particular<00:01:35.240> one's

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
detailing goes but this particular one's

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.609 
detailing goes but this particular one's
already<00:01:35.840> got<00:01:36.110> seat<00:01:36.229> unlock<00:01:36.590> I<00:01:36.619> say<00:01:37.299> so<00:01:38.619> let's

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
already got seat unlock I say so let's

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.890 
already got seat unlock I say so let's
take<00:01:40.189> it<00:01:40.220> out<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.549> box<00:01:40.759> and<00:01:41.090> we'll<00:01:41.930> look<00:01:42.020> at<00:01:42.200> it

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.850 

just<00:01:47.900> take<00:01:48.409> it<00:01:48.619> out<00:01:49.159> of<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.340> plastic<00:01:49.700> sleeve

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
just take it out of the plastic sleeve

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.630 
just take it out of the plastic sleeve
and<00:01:51.860> here<00:01:52.189> it<00:01:52.310> is<00:01:52.460> plus<00:01:53.270> 37<00:01:54.110> inch<00:01:54.500> low<00:01:54.950> delivery

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
and here it is plus 37 inch low delivery

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.020 
and here it is plus 37 inch low delivery
now<00:01:56.570> this<00:01:56.899> is<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.950> first<00:01:58.340> one<00:01:58.549> that<00:01:58.670> come<00:01:58.880> out

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
now this is the first one that come out

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.940 
now this is the first one that come out
as<00:01:59.360> you<00:01:59.420> can<00:01:59.540> see<00:01:59.750> here<00:01:59.990> three<00:02:00.380> seven<00:02:00.680> seven

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
as you can see here three seven seven

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.850 
as you can see here three seven seven
one<00:02:01.220> out<00:02:01.430> I<00:02:01.640> think<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.810> newer<00:02:03.380> one<00:02:03.619> that's

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
one out I think the newer one that's

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.740 
one out I think the newer one that's
recently<00:02:04.460> come<00:02:04.610> out<00:02:04.700> as<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:04.909> different<00:02:05.299> running

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
recently come out as a different running

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.060 
recently come out as a different running
number<00:02:06.250> but<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:07.460> is<00:02:07.670> absolutely<00:02:08.679> amazing<00:02:09.679> and

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
number but it is absolutely amazing and

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.550 
number but it is absolutely amazing and
it's<00:02:10.369> got<00:02:10.519> quite<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:10.790> bit<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.060> weight<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.239> it<00:02:11.560> so

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
it's got quite a bit of weight to it so

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.860 
it's got quite a bit of weight to it so
if<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.100> wanted<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:13.579> push<00:02:13.760> or<00:02:13.970> pull<00:02:14.239> it'll

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
if you wanted to push or pull it'll

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.620 
if you wanted to push or pull it'll
handle<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.320> with<00:02:15.440> ease<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.850> it's<00:02:17.269> fitted<00:02:17.600> with

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
handle it with ease and it's fitted with

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.660 
handle it with ease and it's fitted with
a<00:02:17.750> Hornby<00:02:18.110> decoder<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.920> are<00:02:19.040> eight<00:02:19.190> two<00:02:19.400> four

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
a Hornby decoder the are eight two four

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.940 
a Hornby decoder the are eight two four
nine<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:21.049> did<00:02:21.320> used<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.560> put<00:02:21.739> Batman

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
nine and I did used to put Batman

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.979 
nine and I did used to put Batman
decoders<00:02:22.610> with<00:02:22.730> slow<00:02:22.970> running<00:02:23.299> in<00:02:23.420> them<00:02:23.660> but

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
decoders with slow running in them but

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.830 
decoders with slow running in them but
I've<00:02:24.829> decided<00:02:25.640> now<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.150> I'm<00:02:26.269> going<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.600> start

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
I've decided now that I'm going to start

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.830 
I've decided now that I'm going to start
sticking<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.410> Holmby<00:02:28.090> because<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.329> keeps<00:02:29.570> it<00:02:29.750> a

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
sticking to Holmby because it keeps it a

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.259 
sticking to Holmby because it keeps it a
constant<00:02:30.290> speed<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.650> I<00:02:31.160> can<00:02:31.790> perhaps<00:02:31.940> put<00:02:32.239> a

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
constant speed and I can perhaps put a

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.420 
constant speed and I can perhaps put a
little<00:02:32.480> bit<00:02:32.660> more<00:02:32.870> weight<00:02:33.049> on<00:02:33.110> a<00:02:33.440> little<00:02:34.100> ball

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
little bit more weight on a little ball

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.080 
little bit more weight on a little ball
on<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:36.079> layout<00:02:36.380> so<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:37.400> home<00:02:37.549> B<00:02:37.669> decoders

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
on the layout so the home B decoders

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.550 
on the layout so the home B decoders
come<00:02:38.299> in<00:02:38.389> quite<00:02:38.600> useful<00:02:38.959> thoughts<00:02:39.199> or<00:02:39.410> to

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
come in quite useful thoughts or to

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.300 
come in quite useful thoughts or to
think

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
think

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.460 
think
so<00:02:41.060> without<00:02:41.450> further<00:02:41.660> ado<00:02:41.930> let's<00:02:42.170> see<00:02:42.350> what

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
so without further ado let's see what

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.250 
so without further ado let's see what
it's<00:02:42.620> got<00:02:42.770> on<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.420> I'll<00:02:44.420> suit<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.870> first<00:02:45.080> thing

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
it's got on it I'll suit the first thing

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.120 
it's got on it I'll suit the first thing
we<00:02:45.380> notice<00:02:45.770> is<00:02:45.950> it's<00:02:46.160> got<00:02:46.370> metal<00:02:47.120> handrails

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
we notice is it's got metal handrails

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.350 
we notice is it's got metal handrails
I'll<00:02:49.130> sue<00:02:49.400> for<00:02:49.430> itched<00:02:51.160> really<00:02:52.160> facts<00:02:52.400> on<00:02:53.180> the

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
I'll sue for itched really facts on the

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.199 
I'll sue for itched really facts on the
side<00:02:53.540> of<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.780> bodywork<00:02:54.490> and<00:02:55.490> that's<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.910> very

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
side of the bodywork and that's a very

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.500 
side of the bodywork and that's a very
nice<00:02:56.770> logo<00:02:57.770> I<00:02:57.980> must<00:02:58.310> say<00:02:59.230> obviously<00:03:00.230> same<00:03:00.980> here

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
nice logo I must say obviously same here

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.090 
nice logo I must say obviously same here
metal<00:03:02.510> handrails<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:03.709> all<00:03:03.860> that<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.800> think

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
metal handrails and all that and I think

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.160 
metal handrails and all that and I think
they're<00:03:07.610> different<00:03:08.090> variants<00:03:08.630> as<00:03:08.750> well<00:03:08.930> that

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
they're different variants as well that

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.960 
they're different variants as well that
was<00:03:09.319> a<00:03:09.350> 37<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:11.090> 37<00:03:11.690> five<00:03:11.959> I<00:03:12.380> think<00:03:12.650> I<00:03:13.190> might

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
was a 37 and a 37 five I think I might

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.030 
was a 37 and a 37 five I think I might
be<00:03:14.019> totally<00:03:15.019> wrong<00:03:15.200> not<00:03:15.769> very<00:03:15.890> different

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
be totally wrong not very different

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.350 
be totally wrong not very different
number<00:03:16.489> but<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:19.220> doesn't<00:03:19.489> matter<00:03:19.640> anyway<00:03:20.000> it's

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
number but it doesn't matter anyway it's

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.979 
number but it doesn't matter anyway it's
just<00:03:20.420> a<00:03:20.750> nice<00:03:21.110> local<00:03:22.420> so<00:03:23.420> let's<00:03:23.570> take<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.810> look

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
just a nice local so let's take a look

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.780 
just a nice local so let's take a look
at<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.260> front<00:03:24.470> obviously<00:03:25.160> you<00:03:25.220> can<00:03:25.400> see<00:03:25.580> here

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
at the front obviously you can see here

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.830 
at the front obviously you can see here
sprung<00:03:26.739> loaded<00:03:27.739> buffers<00:03:28.280> and<00:03:28.550> I<00:03:29.390> think<00:03:29.630> that

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
sprung loaded buffers and I think that

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.820 
sprung loaded buffers and I think that
one's<00:03:30.050> a<00:03:30.319> bit<00:03:30.470> I<00:03:31.180> don't<00:03:32.230> that's<00:03:33.230> it<00:03:33.470> it's<00:03:33.769> just

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
one's a bit I don't that's it it's just

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.890 
one's a bit I don't that's it it's just
a<00:03:34.010> bit<00:03:34.190> sticky<00:03:34.430> because<00:03:34.790> thinking<00:03:35.090> matter<00:03:35.330> add

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
a bit sticky because thinking matter add

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.470 
a bit sticky because thinking matter add
a<00:03:35.959> bit<00:03:36.140> of<00:03:36.170> glue<00:03:36.350> on<00:03:36.590> it<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:36.850> this<00:03:37.850> light<00:03:38.120> I

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
a bit of glue on it and this light I

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.729 
a bit of glue on it and this light I
think<00:03:38.750> here<00:03:39.110> lights<00:03:39.620> up<00:03:39.980> was<00:03:40.900> one<00:03:41.900> that<00:03:42.260> one<00:03:42.470> I

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
think here lights up was one that one I

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.550 
think here lights up was one that one I
can't<00:03:43.430> remember<00:03:43.640> but<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.750> it's<00:03:45.170> going<00:03:45.350> to<00:03:45.440> be

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
can't remember but the it's going to be
