00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
things I had done to this like it's a

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.580 
things I had done to this like it's a
belt-driven

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
belt-driven

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.300 
belt-driven
garage<00:00:13.590> door<00:00:13.830> opener<00:00:14.250> versus<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:15.890> like<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:17.010> chain

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.599 
garage door opener versus a like a chain
driven<00:00:17.730> or<00:00:18.210> screw<00:00:18.960> type<00:00:20.660> and<00:00:21.949> so<00:00:22.949> this<00:00:23.100> Bella

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
driven or screw type and so this Bella

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.779 
driven or screw type and so this Bella
it<00:00:24.029> was<00:00:24.150> twisting<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.920> fix<00:00:26.160> for<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.490> was

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
it was twisting and the fix for this was

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.990 
it was twisting and the fix for this was
to<00:00:26.970> get<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> like<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.580> instead<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.730> like<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
to get a like this instead of like a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.049 
to get a like this instead of like a
circle<00:00:30.480> part<00:00:31.380> right<00:00:31.560> there<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:32.850> a

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
circle part right there to have like a

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.069 
circle part right there to have like a
d-shaped

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
d-shaped

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.069 
d-shaped
and<00:00:35.010> then<00:00:35.190> like<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.550> belt<00:00:36.200> wouldn't<00:00:37.200> twist

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
and then like this belt wouldn't twist

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.520 
and then like this belt wouldn't twist
now<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.730> next<00:00:41.730> thing<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.140> was<00:00:43.290> pretty

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
now the next thing and it was pretty

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.119 
now the next thing and it was pretty
quiet<00:00:45.950> it's<00:00:46.950> like<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.219> could<00:00:47.399> get<00:00:47.550> these

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
quiet it's like you could get these

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.369 
quiet it's like you could get these
these<00:00:50.129> rollers<00:00:50.940> could<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.860> nylon<00:00:53.809> versus<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
these rollers could be nylon versus the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.080 
these rollers could be nylon versus the
metal<00:00:55.710> type<00:00:56.059> that<00:00:57.059> made<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.449> quieter<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:59.670> I

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
metal type that made it quieter and I

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.299 
metal type that made it quieter and I
had<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> problem<00:01:00.570> with<00:01:00.899> these<00:01:01.170> um<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
had a problem with these um like the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.000 
had a problem with these um like the
cable<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.090> side<00:01:03.420> was<00:01:03.719> fed<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.710> one<00:01:04.860> was

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
cable on this side was fed that one was

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.570 
cable on this side was fed that one was
okay<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.510> side<00:01:07.040> it<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.220> loose

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580

live<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.680> rattling<00:01:53.130> sound<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.119> I

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
live like a rattling sound and so I

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.050

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
them what could be done about it and

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.580 
them what could be done about it and
they<00:01:58.259> said<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.680> do<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:59.070> lift<00:02:00.030> test<00:02:00.439> and

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
then that meant that it was not balanced

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.479 
then that meant that it was not balanced
and<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:10.280> test<00:02:10.580> is<00:02:11.890> look<00:02:12.890> if<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.069> hold<00:02:13.280> it<00:02:13.370> to

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.000 
your knees and drop let it go then it
should<00:02:16.670> stay<00:02:17.000> there<00:02:17.319> if<00:02:18.319> you<00:02:18.440> hold<00:02:18.709> it<00:02:18.799> to<00:02:18.980> your

are<00:02:31.640> waste<00:02:32.470> so<00:02:33.470> I'm<00:02:33.560> gonna<00:02:33.680> get<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.069> balanced

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
are waste so I'm gonna get it balanced

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.940

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
and they say you can't balance this door

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.280 
and they say you can't balance this door
which<00:02:37.340> is<00:02:37.370> like<00:02:37.670> from<00:02:37.819> 1993<00:02:38.750> but<00:02:38.900> let<00:02:39.049> me<00:02:39.110> do

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
which is like from 1993 but let me do

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.630 
which is like from 1993 but let me do
let<00:02:40.220> me<00:02:40.250> show<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:40.760> balance<00:02:41.720> test<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:43.040> it

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
let me show you the balance test and it

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.339 
let me show you the balance test and it
also<00:02:43.760> failed<00:02:44.180> like<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.599> thing<00:02:44.930> where<00:02:45.049> you<00:02:45.140> put

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
also failed like the thing where you put

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.569 
also failed like the thing where you put
the<00:02:45.470> 2x4<00:02:46.130> down<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.760> didn't<00:02:47.599> bounce<00:02:47.720> back<00:02:48.579> let

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
the 2x4 down and didn't bounce back let

00:02:49.579 --> 00:03:30.210 
the 2x4 down and didn't bounce back let
me<00:02:49.640> I'll<00:02:49.760> do<00:02:49.910> that<00:02:50.030> too<00:02:50.239> hang<00:02:50.480> on<00:02:50.599> here<00:02:50.750> we<00:02:50.780> go

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:46.819 

just

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:04:00.160 

so<00:03:47.829> that's<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.370> box<00:03:48.610> back

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.809 

he<00:04:01.170> is<00:04:01.349> not<00:04:01.590> supposed<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.010> do<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.250> there's

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
he is not supposed to do that there's

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.539 
he is not supposed to do that there's
like<00:04:03.230> there's<00:04:04.230> an<00:04:04.349> eye<00:04:04.590> there<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.190> then<00:04:05.400> on

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
like there's an eye there and then on

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.820 
like there's an eye there and then on
the<00:04:05.670> other<00:04:06.540> side<00:04:06.870> over<00:04:07.019> there<00:04:07.260> but<00:04:07.470> you<00:04:07.590> can't

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
the other side over there but you can't

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.059 
the other side over there but you can't
see<00:04:08.010> that<00:04:08.540> it's<00:04:09.540> trucks<00:04:09.840> flash<00:04:10.230> try<00:04:11.010> to

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
see that it's trucks flash try to

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:21.990 
see that it's trucks flash try to
thicknesses<00:04:11.819> next

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:36.570 

so<00:04:23.000> maybe<00:04:23.210> she'll<00:04:23.780> do<00:04:24.050> it<00:04:24.169> with<00:04:24.350> this

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.929 

no<00:04:38.439> after<00:04:39.439> get<00:04:39.740> a<00:04:39.770> balance<00:04:40.280> may<00:04:40.490> be<00:04:40.550> able<00:04:40.819> to

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:40.939 
no after get a balance may be able to

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:45.129 
no after get a balance may be able to
pass<00:04:41.120> that<00:04:41.449> test<00:04:41.689> with<00:04:42.319> just<00:04:42.560> one<00:04:42.800> place
