have a glass bottle that I cut and I'm

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.220 
have a glass bottle that I cut and I'm
actually<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.450> have<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.719> filled<00:00:16.020> with<00:00:16.199> a

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
actually I have it filled with a

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.320 
actually I have it filled with a
solution<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.859> vinegar<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.369> salt<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.119> was

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
solution of vinegar and salt and I was

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.179 
solution of vinegar and salt and I was
doing<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.660> little<00:00:18.840> bit<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.020> electrolysis<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:20.130> a

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.080 
doing a little bit of electrolysis on a
penny<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.840> simple<00:00:22.699> experiment<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:24.000> I'm

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
penny for a simple experiment that I'm

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.349 
penny for a simple experiment that I'm
gonna<00:00:24.210> be<00:00:24.359> showing<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.779> video<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.170> soon<00:00:25.500> and

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
gonna be showing a video of soon and

this<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.099> regular<00:00:29.550> penny<00:00:29.789> these<00:00:30.060> pennies

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
this is a regular penny these pennies

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.520 
this is a regular penny these pennies
are<00:00:30.779> later<00:00:31.470> newer<00:00:32.009> pennies<00:00:32.460> they're<00:00:33.530> mostly

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
are later newer pennies they're mostly

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.410 
are later newer pennies they're mostly
zinc<00:00:34.920> with<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.280> thin<00:00:35.489> copper<00:00:35.790> coating<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
zinc with the thin copper coating on the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.959 
zinc with the thin copper coating on the
outside<00:00:36.860> this<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> new<00:00:38.309> one<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.610> hasn't

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
outside this is a new one this hasn't

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.030 
outside this is a new one this hasn't
had<00:00:39.059> any<00:00:39.300> exposure<00:00:39.660> I'm<00:00:40.230> gonna<00:00:40.410> stick<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.710> in

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
had any exposure I'm gonna stick this in

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.590 
had any exposure I'm gonna stick this in
the<00:00:41.129> solution<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.700> salt<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.120> vinegar<00:00:42.210> that's

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
the solution of salt and vinegar that's

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.420 
the solution of salt and vinegar that's
been<00:00:43.140> exposed<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.940> electrolysis<00:00:45.390> process

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
been exposed to the electrolysis process

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.529 
been exposed to the electrolysis process
I'm<00:00:47.430> gonna<00:00:47.610> keep<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.940> there<00:00:48.090> there<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.360> no

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
I'm gonna keep it there there is no

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.819 
I'm gonna keep it there there is no
current<00:00:48.780> hook<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.289> at<00:00:49.440> all<00:00:49.530> absolutely

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
current hook to this at all absolutely

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.360 
current hook to this at all absolutely
none<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.270> penny<00:00:52.129> all<00:00:53.129> by

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
none this is just the penny all by

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.819 
none this is just the penny all by
itself<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:54.030> there<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.590> see<00:00:55.739> that

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
itself in there and you can see that

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.729 
itself in there and you can see that
pretty<00:00:56.309> much<00:00:56.489> nothing<00:00:56.940> happens<00:00:57.739> actually

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
pretty much nothing happens actually

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.770 
pretty much nothing happens actually
nothing<00:00:59.010> happens<00:00:59.309> at<00:00:59.399> all

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
nothing happens at all

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.380 
nothing happens at all
now<00:01:00.829> this<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> other<00:01:02.219> penny<00:01:02.489> no<00:01:03.030> current

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
now this is the other penny no current

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.840 
now this is the other penny no current
attached<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.559> I'm<00:01:05.129> gonna<00:01:05.280> stick<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.549> in

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
attached and I'm gonna stick this in

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:27.260 
attached and I'm gonna stick this in
there<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.210> watch<00:01:06.659> what<00:01:06.869> happens

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.179 

it<00:01:27.899> looks<00:01:28.109> like<00:01:28.289> there's<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.560> current<00:01:28.770> hook<00:01:29.009> to

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
it looks like there's a current hook to

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.639 
it looks like there's a current hook to
it<00:01:29.219> when<00:01:29.399> there's<00:01:29.579> not<00:01:30.109> what<00:01:31.109> I<00:01:31.140> want<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.469> guys

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
it when there's not what I want you guys

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.380 
it when there's not what I want you guys
to<00:01:31.679> do<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> little<00:01:32.670> test<00:01:32.969> for<00:01:33.119> a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
to do this is a little test for a

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.450 
to do this is a little test for a
science<00:01:33.929> experiment<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.619> want<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.250> guys<00:01:35.399> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
science experiment I want you guys to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.910 
science experiment I want you guys to
post<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.090> comment<00:01:36.450> section<00:01:36.899> below<00:01:36.929> why

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.020 

by<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:04.710> way<00:02:04.860> here's<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.160> hint<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.640> what's<00:02:05.820> going

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
by the way here's a hint to what's going

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.450 
by the way here's a hint to what's going
on<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.810> lead<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.260> the<00:02:07.380> bottom<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.160> one<00:02:08.280> with

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
on the lead on the bottom the one with

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.090 
on the lead on the bottom the one with
the<00:02:08.550> rust<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.270> one<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.440> has<00:02:10.619> not<00:02:10.830> been

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
the rust on it is one that has not been

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.190 
the rust on it is one that has not been
set<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.520> there<00:02:11.730> with<00:02:12.060> no<00:02:12.270> current<00:02:12.540> in<00:02:12.840> with<00:02:13.110> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
set in there with no current in with the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.310 
set in there with no current in with the
penny<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.650> lead<00:02:14.580> on<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.820> top<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.990> one<00:02:16.200> right

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
penny the lead on the top this one right

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.560 
penny the lead on the top this one right
here<00:02:18.800> was<00:02:19.800> set<00:02:20.160> in<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.490> solution<00:02:20.880> just<00:02:21.360> with

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
here was set in that solution just with

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:35.710 
here was set in that solution just with
the<00:02:21.690> penny<00:02:21.900> all<00:02:22.110> by<00:02:22.260> itself<00:02:22.650> for<00:02:23.520> one<00:02:23.820> minute
