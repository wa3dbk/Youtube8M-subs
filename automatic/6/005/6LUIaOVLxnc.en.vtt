00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
all down with it what it looks like

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.590

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
is probably the best way to go ahead and

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.290 
is probably the best way to go ahead and
set<00:02:08.630> up<00:02:08.720> your<00:02:08.750> base<00:02:09.080> on<00:02:09.819> what<00:02:10.819> I<00:02:10.850> did<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.180> I

set up your base on what I did is I

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.780 
set up your base on what I did is I
section<00:02:11.780> is<00:02:11.930> in<00:02:12.110> half<00:02:12.319> braid<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.280> all<00:02:13.400> those

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
section is in half braid it all those

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.390 
section is in half braid it all those
going<00:02:14.180> down<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.690> then<00:02:15.470> from<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:15.950> top<00:02:16.220> i

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
going down and then from the top i
