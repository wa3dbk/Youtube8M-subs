00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:14.210
 Hello 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.860
 This is my new one since 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.090
 foods 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:25.700
 I'm going to test with apples today. 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:29.900
 he has 400 batches well with the five 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:35.140
 plastic trays 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.140
 in fact the dehydrator is nothing more 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:45.350
 nothing more is that one did not resist agreement 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.149
 together with a fan the heat may have 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.289
 even food can not be too high if 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.750
 Do not you cook? 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:57.230
 the purpose is to remove moisture from the 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:01.480
 Christmas fruit is a fan of the food you 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:07.610
 put it here it cost me 33 dollars 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:11.870
 came with jorge sauce to make 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.930
 right which is dehydrated meat comes 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:20.770
 also with instruction manual 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:25.480
 It is with recipes the day time to disrupt 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.480
 apples varies from six to 12 hours 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:32.570
 is very hot today we are for 30 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.650
 degrees and humidity should be high 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.890
 huh 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.290
 It rains, I believe it must. 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.830
 take a little bit for them to stay 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.830
 ready 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.070
 I liked the three apples 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.740
 I tossed some lemon into them for a 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:55.380
 another city and do not turn black 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.380
 the three apples were three bandits 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.240
 now it's telling 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.810
 how is the weather 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.810
 what is 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.200
 is dehydration with apples 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.319
 because an hour and you win 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.550
 the information already had in July 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.550
 half and intense 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:56.000
 so it was two hours and 38 minutes 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:03:03.019
 and those that I could cut more 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:07.810
 They are already good, but the 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:12.219
 still will still need 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.219
 a little longer 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:26.650
 also on box asks is to guide 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:36.989
 weigh the product before dehydration 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:40.560
 I forgot, but two-thirds are here. 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.560
 of the line 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.220
 stayed 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:52.000
 Well, I'll try the next time. 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:56.080
 cut everything fine even though so far 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:01.060
 Look, I liked two hours and one 48 hours. 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:07.030
 I'll let other a little more but 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:10.860
 in total I liked the taste and the product 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.860
 the crowded that pretty cool interesting 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.630
