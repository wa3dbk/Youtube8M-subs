00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.499
 Questions from the audience a few weeks ago I have in the series 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:24.509
 portrayed for the little Lumix tz7 with the Nikon d5100 under same 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:25.909
 Conditions tested 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:30.649
 now he is finally attacking and getting an opponent is the one 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.870
 Religious Cities you can make the cable here 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.609
 the question is natural now 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:39.249
 so the differences are so i am first judging something has been quiet 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:40.250
 has arrived 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.910
 Tips put in and that were worse than Polemik with Mikosch before 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.390
 one thought that that was not so old but never 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.050
 come call the camera would have to be poured together with the microphone 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.970
 and there are in Cologne particularly hard just under two weeks 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.750
 lasted 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.200
 and now I have her here 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.680
 he explains that now how is this with Nico Ries the sound I have now 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.299
 Just come in and I'm curious 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.130
 what they say and also the St 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.130
 Speaking of applying 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.950
 I just have the microphone rank 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.510
 which the concrete case has a soldier on car rides 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.940
 also ran 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.730
 Baumanns is already looking forward to it 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.140
 so stay to concerns but now stands on Flash instead 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.370
 the franc was ultimately the difference first let fly then 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:34.840
 write in 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.010
 here hit or kicked blog entry 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.030
 I am already very curious and have since try the setting over 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.510
 to study 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.290
 so plans the conditions 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.290
 because I currently have no additional 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.450
 and work again and we can do it 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.520
 to be worse 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.409
 St 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.830
 about 150 Albert Einstein 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.970
 Geithner asked and also about 50 citizens 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.330
 Red Fri 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.280
 it is 5 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.280
 To top up Prof before Prof 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.479
 good progress 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.789
 can be August 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.539
 connect with it 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:13.509
 more 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:14.639
 APA good 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.639
 but the easy way 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:22.759
 Unbelievable the microphone and Erlangen unfortunately we will hear 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.229
 That's how I saw the material 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:31.199
 and every onlooker herself she is glad that she is not the person herself 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.539
 The Nikon d5100 is so bad 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:38.409
 and now also in writing before buying a few individual cases 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.409
 I would have much more often especially in front of the mic 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:45.859
 England I had the feeling that it is better with the Flat setting 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.339
 she with Alcott 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:51.329
 outside I also noticed that the woman would have to be better than celebrities 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.459
 even a slight improvement 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.760
 However, I had hoped that's just Dayton louder 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.279
 He is clear to us 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:00.869
 I'm a bit disappointed 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:03.869
 before Nico sued me now it can be natural 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:07.579
 Money that I had set the other wrong 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.189
 in Haiti Chile part of our profile Sun forth 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.009
 what they think about it another may wonder what I am currently 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:16.499
 at this moment forever dispute with the Lumix tz7 and the throne 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:19.349
 actually at 11 4 percent 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:20.729
 No 1 0 defeated
