00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.529
 it was until 2008 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.350
 cleveland 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.470
 for him it's a pity that people are watching this behavior 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.930
 and nobody 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.770
 the Mexican currency 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.710
 this commercial management of creativity gentina is evaluated if you act a lot 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.930
 creativity I always value yourself when you define a budget 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.390
 if this is filmed where plan 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.210
 i was done in this last very thorough of what places you could get to use 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.790
 to be able to reproduce the digital images 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.760
 so 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.090
 port 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.130
 cheese factory and that is the port of de genova 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.920
 It is an old melgen train station, disabling the genoa 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.270
 it is clear to anyone except the plan against jamaica alberto marquez 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.270
 but the Polish goalkeeper the oil slick 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:15.079
 this all the people of italy is a 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.740
 a field I am dry with stay in tandil 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.210
 all the tentacle cross country tentacle meetings no water 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:22.709
 I made of the sea 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.789
 look good 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:26.849
 percent the interesting thing about this is to make use 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.459
 of good scenarios 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.139
 and combine them with all the technology already foresees that today we have that allows us 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:33.079
 put together this wonder 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.209
 josep pons do anything anything wherever you want 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.599
 templeton talking about a bit of family and living and living well masferrer 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.930
 always characterized by the goalkeeper's expulsion 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.189
 but this does not go so well of price a campaign that tired where by criticism 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.179
 is to do in terms of promotion in santa fe 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:53.849
 within this platform sponsorships and related to soccer in argentina 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.579
 We are like mouth sponsor juniors 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.479
 we are in negotiations with some other sponsorships of the first 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.719
 at the regional level we are spouses of the South American qualifiers 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.139
 but good to the shovel next world cup 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:13.739
 so there is a calendar during the year 2008 already started in 2007 2008 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.279
 and 2009 a well-numbered calendar of matches where Argentina will play as 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:17.949
 local 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:19.279
 and some parties 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:23.169
 very spicy as for example the visitor's match we go in June against 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.559
 Brazil, so we are putting together a series of promotions to give 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:28.069
 possibility to people 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.149
 that through its consumption can enter draws 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:32.680
 for tickets and packages 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.469
 to go to see a pass with the disabled to moderate 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:39.489
 although if you are not going to be able to see it also takes out without a local on the river 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.060
 per cent we have a series tickets that also those who put us promotions 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.659
 for Alexis with the people there can see the matches you have to be alert to that 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.760
 then I read what happened with your clear password that we are talking about 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.769
 a lot of me a style promotion 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.429
 a weak consumption 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:57.429
 consumption is growing in consideration of an assembly that has 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:00.279
 been South American abel of two digits in it 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:01.759
 2007 a year 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:03.809
 very good very interesting 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:07.719
 As I said, avoid many hands off camera when they asked me 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:09.389
 competitive scenario 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:10.379
 p 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.159
 we hold 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.239
 of mastercard that knowing that in Latin America 55 percent the 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.169
 consumption cash 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.129
 that and not another great opportunity 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:22.999
 then we are working with value offers for here 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:25.999
 people who do not have a card or have it and do not use it 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.370
 a real benefit in powerful mastercard and make your purchases a 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.630
 effective fast safe way you deserve it and you decide if you can 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.700
 provided is 5% with placenta 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.490
 I feel very sad 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.289
 the average we take in 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:42.120
 a roof 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.120
 is the average in all countries of Latin America and the Caribbean 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:48.289
 i argentina 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.289
 is within that scenario with very even numbers 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.339
 there is an educational task at home evangelist mastercard 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.289
 acea people like to use water 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.030
 to the attack that have benefited him from these symbols mastercard has since 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.839
 make 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:06.110
 some years a program 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.009
 they are called translated it would be a consumer education program 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.460
 it seems a bit presumptuous this to educate we do not want to educate 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.370
 we simply want to bring 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.059
 to consumers different ways 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:22.800
 to see additional benefits or mastercard asarco 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.690
 when we talk about education 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.280
 let's go some some 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.120
 maybe some secrets 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.339
 well why 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:32.509
 You can optimize your plot and step on the Christmas card 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.469
 wool or no security 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:35.559
 d 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:40.219
 snl the credit card is like main comfort day today 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:43.489
 we have a coverage network claiming close to 100 percent so that 

00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:44.750
 practically 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.460
 all shops have accepted mastercard 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.559
 second 

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:51.639
 the security of not carrying cash 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:55.050
 third the whole benefit platform we are like 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:58.759
 cardholders discounts without interest 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.660
 and good i 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.410
 We are constantly analyzing all this with strong support 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.809
 technological so that transactions 

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:09.729
 be in time and in form we say that 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:11.389
 we are the heart of commerce 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.059
 in trade and with intensity card 

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:17.999
 and he decides to pay for his purchase with his mastercard and that transaction has 

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:19.580
 what to do in a safe way 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.999
 fast and effective 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:24.819
 and for this we also do more and technological development for 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:27.790
 symbiosis between the countries of Latin America and 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.969
 different habits for card use 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:33.489
 efe the consumer is equal in everything once in all medicine or 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:35.240
 in spite of 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.509
 it is not equal the consumer in Chile is not a great defender in Uruguay that we cross 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:42.379
 the mountain range or we ride a ride we are in another country 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:45.319
 Consumption habits are very different 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:47.289
 There is a common profile 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:51.759
 which confirms as I said at the beginning 55% of the use of cash 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:54.309
 but in terms of the use of the credit card 

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:56.800
 It also has to do with the characteristics 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.240
 of the macroeconomics of every nine countries 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.050
 that make the credit card an instrument with different 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.389
 is with different benefits and different characteristics and ultimately the 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:11.740
 cardholders are adapting to the macroeconomic characteristics and 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.530
 use of the card of each country for which 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.610
 the answer is 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.229
 we are similar but in each country in tekax 

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:18.260
 to end 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.339
 a quartet that will happen 

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:23.899
 during this year with the issue of consumption with credit cards 

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:25.919
 the area of â€‹â€‹the neck 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:27.689
 all the variables 

00:07:27.689 --> 00:07:29.979
 I return to the macroeconomic variables because 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:33.339
 we are big dependents of what happens the economy of each country 

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:38.129
 all macroeconomic variables indicate consumption makes a growth 

00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:39.199
 sharp sharp 

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:44.229
 percent of the interior from this phenomenon of the countryside and the growth of 

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:45.610
 agricultural businesses 

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:49.960
 is becoming a very interesting chimento where more tracing 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.499
 is putting a lot of focus 

00:07:51.499 --> 00:07:54.520
 through ebay benefits through its network of banks 

00:07:55.499 --> 00:07:57.539
 so that everything indicates that 

00:07:57.539 --> 00:08:00.270
 pto continues on ascending scale 

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.210
 they make a lot of houses to scratch the program and explain all these things 

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.190
 that have to do with the card banegas offer in controversial
