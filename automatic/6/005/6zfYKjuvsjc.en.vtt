00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
you leave it for about 10 seconds you

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.920 
you leave it for about 10 seconds you
just<00:02:24.459> have<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.730> press<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.150> button<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.720> just

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
just have to press the button to just

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.820 
just have to press the button to just
wake<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.230> back<00:02:26.410> up<00:02:26.650> oh<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:29.350> I<00:02:29.470> don't<00:02:29.650> know<00:02:29.739> if

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
wake it back up oh and I don't know if

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.640 
wake it back up oh and I don't know if
that's<00:02:30.040> because<00:02:30.130> this<00:02:30.760> speed<00:02:31.569> like<00:02:31.840> shuts

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
that's because this speed like shuts

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.830 
that's because this speed like shuts
down<00:02:32.860> like<00:02:33.250> after<00:02:33.430> 10<00:02:33.700> seconds<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.420> probably

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
down like after 10 seconds it probably

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.890 
down like after 10 seconds it probably
is<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.350> speed<00:02:35.620> like<00:02:35.830> this<00:02:36.010> causing<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:36.550> but

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
is the speed like this causing it but

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.760 
is the speed like this causing it but
that's<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.050> only<00:02:38.110> thing<00:02:38.319> i<00:02:38.410> don't<00:02:38.470> like<00:02:38.680> about

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
that's the only thing i don't like about

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.430 
that's the only thing i don't like about
it<00:02:39.010> besides<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.540> has<00:02:40.690> pretty<00:02:40.870> good<00:02:41.140> range

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
it besides that it has pretty good range
