there put three in first just see how
caramelized<00:02:09.920> they<00:02:10.099> get<00:02:10.310> so<00:02:10.610> you're<00:02:11.330> going<00:02:11.420> to

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
caramelized they get so you're going to

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.160 
caramelized they get so you're going to
really<00:02:12.349> stir<00:02:12.709> it<00:02:12.890> in<00:02:13.099> and<00:02:13.370> bubble<00:02:13.610> it<00:02:13.670> through

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
really stir it in and bubble it through

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.780 
really stir it in and bubble it through
and<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:15.319> can<00:02:15.500> see<00:02:15.739> that<00:02:15.769> sugars<00:02:16.400> really

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
and you can see that sugars really

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.240 
and you can see that sugars really
thicken<00:02:17.360> up<00:02:17.510> that<00:02:17.569> dark<00:02:18.050> soy<00:02:18.319> sauce<00:02:18.349> this<00:02:18.950> it's

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
thicken up that dark soy sauce this it's

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.180 
thicken up that dark soy sauce this it's
quite<00:02:19.430> caramel<00:02:20.090> like<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.569> see<00:02:20.720> that<00:02:20.900> yeah<00:02:21.860> and

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
quite caramel like you see that yeah and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.250 
quite caramel like you see that yeah and
I<00:02:22.700> think<00:02:22.760> three<00:02:23.180> tablespoons<00:02:23.780> is<00:02:23.900> absolutely

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260
