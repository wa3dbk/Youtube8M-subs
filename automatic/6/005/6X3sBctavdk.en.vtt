00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.180
 Hi there, this video on the site mean 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.580
 cancer we are now at the presentation 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.200
 early they told about their line 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.509
 commercial vehicles which by the way 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.540
 already for 17 years is 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.730
 the leader in Europe ranks first 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.949
 there are masters here there are docker and 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.050
 but we all saw our interest 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.150
 chained to new traffic which 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.920
 pretty much changed from the front 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.960
 and generally a lot of things and under the hood and 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.449
 salon new let's watch our friend 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.929
 and partner store 130 is all for your 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.090
 auto 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.840
 front car acquired habitual 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.790
 features of the manufacturer as you know 2012 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.710
 years the style has changed quite a lot here 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.480
 such a grille and a big icon 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.969
 he is present today in all 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.430
 brand cars unlike passenger cars 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.739
 wheelbarrows here this thing lattice 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.780
 radiator she is not glossy matt well 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.379
 of course it will be convenient for practical 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.120
 overall looks pretty fresh and 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.309
 completely different from the previous one 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.660
 generation is a large windshield I 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.920
 I don't know, by the way, she is no more than 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.019
 previous versions you said that she 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.670
 very large probably still more 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.070
 profile as you can see visually features 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.409
 but one is very large 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.689
 the difference here is gone hump like u 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.610
 Boeing 747 of course for those who want 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.530
 Allegri him do only have aircraft 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.090
 this is a minus but nevertheless here he became 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.909
 somehow probably more concise and 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.150
 familiar to the ordinary human 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.659
 eyes otherwise here plus minus everything 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.939
 it does not look like it has preserved features 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.250
 successive world here this bevel glass 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.320
 but you see glass is now narrowed to 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.030
 In the end, there is still a difference. 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.579
 you can not say about the back as you can see 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.070
 back if you are not straight yary lover though 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.170
 I donâ€™t even know that lovers will distinguish the old 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.810
 version from new here everything is very strong 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.009
 Unlike the previous generation Well 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.729
 let's now about myself interesting what 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.180
 changed under the hood cool with us 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.369
 here is automatic opening and nothing 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.350
 there is actually just the engine 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.700
 compactly placed and it is below 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.219
 engine range submitted 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.469
 Ukraine consists of two 1 and 6 liter 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.780
 turbodiesel hey one of them power 115 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.580
 horsepower from one turbine second this 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.450
 140 strong twin turbo with two turbines 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.550
 running consecutive 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.470
 on spins the engine 2 picks up 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.470
 thanks to which we managed to avoid turbo lag 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.170
 I'm not in the cabin right now 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.060
 cool picking because next 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.800
 there is a car here and media nav is 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.190
 but nevertheless , even here there is something 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.440
 see the example immediately have usb me 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.900
 Very pleased with the natural number of niches 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.520
 there is also a length not so special 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.250
 By the way in Kangoo this topic was similar 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.590
 there are niches where all sorts of magazines 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.160
 boxes and if you lay down on ordinary 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.080
 cars 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.390
 you throw them all over the cabin 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.190
 soaring here is a septum in general 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.170
 everything is thought out very cool here even 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.820
 if you put some pens then they 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.040
 will not fly because firstly 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.350
 there is such a soft-touch surface 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.050
 rim and there are also grooved there are such 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.570
 generally very thoughtful in terms of 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.090
 commerce there is a cup holder here there is 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.800
 cup holder there is cup holder here 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.780
 if i look here here too 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.780
 that that is not there probably not too 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.690
 niche one more in the glove box here the glove box 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.410
 here and nifiga yourself deep here 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.800
 niche there is a niche armrest in this version 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.650
 no, but there is no 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.380
 but there really are two seats 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.200
 speaking about the salon version there are with five 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.900
 eight seats with eight this when 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.970
 rear two rows on the front row only 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.820
 driver 's seat passenger separately 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.470
 a small tunnel like this here two 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.860
 there is no choice pass I would say hardly 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.540
 armrest and this version is 9 seats 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.480
 when there are two people next to the driver 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.050
 sit down and back two more rows of three 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.100
 places there is a media system where yusbi split 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.290
 here and on the most 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.820
 rather radio tape recorder on the radio tape recorder itself 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.720
 immediately bluetooth mp3 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:03.120
 there is also here and there away well to 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.550
 example if you need to charge the phone 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.910
 changed tidy earlier if you 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.380
 remember she was so full width 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.710
 now it is more like an ordinary 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.980
 passenger car and what's cool 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.420
 speedometer now i'm ethereal that is he in 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.700
 him tsiferki will always tour there 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.640
 here instead of arrows and arrows 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.360
 there were only a tachometer and level 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.970
 fuel 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.240
 road holding system all here 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.910
 there is an adjustment of mirrors by the way mirrors 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.370
 pay attention with two distorted 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.320
 zones you see it that under the machine 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.150
 Claire if you on this tells us 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.380
 cars park and poles somewhere 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.360
 you will see what's under the car 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.770
 occurs naturally lateral zones 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.430
 to get rid of dead zones 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.800
 powered one of them 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.020
 impulsive driver's passenger too 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.500
 there is a regulator and 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.810
 such massive doors are really massive 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.580
 but for such days and loops 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.530
 appropriate so this whole thing is not 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.050
 they began to stagger enormously over time 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.750
 on the second and third row it is conveniently a lot 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.060
 places and happy here and there have airflow 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.860
 You can change the number of temperature 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.110
 air supplied to you and you can 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.180
 regulate it flows very cool well and 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.280
 that generally there is a trump airflow pier and 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.770
 two steps one lower for the third 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.530
 rows one taller for the second row goes and 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.450
 right and left and forward picking 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.400
 there will be different examples and that is the median 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.170
 but abdullah is absent ie it is 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.300
 version slightly by available well and 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.090
 of course the trunk is huge here 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.370
 even taking into account the 3 rows of seats 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.850
 the minimum is a thousand 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.190
 800 liters and maximum 4000 liters 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.960
 just bomb loading height like 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.300
 see a little this one is very important for 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.460
 convenience of loading cargo immediately there is 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.310
 such an easy to clean mat 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.340
 true enough you can't but wash it easily 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.200
 and also accessories you can afford 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.120
 to weight this thing and not to the omentum either 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.160
 spa salon by the way there are a lot of accessories 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.690
 Presented several sets can 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.850
 the world and the roof of the roof 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.160
 put with a ladder well and a bunch of pile 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:08.240
 any organizer nets and so on then 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.240
 there is a big choice 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.650
 we looked at new reno traffic which 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.030
 from this day presented in Ukraine 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.560
