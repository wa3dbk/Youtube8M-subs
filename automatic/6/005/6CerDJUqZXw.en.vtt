00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:13.749
 we will see here how the evolution of drawing took place to get to the 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.859
 standardization for use in projects 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.890
 drawing is one of the most widespread forms of communication in 

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:23.759
 humanity 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.939
 and through them and from there that event are transmitted 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.769
 how does it draw technician this is not different 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.670
 however in this case or those of rules it is necessary 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.110
 as we saw in the introduction of the school drawing it 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.340
 of limit thus transmit 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.530
 knowledge facts 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.580
 keiko will occur during history as we can see here 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.450
 This is you, a whole rock painting. 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.500
 of the caves of lascaux 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.199
 where we can visualize what something like a delayed 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.190
 at that time the primordial at the time 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.160
 so here we have the case of the broadcasting drawing 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.310
 a fact that occurred 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.990
 in prehistory 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.430
 already in this other painting here 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.930
 we visualize 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.800
 in fact going on in the woods 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.870
 1 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.390
 with the command of the selection something like this 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.880
 The complaint also 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.880
 greater detail of scenes 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.210
 internal massacre 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.619
 is not considered a technical drawing here 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.230
 in this more classic style of painting 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.630
 the handout will vary greatly 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.030
 from one painter to another from designer to another 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.100
 because each one 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.280
 will have 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.280
 the way you work your style 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.170
 can give the brushstrokes 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.950
 create a work of art like this 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.160
 but 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.740
 in a moment some people started to be creating drawings 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.509
 to represent machines 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.789
 how can we visualize 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.269
 in this estimation that the drawing here 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:14.609
 a machine 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.949
 developed by leonardo da vinci 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:19.189
 the kinas 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.040
 we would have 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.529
 almost a prototype of a 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:24.840
 helicopter we have today 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.250
 but with a different shape from the series c week mc helical here in the case and 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.609
 it does not pass like we do today 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:37.899
 here is where we start to visualize some of the technical drawing 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.520
 or more intended 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.610
 for projects are they architectural mechanics and so on 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.579
 so here we have some 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:49.849
 drawing 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.009
 dida 20 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:53.940
 finally today 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.940
 we find the technical drawing 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.229
 where we have smaller but 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.579
 which react to the way in which this technical drawing 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:05.419
 created 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:08.999
 here we see standards for 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:11.329
 mentor code 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.429
 the agency 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:17.359
 excuse refuge the word physical state of health 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.049
 dimension of good bag campaigns 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:23.829
 this until the technical drawing 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.139
 where we have 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.499
 all this part of 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:31.299
 standards 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.879
 thanks to these norms that a drawing can be understood both here in the 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:36.869
 Brazil 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:40.079
 how there in the united states germany 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:45.179
 why they end up becoming punishable silas will not change from one 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.899
 to another as it occurs in a classic painting that we have seen more saline 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:51.919
 start 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:52.959
 at where 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.209
 the experience of the painter 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.449
 the emotions that he was influenced in the final result of his art in the drawing 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.099
 technician does not have it 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.919
 are the technical rules that will govern how I'm going to draw a piece 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:08.380
 amy 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.779
 mechanical assembly 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:12.159
 a house 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.729
 and in this class we saw a little of the evolution of the drawing until the drawing 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.930
 parade cap of prehistory where 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.360
 the cave paintings deal with so they treated me 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.930
 report facts that have happened married 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.430
 events 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.569
 to me 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:34.210
 migration of animals 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.470
 until the classic paintings 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.770
 through the first designs qui mechanical sets with the drawings of 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.059
 leonardo da vinci 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:45.340
 until we get to what we have today 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.340
 which is the technical drawing that the visit governed by norms 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.840
 and is not influenced by violence 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.430
 of the designer 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.800
 in fact yes it is of the essence it has been closed because 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.690
 as we work with technical drawing 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.300
 the beach designer automatically 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.219
 improving more 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:09.080
 in a particular project type for example 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.919
 but the yacht 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.560
 people will always follow 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.249
 a technical standard 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:15.770
 and never 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.319
 the intuition 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:19.659
 the removal 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:21.509
 designer gift 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.509
 the project in question technical drawing 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:27.520
 could it be said that it is something more hurt 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.289
 ah 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:30.549
 governed by laws
