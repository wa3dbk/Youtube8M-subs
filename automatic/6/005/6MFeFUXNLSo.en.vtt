00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
in music I don't live in some kind of a

cultural ivory tower
I<00:01:44.600> consider<00:01:45.409> myself<00:01:45.679> someone<00:01:46.429> of<00:01:46.789> this<00:01:47.270> time

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
I consider myself someone of this time

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:51.459 
I consider myself someone of this time
in<00:01:48.020> age<00:01:48.289> so<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:49.250> feel<00:01:49.670> that<00:01:49.700> all<00:01:50.630> of<00:01:50.869> us<00:01:51.110> as

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
in age so I feel that all of us as

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:54.090 
in age so I feel that all of us as
contemporary<00:01:52.310> women<00:01:52.490> bringing<00:01:53.030> our

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
contemporary women bringing our

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.550 
contemporary women bringing our
sensibilities<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.520> that<00:01:56.509> dance<00:01:56.840> is<00:01:57.140> infused

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
sensibilities and that dance is infused

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.600 
sensibilities and that dance is infused
with<00:01:57.799> it<00:01:58.099> for<00:01:58.880> me<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.270> challenge<00:01:59.569> lies<00:02:00.349> in

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
with it for me the challenge lies in

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.389 
with it for me the challenge lies in
transforming<00:02:01.610> what<00:02:02.270> is<00:02:02.479> a<00:02:02.509> codified<00:02:03.500> idiom<00:02:04.280> of

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
transforming what is a codified idiom of

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.990 
transforming what is a codified idiom of
gesture<00:02:05.470> into<00:02:06.470> a<00:02:06.500> language<00:02:06.829> of<00:02:07.340> sense

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
gesture into a language of sense

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.809 
gesture into a language of sense
expression<00:02:08.739> so<00:02:09.739> when<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:09.950> say<00:02:10.190> laying<00:02:10.940> down

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
expression so when you say laying down

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.670 
expression so when you say laying down
that<00:02:13.900> there<00:02:14.900> is<00:02:15.049> if<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.319> show<00:02:15.349> if<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.040> say<00:02:16.220> no

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
that there is if you show if you say no
