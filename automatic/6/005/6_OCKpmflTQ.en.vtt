00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
with a yarn started flip through and

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:44.610 
with a yarn started flip through and
then

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.250 

pull<00:05:45.250> that<00:05:45.630> that's<00:05:46.630> what<00:05:46.780> tightens<00:05:47.110> up

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
pull that that's what tightens up

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.780 
pull that that's what tightens up
against<00:05:48.250> the<00:05:48.400> edge<00:05:48.550> and<00:05:48.850> also<00:05:49.510> just<00:05:49.660> take<00:05:49.990> the

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
against the edge and also just take the

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.430 
against the edge and also just take the
beginning<00:05:51.790> of<00:05:51.850> yarn<00:05:52.270> too<00:05:52.479> and<00:05:52.690> pull<00:05:53.020> that<00:05:53.199> if

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
beginning of yarn too and pull that if

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.670 
beginning of yarn too and pull that if
it's<00:05:53.680> sort<00:05:54.639> of<00:05:54.699> gapped<00:05:54.940> a<00:05:55.120> little<00:05:55.360> bit<00:05:55.510> as<00:05:55.720> you

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
it's sort of gapped a little bit as you

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.670 
it's sort of gapped a little bit as you
worked<00:05:56.889> so<00:05:57.729> everything<00:05:58.150> is<00:05:58.620> pulled<00:05:59.620> in<00:05:59.820> I<00:06:01.680> just

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
worked so everything is pulled in I just

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.090 
worked so everything is pulled in I just
usually<00:06:03.220> tie<00:06:03.550> a<00:06:03.580> knot<00:06:04.560> with<00:06:05.560> beginning<00:06:05.949> in<00:06:06.040> the

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100

end<00:06:06.250> and<00:06:06.490> then<00:06:06.610> pull<00:06:06.790> it<00:06:06.820> to<00:06:07.030> the<00:06:07.060> back<00:06:09.750> so<00:06:10.750> a

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
end and then pull it to the back so a

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.590 
end and then pull it to the back so a
couple<00:06:11.169> of<00:06:11.350> knots<00:06:11.560> just<00:06:11.830> to<00:06:11.919> make<00:06:12.040> sure<00:06:12.600> that

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.550 

pull<00:06:24.520> my<00:06:24.669> yarn<00:06:24.699> ends<00:06:25.150> to<00:06:25.870> the<00:06:25.900> inside<00:06:26.349> of<00:06:26.379> the
