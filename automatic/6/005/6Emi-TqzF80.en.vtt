I've<00:00:00.480> got<00:00:00.659> no<00:00:00.840> great<00:00:01.110> desire<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:02.220> do<00:00:02.370> anything

I've got no great desire to do anything
other<00:00:02.909> than<00:00:03.120> comics<00:00:03.570> I<00:00:03.689> think<00:00:03.929> that<00:00:04.049> it's<00:00:04.170> a

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
other than comics I think that it's a

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.070 
other than comics I think that it's a
bit<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.500> shame<00:00:04.770> that<00:00:05.009> sometimes<00:00:05.520> people

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.080 
bit of a shame that sometimes people

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.270 
bit of a shame that sometimes people
tend<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.170> regard<00:00:07.350> even<00:00:07.770> people<00:00:08.069> in<00:00:08.099> the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
industry tend to regard comics as the

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.650 
industry tend to regard comics as the
poor<00:00:10.710> relation<00:00:11.309> it's<00:00:11.639> something<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.269> be<00:00:12.389> doing

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
poor relation it's something to be doing

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.270 
poor relation it's something to be doing
until<00:00:12.809> they<00:00:13.080> get<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.259> job<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.590> television<00:00:14.160> or

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
until they get a job on television or

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.420 
until they get a job on television or
writing<00:00:14.670> proper<00:00:15.599> novels<00:00:16.080> or<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.980> know<00:00:17.100> doing

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
writing proper novels or you know doing

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.970 
writing proper novels or you know doing
films<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.090> mean<00:00:18.240> for<00:00:19.050> me<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.470> tends<00:00:19.859> to

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
films I mean for me that tends to

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.099 
films I mean for me that tends to
degrade<00:00:20.130> comics<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.850> little<00:00:21.060> bit<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.420> think<00:00:21.960> that

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
degrade comics a little bit I think that

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.620 
degrade comics a little bit I think that
if<00:00:22.320> comics<00:00:23.010> aren't<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.939> art<00:00:24.090> form<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.420> they

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
if comics aren't the art form that they

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.960 
if comics aren't the art form that they
should<00:00:24.869> be<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> port<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.859> me<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
should be it's the port of me and the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.339 
should be it's the port of me and the
other<00:00:27.090> people<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.599> field<00:00:27.840> we<00:00:28.109> should<00:00:28.260> be

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
other people in the field we should be

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.040 
other people in the field we should be
doing<00:00:28.529> something<00:00:28.680> about<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:30.390> think

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
doing something about it and I think

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.139 
doing something about it and I think
that<00:00:31.529> comics<00:00:31.890> are<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.009> wonderful<00:00:32.520> art<00:00:32.669> form<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
that comics are a wonderful art form and

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.010 
that comics are a wonderful art form and
I<00:00:33.719> think<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.079> nobody<00:00:34.350> really<00:00:35.510> since<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
I think that nobody really since the the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.080 
I think that nobody really since the the
great<00:00:37.260> era<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.680> American<00:00:38.129> newspaper<00:00:38.640> strips

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
great era of American newspaper strips

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.420 
great era of American newspaper strips
nobody<00:00:39.660> really<00:00:40.050> has<00:00:40.140> come<00:00:40.320> anywhere<00:00:40.649> close<00:00:41.040> to

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
nobody really has come anywhere close to

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.100 
nobody really has come anywhere close to
sort<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.500> realizing<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:44.010> possibilities<00:00:44.730> of

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
sort of realizing the possibilities of

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.660 
sort of realizing the possibilities of
comics<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.530> think<00:00:46.980> there's<00:00:47.160> an<00:00:47.219> awful<00:00:47.280> lot<00:00:47.520> of

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
comics I think there's an awful lot of

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.090 
comics I think there's an awful lot of
work<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.969> do<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.360> very<00:00:48.539> much<00:00:48.690> like<00:00:48.920> if<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
work to do it's very much like if the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.639 
work to do it's very much like if the
first<00:00:50.309> films<00:00:50.760> had<00:00:51.000> been<00:00:51.170> short<00:00:52.170> children's

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
first films had been short children's

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.979 
first films had been short children's
cartoon<00:00:53.129> films<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.149> as<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> result<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.840> that

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
cartoon films and as a result of that

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.810 
cartoon films and as a result of that
people<00:00:55.320> had<00:00:55.530> said<00:00:55.739> well<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.280> obviously<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
people had said well this is obviously a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.299 
people had said well this is obviously a
medium<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.390> kids<00:00:57.829> then<00:00:58.829> you'd<00:00:59.010> never<00:00:59.160> have

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
medium for kids then you'd never have

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.910 
medium for kids then you'd never have
had<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> Citizen<00:00:59.910> Kane<00:01:00.379> you'd<00:01:01.379> never<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.739> had

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
had a Citizen Kane you'd never have had

a Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf you'd

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.960 
a Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf you'd
met<00:01:04.799> all<00:01:04.979> these<00:01:05.129> films<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.489> would<00:01:05.700> not<00:01:05.880> have

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
met all these films just would not have

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.649 
met all these films just would not have
happened<00:01:06.150> because<00:01:06.720> they're<00:01:07.320> adult<00:01:07.590> films<00:01:08.040> and

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
happened because they're adult films and

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.460 
happened because they're adult films and
they<00:01:09.659> wouldn't<00:01:09.930> have<00:01:10.020> occurred<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.439> a

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
they wouldn't have occurred in a

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.719 
they wouldn't have occurred in a
children's<00:01:10.890> medium<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.369> that's<00:01:11.520> what's

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
children's medium and that's what's

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.910 
children's medium and that's what's
happened<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.119> comics<00:01:12.570> people<00:01:13.140> say<00:01:13.409> comics<00:01:13.830> are

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
happened in comics people say comics are

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.359 
happened in comics people say comics are
for<00:01:13.950> kids

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
for kids

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.539 
for kids
so<00:01:15.150> therefore<00:01:15.530> you<00:01:16.530> know<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:17.070> got<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
so therefore you know it's got to the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.270 
so therefore you know it's got to the
stage<00:01:17.790> where<00:01:17.820> unless<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.979> want<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.070> put<00:01:20.220> a

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
stage where unless you want to put a

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.590 
stage where unless you want to put a
comic<00:01:20.640> out<00:01:20.790> which<00:01:20.970> probably<00:01:21.270> hasn't<00:01:21.420> got<00:01:21.570> a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
comic out which probably hasn't got a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.450 
comic out which probably hasn't got a
market<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.650> do<00:01:22.799> something<00:01:23.159> for<00:01:23.280> kids

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
market for it you do something for kids

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.880 
market for it you do something for kids
that's<00:01:24.180> time<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.540> change<00:01:24.810> now<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.710> could

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
that's time to change now and I could

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.700 
that's time to change now and I could
see<00:01:26.100> with<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> bit<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.000> look<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.540> 10<00:01:28.140> years<00:01:28.439> maybe

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
see with a bit of look in 10 years maybe

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.950 
see with a bit of look in 10 years maybe
we'll<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> medium<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.479> will<00:01:30.659> be<00:01:30.869> as

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
we'll have a medium that will be as

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.350 
we'll have a medium that will be as
important<00:01:31.560> as<00:01:31.710> films<00:01:32.400> or<00:01:32.670> there's<00:01:33.000> literature

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
important as films or there's literature

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.050 
important as films or there's literature
in<00:01:34.200> England<00:01:34.650> comics<00:01:35.460> I've<00:01:35.579> taken<00:01:35.820> more

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
in England comics I've taken more

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.780 
in England comics I've taken more
seriously<00:01:36.320> been<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.560> country<00:01:37.790> perhaps

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
seriously been in this country perhaps

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.210 
seriously been in this country perhaps
slightly<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.960> think<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.590> general<00:01:40.920> in

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
slightly but I think that in general in

slightly but I think that in general in

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
I mean another thing that I would like

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.610 
I mean another thing that I would like
to<00:03:48.150> see<00:03:48.329> is<00:03:48.390> more<00:03:48.600> women<00:03:48.900> reading<00:03:49.110> comics

to see is more women reading comics

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.360 
to see is more women reading comics

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
because there's a whole vast audience

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.400 
because there's a whole vast audience
out<00:03:53.549> there<00:03:53.579> who<00:03:54.239> just<00:03:54.269> won't<00:03:54.720> touch<00:03:54.989> a<00:03:55.049> comic

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
out there who just won't touch a comic

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.539

book and I can understand more they

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.220 
book and I can understand more they
won't<00:03:56.760> touch<00:03:56.970> it<00:03:57.030> because<00:03:57.540> there's<00:03:58.079> really

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
won't touch it because there's really

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.550 
won't touch it because there's really
nothing<00:03:58.650> in<00:03:58.769> comics<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.730> attract<00:04:00.180> a<00:04:00.329> woman

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
nothing in comics to attract a woman

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.440 
nothing in comics to attract a woman
because<00:04:01.560> it's<00:04:01.739> mainly<00:04:01.950> boys<00:04:02.340> power<00:04:02.790> fantasies

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
because it's mainly boys power fantasies

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.349 
because it's mainly boys power fantasies
you<00:04:04.230> know<00:04:04.350> which<00:04:04.590> is<00:04:05.100> as<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.549> boy<00:04:05.820> I<00:04:06.090> mean<00:04:06.269> I

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
you know which is as a boy I mean I

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.479 
you know which is as a boy I mean I
enjoy<00:04:06.630> them<00:04:06.780> as<00:04:06.840> much<00:04:06.900> as<00:04:07.079> anybody<00:04:07.290> else<00:04:07.650> but<00:04:08.430> I

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
enjoy them as much as anybody else but I

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.729 
enjoy them as much as anybody else but I
can<00:04:08.549> see<00:04:08.940> that<00:04:09.180> for<00:04:09.900> women<00:04:10.079> there's<00:04:10.440> something

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
can see that for women there's something

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.729 
can see that for women there's something
lacking<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.430> I<00:04:12.180> think<00:04:12.900> DC<00:04:13.260> are<00:04:13.350> starting<00:04:13.650> to

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
lacking and I think DC are starting to

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.110 
lacking and I think DC are starting to
move<00:04:13.920> in<00:04:14.070> that<00:04:14.100> direction<00:04:14.250> they're<00:04:14.790> planning

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
move in that direction they're planning

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.879 
move in that direction they're planning
to<00:04:15.150> sort<00:04:15.540> of<00:04:15.630> do<00:04:16.049> things<00:04:16.320> that<00:04:16.470> price<00:04:16.650> will

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
to sort of do things that price will

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.319 
to sort of do things that price will
drop<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.220> drag<00:04:17.400> in<00:04:17.579> the<00:04:17.699> women<00:04:17.970> read

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
drop and drag in the women read

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.879 
drop and drag in the women read
and<00:04:18.629> I<00:04:18.689> think<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:19.019> will<00:04:19.139> be<00:04:19.259> that<00:04:19.680> will<00:04:19.769> be<00:04:19.799> a

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
and I think that will be that will be a

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.669 
and I think that will be that will be a
big<00:04:20.069> step<00:04:20.280> forward
