fight now there had been speculation for

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.030 
fight now there had been speculation for
the<00:00:11.790> past<00:00:12.000> few<00:00:12.599> years<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.710> could<00:00:13.889> be<00:00:14.009> a

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
the past few years that it could be a

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.829 
the past few years that it could be a
rematch<00:00:14.460> between<00:00:14.610> Miguel<00:00:15.089> Cotto<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.509> Manny

rematch between Miguel Cotto and Manny

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.300 
rematch between Miguel Cotto and Manny
Pacquiao<00:00:16.640> but<00:00:18.140> Miguel<00:00:19.140> Cotto<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.590> now<00:00:19.800> trained

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
Pacquiao but Miguel Cotto is now trained

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.420 
Pacquiao but Miguel Cotto is now trained
by<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.640> same<00:00:20.939> guy<00:00:21.240> as<00:00:21.560> Manny<00:00:22.560> Pacquiao<00:00:23.039> which

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
by the same guy as Manny Pacquiao which

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.920 
by the same guy as Manny Pacquiao which
is<00:00:23.580> Freddie<00:00:23.820> Roach<00:00:24.080> so<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.289> unlikely<00:00:25.500> that

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
is Freddie Roach so it's unlikely that

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.509 
is Freddie Roach so it's unlikely that
that<00:00:27.930> fight<00:00:28.199> could<00:00:28.349> happen<00:00:28.710> for<00:00:28.859> now<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.310> don't

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
that fight could happen for now I don't

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.220 
that fight could happen for now I don't
see<00:00:29.820> how<00:00:30.000> they'd<00:00:30.210> get<00:00:30.420> past<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.869> training

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
see how they'd get past the training

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.350 
see how they'd get past the training
situation<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.949> know<00:00:32.009> Freddie<00:00:32.940> Roach<00:00:33.149> is

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
situation I know Freddie Roach is

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.970 
situation I know Freddie Roach is
ultimately<00:00:33.870> always<00:00:34.140> loyal<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.739> Manny

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
ultimately always loyal to Manny

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.680 
ultimately always loyal to Manny
Pacquiao<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.760> if<00:00:35.910> he<00:00:36.000> had<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.270> choose<00:00:36.450> sides

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
Pacquiao so if he had to choose sides

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.209 
Pacquiao so if he had to choose sides
he's<00:00:36.930> obviously<00:00:37.079> gonna<00:00:37.440> go<00:00:37.620> with<00:00:37.770> Pacquiao

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
he's obviously gonna go with Pacquiao

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.139 
he's obviously gonna go with Pacquiao
but<00:00:39.030> at<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> same<00:00:39.329> time<00:00:39.660> begin<00:00:40.410> Koto's<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.250> very

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
but at the same time begin Koto's a very

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.720 
but at the same time begin Koto's a very
high-profile<00:00:42.840> fighter<00:00:43.140> he<00:00:44.129> makes<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.550> lot<00:00:44.640> of

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
high-profile fighter he makes a lot of

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.819 
high-profile fighter he makes a lot of
money<00:00:44.910> he<00:00:45.239> has<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> lot<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.690> power<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.230> pull<00:00:46.530> in

money he has a lot of power and pull in

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.729

the<00:00:47.730> game<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.030> boxing<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.500> would<00:00:49.620> be<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the game of boxing so that would be a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.400 
the game of boxing so that would be a
difficult<00:00:50.010> situation<00:00:50.460> for<00:00:50.850> Freddie<00:00:51.180> Roach

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
difficult situation for Freddie Roach

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.310 
difficult situation for Freddie Roach
but<00:00:52.410> should<00:00:52.649> Sergio<00:00:53.070> Martinez<00:00:53.520> win<00:00:54.199> it<00:00:55.199> will

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
that he'd be willing to fight me over a

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.280 
that he'd be willing to fight me over a
catchweight<00:01:33.659> maybe<00:01:34.409> around<00:01:34.590> 150<00:01:35.340> or<00:01:35.430> 152<00:01:36.290> so

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
catchweight maybe around 150 or 152 so

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.050 
catchweight maybe around 150 or 152 so
maybe<00:01:38.009> he'll<00:01:38.220> be<00:01:38.369> willing<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.700> do<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> same

for Pacquiao
but<00:01:40.380> either<00:01:40.530> way<00:01:40.970> it'll<00:01:41.970> be<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> great<00:01:42.299> fight<00:01:42.570> to

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869

but either way it'll be a great fight to
see<00:01:43.020> Manny<00:01:43.229> Pacquiao<00:01:43.619> fight<00:01:43.680> Sergio<00:01:44.250> Martinez

anything like that don't be ridiculous
but<00:02:16.060> he's<00:02:16.630> certainly<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.500> true<00:02:17.830> fighting<00:02:18.250> man

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
Arum right now that he's willing to

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.920 
Arum right now that he's willing to
match<00:02:42.100> Pacquiao<00:02:42.640> possibly<00:02:43.420> with<00:02:43.540> Sergio

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
match Pacquiao possibly with Sergio

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.510

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
Martinez is he trying to cash out on

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.880 
Martinez is he trying to cash out on
Pacquiao<00:02:46.090> does<00:02:47.020> he<00:02:47.170> really<00:02:47.410> think<00:02:47.530> that

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
Pacquiao does he really think that

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.070 
Pacquiao does he really think that
Pacquiao<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.310> fading<00:02:48.850> as<00:02:48.970> badly<00:02:49.180> as<00:02:49.330> most<00:02:49.930> of

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
Pacquiao is fading as badly as most of

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.720 
Pacquiao is fading as badly as most of
us<00:02:50.170> do<00:02:50.350> because<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.650> think<00:02:50.800> Pacquiao<00:02:51.160> is<00:02:51.340> fading

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
us do because I think Pacquiao is fading

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.030 
us do because I think Pacquiao is fading
in<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.120> major<00:02:52.330> way<00:02:52.560> even<00:02:53.560> though<00:02:53.650> he<00:02:53.770> was<00:02:53.890> able

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
in a major way even though he was able

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.210 
in a major way even though he was able
to<00:02:54.160> be<00:02:54.310> Bradley<00:02:54.730> who<00:02:54.880> is<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.060> top<00:02:55.360> fighter<00:02:56.220> I

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
to be Bradley who is a top fighter I

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.520 
to be Bradley who is a top fighter I
still<00:02:57.850> think<00:02:58.090> he's<00:02:58.209> fading<00:02:58.630> majorly

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
still think he's fading majorly

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.280 
still think he's fading majorly
maybe<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.610> remind<00:03:01.390> of<00:03:01.450> cash<00:03:01.660> out<00:03:01.840> now<00:03:02.080> just

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
maybe I remind of cash out now just

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.660 
maybe I remind of cash out now just
looking<00:03:02.680> for<00:03:02.830> an<00:03:02.920> opportunity<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.459> do

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
looking for an opportunity to do

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.220 
looking for an opportunity to do
something<00:03:03.880> massive<00:03:04.450> with<00:03:04.570> Pacquiao<00:03:04.959> if<00:03:05.140> you

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
something massive with Pacquiao if you

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.160 
something massive with Pacquiao if you
can't<00:03:05.440> get<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.650> makeover<00:03:06.010> fight<00:03:06.280> for<00:03:06.580> Pacquiao

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
can't get a makeover fight for Pacquiao

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.410 
can't get a makeover fight for Pacquiao

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
maybe he gets a Martinez fight you'll be

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.770 
maybe he gets a Martinez fight you'll be
you<00:03:11.200> know<00:03:11.230> probably<00:03:11.560> maybe<00:03:12.489> not<00:03:13.060> as<00:03:13.150> big<00:03:13.300> as<00:03:13.390> a

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
you know probably maybe not as big as a

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.540 
you know probably maybe not as big as a
floyd<00:03:14.080> fight<00:03:14.290> but<00:03:14.560> maybe<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.130> next<00:03:15.310> best

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
floyd fight but maybe the next best

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.960

assuming<00:03:38.980> he's<00:03:39.190> healthy<00:03:39.549> and<00:03:39.880> I<00:03:40.060> know<00:03:40.150> he's

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
assuming he's healthy and I know he's

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.810 
assuming he's healthy and I know he's
coming<00:03:40.540> off<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.690> long<00:03:40.840> layoff<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:42.220> think<00:03:42.700> we'll

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
coming off a long layoff I think we'll

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.570 
coming off a long layoff I think we'll
probably<00:03:42.910> be<00:03:43.150> Miguel<00:03:43.510> Cotto<00:03:43.750> but<00:03:44.440> if<00:03:45.160> he<00:03:45.370> does

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
probably be Miguel Cotto but if he does

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.240 
probably be Miguel Cotto but if he does
we'll<00:03:46.390> fight<00:03:46.660> Pacquiao<00:03:46.900> do<00:03:47.860> you<00:03:47.950> think<00:03:48.130> this

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
we'll fight Pacquiao do you think this

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.030 
we'll fight Pacquiao do you think this
is<00:03:48.370> just<00:03:48.549> a<00:03:48.640> smokescreen<00:03:49.060> by<00:03:49.540> Arum<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:50.739> drum<00:03:51.010> up

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
is just a smokescreen by Arum to drum up

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.039 
is just a smokescreen by Arum to drum up
publicity<00:03:51.280> or<00:03:52.150> do<00:03:52.299> you<00:03:52.390> think<00:03:52.630> there<00:03:52.750> is<00:03:52.840> some

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
publicity or do you think there is some

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.070 
publicity or do you think there is some
truth<00:03:53.260> to<00:03:53.320> this<00:03:53.620> maybe<00:03:54.549> he'll<00:03:54.880> only<00:03:55.060> fight<00:03:55.390> the

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
truth to this maybe he'll only fight the

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.800 
truth to this maybe he'll only fight the
winner<00:03:56.260> of<00:03:56.790> Martinez<00:03:57.790> Cotto<00:03:58.030> if<00:03:58.420> he's<00:03:58.540> Cotto

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
winner of Martinez Cotto if he's Cotto
