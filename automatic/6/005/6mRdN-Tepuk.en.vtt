00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
plays so there's a couple interesting

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.179 
plays so there's a couple interesting
elements<00:01:18.780> going<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.080> here<00:01:19.259> first<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.619> all<00:01:19.680> all

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
elements going on here first of all all

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.429 
elements going on here first of all all
the<00:01:20.700> water<00:01:20.970> around<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.479> map<00:01:21.630> as<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.869> survivor

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
the water around the map as a survivor

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.859 
the water around the map as a survivor
is<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.770> bit<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.340> hazard<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.180> jump

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
is a bit of a hazard you have to jump

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.530 
is a bit of a hazard you have to jump
over<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.500> try<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> avoid<00:01:26.220> falling<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.390> that

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
over it and try to avoid falling in that

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.120 
over it and try to avoid falling in that
water<00:01:27.829> and<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.250> map<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.610> also<00:01:30.060> very<00:01:30.570> a

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
water and the map is also very a

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.950 
water and the map is also very a
circular<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.340> kind<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.670> open<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.240> that

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
circular and kind of open in that

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.859 
circular and kind of open in that
there's<00:01:34.320> no<00:01:34.530> dead<00:01:34.890> ends<00:01:35.270> you<00:01:36.270> you're<00:01:36.720> really

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
there's no dead ends you you're really

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.690 
there's no dead ends you you're really
going<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.110> be<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.320> your<00:01:37.470> toes<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> survivor

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
going to be on your toes as a survivor

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.910 
going to be on your toes as a survivor
and<00:01:39.659> there's<00:01:40.020> lots<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.320> opportunities<00:01:40.890> to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and there's lots of opportunities to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.800 
and there's lots of opportunities to
move

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
move

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.260 
move
but<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.680> know<00:01:43.770> you're<00:01:44.610> not<00:01:44.760> gonna<00:01:44.970> want<00:01:45.180> to

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
but you know you're not gonna want to

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.960 
but you know you're not gonna want to
just<00:01:45.450> sit<00:01:45.690> somewhere<00:01:46.400> with<00:01:47.400> your<00:01:47.550> back<00:01:47.730> to<00:01:47.940> a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
just sit somewhere with your back to a

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.020 
just sit somewhere with your back to a
wall<00:01:48.240> because<00:01:48.660> you<00:01:49.440> know<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.070> infected<00:01:50.850> can

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
wall because you know the infected can

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.050 
wall because you know the infected can
come<00:01:51.210> from<00:01:51.390> anywhere<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:52.230> the<00:01:52.680> catch<00:01:53.400> here<00:01:53.850> is

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
come from anywhere so the catch here is

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.890 
come from anywhere so the catch here is
that<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:56.070> zombies<00:01:56.520> actually<00:01:57.120> go<00:01:57.360> underwater

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
that the zombies actually go underwater

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.010 
that the zombies actually go underwater
and<00:01:58.440> they<00:01:58.590> actually<00:01:58.920> spawn<00:01:59.400> underwater<00:02:00.020> and

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
and they actually spawn underwater and

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.510 
and they actually spawn underwater and
it's<00:02:01.170> actually<00:02:01.350> pretty<00:02:01.680> easy<00:02:01.800> to<00:02:02.160> see<00:02:02.340> where

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
it's actually pretty easy to see where

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.800 
it's actually pretty easy to see where
you're<00:02:02.670> going<00:02:02.700> as<00:02:03.120> a<00:02:03.150> zombie<00:02:03.420> when<00:02:03.660> you're

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
you're going as a zombie when you're

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.020 
you're going as a zombie when you're
underwater<00:02:04.050> because<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:05.040> some<00:02:05.730> clever

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
underwater because of some clever

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.270 
underwater because of some clever
texture<00:02:06.660> use<00:02:06.870> just<00:02:07.230> makes<00:02:07.590> orientation

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
texture use just makes orientation

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.000 
texture use just makes orientation
pretty<00:02:08.520> easy<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.290> zombies<00:02:10.440> can<00:02:10.770> jump

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
pretty easy and the zombies can jump

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.680 
pretty easy and the zombies can jump
right<00:02:11.220> up<00:02:11.280> out<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.700> water<00:02:11.880> and<00:02:12.120> attack<00:02:12.510> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
right up out of the water and attack the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.600 
right up out of the water and attack the
humans<00:02:12.960> from<00:02:13.050> anywhere<00:02:13.590> really<00:02:14.130> keeps<00:02:14.520> the

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
humans from anywhere really keeps the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.070 
humans from anywhere really keeps the
humans<00:02:14.880> on<00:02:15.000> their<00:02:15.120> toes<00:02:15.300> this<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.690> actually<00:02:16.050> a

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
humans on their toes this is actually a

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.510 
humans on their toes this is actually a
feature<00:02:16.350> which<00:02:17.510> was<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:19.110> map<00:02:19.410> we<00:02:20.160> featured

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
feature which was in a map we featured

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.670 
feature which was in a map we featured
called<00:02:20.790> forsaken<00:02:21.510> Lagoon<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.200> was<00:02:22.350> actually

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
called forsaken Lagoon it was actually

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.740 
called forsaken Lagoon it was actually
the<00:02:22.740> first<00:02:23.130> infection<00:02:23.700> if<00:02:24.000> we<00:02:24.150> ever<00:02:24.270> featured

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
the first infection if we ever featured

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.500 
the first infection if we ever featured
on<00:02:24.840> message<00:02:25.200> channel<00:02:25.610> but<00:02:26.610> this<00:02:26.910> map<00:02:27.180> does<00:02:27.420> an

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
on message channel but this map does an

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.240 
on message channel but this map does an
excellent<00:02:27.690> job<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.290> putting<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:28.770> mechanic

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
excellent job of putting this mechanic

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.850 
excellent job of putting this mechanic
to<00:02:29.400> use<00:02:29.640> if<00:02:30.570> you're<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.840> survivor<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.650> fall

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
to use if you're a survivor and you fall

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.760 
to use if you're a survivor and you fall
in<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.040> water<00:02:32.160> you're<00:02:32.430> pretty<00:02:32.670> much<00:02:32.730> boned

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
in the water you're pretty much boned

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.900 
in the water you're pretty much boned
you'll<00:02:34.770> get<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.980> waypoint<00:02:35.160> above<00:02:35.610> your<00:02:35.760> head

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
you'll get a waypoint above your head

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.620 
you'll get a waypoint above your head
you'll<00:02:36.090> move<00:02:36.270> slow<00:02:36.770> etc<00:02:37.770> but<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:37.950> can<00:02:38.630> escape

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
you'll move slow etc but you can escape

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.540 
you'll move slow etc but you can escape
the<00:02:39.930> water<00:02:40.140> as<00:02:40.320> a<00:02:40.350> survivor<00:02:40.830> if<00:02:41.100> you<00:02:41.310> make<00:02:41.520> it

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
the water as a survivor if you make it

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.000 
the water as a survivor if you make it
back<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.209> central<00:02:42.570> chamber<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.140> hop<00:02:43.830> on

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
back to the central chamber and hop on

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.350 
back to the central chamber and hop on
the<00:02:44.100> main<00:02:44.310> cannon<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.790> can<00:02:44.940> actually<00:02:45.209> get<00:02:45.300> out

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
the main cannon you can actually get out

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.680 
the main cannon you can actually get out
of<00:02:45.570> there<00:02:45.690> but<00:02:46.290> your<00:02:46.650> chances<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.070> survival

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
of there but your chances of survival

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.500 
of there but your chances of survival
dwindled<00:02:48.690> pretty<00:02:49.370> pretty<00:02:50.370> significantly<00:02:51.060> if

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
dwindled pretty pretty significantly if

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.090 
dwindled pretty pretty significantly if
you<00:02:51.690> fall<00:02:51.870> in<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.080> water<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.739> don't<00:02:52.920> want<00:02:53.040> to

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
you fall in the water you don't want to

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.449 
you fall in the water you don't want to
do<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.360> but<00:02:54.360> anyways<00:02:54.690> as<00:02:55.020> far<00:02:55.560> as<00:02:55.590> the

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
do that but anyways as far as the

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.270 
do that but anyways as far as the
game-type<00:02:57.180> goes<00:02:57.510> humans<00:02:58.380> can<00:02:58.560> take<00:02:58.739> two<00:02:58.980> hits

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
game-type goes humans can take two hits

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.920 
game-type goes humans can take two hits
from<00:02:59.459> zombies<00:02:59.910> but<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.180> first<00:03:00.420> hit<00:03:00.630> is<00:03:00.810> going

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
from zombies but the first hit is going

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.199 
from zombies but the first hit is going
to<00:03:01.470> take<00:03:02.100> them<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.489> red<00:03:02.700> bar<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:04.880> it's<00:03:05.880> going

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
to take them to red bar and it's going

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.720 
to take them to red bar and it's going
to<00:03:06.300> encourage<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.350> hang<00:03:08.010> out<00:03:08.160> by<00:03:08.340> some<00:03:08.640> of

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
to encourage you to hang out by some of

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.860 
to encourage you to hang out by some of
the<00:03:08.790> health<00:03:09.030> packs<00:03:09.300> that<00:03:09.480> are<00:03:09.600> scattered

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
the health packs that are scattered

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.620 
the health packs that are scattered
around<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.350> map<00:03:10.560> there's<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.980> few<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.489> those

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
around the map there's a few of those

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.870 
around the map there's a few of those
which<00:03:12.630> are<00:03:12.810> very<00:03:13.170> useful<00:03:13.430> human<00:03:14.430> spawn<00:03:14.700> with

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
which are very useful human spawn with

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.699 
which are very useful human spawn with
shotguns<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.660> magnums<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.560> zombies

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
shotguns and magnums and the zombies

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.170 
shotguns and magnums and the zombies
don't<00:03:17.040> take<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.310> lot<00:03:17.489> of<00:03:17.519> damage<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:17.910> can

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
don't take a lot of damage you can

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.210 
don't take a lot of damage you can
one-shot<00:03:18.420> headshot<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.170> zombie<00:03:19.560> with<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:19.739> magnum

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
one-shot headshot a zombie with a magnum

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.520 
one-shot headshot a zombie with a magnum
and<00:03:20.370> one<00:03:21.150> shot<00:03:21.360> kills<00:03:21.600> with<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.900> shotgun<00:03:22.110> are

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
and one shot kills with the shotgun are

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.660 
and one shot kills with the shotgun are
pretty<00:03:23.280> common<00:03:23.459> um<00:03:24.290> but<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.800> is<00:03:26.010> offset<00:03:26.640> by

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
pretty common um but that is offset by

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.130 
pretty common um but that is offset by
the<00:03:26.820> fact<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.269> zombies<00:03:27.660> can<00:03:27.840> come<00:03:27.989> from

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
the fact that the zombies can come from

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.810 
the fact that the zombies can come from
anywhere<00:03:28.410> they<00:03:28.950> can<00:03:29.100> really<00:03:29.250> flank<00:03:29.670> the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
anywhere they can really flank the

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.820 
anywhere they can really flank the
humans<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.239> think<00:03:30.480> them<00:03:30.660> by<00:03:31.080> surprise<00:03:31.290> by

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
humans and think them by surprise by

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.949 
humans and think them by surprise by
jumping<00:03:32.220> out<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.489> water<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:33.510> humans<00:03:33.780> also

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
jumping out of the water the humans also

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.490 
jumping out of the water the humans also
get<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:35.160> single<00:03:36.030> frag<00:03:36.269> grenade<00:03:36.630> each<00:03:36.840> which

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
get a a single frag grenade each which

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.650 
get a a single frag grenade each which
can<00:03:37.680> be<00:03:37.830> really<00:03:38.100> useful<00:03:38.130> if<00:03:38.580> you<00:03:39.330> think

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
can be really useful if you think

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.090 
can be really useful if you think
there's<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.930> couple<00:03:40.110> zombies<00:03:40.620> in<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.890> water

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
there's a couple zombies in the water

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.620 
there's a couple zombies in the water
nearby<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.610> can<00:03:41.910> actually<00:03:42.090> blow<00:03:42.450> them<00:03:42.570> up

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
nearby you can actually blow them up

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.590 
nearby you can actually blow them up
with<00:03:43.320> a<00:03:43.350> fragrant<00:03:43.860> it's<00:03:44.100> very<00:03:44.280> useful<00:03:44.430> but<00:03:45.120> you

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
with a fragrant it's very useful but you

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.180 
with a fragrant it's very useful but you
know<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:45.780> can't<00:03:46.050> really<00:03:46.170> see<00:03:46.290> into<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:47.040> water

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
know you can't really see into the water

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.320 
know you can't really see into the water
very<00:03:47.400> well<00:03:47.670> as

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
very well as

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.050 
very well as
so<00:03:48.660> it's<00:03:48.870> it's<00:03:49.350> pretty<00:03:49.560> time<00:03:49.770> there's<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.820> few

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
so it's it's pretty time there's a few

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.250 
so it's it's pretty time there's a few
other<00:03:51.090> weapons<00:03:51.570> scattered<00:03:51.780> throughout<00:03:52.200> the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
other weapons scattered throughout the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.990 
other weapons scattered throughout the
map<00:03:52.470> there<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:52.950> machine<00:03:53.130> gun<00:03:53.580> turret<00:03:53.880> which

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
map there is a machine gun turret which

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.780 
map there is a machine gun turret which
is<00:03:54.120> pretty<00:03:54.480> useful<00:03:54.980> there<00:03:55.980> is<00:03:56.100> also<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.460> few

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
is pretty useful there is also a few

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.660 
is pretty useful there is also a few
assault<00:03:57.150> rifles<00:03:57.540> there<00:03:58.110> is<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.440> sprint<00:03:59.100> pick<00:03:59.460> up

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
assault rifles there is a sprint pick up

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.910 
assault rifles there is a sprint pick up
in<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.150> central<00:04:00.540> chamber<00:04:00.930> which<00:04:01.200> I<00:04:01.410> can<00:04:01.710> just

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
in the central chamber which I can just

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.160 
in the central chamber which I can just
let<00:04:02.160> you<00:04:02.340> traverse<00:04:03.240> the<00:04:03.390> map<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.570> bit<00:04:03.810> quicker

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
let you traverse the map a bit quicker

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.570 
let you traverse the map a bit quicker
but<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:04.560> got<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.710> be<00:04:04.830> careful<00:04:04.980> you<00:04:05.340> don't<00:04:05.490> want

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
but you got to be careful you don't want

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.600 
but you got to be careful you don't want
to<00:04:05.730> fall<00:04:05.850> in<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.090> water<00:04:06.210> like<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:06.660> said<00:04:06.870> and

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
to fall in the water like I said and

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.400 
to fall in the water like I said and
lastly<00:04:08.610> there<00:04:08.940> is<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.150> rocket<00:04:09.870> launcher<00:04:10.230> which

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
lastly there is a rocket launcher which

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.790 
lastly there is a rocket launcher which
is<00:04:10.560> in<00:04:10.680> this<00:04:10.910> long<00:04:11.910> tunnel<00:04:12.750> around<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.620> map

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
is in this long tunnel around the map

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.710 
is in this long tunnel around the map
there's<00:04:14.040> some<00:04:14.250> inherent<00:04:14.880> risk<00:04:15.120> involved<00:04:15.420> and

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
there's some inherent risk involved and

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.050 
there's some inherent risk involved and
not<00:04:15.930> only<00:04:16.109> is<00:04:16.320> it<00:04:16.350> this<00:04:16.590> long<00:04:16.980> skinny<00:04:17.640> tunnel

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
not only is it this long skinny tunnel

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.940 
not only is it this long skinny tunnel
where<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.269> can<00:04:18.420> get<00:04:18.570> cornered<00:04:19.290> by<00:04:19.500> zombies

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
where you can get cornered by zombies

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.530 
where you can get cornered by zombies
but<00:04:20.130> there's<00:04:20.310> also<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.609> soft<00:04:20.940> kill<00:04:21.180> zone<00:04:21.390> in

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
but there's also a soft kill zone in

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.030 
but there's also a soft kill zone in
there<00:04:21.720> so<00:04:22.140> you<00:04:22.230> can't<00:04:22.410> just<00:04:22.620> hang<00:04:22.800> out<00:04:22.920> in

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
there so you can't just hang out in

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.230 
there so you can't just hang out in
there<00:04:23.160> you<00:04:23.310> got<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.520> just<00:04:23.640> run<00:04:23.880> through<00:04:24.060> there

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
there you got to just run through there

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.380 
there you got to just run through there
and<00:04:24.330> grab<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.660> rockets<00:04:25.020> and<00:04:25.110> go<00:04:26.180> and<00:04:27.180> those

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
and grab the rockets and go and those

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.970 
and grab the rockets and go and those
Rockets<00:04:27.780> are<00:04:27.900> pretty<00:04:28.080> effective<00:04:28.530> as<00:04:28.680> you

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
Rockets are pretty effective as you

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.910 
Rockets are pretty effective as you
would<00:04:29.100> imagine<00:04:29.690> but<00:04:30.690> yeah<00:04:31.260> this<00:04:31.470> map<00:04:31.710> just

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
would imagine but yeah this map just

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.130 
would imagine but yeah this map just
plays<00:04:32.220> fantastically<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.330> combination<00:04:33.690> of

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
plays fantastically that combination of

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.250 
plays fantastically that combination of
you<00:04:34.950> know<00:04:35.040> not<00:04:35.940> having<00:04:36.300> these<00:04:36.570> dead<00:04:36.840> ends<00:04:37.200> and

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
you know not having these dead ends and

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.770 
you know not having these dead ends and
just<00:04:37.440> allowing<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:38.010> zombies<00:04:38.430> this<00:04:38.670> access<00:04:39.600> to

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
just allowing the zombies this access to

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.060 
just allowing the zombies this access to
this<00:04:39.870> part<00:04:40.140> of<00:04:40.170> the<00:04:40.290> map<00:04:40.440> that<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.740> humans

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
this part of the map that the humans

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.670 
this part of the map that the humans
don't<00:04:41.880> have<00:04:42.240> access<00:04:42.450> to<00:04:42.810> its<00:04:42.990> it's<00:04:43.200> kind<00:04:43.530> of<00:04:43.560> a

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
don't have access to its it's kind of a

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.550 
don't have access to its it's kind of a
similar<00:04:43.890> mechanic<00:04:44.460> to<00:04:44.700> last<00:04:45.120> stand<00:04:45.660> where<00:04:46.380> the

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
similar mechanic to last stand where the

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.500 
similar mechanic to last stand where the
humans<00:04:46.860> are<00:04:46.950> confined<00:04:47.370> to<00:04:47.730> a<00:04:47.760> certain<00:04:48.150> area

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
humans are confined to a certain area

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.100 
humans are confined to a certain area
and<00:04:49.440> zombies<00:04:50.100> get<00:04:50.310> this<00:04:50.490> extra<00:04:51.450> flanking<00:04:51.990> room

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
and zombies get this extra flanking room

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.409 
and zombies get this extra flanking room
it's<00:04:52.830> kind<00:04:53.100> of<00:04:53.130> a<00:04:53.250> similar<00:04:53.460> mechanic<00:04:53.970> but<00:04:54.060> it's

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
it's kind of a similar mechanic but it's

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.990 
it's kind of a similar mechanic but it's
pretty<00:04:54.780> interesting<00:04:55.530> and<00:04:56.010> cool<00:04:56.460> to<00:04:56.700> have<00:04:56.820> the

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
pretty interesting and cool to have the

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.760 
pretty interesting and cool to have the
zombies<00:04:57.330> jumping<00:04:57.660> out<00:04:57.750> of<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:57.930> water<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.680> of

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
zombies jumping out of the water and of

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.230 
zombies jumping out of the water and of
course<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:59.070> zombies<00:04:59.400> are<00:04:59.460> green<00:04:59.820> they<00:05:00.060> are

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
course the zombies are green they are

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.120 
course the zombies are green they are
the<00:05:00.419> reptiles<00:05:01.110> you<00:05:01.380> know<00:05:01.470> it's<00:05:01.740> kind<00:05:01.950> of<00:05:01.980> cool

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
the reptiles you know it's kind of cool

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.970 
the reptiles you know it's kind of cool
but<00:05:02.669> yeah<00:05:03.120> this<00:05:03.240> is<00:05:03.390> a<00:05:03.419> really<00:05:03.780> fun<00:05:04.020> map<00:05:04.230> I

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
but yeah this is a really fun map I

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.890 
but yeah this is a really fun map I
would<00:05:05.340> advise<00:05:05.880> you<00:05:05.910> guys<00:05:06.090> to<00:05:06.270> check<00:05:06.660> it<00:05:06.810> out

a great designer and it's cool to see
him<00:05:15.030> you<00:05:15.840> know<00:05:15.930> having<00:05:16.260> applied<00:05:16.520> some<00:05:17.520> of<00:05:17.640> his

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
him you know having applied some of his

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.270 
him you know having applied some of his
design<00:05:18.210> knowledge<00:05:18.600> to<00:05:19.110> you<00:05:19.620> know<00:05:19.710> infection

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
design knowledge to you know infection

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.930 
design knowledge to you know infection
instead<00:05:20.550> of<00:05:20.700> just<00:05:21.240> core<00:05:21.720> maps<00:05:22.500> but<00:05:23.280> so<00:05:23.550> yeah

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
instead of just core maps but so yeah

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.170 
instead of just core maps but so yeah
you<00:05:24.330> guys<00:05:24.510> should<00:05:24.540> check<00:05:24.750> this<00:05:25.080> out<00:05:25.290> and<00:05:26.280> I
