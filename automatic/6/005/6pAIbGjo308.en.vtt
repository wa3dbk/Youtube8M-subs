just<00:02:00.400> slide<00:02:01.400> it<00:02:01.610> in<00:02:01.759> through<00:02:02.090> here<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:04.340> seems

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
just slide it in through here it seems

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.880 
just slide it in through here it seems
well<00:02:07.759> it's<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.119> tight<00:02:08.390> fit<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.619> there<00:02:09.769> we<00:02:09.860> go

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
well it's a tight fit and there we go

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.070 
well it's a tight fit and there we go
yeah<00:02:10.670> it's<00:02:10.819> a<00:02:10.849> really<00:02:10.970> tight<00:02:11.269> fit<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.659> actually

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
yeah it's a really tight fit it actually

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.580 
yeah it's a really tight fit it actually
takes<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.040> little<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.610> get<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:13.880> thing<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:14.210> here

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.050 

and<00:02:18.590> I<00:02:18.650> guess<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:18.980> means<00:02:19.100> it's<00:02:19.250> safe<00:02:19.730> which

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
and I guess that means it's safe which

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.780 
and I guess that means it's safe which
is<00:02:20.240> good<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:20.930> know<00:02:21.200> but<00:02:21.380> if<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.430> have<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:22.610> take

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
is good to know but if you have to take

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.220 
is good to know but if you have to take
this<00:02:22.880> thing<00:02:22.940> out<00:02:23.240> god<00:02:23.510> forbid<00:02:23.960> it's<00:02:24.110> gonna

yes maje crazy a lot of fingerprints I

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.970 
yes maje crazy a lot of fingerprints I
have<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.960> brightness<00:02:33.290> down<00:02:33.470> because<00:02:33.830> of<00:02:33.860> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
have the brightness down because of the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.140 
have the brightness down because of the
video<00:02:34.190> so<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:34.490> doesn't<00:02:34.700> blow<00:02:34.790> out<00:02:35.000> the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
video so it doesn't blow out the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.090 
video so it doesn't blow out the
exposure<00:02:35.530> anyway<00:02:37.450> there<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:38.920> gotta<00:02:39.920> say

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100

it feels nice in the end it has a nice
rubber<00:02:42.260> grip<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.800> it<00:02:43.300> it's<00:02:44.300> very<00:02:44.390> minimal<00:02:44.950> very

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
rubber grip to it it's very minimal very

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.300 
rubber grip to it it's very minimal very
nice<00:02:46.190> looking<00:02:46.400> I<00:02:47.290> can<00:02:48.290> tell<00:02:48.500> right<00:02:48.800> now<00:02:49.130> this

picking it out but you can see a little
bit<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:59.590> residue<00:03:00.590> right<00:03:00.980> there<00:03:01.190> dust<00:03:01.730> so<00:03:02.530> all

bit of residue right there dust so all
right<00:03:03.650> now<00:03:03.800> let's<00:03:04.010> unfold<00:03:04.459> it<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.650> fold<00:03:06.650> it

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
right now let's unfold it and fold it

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.800 
right now let's unfold it and fold it
back<00:03:08.590> hmm<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:10.060> gotta<00:03:11.060> say<00:03:11.209> holding<00:03:11.600> on<00:03:11.690> like

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
back hmm I gotta say holding on like

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.600 
back hmm I gotta say holding on like
this<00:03:11.959> isn't<00:03:12.260> as<00:03:12.530> bad<00:03:12.800> as<00:03:13.070> I<00:03:13.160> thought<00:03:13.370> it<00:03:13.430> was

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
this isn't as bad as I thought it was

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.470 
this isn't as bad as I thought it was
going<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.790> be<00:03:14.080> but<00:03:15.080> this<00:03:16.070> thing<00:03:16.459> kind<00:03:17.030> of<00:03:17.239> gets

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
going to be but this thing kind of gets

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.470 
going to be but this thing kind of gets
in<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.690> way<00:03:17.900> although<00:03:18.140> are<00:03:18.500> you<00:03:18.650> supposed<00:03:18.980> to

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
in the way although are you supposed to

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.320 
in the way although are you supposed to
put<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.660> under<00:03:21.140> here<00:03:21.500> or<00:03:21.530> what<00:03:22.100> I'm<00:03:22.910> not<00:03:23.090> even

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
put that under here or what I'm not even

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.740 
put that under here or what I'm not even
sure<00:03:23.360> how<00:03:23.720> that<00:03:23.900> works<00:03:24.370> anyway<00:03:25.630> ignoring<00:03:26.630> this

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
sure how that works anyway ignoring this

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.770 
sure how that works anyway ignoring this
flap<00:03:27.110> it's<00:03:27.920> not<00:03:28.160> that<00:03:28.370> bad<00:03:28.550> it's<00:03:29.120> not<00:03:29.300> flat

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
flap it's not that bad it's not flat

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.090 
flap it's not that bad it's not flat
when<00:03:30.110> you<00:03:30.200> do<00:03:30.320> this<00:03:30.590> there<00:03:31.459> is<00:03:31.640> a<00:03:31.670> little<00:03:33.100> curve

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
when you do this there is a little curve

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.920 
when you do this there is a little curve
right<00:03:34.340> there<00:03:34.400> but<00:03:35.239> that's<00:03:35.300> because<00:03:35.570> it

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
right there but that's because it

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.890 
right there but that's because it
doubles<00:03:36.350> as<00:03:36.530> a<00:03:36.590> photo<00:03:37.040> frame<00:03:37.480> so<00:03:38.480> let<00:03:38.690> me<00:03:38.750> see

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
doubles as a photo frame so let me see

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.020 
doubles as a photo frame so let me see
how<00:03:38.989> that<00:03:39.200> works<00:03:39.470> I<00:03:42.640> don't<00:03:43.640> even<00:03:43.730> know<00:03:43.880> how

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
how that works I don't even know how

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.020 
how that works I don't even know how
this<00:03:44.180> works<00:03:44.390> okay<00:03:45.040> turn<00:03:46.040> this<00:03:46.160> off<00:03:46.340> you

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
this works okay turn this off you

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.690 
this works okay turn this off you
probably<00:03:47.239> got<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.600> do<00:03:47.690> this<00:03:47.900> ah<00:03:49.870> there<00:03:50.870> we<00:03:50.989> go<00:03:51.080> I

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
see now and then we got to get it under

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:04.330 
see now and then we got to get it under

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.290 
really sure right now i'm not sure what
to<00:04:20.810> deal<00:04:20.959> with<00:04:21.109> that<00:04:21.260> is<00:04:21.669> now<00:04:22.669> it<00:04:22.880> also<00:04:23.000> goes

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
to deal with that is now it also goes

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
to deal with that is now it also goes
like<00:04:23.510> this<00:04:23.750> and

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
like this and

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.160 
like this and
I thing<00:04:25.420> medicine<00:04:26.420> let<00:04:26.510> me<00:04:26.630> see<00:04:26.870> if<00:04:26.960> I<00:04:27.020> can

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
I thing medicine let me see if I can

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.870 
I thing medicine let me see if I can
figure<00:04:27.290> that<00:04:27.470> out<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:27.830> just<00:04:27.980> set<00:04:28.580> it<00:04:28.610> down<00:04:28.730> I

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
figure that out you just set it down I

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.010 
figure that out you just set it down I
guess<00:04:29.120> and<00:04:29.870> that's<00:04:30.170> that<00:04:31.720> so<00:04:32.720> it's<00:04:32.840> pretty

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
guess and that's that so it's pretty

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.920 
guess and that's that so it's pretty
cool<00:04:33.200> so<00:04:33.620> if<00:04:33.710> i<00:04:33.800> was<00:04:33.950> in<00:04:34.070> safari<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:34.730> i<00:04:35.630> wanted
