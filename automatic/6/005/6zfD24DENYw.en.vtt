00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
on the 2nd of November 2010 well I was

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.150 
on the 2nd of November 2010 well I was
actually<00:06:23.910> uploading<00:06:24.630> vlogs<00:06:24.900> videos<00:06:25.230> before

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 
actually uploading vlogs videos before

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.330 
actually uploading vlogs videos before
then<00:06:26.550> and<00:06:26.940> I<00:06:27.420> have<00:06:27.630> one<00:06:27.840> but<00:06:28.410> I<00:06:28.500> deleted<00:06:28.890> them

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
then and I have one but I deleted them

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.340 
then and I have one but I deleted them
that's<00:06:29.640> why<00:06:29.910> but<00:06:30.210> I<00:06:30.270> actually<00:06:30.510> was<00:06:30.840> uploading

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
that's why but I actually was uploading

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.230 
that's why but I actually was uploading
I<00:06:31.590> think<00:06:32.040> my<00:06:32.160> first<00:06:32.310> one<00:06:32.550> was<00:06:32.670> uploaded<00:06:33.180> in

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
I think my first one was uploaded in

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.820 
I think my first one was uploaded in
like<00:06:33.450> August<00:06:33.900> or<00:06:34.080> something<00:06:34.470> and<00:06:34.620> I<00:06:34.650> thought

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
like August or something and I thought

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.920 
like August or something and I thought
really<00:06:35.190> sure<00:06:35.430> I<00:06:35.490> used<00:06:35.760> to<00:06:35.940> yes

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
really sure I used to yes

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.790 
really sure I used to yes
so<00:06:37.140> I<00:06:37.430> might<00:06:38.430> imagine<00:06:38.870> because<00:06:39.870> they<00:06:40.740> were

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
so I might imagine because they were

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.250 
so I might imagine because they were
 oh<00:06:42.260> yeah<00:06:43.290> I<00:06:44.220> never<00:06:45.090> sure<00:06:45.330> so<00:06:45.840> I<00:06:45.870> guess

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.260 
 oh yeah I never sure so I guess

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.170
