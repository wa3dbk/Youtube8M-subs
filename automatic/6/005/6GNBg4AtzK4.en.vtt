00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello everyone welcome once 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.150
 more to the channel today I bring you a video that 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.310
 I have been asked so much that it is the top 5 of 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.570
 the glazes for this season or the 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.190
 trends in colors for this 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.600
 season be they glazes also 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.529
 could you pass it on to your makeup clothes 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.529
 etc 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.650
 this is going to be a very special video 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.410
 because it is a collaborative with glitter 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.060
 I believe that everyone here knows her 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.460
 body is one of the first youtubers 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.870
 that there was with chile and in its channel they can 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.290
 find everything 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.850
 routines halls makeup types of 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.250
 specific makeups for each type 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.750
 of face the truth is that purple is 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.339
 a latitude that makes videos that more 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.080
 I like them so they are all very 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.030
 invited to go to his channel to see the 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.280
 video of her that is going to be a top 5 of 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.989
 the lipsticks of this season I'm going to 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.910
 leave with a tone in the line of 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.629
 colors newt this would be the 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.570
 saying 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.719
 bout punk of the beat is a nude color 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.329
 creamy that covers very well only two 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.729
 layers is one of my favorites for 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.350
 say it and the truth is that it is a color 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.050
 that is very good with this season 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.440
 because well-worn nudes are used 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.570
 for beige and good claritos 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.750
 secondly I bring you a blue that 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.390
 it is a blue well off is the tone be 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.160
 of revlon this color covered perfect in 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.450
 one layer I had to put two because 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.980
 you know I can not live 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.690
 quiet if I put a layer on 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.490
 glazes but it really is a color 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.710
 beautiful that is also very much in agreement 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.160
 with the colors trends in clothes 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.160
 this year 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.200
 as third color I bring you this tone 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:46.119
 that is a little grayish gray like with 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.210
 a sector a little bit mauve that is the tone 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.369
 Make-up shell This is a glaze 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.649
 Brazilian but you can find 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.119
 many colors of this tone in 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.070
 l'oréal especially I think that l'oréal 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.679
 brought a special line with this guy 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.750
 of colors at least I have seen many and 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.299
 It is a color that besides being very 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.159
 tempting comes with everything you can put 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.990
 clothes of all colors and always going to 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.990
 be consistent with what is set 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.970
 then I bring you this option for the 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.560
 which are a little more used with which 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.130
 they like darker tones a little 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.320
 this is the wicked color of exit is one 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.910
 of my favorite tones could be said 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.700
 which is a burgundy tone but has a 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.710
 sub notorious red tone live but 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.480
 at the same time it is an almost black color 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.420
 what makes it perfect for departures 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.010
 nightly for special events is 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.740
 away one of my favorite colors of the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.350
 season and also that it is a color that 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.240
 it is perfect without top coat or the 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.190
 that they do not touch or that they do not like 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.140
 use for the same reason this color is left 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.530
 very bright but apply a coat 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.530
 final 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.489
 and finally I bring you this green color 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.379
 that are green that looks pretty 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.849
 turned on like for the season but 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.310
 although they do not believe it is one of the colors 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.489
 that is coming super strong this tone is 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.590
 in lima of the brand of enea this too 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.709
 I bought it in Brazil but I repeat 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.819
 here in chile you can find 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.030
 many brands that have this color 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.370
 such as obi es and maybelline 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.470
 etcetera and those were the five colors 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.700
 of season that I chose as they could 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.799
 notice in the video I was quite 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.380
 conservative with the colors but this 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.970
 I wanted to leave it neutral so that 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.290
 all can occupy them with colors and the 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.750
 truth is that they are super easy to 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.150
 get today and I really hope 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.190
 to put this top 5 into practice and 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.720
 I repeat again that you are invited 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.610
 to go through the door channel 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.769
 to see these 5 of the vials of this 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.299
 season and waiting for them 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.370
 I really liked this video I say goodbye 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.650

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.370

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.370
