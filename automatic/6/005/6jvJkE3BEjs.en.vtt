for<00:00:02.900> our<00:00:03.020> alternative<00:00:03.680> car<00:00:03.919> we<00:00:04.130> could<00:00:04.250> have

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:04.340 
for our alternative car we could have

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.799 
for our alternative car we could have
been<00:00:04.430> all<00:00:04.580> sensible<00:00:05.060> and<00:00:05.270> just<00:00:05.420> stuck<00:00:05.779> to

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:05.809 
been all sensible and just stuck to

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:09.040 
been all sensible and just stuck to
budget<00:00:06.609> but<00:00:07.609> hang<00:00:07.790> on<00:00:07.910> these<00:00:08.210> are<00:00:08.389> sports<00:00:08.660> cars

budget but hang on these are sports cars

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.280 
budget but hang on these are sports cars
so<00:00:09.440> he<00:00:09.559> wants<00:00:09.769> to<00:00:09.830> be<00:00:10.009> sensible<00:00:10.809> so<00:00:11.809> we<00:00:11.990> threw

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
so he wants to be sensible so we threw

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.140 
so he wants to be sensible so we threw
the<00:00:12.469> budget<00:00:12.769> out<00:00:12.919> the<00:00:13.190> window<00:00:13.519> and<00:00:13.759> went<00:00:13.969> just

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
the budget out the window and went just

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.540 
the budget out the window and went just
a<00:00:14.299> little<00:00:14.539> bit<00:00:14.690> crazy<00:00:16.360> with<00:00:17.360> this<00:00:17.689> the<00:00:18.050> Honda

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
seen and it is a process just a little

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.250 
seen and it is a process just a little
bit<00:00:57.280> easier<00:00:57.640> than<00:00:57.820> in<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.030> VX<00:00:58.330> 220<00:00:58.960> or<00:00:59.110> the

Lotus Elise and around 27,000 fan we
have<00:01:22.000> got<00:01:22.240> a<00:01:22.270> bit<00:01:22.450> barmy<00:01:22.720> with<00:01:23.050> the<00:01:23.140> money

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
have got a bit barmy with the money

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.830

certainly<00:01:23.950> compared<00:01:24.430> to<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.610> others<00:01:24.910> but<00:01:25.600> for

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
certainly compared to the others but for

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.660 
certainly compared to the others but for
that<00:01:25.990> money<00:01:26.229> you<00:01:26.320> are<00:01:26.470> getting<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:26.830> very<00:01:27.280> clever

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
that money you are getting a very clever

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.740 
that money you are getting a very clever
piece<00:01:28.030> of<00:01:28.210> kit<00:01:30.450> undergone<00:01:31.450> /<00:01:31.539> a<00:01:31.570> very

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
piece of kit undergone / a very

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.450 
piece of kit undergone / a very
high-tech<00:01:31.990> approach<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:32.920> Roadster<00:01:33.310> so

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
high-tech approach to the Roadster so

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.950 
high-tech approach to the Roadster so
yes<00:01:33.640> we've<00:01:33.789> got<00:01:33.820> a<00:01:33.910> traditional<00:01:34.090> layout<00:01:34.570> -

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
yes we've got a traditional layout -

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.410 
yes we've got a traditional layout -
seems<00:01:35.289> long<00:01:35.590> bonnet<00:01:35.890> rear-wheel<00:01:36.729> drive<00:01:36.759> but

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
seems long bonnet rear-wheel drive but

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.420 
seems long bonnet rear-wheel drive but
at<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.600> front<00:01:37.869> is<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.440> very<00:01:38.740> clever<00:01:38.979> engine

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
at the front is a very clever engine

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.609 
at the front is a very clever engine
it's<00:01:39.820> all<00:01:39.970> of<00:01:40.060> their<00:01:40.180> very<00:01:40.360> clever<00:01:40.660> VTEC<00:01:41.259> unit

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
it's all of their very clever VTEC unit

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.290 
it's all of their very clever VTEC unit
which<00:01:41.800> means<00:01:41.830> it<00:01:42.190> may<00:01:42.310> only<00:01:42.369> give<00:01:42.670> 2<00:01:42.850> litres

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
which means it may only give 2 litres

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.389
