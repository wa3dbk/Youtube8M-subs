00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.670
 1998 will lead me to everyone 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.820
 I wanted to play dota and I asked 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.880
 my friend zadrota how to start playing 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.880
 he said it's almost impossible now 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.119
 get well and on dota well and said that 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.029
 fraternally sell me an invite at the cash register 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.990
 Well, huh, because everyone says that the game 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.680
 okhuitelnaya 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.230
 but I bought probably start the first we 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.579
 see my date from the nickname in the lower left 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.280
 screen corner 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.829
 and of course you can see my bro 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.239
 who shared this with me 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.450
 great game 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.910
 first thing you need to register in the game but 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.399
 not so simple the game will be 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.670
 refuse to regat this pussy in 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.090
 a player like me this will cause an imbalance 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.570
 in teams after three hours of trying me 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.550
 finally threw the game right away 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.760
 show what you are about 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.629
 and greet everyone well and wish 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.629
 good game 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.410
 although who am I 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.590
 I would never wish a successful 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.190
 games because all allies are full of uebans and 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.460
 rakals 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.970
 Well, finally it is time to peak a bunch 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.000
 any uebansky heroes 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.060
 who knows who to choose, but probably 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.190
 I'll take the invoker, because my brother said that 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.880
 he is the easiest to manage 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:36.330
 although I'm a little dumb to play for Persian 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.270
 which looks like a fag is necessary 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:43.140
 to chat about what I mean 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.990
 maybe someone knows that's my first fucking 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.350
 feeling from the game struck me on 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.140
 gag reflex game shit fucking necessary 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.350
 give a friend pussies for such a fuck 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.450
 I'll go to wipe the table from the lessons did not start 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.450
