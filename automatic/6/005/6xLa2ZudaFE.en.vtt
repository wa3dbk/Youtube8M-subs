 for you to create it here in carlos cocina 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.660
 what we do we are going to add all the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.080
 2 flour ingredients we also add 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.080
 sucralose 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.030
 Good Morning 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:09.010
 a quarter passes oil

 pure wonder 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.740
 4 eggs 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.730
 let's go first slow when it 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.780
 incorporate everything 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.780
 we were the power 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:41.259
 let's put the butter in the background 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.450
 I'm going to get a little touch of oil in 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.450
 the background and with a brush 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.740
 we distribute well 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.740
 we add the mixture 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.020
 it has to stay like this point they collapse 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.080
 call that point where one could almost 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.200
 write with this as well as a manga 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.200
 pastry 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.220
 this process of doing it fast because it's 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.220
 that normally tends to get off 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.220
 easily 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.030
 so we have a lot of time in 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.690
 take it to the oven preheated to 180 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.690
 degrees 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.840
 it's ready 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.930
 good ones 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.910
 so here I have the two options already 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.950
 what unmolds another I have it in the 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.990
 paper and how it traditionally tends to 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.700
 come down I know this normally normal that 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.700
 I'll say, I'll put it there 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.090
 the strawberries 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.040
 we put the strawberries remember that the 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.870
 strawberries also like the 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.019
 orange are a good source of vitamin 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:03.390
 c so if we get it is very good and 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.390
 let's put honey bee there 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.930
 we can give our license remember 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.389
 that this is very low in calories and the 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.840
 second alternative was that they take it from 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:16.060
 gift if you have a friend celiac in 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.450
 the same package where we take you to 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.640
 oven 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.640
 and simply with a reason the truth 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.200
 and we do 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.680
 and it can be a good alternative 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:37.480
 also a gift for a friend 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.480
 celia who saw him here in flesh 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:03.170
