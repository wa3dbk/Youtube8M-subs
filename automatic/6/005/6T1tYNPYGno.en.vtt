 originally they want to come out of japan 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.230
 but the original recipe does not suit me that way 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.210
 That's why they taste good 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.450

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.170
 which consists of three participate because 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.000
 no fat and some sugar as well 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.040
 we will still enter it with one 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.979
 pinch salt to refine it properly 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.470
 This time will be nice and soft furniture 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.690
 it's simple and it usually has all the 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.070
 Home ingredients come to mind spontaneously 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.260
 want to bake the children 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.570
 You can also join the day 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.190
 flavors refine the almond aroma 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.390
 lemon zest vanilla 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.130
 but I'll show you this today 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.159
 basic recipe and we start with the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.700
 ingredients for the butter cookies 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:43.479
 we needed to drink 200 grams of butter 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:47.590
 100 grams of sugar a pinch of salt and 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.270
 two yolks for the production of the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.229
 I will give the dough first thing now 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.670
 You make flour on the church surface like that 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.439
 a little cool into it 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.100
 then I can put that all in it 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.100
 give 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:14.569
 and also the pinch of salt and sugar 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.730
 and then I give the butter 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.129
 Add and knead now everyone 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.549
 ingredients by hand to a beautiful 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.549
 part 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.780
 if you turn the ingredients into a smooth one 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.700
 dough kneaded after party in 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.799
 wrapper and make the 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.810
 refrigerator so that the at least Hungary 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.819
 for an hour better for two hours 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.319
 even better over night but if you 're with 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.120
 cook cookies for the children yes 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.519
 do not be worried the next day 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.959
 so I was an hour in the 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.340
 Incidentally you can dough very well 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.609
 Freeze like any other citizen 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.510
 also shows the gas station can now 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.609
 we catch up 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.340
 I do that with a silicone 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.510
 Hollstadt because david haye stays and 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.069
 Of course we will need that too 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.269
 cookie cutter with a few butter cookies 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.970
 outdo 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:34.450
 for the tennis you will find of course 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.980
 a bear cookie cutter and easily to be 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.650
 that will come later in the 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.230
 arms from the city â€‹â€‹and around the eyes and 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.939
 to cut out your nose you need 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.430
 For example, it's easy to be over the top 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.430
 was the generation or a pun 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.750
 if you clean the dough evenly 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.709
 then you can start the kicks 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.209
 outdo 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.069
 I'll show you now how I like this man 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.549
 and cellphone I have taken for it 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:05.859
 me just the defense of Stecher and 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:08.349
 I stand a bird would be out and then 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.870
 Can you just give him a whole almond 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.889
 or any other walnut eg 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.229
 to lay in your arms 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:19.630
 I find the one they just am 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:23.349
 lowest and then I put him 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:29.289
 just yet with his wheelchair a 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:31.610
 few eyes and a little nose 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.689
 and you've already got this easy 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.689
 cute left 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:48.360
 the butter cookies come at 180 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.699
 degree top and bottom heat in the 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.919
 preheated oven and must there ever 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.990
 baked to size about 10 minutes 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.759
 when the wall comes to gold 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.379
 then they are done not too dark 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:58.919
 fear because they no longer taste 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:00.689
 so good 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.669
 it is not synonymous with this recipe 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:04.499
 it is necessary that we do it again before 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.419
 can not stand it 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:07.919
 This time it does not work because 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.169
 some other biscuits is that sometimes 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.180
 important and due to the short construction time 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.189
 you do not yet misjudge us 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.659
 and now if she brings me 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:20.520
 still the rest finished in the under 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:22.139
 cookies are ready baked then give 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.129
 you just click an explicit and 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:24.479
 let it cool 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:26.219
 they are still very much in the beginning 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:28.289
 fragile but once cooled 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:29.550
 if you're pretty stable you can 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.289
 can also do without 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.879
 the butter nonsense piece really 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.770
 Puttrich paid worked so ge 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:36.930
 just have to be butter cookies 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.459
 we see he is doing this right 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.080
 you can become cute too 

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:42.149
 very good for nikolaus or too 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.159
 give away christmas if you see 

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:46.409
 I want those biscuits or impact in 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:47.849
 that we do on the second advent 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:49.289
 can decide on packaging 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:51.389
 third advent again 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:52.830
 That's where I make it really pretty 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:54.389
 pralines packaging 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.559
 I hope you liked the video 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:59.059
 I would be, we are indeed at the next 

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:59.059
