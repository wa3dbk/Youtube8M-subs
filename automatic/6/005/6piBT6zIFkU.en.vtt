thought that was going to be the very
first<00:02:20.970> thing<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.390> they<00:02:21.600> nerfed<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.860> know

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
first thing that they nerfed you know

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.190 
first thing that they nerfed you know
some<00:02:23.220> surprise<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.970> waited<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:24.540> long<00:02:24.600> to

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
some surprise that waited this long to

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.790 
some surprise that waited this long to
nerf<00:02:25.500> it

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
nerf it

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.990 
nerf it
because<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.460> IED<00:02:27.000> was<00:02:27.330> extremely

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
because the IED was extremely

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.610 
because the IED was extremely
overpowered<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.300> know<00:02:30.450> like<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.840> cannot<00:02:31.290> get

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
overpowered you know like you cannot get

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.460 
overpowered you know like you cannot get
around<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:32.100> IED<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.230> somebody<00:02:34.230> made<00:02:34.440> a

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
around the IED and somebody made a

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.640 
around the IED and somebody made a
really<00:02:34.920> good<00:02:35.700> video<00:02:36.000> about<00:02:36.570> that<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.530> know

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
really good video about that you know

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.220 
really good video about that you know
saying<00:02:38.010> how<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.580> know<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.150> couldn't<00:02:39.750> jump

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
saying how you know you couldn't jump

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.710 
saying how you know you couldn't jump
over<00:02:40.380> IEDs<00:02:41.100> you<00:02:41.520> couldn't<00:02:41.910> duck<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.390> couldn't

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
over IEDs you couldn't duck you couldn't

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.090 
over IEDs you couldn't duck you couldn't
do<00:02:42.810> anything<00:02:43.140> like<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.680> could<00:02:43.920> on<00:02:44.070> the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
do anything like you could on the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.120 
do anything like you could on the
bouncing<00:02:44.670> Betties<00:02:45.110> when<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.260> know<00:02:46.380> now<00:02:46.590> they

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
bouncing Betties when you know now they

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.250 
bouncing Betties when you know now they
work<00:02:47.370> just<00:02:47.400> like<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:48.030> bounce<00:02:48.330> of<00:02:48.540> Betty's<00:02:48.960> and

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
work just like the bounce of Betty's and

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.280 
work just like the bounce of Betty's and
with<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.460> you<00:02:50.520> know<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.880> IEDs<00:02:51.390> are<00:02:51.420> more

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
with that you know the IEDs are more

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.620 
with that you know the IEDs are more
delay<00:02:52.680> now<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.070> know<00:02:53.460> you<00:02:53.520> can<00:02:53.760> go<00:02:53.910> prone<00:02:54.330> if

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
delay now you know you can go prone if

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.810 
delay now you know you can go prone if
they're<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.080> air<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:56.040> can<00:02:56.250> jump<00:02:56.520> over

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
they're in the air you can jump over

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.880 
they're in the air you can jump over
them<00:02:57.150> so<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.750> has<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:57.960> little<00:02:58.230> more<00:02:58.380> delayed

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
them so it has a little more delayed

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.220 
them so it has a little more delayed
action<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.670> tell<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.600> truth<00:03:00.870> they<00:03:01.050> don't

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230
