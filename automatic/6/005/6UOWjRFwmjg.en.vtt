like<00:04:13.380> this<00:04:13.620> like<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.430> said<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.180> controls

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
like this like I said the the controls

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.210 
like this like I said the the controls
aren't<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.229> best<00:04:16.470> but<00:04:18.079> I<00:04:19.079> think<00:04:19.889> it<00:04:19.950> has<00:04:20.039> a<00:04:20.099> lot

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
aren't the best but I think it has a lot

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.159 
aren't the best but I think it has a lot
of<00:04:20.370> potential<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:23.660> again<00:04:24.660> I'm<00:04:24.780> not<00:04:24.810> going<00:04:25.080> to

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
of potential and again I'm not going to

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.640 
of potential and again I'm not going to
go<00:04:25.560> into<00:04:25.680> full<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.760> playa<00:04:27.270> playa<00:04:27.840> whole<00:04:28.470> lot

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
go into full the playa playa whole lot

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.170 
go into full the playa playa whole lot
of<00:04:28.740> this<00:04:28.860> game<00:04:29.070> but<00:04:29.310> you<00:04:29.729> kind<00:04:29.940> of<00:04:30.000> get<00:04:30.120> the

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
of this game but you kind of get the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.690 
of this game but you kind of get the
idea<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:31.020> autofocus<00:04:31.650> or<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.190> auto<00:04:32.370> look

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
idea the autofocus or the auto look

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.129 
idea the autofocus or the auto look
isn't<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.150> best<00:04:33.300> in<00:04:33.479> this<00:04:33.570> game<00:04:33.630> that's<00:04:34.020> the

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
isn't the best in this game that's the

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.200 
isn't the best in this game that's the
my<00:04:34.560> biggest<00:04:34.919> complaint<00:04:35.280> about<00:04:35.370> this<00:04:35.669> game<00:04:35.849> but

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
my biggest complaint about this game but

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.600 
my biggest complaint about this game but
it<00:04:36.750> does<00:04:36.990> have<00:04:37.139> a<00:04:37.200> lot<00:04:37.380> of<00:04:37.410> potential<00:04:37.800> so<00:04:38.099> those

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
it does have a lot of potential so those

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.060 
it does have a lot of potential so those
