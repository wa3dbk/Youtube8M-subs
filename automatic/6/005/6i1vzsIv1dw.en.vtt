00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
makes a bit more sense because it's a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.450 
makes a bit more sense because it's a
pass<00:00:36.840> rebound<00:00:37.290> or<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.500> puck<00:00:37.649> rebounder<00:00:38.100> I

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.620 
it straight so I kind of liked the idea
of<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.290> already<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:26.159> little<00:01:26.670> bit<00:01:26.759> more<00:01:26.970> and

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
of this already a little bit more and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.690 
of this already a little bit more and

it's really easy to pull back as well so

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.730 
it's really easy to pull back as well so
transport<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.850> really<00:01:33.570> simple<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.350> pick<00:01:34.619> it

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.649 
transport it really simple you pick it
up<00:01:34.829> like<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.220> phones<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:36.270> pretty<00:01:36.450> nicely

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
up like that and phones up pretty nicely

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.109 
up like that and phones up pretty nicely
for<00:01:37.140> they<00:01:37.500> durable<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.610> video<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.060> they

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
for they durable on the video and they

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.730 
for they durable on the video and they
showed<00:01:39.299> something<00:01:39.540> stepping<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.290> with<00:01:40.710> a

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
showed something stepping on it with a

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.160 
showed something stepping on it with a
skate<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.280> didn't<00:01:41.970> break<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.049> can

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
skate and didn't break it all so you can

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.870 
skate and didn't break it all so you can
see<00:01:45.560> pretty<00:01:46.560> durable<00:01:46.799> plastic<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.610> think<00:01:47.790> it's

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
see pretty durable plastic I think it's

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.670 
see pretty durable plastic I think it's
just<00:01:48.000> HDPE<00:01:48.600> which<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.049> what<00:01:49.229> they<00:01:49.350> make<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
just HDPE which is what they make the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.130 
just HDPE which is what they make the
boards<00:01:50.040> at<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.729> hockey<00:01:51.149> rinse<00:01:51.479> out<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.079> I'm

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
boards at the hockey rinse out of so I'm

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.130 
boards at the hockey rinse out of so I'm
going<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.320> show<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.799> use<00:01:53.070> right<00:01:53.220> now<00:01:54.140> this

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
going to show you in use right now this

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.959 
going to show you in use right now this
is<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> first<00:01:55.710> design<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.549> sort<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.850> came

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
is the first design that I sort of came

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.700 
is the first design that I sort of came
up<00:01:57.119> with<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.689> L<00:01:57.930> shape<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.560> have

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
up with it just like L shape and I have

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.499 
up with it just like L shape and I have
the<00:01:58.860> pass<00:01:59.070> rebound<00:01:59.670> right<00:01:59.820> there<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.329> X

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
the pass rebound right there the X

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.420 
the pass rebound right there the X
deviator<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.619> there's<00:02:01.799> something<00:02:02.040> fun<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.280> do

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
deviator so there's something fun to do

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.730 
deviator so there's something fun to do
then<00:02:03.030> also<00:02:03.180> with<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.869> top<00:02:04.229> part<00:02:04.409> there<00:02:04.619> you

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
then also with the top part there you

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.410 
then also with the top part there you
can<00:02:04.860> practice<00:02:05.189> little<00:02:05.399> toad<00:02:05.549> rags<00:02:05.820> going<00:02:06.210> back

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
can practice little toad rags going back

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.389 
can practice little toad rags going back
and<00:02:06.630> forth<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.560> point<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.860> not<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.039> hit<00:02:08.280> it

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
and forth and the point is not to hit it

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.729 
and forth and the point is not to hit it
like<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.849> did<00:02:09.060> right<00:02:09.209> there<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.440> actually

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
like I did right there this is actually

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.280 
like I did right there this is actually
my<00:02:10.830> favorite<00:02:11.009> way<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.340> set<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.610> up<00:02:11.730> because

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
my favorite way to set it up because

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.750 
my favorite way to set it up because
in<00:02:12.439> practice<00:02:12.829> with<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.040> puck<00:02:13.219> in<00:02:13.340> front<00:02:13.370> of<00:02:13.670> me

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
in practice with the puck in front of me

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.479 
in practice with the puck in front of me
and<00:02:13.939> then<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.930> side<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.129> right<00:02:16.250> side

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
and then to the side to the right side

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.399 
and then to the side to the right side
in<00:02:16.700> front<00:02:16.969> again<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.299> practice<00:02:17.870> putting<00:02:18.319> the

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
in front again and practice putting the

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.080 
in front again and practice putting the
pump<00:02:18.620> underneath<00:02:18.890> something<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.849> then<00:02:19.939> also

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
pump underneath something and then also

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.910 
pump underneath something and then also
going<00:02:20.390> straight<00:02:20.750> across<00:02:20.959> that<00:02:21.319> wide<00:02:21.560> movement

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
going straight across that wide movement

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.740 
going straight across that wide movement
and<00:02:22.280> then<00:02:22.370> also<00:02:22.819> practicing<00:02:23.420> with<00:02:23.510> green

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
and then also practicing with green

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.869 
and then also practicing with green
biscuit<00:02:24.109> to<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.500> other<00:02:24.620> side<00:02:24.890> so<00:02:25.519> this<00:02:25.700> is<00:02:25.849> a

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
biscuit to the other side so this is a

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.089 
biscuit to the other side so this is a
great<00:02:26.269> way<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.450> practice<00:02:27.019> this<00:02:27.319> wide<00:02:27.560> wide

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
great way to practice this wide wide

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.289 
great way to practice this wide wide
movements<00:02:28.519> on<00:02:28.640> your<00:02:28.760> forehand<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.150> backhand

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
movements on your forehand and backhand

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.569 
movements on your forehand and backhand
and<00:02:30.079> the<00:02:30.500> quick<00:02:30.680> movements<00:02:31.040> in<00:02:31.129> the<00:02:31.220> forehand

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
and the quick movements in the forehand

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.429 
and the quick movements in the forehand
and<00:02:31.670> backhand<00:02:31.879> and<00:02:32.540> also<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:32.900> can<00:02:33.140> have<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.290> big

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
and backhand and also I can have a big

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.860 
and backhand and also I can have a big
toe<00:02:33.650> drag<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.579> I<00:02:34.609> like<00:02:34.939> practicing<00:02:35.180> that<00:02:35.599> you

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
toe drag so I like practicing that you

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.539 
toe drag so I like practicing that you
know<00:02:35.959> a<00:02:35.989> big<00:02:36.439> toe<00:02:36.620> drag<00:02:36.859> all<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.159> way<00:02:37.250> around

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
know a big toe drag all the way around

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.339 
know a big toe drag all the way around
and<00:02:38.090> so<00:02:38.420> this<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.599> my<00:02:38.689> favourite<00:02:38.989> way<00:02:39.079> to<00:02:39.109> set

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
and so this is my favourite way to set

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.589 
and so this is my favourite way to set
it<00:02:39.379> up<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.799> then<00:02:40.459> I<00:02:40.849> also<00:02:41.060> set<00:02:41.329> it<00:02:41.420> up<00:02:41.540> like

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
it up and then I also set it up like

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.149 
it up and then I also set it up like
this<00:02:41.840> just<00:02:42.049> a<00:02:42.170> crazy<00:02:42.349> little<00:02:42.680> design<00:02:42.950> that<00:02:43.129> I

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
this just a crazy little design that I

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.890 
this just a crazy little design that I
did<00:02:43.219> challenge<00:02:44.030> myself<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.569> use<00:02:44.750> my

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
did challenge myself and use my

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.020 
did challenge myself and use my
imagination<00:02:45.079> and<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:46.310> diamond<00:02:46.639> at<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.790> top

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
imagination and the diamond at the top

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.610 
imagination and the diamond at the top
is<00:02:47.239> a<00:02:47.389> bit<00:02:47.420> challenging<00:02:47.780> this<00:02:48.170> stick<00:02:48.409> handle

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
is a bit challenging this stick handle

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.500 
is a bit challenging this stick handle
through<00:02:48.799> well<00:02:49.340> yeah<00:02:49.459> just<00:02:49.519> some<00:02:49.819> fun<00:02:50.299> things

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
through well yeah just some fun things

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.729 
through well yeah just some fun things
to<00:02:50.629> do<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.019> I'll<00:02:51.109> just<00:02:51.200> keep<00:02:51.319> my<00:02:51.379> overall

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
to do and I'll just keep my overall

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.759 
to do and I'll just keep my overall
opinion<00:02:51.859> down<00:02:52.159> I<00:02:53.379> should<00:02:54.379> give<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.620> good

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
opinion down I should give you a good

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.500 
opinion down I should give you a good
idea<00:02:54.799> of<00:02:55.069> the<00:02:55.220> X<00:02:55.489> deviator<00:02:55.909> what<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.299> can<00:02:56.419> do

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
idea of the X deviator what you can do

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.940 
idea of the X deviator what you can do
with<00:02:56.659> it<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.049> how<00:02:57.379> you<00:02:57.439> don't<00:02:57.560> different

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
with it and how you don't different

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:58.929 
with it and how you don't different
drill<00:02:58.099> so<00:02:58.189> you<00:02:58.280> can<00:02:58.400> do<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:58.639> that<00:02:58.700> sort<00:02:58.909> of

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:58.939 
drill so you can do and that sort of

00:02:58.939 --> 00:02:59.289 
drill so you can do and that sort of
thing

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
thing

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:00.610 
thing
you're<00:02:59.599> going<00:02:59.720> to<00:02:59.780> talk<00:02:59.870> about<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.109> price<00:03:00.349> and

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
you're going to talk about the price and

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.890 
you're going to talk about the price and
my<00:03:01.099> overall<00:03:01.340> thoughts<00:03:01.609> for<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.209> price<00:03:02.419> 100

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
my overall thoughts for the price 100

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.339 
my overall thoughts for the price 100
2995<00:03:03.519> and<00:03:04.519> yeah<00:03:05.000> seems<00:03:05.299> a<00:03:05.389> bit<00:03:05.510> expensive<00:03:05.720> but

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
2995 and yeah seems a bit expensive but

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.050 
2995 and yeah seems a bit expensive but
I<00:03:06.379> guess<00:03:06.620> for<00:03:06.919> such<00:03:07.189> a<00:03:07.220> small<00:03:07.489> market<00:03:07.939> of

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
I guess for such a small market of

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.089 
I guess for such a small market of
hockey<00:03:08.239> training<00:03:08.689> aids<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.590> products<00:03:09.919> tend

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
hockey training aids the products tend

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.409 
hockey training aids the products tend
to<00:03:10.159> be<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.310> bit<00:03:10.370> more<00:03:10.669> expensive<00:03:10.939> than<00:03:11.299> you

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:11.419 
to be a bit more expensive than you

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.559 
to be a bit more expensive than you
normally<00:03:11.540> pay<00:03:11.959> so<00:03:12.709> what<00:03:12.859> it<00:03:12.950> is<00:03:13.069> it's<00:03:13.669> a<00:03:13.970> cheapy

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
normally pay so what it is it's a cheapy

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.330 
normally pay so what it is it's a cheapy
I'm<00:03:14.810> pretty<00:03:15.019> sure<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.859> plastic<00:03:16.040> that

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
I'm pretty sure the the plastic that

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.770 
I'm pretty sure the the plastic that
they<00:03:16.430> use<00:03:16.579> to<00:03:16.790> build<00:03:16.909> it<00:03:17.120> which<00:03:17.449> is<00:03:17.569> very

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
they use to build it which is very

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.930 
they use to build it which is very
durable<00:03:17.989> they<00:03:18.349> also<00:03:18.500> use<00:03:18.829> it<00:03:18.859> for<00:03:19.099> the<00:03:19.579> boards

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
durable they also use it for the boards

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.759 
durable they also use it for the boards
around<00:03:20.060> hockey<00:03:20.569> arenas<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:21.169> they<00:03:21.530> use<00:03:21.620> it<00:03:21.650> for

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
around hockey arenas and they use it for

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.770 
around hockey arenas and they use it for
hockey<00:03:22.040> shooting<00:03:22.370> pads<00:03:22.549> as<00:03:22.699> well<00:03:22.879> I'm<00:03:23.510> very

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
hockey shooting pads as well I'm very

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.390 
hockey shooting pads as well I'm very
durable<00:03:23.959> you<00:03:24.470> can<00:03:24.799> step<00:03:24.979> on<00:03:25.129> this<00:03:25.220> with<00:03:25.340> a

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
durable you can step on this with a

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.949 
durable you can step on this with a
skate<00:03:25.609> it<00:03:25.790> won't<00:03:25.909> break<00:03:26.150> which<00:03:26.599> that's<00:03:26.720> nice

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
skate it won't break which that's nice

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.830 
skate it won't break which that's nice
to<00:03:27.109> see<00:03:27.349> so<00:03:28.180> first<00:03:29.180> I'll<00:03:29.299> say<00:03:29.419> what<00:03:29.599> I<00:03:29.659> don't

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
to see so first I'll say what I don't

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.170 
to see so first I'll say what I don't
like<00:03:29.959> about<00:03:30.019> it<00:03:30.290> I<00:03:31.069> can't<00:03:31.609> really<00:03:31.729> think<00:03:31.849> of

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
like about it I can't really think of

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.449 
like about it I can't really think of
anything<00:03:32.569> bearing<00:03:33.379> the<00:03:33.470> price<00:03:33.680> 1:30<00:03:34.190> it's<00:03:34.430> a

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
anything bearing the price 1:30 it's a

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.849 
anything bearing the price 1:30 it's a
bit<00:03:34.579> expensive<00:03:34.879> very<00:03:35.690> simple<00:03:36.290> very<00:03:36.620> simple

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
bit expensive very simple very simple

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.069 
bit expensive very simple very simple
concept<00:03:37.519> for<00:03:37.760> training<00:03:38.239> but<00:03:38.659> if<00:03:38.959> you're

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
concept for training but if you're

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.569 
concept for training but if you're
looking<00:03:39.349> for<00:03:39.530> something<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:39.829> work<00:03:40.340> on<00:03:40.459> your

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
looking for something to work on your

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:41.800 
looking for something to work on your
stick<00:03:40.729> handling<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:41.359> you<00:03:41.479> want<00:03:41.659> to<00:03:41.720> add

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
stick handling and you want to add

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.479 
stick handling and you want to add
something<00:03:42.079> to<00:03:42.169> your<00:03:42.319> room<00:03:42.500> there's<00:03:43.370> two

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
something to your room there's two

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.830 
something to your room there's two
products<00:03:43.879> out<00:03:44.000> there<00:03:44.030> there's<00:03:44.540> this<00:03:44.659> one

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
products out there there's this one

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.659 
products out there there's this one
there's<00:03:44.989> another<00:03:45.139> one<00:03:45.349> I<00:03:45.560> think<00:03:46.069> I<00:03:46.370> like<00:03:46.549> this

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
there's another one I think I like this

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:49.330 
there's another one I think I like this
one<00:03:46.849> better<00:03:47.030> because<00:03:47.419> this<00:03:48.319> one<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:48.680> can<00:03:48.859> move

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
one better because this one you can move

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.670 
one better because this one you can move
it<00:03:49.459> around<00:03:49.489> pick<00:03:50.120> different<00:03:50.239> angles<00:03:50.870> it<00:03:51.500> gives

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
it around pick different angles it gives

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.619 
it around pick different angles it gives
you<00:03:51.799> a<00:03:51.829> bit<00:03:52.099> more<00:03:52.129> to<00:03:52.609> work<00:03:52.729> with<00:03:53.000> as<00:03:53.209> far<00:03:53.359> as<00:03:53.419> if

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
you a bit more to work with as far as if

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:54.879 
you a bit more to work with as far as if
you<00:03:53.720> want<00:03:53.750> to<00:03:53.930> you<00:03:54.109> know<00:03:54.199> come<00:03:54.500> up<00:03:54.530> with<00:03:54.769> some

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
you want to you know come up with some

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.559 
you want to you know come up with some
crazy<00:03:55.069> scenario<00:03:55.609> if<00:03:55.729> stickhandle<00:03:56.209> around<00:03:56.449> you

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
crazy scenario if stickhandle around you

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.119 
crazy scenario if stickhandle around you
can<00:03:56.689> use<00:03:56.810> this<00:03:57.019> the<00:03:57.739> other<00:03:57.859> one<00:03:57.979> is<00:03:58.099> just

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
can use this the other one is just

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:59.979 
can use this the other one is just
straight<00:03:58.519> and<00:03:58.760> stall<00:03:58.939> it's<00:03:59.150> all<00:03:59.269> fixed<00:03:59.629> so

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
straight and stall it's all fixed so

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.020 
straight and stall it's all fixed so
this<00:04:00.079> one<00:04:00.229> seems<00:04:00.379> a<00:04:00.530> bit<00:04:00.650> easier<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.099> pick<00:04:01.879> up

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
this one seems a bit easier to pick up

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.750 
this one seems a bit easier to pick up
move<00:04:02.269> around<00:04:02.299> and<00:04:02.930> twist<00:04:03.829> and<00:04:04.010> turn<00:04:04.159> and<00:04:04.489> and

move around and twist and turn and and

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.330 
move around and twist and turn and and
sort<00:04:05.120> of<00:04:05.209> create<00:04:05.540> your<00:04:05.569> own<00:04:05.720> stick<00:04:06.379> handling<00:04:06.709> I

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
sort of create your own stick handling I

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.580 
sort of create your own stick handling I
guess<00:04:08.030> obstacles<00:04:08.509> of<00:04:08.599> course<00:04:08.780> so<00:04:09.259> I<00:04:09.319> like<00:04:09.439> that

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
guess obstacles of course so I like that

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.649 
guess obstacles of course so I like that
about<00:04:09.769> it<00:04:09.979> the<00:04:10.220> things<00:04:10.400> I<00:04:10.519> do<00:04:10.609> like<00:04:10.699> I<00:04:11.060> just

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
about it the things I do like I just

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.089 
about it the things I do like I just
like<00:04:11.750> I<00:04:11.840> said<00:04:12.049> it's<00:04:12.259> really<00:04:12.349> easy<00:04:12.620> to<00:04:12.769> pick<00:04:12.949> up

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
like I said it's really easy to pick up

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.390 
like I said it's really easy to pick up
and<00:04:13.280> move<00:04:13.340> around<00:04:13.519> nice<00:04:14.239> and<00:04:14.449> durable<00:04:14.769> I<00:04:15.769> hope

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
and move around nice and durable I hope

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.399 
and move around nice and durable I hope
you<00:04:16.549> players<00:04:16.820> the<00:04:17.419> ability<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:17.780> sort<00:04:18.169> of<00:04:18.259> use

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:18.409 
you players the ability to sort of use

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.699 
you players the ability to sort of use
their

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709

their
janeshia<00:04:19.039> more<00:04:19.340> so<00:04:19.519> instead<00:04:19.699> of<00:04:19.759> just<00:04:19.910> stick

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
janeshia more so instead of just stick

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.759 
janeshia more so instead of just stick
handling<00:04:20.329> around<00:04:20.569> a<00:04:20.630> few<00:04:20.750> pucks<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:21.500> they<00:04:21.620> can

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
handling around a few pucks and they can

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.350 
handling around a few pucks and they can
flip<00:04:21.889> the<00:04:22.039> puck<00:04:22.190> over<00:04:22.340> it<00:04:22.669> they<00:04:22.850> can<00:04:22.970> go<00:04:23.090> under

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
flip the puck over it they can go under

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.330 
flip the puck over it they can go under
the<00:04:23.389> toe<00:04:23.660> grip<00:04:23.900> drag<00:04:24.080> around<00:04:24.380> it<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:24.740> they<00:04:25.190> can

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
the toe grip drag around it and they can

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.830 
the toe grip drag around it and they can
always<00:04:25.460> create<00:04:25.789> their<00:04:26.060> own<00:04:26.150> little<00:04:26.389> obstacle

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
always create their own little obstacle
