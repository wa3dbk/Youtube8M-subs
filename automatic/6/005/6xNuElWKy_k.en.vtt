00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.820
 good morning ehmeya one of the most beautiful 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.929
 representatives of the bromeliad family than 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.150
 so good and hops 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.119
 wonderful plant by children and she 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.500
 extraordinarily beautiful combination of hera 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.070
 green leaves 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.189
 pink so bright saturated inflorescences 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.250
 further flowers that first 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.980
 us red and then the color changes to 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.200
 blue is unusual not only a combination of these 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.300
 flowers on plants I think that everything 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.300
 representatives of the bromeliad family and their 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.640
 mey in particular very unusual it 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.620
 a plant is something mean to me 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.940
 between the plant and although it may be 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.640
 even creepy 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.980
 tough leaves extraordinary escape 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.980
 rolled just such a long tube 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.510
 makes the plant out of range 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.870
 ordinary plants 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.989
 natives of forests and fields 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.030
 South America of course a lot of sun 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.090
 and light and plants extremely 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.840
 photophilous new by virtue of features 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.990
 the structures of their body and accordingly 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.229
 leaf stiffness this plant can 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.939
 stand in relatively poor conditions with 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.600
 light point of view 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.299
 Here in this of course the dignity of these 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.939
 plants it is also not their other species with 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.490
 this plant here this hop binds 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.119
 leaf stiffness is also such a tube 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.159
 visible such a shoot but inflorescence looks 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.560
 completely different different color 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.049
 leaves other color 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.479
 leaves and so on and man 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.700
 inexperienced hardly say that these 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.619
 plants are close relatives but not 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.780
 less so 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.140
 this plant has all the same 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.130
 merits as their previous not all 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.190
 bromeliads 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:01.590
 it's almost epiphytic plants 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:03.900
 and how to care for you dare we plant them in 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.640
 very light chest here if we see 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.790
 on this plant she sits here in such 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.520
 see fibrous ginger thicker 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.150
 This is the best sex spending for such 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.210
 of plants 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.880
 but they can be planted in shredded bark 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.320
 you can plant them sphagnum moss everywhere 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.290
 that feel good 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.660
 Do not forget that excessive watering 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.420
 plants can induce this 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.880
 wonderful long tube can when 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.520
 spraying filled with water 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.160
 so in no case try 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.920
 so that the water in this tube does not remain 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.840
 she will go there inflorescence 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.300
 this plant will quickly fade away 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.990
 will quickly fade because the base 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.480
 can rot 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.790
 so you need to spray the plant 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.130
 every day but make sure that 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.950
 the water pipe did not stagnate in nature 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.990
 plants necessarily water is stored in 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.989
 tube and serves as a source of moisture for 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.980
 many animals and the plant itself but 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.970
 unfortunately there are other conditions in the rooms 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.300
 aired much worse 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.940
 we don't have to keep water inside 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:16.980
 plant which pests dangerous snakes 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.930
 due to the stiffness of the leaves this plant 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.270
 rarely affected by pests 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.730
 except that sometimes aphid sits on inflorescences 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.480
 but it is easy to notice necessary 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.830
 immediately and eliminate need only 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.959
 world feeding to all epiphytic plants 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.120
 they love to be fed feed 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.519
 plants can be and at the root of pouring 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.680
 fertilizer solution directly into the pot can 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.380
 spray the plant on the leaves and you 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.720
 you know that all appetizing forms have leaves 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.560
 absorb moisture very well along with 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.410
 by the military 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.360
 in it getting nutrients 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.849
 such care they will be well behaved 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.120
 feel in your apartment and bring 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.200
 well that's all probably bye all 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.160
 good for you 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.160
 Have a good mood
