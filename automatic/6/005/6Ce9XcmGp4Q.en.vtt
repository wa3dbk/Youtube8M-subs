00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.150
 hello how about I am rich and in this 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.890
 tutorial let's see the different 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.439
 types of faces that can be made 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.630
 change the structure of these here 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.300
 we have four basic figures a 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.030
 circle an oval a square or a 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.950
 rectangle and a kind of triangle to 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.930
 use them as a basis for the faces of 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.590
 our characters we can create more 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.300
 variety and better define your personality 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.040
 first we have the circle this is very 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.379
 useful for making faces of characters 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.570
 juvenile and children either from a 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.400
 baby a child as well as animals cartoon 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.010
 we want them to look innocent and 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.500
 pleasant 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.960
 the oval that is the one that we have been most 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.269
 using is very versatile and can be used 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.670
 for adult or young characters like that 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.440
 as for men and women what I 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.630
 like the oval is that you have more 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.000
 space for the mouth and to do 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.000
 Exaggerated expressions with this one 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.590
 then we have the square rectangle that 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.050
 having the edges of the face more 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.120
 marked shows us strength that is 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.240
 ideal for brave or tough characters 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.070
 and finally there is the triangle that we 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.500
 allows to make faces more delicate 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.970
 ideal for drawing women or characters 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.970
 elegant and mysterious 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.630
 now let's draw the faces one 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.850
 based on one rectangle and the other on a 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.619
 triangle using the guidelines for 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.619
 turn them into a three-quarter view 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.869
 first I'll start by drawing a couple of 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.729
 rectangles the first will have the face 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.619
 looking to the front while the 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.619
 second will be a three-quarter view 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.030
 we put the guidelines 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.150
 and then we put each of the traits 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.840
 first the nose the mouth and now I'm going to 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.840
 draw the eyes 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.549
 let's put a beard 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.349
 if all the features of the 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.659
 character are at the top of 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.849
 rectangle this is to give you more 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:20.930
 space to the chin and that the character 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.930
 see stronger and ruth 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.769
 now I'm going to draw the pills and their 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.769
 hair 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.530
 usually I always start with the 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.860
 part of the hair center and then the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.860
 sides 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.090
 with the other face we do the same 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.330
 first we put the nose and then the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.980
 eyes 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.580
 I'm going to draw them with an expression 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.580
 different 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.780
 and then I put the ear and finally the 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.080
 mouth that this time will be showing the 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.080
 teeth 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.640
 we draw the beard 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.630
 then the pills and again the 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.630
 comb 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.970
 And finally I would draw the chin 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.310
 the details that I missed and the ear 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.730
 and now we are going to draw a face 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.930
 female using a triangle as a base 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.300
 again we started doing two 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.870
 basic figures and their respective lines 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.870
 greek 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.550
 one will be looking straight ahead and the other 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.550
 in three quarters 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.110
 and good as the previous faces 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.080
 I'll start first with my nose and then 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.640
 the eyes to be the female eyes 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.569
 go over the eyelashes doing the edge 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.569
 of the thickest eye 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.720
 now I'm going to draw the mouth 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.720
 we put the eyebrows 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.540
 ears 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.740
 chin 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.740
 and now I'm going to add the camel 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.810
 as you see when using a triangle as a base 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.380
 the edge of the face looks much more 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.380
 delicate 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.150
 for the second face something just what 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:58.449
 same start with the nose and then the 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.449
 eyes 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:13.639
 then added the eyebrows 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:25.400
 the ear and the mouth in which I am going to 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.400
 draw open 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.100
 then I make my chin 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.740
 we add the hair 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.300
 And the neck 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.400
 and ready 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.500
 as you see now you can add variety 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.650
 to your characters using these two forms 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.380
 geometric and well that's all for this 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.210
