00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:08.510 

so<00:00:05.189> here<00:00:05.399> we<00:00:05.520> see<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.880> base<00:00:06.090> of<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:07.520> cranial

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:08.520 
so here we see the base of the cranial

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.150 
so here we see the base of the cranial
cavity<00:00:11.809> here<00:00:12.809> we<00:00:12.960> see<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.440> start<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:14.040> the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
cavity here we see the start of the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.570 
cavity here we see the start of the
spinal<00:00:14.519> cord<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.529> this<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.890> hole<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.310> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
spinal cord so this is the hole in the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.340 
spinal cord so this is the hole in the
base<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.090> skull<00:00:18.359> here<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.840> foramen

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
base of the skull here the foramen

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.420 
base of the skull here the foramen
magnum

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.870 

here<00:00:23.430> we<00:00:23.609> see<00:00:23.820> sinuses<00:00:24.800> filled<00:00:25.800> with<00:00:26.010> air<00:00:28.880> and

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
here we see sinuses filled with air and

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.770 
here we see sinuses filled with air and
the<00:00:30.750> nasal<00:00:30.930> cavities<00:00:34.730> with<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> nasopharynx

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.590 

oropharynx<00:00:39.780> behind<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> mouth<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
oropharynx behind the mouth and the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.200 
oropharynx behind the mouth and the
Ringo<00:00:42.899> pharynx<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:47.129> oral<00:00:47.550> cavities<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
Ringo pharynx the oral cavities in the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.180 
Ringo pharynx the oral cavities in the
tongue<00:00:48.539> here<00:00:49.940> and<00:00:51.200> this<00:00:52.200> structure<00:00:52.950> here<00:00:53.160> is

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
tongue here and this structure here is

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.130 
tongue here and this structure here is
the<00:00:54.350> larynx<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:58.370> of<00:00:59.370> course<00:00:59.640> going<00:01:00.140> through

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
the larynx and of course going through

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.870 
the larynx and of course going through
the<00:01:01.320> larynx<00:01:01.530> down<00:01:02.420> here<00:01:03.949> that<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.190> the<00:01:05.369> airway

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the larynx down here that is the airway

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.370 
the larynx down here that is the airway
and<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:07.140> opening<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> airway<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:09.380> is

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and the opening of the airway here is

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.010 
and the opening of the airway here is
called<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.799> glottis<00:01:14.270> so<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.420> opening<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
called the glottis so the opening of the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.690 
called the glottis so the opening of the
airway<00:01:16.409> first<00:01:16.710> goes<00:01:16.979> down<00:01:17.220> through<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
airway first goes down through the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.570 
airway first goes down through the
larynx<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.619> then<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.799> goes<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.310> down<00:01:21.259> to<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
larynx and then that goes on down to the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.230 
larynx and then that goes on down to the
Shakya<00:01:23.580> go<00:01:24.150> into<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> lungs<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:26.060> what<00:01:27.060> this

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
Shakya go into the lungs and what this

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.999 
Shakya go into the lungs and what this
model<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.630> particularly<00:01:28.020> useful<00:01:28.259> at<00:01:28.590> showing

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
model is particularly useful at showing

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.149 
model is particularly useful at showing
is<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.820> rubber<00:01:30.060> flap<00:01:30.390> here<00:01:30.740> which<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
is this rubber flap here which is the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.789 
is this rubber flap here which is the
epiglottis<00:01:35.090> epiglottis<00:01:36.439> covering<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.590> top

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
epiglottis epiglottis covering the top

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.179 
epiglottis epiglottis covering the top
of<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.189> glottis<00:01:39.710> because<00:01:40.710> behind<00:01:41.159> here<00:01:43.189> this

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
of the glottis because behind here this

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.240 
of the glottis because behind here this
area<00:01:44.579> here<00:01:45.439> is<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.560> esophagus<00:01:48.829> that<00:01:49.829> area

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
area here is the esophagus that area

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.850 
area here is the esophagus that area
there<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:51.750> when<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.140> time<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.380> swallow

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
there so when it's time to swallow

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.330 
there so when it's time to swallow
something<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:55.229> food<00:01:55.500> or<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.860> fluid<00:01:56.070> has<00:01:56.280> to

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
something the food or the fluid has to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.020 
something the food or the fluid has to
go<00:01:56.549> from<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.909> mouth<00:01:57.530> over<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.680> top<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.250> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
go from the mouth over the top of the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.100 
go from the mouth over the top of the
glottis<00:02:00.439> to<00:02:01.439> get<00:02:01.619> into<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.189> esophagus<00:02:03.110> we

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
glottis to get into the esophagus we

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.929 
glottis to get into the esophagus we
don't<00:02:04.350> want<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.920> go<00:02:05.100> down<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.520> wrong<00:02:05.700> way

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
don't want it to go down the wrong way

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.790 
don't want it to go down the wrong way
causing<00:02:06.299> choking<00:02:07.940> so<00:02:08.940> when<00:02:09.119> we<00:02:09.299> swallow<00:02:09.800> the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
causing choking so when we swallow the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.959 
causing choking so when we swallow the
epiglottis<00:02:11.610> goes<00:02:12.209> down

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:13.969 
epiglottis goes down

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:17.869 
epiglottis goes down
over<00:02:14.969> the<00:02:15.090> top<00:02:15.239> of<00:02:15.299> the<00:02:15.510> glottis<00:02:16.760> closing<00:02:17.760> off

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
over the top of the glottis closing off

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.839 
over the top of the glottis closing off
the<00:02:18.030> top<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.510> glottis<00:02:19.219> meaning<00:02:20.219> the<00:02:20.400> food

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
the top of the glottis meaning the food

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.630 
the top of the glottis meaning the food
or<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.120> water<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.840> go<00:02:21.989> straight<00:02:22.260> over<00:02:22.769> the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
or the water can go straight over the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.209 
or the water can go straight over the
epiglottis<00:02:24.560> down<00:02:25.560> into<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.280> esophagus

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:28.219 
epiglottis down into the esophagus

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.809 
epiglottis down into the esophagus
facilitating<00:02:29.219> swallowing<00:02:30.170> without

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
facilitating swallowing without

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.830 
facilitating swallowing without
aspirating<00:02:33.079> into<00:02:34.079> the<00:02:34.260> airway

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
aspirating into the airway

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.709 
aspirating into the airway
after<00:02:36.840> we've<00:02:37.019> swallowed<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:39.120> epiglottis

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:39.719 
after we've swallowed the epiglottis

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:44.690 
after we've swallowed the epiglottis
goes<00:02:39.989> up<00:02:41.629> opening<00:02:42.629> the<00:02:42.719> airway<00:02:43.579> meaning<00:02:44.579> that

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
goes up opening the airway meaning that

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.470 
goes up opening the airway meaning that
we<00:02:44.879> can<00:02:45.090> breathe<00:02:45.329> again<00:02:46.879> this<00:02:47.879> is<00:02:48.060> why<00:02:48.209> it's<00:02:48.389> a

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
we can breathe again this is why it's a

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.059 
we can breathe again this is why it's a
bad<00:02:48.629> idea<00:02:49.079> to<00:02:49.409> try<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.709> talk<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.720> eat<00:02:51.950> at<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
bad idea to try and talk and eat at the

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.669 
bad idea to try and talk and eat at the
same<00:02:53.310> time
