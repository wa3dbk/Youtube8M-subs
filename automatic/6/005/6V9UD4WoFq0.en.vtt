more um I think crit as arcane is good

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.529 
more um I think crit as arcane is good
but<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.220> don't<00:00:26.279> think<00:00:26.519> it's<00:00:26.640> needed<00:00:27.060> as<00:00:27.180> much<00:00:27.210> as

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
like I'm pretty sure frost all isn't it

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.380 
like I'm pretty sure frost all isn't it
as<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.840> science<00:02:57.380> first<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:57.920> root<00:02:58.100> second<00:02:58.640> i'm

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.180 
as a science first and a root second i'm
fairly<00:02:59.660> certain<00:02:59.750> i<00:03:00.170> think<00:03:00.530> i<00:03:00.739> don't<00:03:01.070> know<00:03:01.130> if

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
fairly certain i think i don't know if

fairly certain i think i don't know if
that's<00:03:01.250> true<00:03:01.370> I'm<00:03:01.670> just<00:03:01.760> gonna<00:03:01.910> pretend<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.270> is

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
that's true I'm just gonna pretend it is

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.570 
that's true I'm just gonna pretend it is
true<00:03:02.570> nasty<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:05.380> love<00:03:06.380> frost<00:03:06.620> all<00:03:06.800> as<00:03:06.950> arcane

true nasty I love frost all as arcane

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.460 
true nasty I love frost all as arcane
and<00:03:07.670> fire<00:03:07.820> I<00:03:07.850> think<00:03:08.120> it's<00:03:08.239> one<00:03:09.110> of<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.320> better

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470

spells to get as frost I don't think

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.970 
spells to get as frost I don't think
it's<00:03:11.420> very<00:03:11.450> good<00:03:11.630> because<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.709> ready<00:03:12.860> have
