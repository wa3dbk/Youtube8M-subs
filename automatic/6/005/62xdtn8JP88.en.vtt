 part it doesn't matter the most 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:36.360
 the main thing is that the weather is awesome 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.480
 the smell of the sea is even sand it is of course 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.920
 not the best beach in the army but it 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:48.390
 the most affordable call to breathe 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.250
 admire the beauty just awesome 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.719

 well just need to watch me 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.390
 will be here okay okay we agree i 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.350
 more like a wild beach where there is 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.940
 a lot of vegetation 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.540
 somewhere 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.390
 tom beach usually swim rest so 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:40.100
 that I don't know if you feel but we 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.030
 happy and once again i'm all of us determined 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.030
 pure heart 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.410
 once again my pure heart wish everyone 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.500
 everyone who just believes like that 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.630
 it is important to simply believe what your dream 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.210
 you can really reach you again 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.370
 wish all yours here 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.600
 dreaming they were fulfilled into reality and 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.399
 know it is very important 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.110
 someone is afraid to dream one must say that 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.910
 he has a dream but when you ask about 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.910
 something you dream he is afraid of it 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.670
 say so here I will just give you pure 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.220
 practical advice first don't be afraid 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.830
 tell people what you want because 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.410
 I understand that you are probably afraid 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.940
 evil eye yes how people say in the world 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.250
 jinx it but in that world in which i 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.810
 I am staying as I say more 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.780
 about what I want in life to achieve what I 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.850
 what else do I have? 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.489
 to fulfill my plans I see how 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.060
 people react to what i just 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.310
 man real purposeful and with 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.430
 I can deal when they know 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.620
 my plans i'm not afraid to speak my dream 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.930
 firstly because i'm into it 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:06.560
 I really believe in this, convinced that 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:09.290
 she will have me finish I'm in this 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.630
 really convinced second when i 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.670
 I speak to other people and in my 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.730
 There is confidence in the voice 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.640
 seriously with my intentions then these people a 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.380
 don't know they share this dream together 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.560
 with me they support me 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.110
 someone will say he is from a very difficult pile 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.850
 by and so i want to achieve this well 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.010
 so let me wish good luck 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.730
 okay this is another one 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.590
 additional incentive to achieve 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.870
 your dream second moment when you 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.360
 sound out so you do not have either 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.129
 back but you understood me and a third very much 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.909
 important moment when you pronounce 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:52.129
 Share your dream with someone close to 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:54.940
 by someone you through your own 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.799
 words through their own mouth already 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.440
 projecting this dream into reality yet 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.870
 very important point to think and on paper 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.239
 if you are dreaming about something today 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.890
 it even you talk about it it all 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:11.799
 just some image try to sit down and 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:16.600
 concentrate on writing 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:19.489
 specifically what you want to draw it 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.310
 translate into real image on paper on 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.919

 like a long time ago to make repairs, and 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.800
 think about every detail 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.479
 why do you need to read this if you 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.979
 numbers are needed how much will it be 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:42.020
 cost to limit yourself in terms write 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:44.960
