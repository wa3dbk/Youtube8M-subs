 human psychotropic in boys the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.500
 coop everything i'm going to do a little challenge 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.270
 at the same time commenting on gold for that 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.710
 challenge so I'm going to play scrum 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.619
 general and so I'm going to try to 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.420
 win a general melee with a soul 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.599
 or big so that's the right b20 is 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.300
 reloaded when capacity with kits 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.700
 strict micro orbital station boom hue 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.890
 m and fighting adaf 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.610
 we replay with which I play so with 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.310
 Ghost trumps and bulletproof vest 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.230
 with robustness looters and dexterity 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:51.210
 off game you speak at the same time as 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.809
 the gameplay advances in the video of 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.020
 something that trait that bothers 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.010
 a lot the world a lot the people 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.400
 population 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.820
 not for my part it's the end of 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.129
 world 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.660
 the end of the world which is therefore predicted by 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.270
 the so-called maya that we did not hear 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.950
 both times 2-1 just they are good 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.220
 just to tell us the end of the world 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.290
 especially they are good to be wrong 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.110
 would you have I say that because in half 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.680
 had predicted that the ordaz the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.880
 computers beugrÃ© and all that would be 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.000
 the end of the world but the end of the world a 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.360
 winger really looks at it in 2012 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.070
 soon in 2013 in in two weeks 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.229
 in 2013 and so there was nothing 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:47.430
 back to 2012 when he tells us 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.799
 although considering that they have more room in 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.110
 more leaves then of place I do not 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.250
 do not know what you can not write anymore 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.390
 their calendar 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.909
 they tell us it's the end of the world 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.560
 excuse me me I'll be you I take 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.350
 my little outfit I'm coming I'm taking 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.420
 strains goes crossroads I buy some of 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.670
 a4 sheets and large good 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.030
 tiles and now you buy a pen 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.340
 with and that's gold crowd on a tool that has 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.170
 taken soft 10th end of the world we can more 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.260
 write and a whole game sticks a little 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.510
 on that but maybe it's true after 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.900
 I do not know but I do not believe it 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.720
 all they tell us more metals 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.390
 two months for me as well as some tails 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.790
 after if it happens I would have been wrong 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.030
 it will not matter 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.849
 either we all die a care be you 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.780
 it's his only domesticity you're going to 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.489
 do what 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.069
 a scud me you'll be bored you're going to fart 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:47.150
 a lead you'll go crazy and also 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:50.890
 the planting of americans what does 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:55.480
 cost me the same in the world 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:59.389
 he says I'm going to buy 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.819
 thirty thousand euros bunkers to 30000 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:04.269
 euros so they do not know if the 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.099
 end of the world will come excuse me 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.680
 it is pitiful 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.540
 buy a bunker for the end of the world 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.079
 while they do not know they know 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.340
 not even if it will happen then know 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.340
 if she will not arrive here 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.260
 francis well fucked what 30000 euros 1 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.440
 it hurts so there is some 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.030
 downright their house in everything and for 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.370
 all he go to their families in their 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.989
 bunker with boots retaining a 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.700
 that brakes demand does not happen it will be 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.769
 in front of his TV lightening boxes of 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.209
 preserve 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.500
 it will be a little clearances this 30000 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.530
 euros it's a little pain in the ass of the 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.730
 land frankly I will keep them 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:45.440
 and after after we do not see what 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.420
 goes behind after the end of the world 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.760
 and where we do not see what is happening but 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.630
 companies like bunkers in 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.459
 2012 and in 2000 the computers the 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.709
 bunkers and computers 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.200
 they are full but full of money 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.690
 because there this year since at the end 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.819
 of the world the Americans and others 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.579
 people who think they are buying 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.910
 renderer full bunker 30000euros 30000 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.470
 euros 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.910
 every bank and there are more there 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.829
 have too many people buying 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.100
 bunkers then behind them they make themselves 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:21.229
 gold balls so i can tell it at 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.660
 see again in 2000 it was the same he had 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.550
 the stitches had therefore predicted that 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.090
 computers of regret I wanted to 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.430
 broadband video and after a trick of 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.099
 two Belgian pass existed before but 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:38.780
 a trick of those of the creators 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:41.690
 of computers they decided to 2 10 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.919
 euros to the people who do not 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.780
 pass an ad that they had so before 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.020
 finally found the problem why the 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.810
 computers bugged everything and and the 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.740
 so naive population has increased the 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.440
 health at 7 this false ad and so 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.070
 started buying computers from 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.410
 this creator and so is the creator 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.630
 computers has therefore made itself 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.360
 golden balls her it made them a 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:20.389
 big margin but a fucking margin 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:22.790
 on their beautiful dawn can you too much 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.669
 say on the end of the world until this is 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:28.070
 beast huh frankly done did you 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.050
 think if you do not believe me 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.180
 day are seen Buddhist as you 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.520
 threaten to say it exists everywhere huh 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.500
 you do what you want for my 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.570
 share me I do not believe I support this 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.080
 that they also grow those who do not 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.910
 do not believe after you do as you 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.479
 want it's your life if you like 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:52.100
 snap the money in stuff that that 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:54.260
 can you be serving do like 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.310
 you feel good then we'll go back to 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.039
 little gameplay 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:01.190
 but then you see that I am in very 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:02.720
 good lead with the 27 that 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.690
 the second is just after 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.000
 what he this part was a little faith 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.030
 and there you see yours to apologize 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.630
 gold this part was a bit of a carnage 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.220
 even if I die 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.700
 a dozen times I believe if I 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.580
 remember well 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.080
 yet it remains for me more than that I 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.600
 looking for the last person to 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.420
 murder you'll see I'm going 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.550
 the murder with hours a little trick 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.350
 very impressive that I'm not going to him 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.470
 put a loader but all 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.730
 domains a burst and so this is this 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.810
 Part is over I hope that you 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.610
