00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
there so they'll be on their way to

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.789 
there so they'll be on their way to
maturity<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:57.609> then<00:00:58.609> I've<00:00:59.569> got<00:01:00.039> this<00:01:02.799> carrot

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
maturity and then I've got this carrot

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:05.740 
maturity and then I've got this carrot
right<00:01:04.070> here<00:01:04.370> and<00:01:04.670> when<00:01:04.879> I<00:01:04.910> actually<00:01:05.390> pulled

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
right here and when I actually pulled

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.300 
right here and when I actually pulled
this<00:01:05.900> up<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:06.410> snuck<00:01:06.620> it<00:01:06.740> back<00:01:06.890> in<00:01:07.100> there

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
this up and and snuck it back in there

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.760 
this up and and snuck it back in there
to<00:01:07.760> see<00:01:07.970> what<00:01:08.120> it<00:01:08.210> was<00:01:08.360> doing<00:01:08.590> what<00:01:09.590> you're

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
to see what it was doing what you're

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.890 
to see what it was doing what you're
seeing<00:01:09.980> here<00:01:10.070> is<00:01:10.310> only<00:01:10.670> about<00:01:10.880> that<00:01:11.120> big<00:01:11.180> but

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
seeing here is only about that big but

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.430 
seeing here is only about that big but
then<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:12.200> branches<00:01:12.410> off<00:01:12.890> into<00:01:13.220> two<00:01:13.700> carrots

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
then it branches off into two carrots

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.650 
then it branches off into two carrots
that<00:01:15.440> are<00:01:15.800> probably<00:01:16.310> six<00:01:16.700> inches<00:01:16.970> long<00:01:17.210> so<00:01:17.630> it

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
that are probably six inches long so it

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.190 
that are probably six inches long so it
seems<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.740> be<00:01:18.860> working<00:01:19.280> that<00:01:20.030> they<00:01:20.840> would<00:01:20.990> look

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
seems to be working that they would look

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.840 
seems to be working that they would look
healthy<00:01:21.620> when<00:01:21.770> I<00:01:21.800> pulled<00:01:22.070> it<00:01:22.220> up<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.520> I<00:01:22.640> stuck

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
healthy when I pulled it up and I stuck

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.510 
healthy when I pulled it up and I stuck
it<00:01:22.970> back<00:01:23.000> in<00:01:23.300> there<00:01:23.510> and<00:01:23.680> we<00:01:24.680> shall<00:01:25.010> see<00:01:25.310> how

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
it back in there and we shall see how

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.930 
it back in there and we shall see how
this<00:01:25.700> all<00:01:25.940> works<00:01:26.450> out<00:01:26.660> but<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.140> onions<00:01:27.910> did<00:01:28.910> a

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
this all works out but the onions did a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.740 
this all works out but the onions did a
great<00:01:29.270> job<00:01:29.300> and<00:01:30.340> put<00:01:31.340> one<00:01:31.640> in<00:01:31.850> some<00:01:32.120> salsa<00:01:32.540> last

great job and put one in some salsa last
night<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.290> it<00:01:34.100> very<00:01:34.340> very<00:01:34.580> flavorful<00:01:34.910> so<00:01:35.480> good
