feet<00:03:14.310> over<00:03:14.519> your<00:03:14.550> bolts<00:03:14.879> stop<00:03:15.300> it<00:03:15.450> down<00:03:15.569> the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
feet over your bolts stop it down the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.899 
feet over your bolts stop it down the
board<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.980> know<00:03:17.099> it<00:03:17.280> doesn't<00:03:17.370> always<00:03:17.610> flip

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
board you know it doesn't always flip

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.149 
board you know it doesn't always flip
the<00:03:18.060> exact<00:03:18.330> same<00:03:18.540> way<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:19.290> sometimes<00:03:19.920> we'll

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
the exact same way so sometimes we'll

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.949 
the exact same way so sometimes we'll
flip<00:03:20.340> faster<00:03:20.730> sometimes<00:03:21.030> slower<00:03:21.480> but<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.840> can

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
flip faster sometimes slower but you can

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.030 
flip faster sometimes slower but you can
basically<00:03:22.140> just<00:03:22.379> keep<00:03:22.530> your<00:03:22.620> feet<00:03:22.800> out<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:22.950> the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
basically just keep your feet out of the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.770 
basically just keep your feet out of the
way<00:03:23.159> and<00:03:23.370> watch<00:03:23.610> it<00:03:23.819> as<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.150> grip<00:03:24.300> tape<00:03:24.510> comes

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
way and watch it as the grip tape comes

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.630 
way and watch it as the grip tape comes
around<00:03:25.080> just<00:03:25.650> stomp<00:03:25.860> your<00:03:26.010> feet<00:03:26.159> down<00:03:26.400> on<00:03:26.430> top

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
around just stomp your feet down on top

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.119 
around just stomp your feet down on top
of<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:26.879> make<00:03:27.599> a<00:03:27.659> good<00:03:27.810> way<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.019> do<00:03:28.230> well<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:29.040> get

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
of it make a good way to do well to get

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.619 
of it make a good way to do well to get
used<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.400> watching<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.730> board<00:03:29.940> spins<00:03:30.269> you<00:03:30.540> can

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
used to watching the board spins you can

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.180 
used to watching the board spins you can
do<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.780> stationary<00:03:31.200> standing<00:03:31.650> in<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.830> carpet

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
do it stationary standing in the carpet

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.250 
do it stationary standing in the carpet
or<00:03:32.400> in<00:03:32.640> your<00:03:32.760> driveway<00:03:33.030> anywhere<00:03:33.569> it's<00:03:34.110> just

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
or in your driveway anywhere it's just

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.790 
or in your driveway anywhere it's just
basically<00:03:34.530> pop<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.950> tail<00:03:35.190> down

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
basically pop the tail down

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.800 
basically pop the tail down
smack<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.370> board<00:03:36.580> with<00:03:37.090> your<00:03:37.180> hand<00:03:37.390> and<00:03:37.630> then

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
smack the board with your hand and then

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.150 
smack the board with your hand and then
get<00:03:37.990> the<00:03:38.080> flip<00:03:38.290> going<00:03:38.500> so<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:38.770> way<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:38.950> can

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
get the flip going so that way you can

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.920 
get the flip going so that way you can
be<00:03:39.700> above<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.180> not<00:03:40.210> just<00:03:40.450> see<00:03:40.540> what<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.690> board

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
be above and not just see what the board

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.210 
be above and not just see what the board
looks<00:03:41.140> like<00:03:41.260> while<00:03:41.440> it's<00:03:41.560> spinning<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:42.100> then

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
looks like while it's spinning and then

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.350 
looks like while it's spinning and then
you<00:03:42.310> can<00:03:42.460> move<00:03:42.550> on<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:42.820> flipping<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.180> with<00:03:43.270> your

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
you can move on to flipping it with your

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.580 
you can move on to flipping it with your
feet<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.720> you<00:03:43.840> can<00:03:43.960> definitely<00:03:44.110> learn<00:03:44.380> the

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
feet and you can definitely learn the

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.420 
feet and you can definitely learn the
stationary<00:03:45.130> carpet<00:03:45.580> grass<00:03:47.190> don't<00:03:48.190> get

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
stationary carpet grass don't get

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.530 
stationary carpet grass don't get
frustrating<00:03:48.850> this<00:03:48.940> is<00:03:49.060> one<00:03:49.180> of<00:03:49.210> the<00:03:49.300> hardest

as<00:04:37.890> you<00:04:38.550> can<00:04:38.640> see<00:04:38.820> kickflips<00:04:39.300> are<00:04:39.480> not<00:04:39.600> the

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
as you can see kickflips are not the

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.240 
as you can see kickflips are not the
most<00:04:39.870> consistent<00:04:40.230> trick<00:04:40.680> we've<00:04:41.040> been<00:04:41.130> doing

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
most consistent trick we've been doing

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.370 
most consistent trick we've been doing
it<00:04:41.400> for<00:04:41.550> years<00:04:41.580> and<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.330> still<00:04:42.360> need<00:04:42.810> practice

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
it for years and you still need practice

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.320 
it for years and you still need practice
but<00:04:44.100> it's<00:04:44.460> all<00:04:44.550> about<00:04:44.730> it's<00:04:44.940> about<00:04:45.030> just

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
but it's all about it's about just

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.000 
but it's all about it's about just
always<00:04:45.510> trying<00:04:45.870> to<00:04:45.930> improve<00:04:45.960> your<00:04:46.260> skills<00:04:46.740> and

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
always trying to improve your skills and

always trying to improve your skills and
just<00:04:47.520> to<00:04:47.580> keep<00:04:47.700> at<00:04:47.880> it<00:04:48.200> most<00:04:49.200> common<00:04:49.440> mistakes

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
just to keep at it most common mistakes

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.590 
just to keep at it most common mistakes
with<00:04:49.890> kickflips<00:04:50.310> well<00:04:50.850> first<00:04:51.150> one<00:04:51.300> I<00:04:51.330> think<00:04:51.390> is

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
with kickflips well first one I think is

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.180 
with kickflips well first one I think is
to<00:04:51.780> not<00:04:51.930> flipping<00:04:52.350> bored<00:04:52.500> enough<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:52.980> that

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
to not flipping bored enough and that

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.970 
to not flipping bored enough and that
will<00:04:53.340> definitely<00:04:53.550> stop<00:04:53.970> your<00:04:54.120> motion<00:04:54.480> so<00:04:55.470> how

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
will definitely stop your motion so how

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.460 
will definitely stop your motion so how
would<00:04:56.040> you<00:04:56.220> remedy<00:04:56.460> that<00:04:57.200> if<00:04:58.200> you're<00:04:58.380> not

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
would you remedy that if you're not

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.930 
would you remedy that if you're not
flipping<00:04:58.650> enough<00:04:59.010> then<00:04:59.340> you<00:04:59.460> can<00:04:59.580> just<00:04:59.730> give

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
flipping enough then you can just give

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.750 
flipping enough then you can just give
it<00:05:00.060> a<00:05:00.090> little<00:05:00.210> bit<00:05:00.360> harder<00:05:00.600> flick<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:01.760> if

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
it a little bit harder flick and if

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.950 
it a little bit harder flick and if
living<00:05:02.970> it<00:05:03.090> too<00:05:03.210> much<00:05:03.360> so<00:05:03.420> maybe<00:05:03.750> a<00:05:03.810> little

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
living it too much so maybe a little

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.830 
living it too much so maybe a little
less<00:05:04.170> flick<00:05:04.940> just<00:05:05.940> watch<00:05:06.120> it<00:05:06.150> just<00:05:06.510> watch<00:05:06.660> it

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
less flick just watch it just watch it

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.060 
less flick just watch it just watch it
come<00:05:06.960> around<00:05:07.170> and<00:05:07.350> make<00:05:07.470> sure<00:05:07.500> you<00:05:07.680> time<00:05:07.890> your

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
come around and make sure you time your

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
and it's it's catching it catching it is

another<00:05:20.190> common<00:05:20.400> mistake<00:05:20.580> is<00:05:20.820> not<00:05:21.270> leaning

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
another common mistake is not leaning

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.510 
another common mistake is not leaning
far<00:05:21.870> enough<00:05:22.050> forward<00:05:22.350> so<00:05:22.920> you're<00:05:23.130> flipping

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
far enough forward so you're flipping

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.040 
far enough forward so you're flipping
but<00:05:23.670> your<00:05:23.790> front<00:05:24.090> foot<00:05:24.120> is<00:05:24.270> always<00:05:24.630> landing<00:05:24.960> on

the ground and that's just more about
the<00:05:26.670> commitment<00:05:26.940> and<00:05:27.270> about<00:05:27.810> leaning<00:05:28.140> over

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
the commitment and about leaning over

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
big toe right on the rail that really

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.499 
big toe right on the rail that really
gives<00:06:41.289> you<00:06:41.440> the<00:06:41.770> edge<00:06:42.250> for<00:06:42.909> the<00:06:43.030> right<00:06:43.240> kind<00:06:43.479> of

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:43.509 
gives you the edge for the right kind of

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:45.089 
gives you the edge for the right kind of
motion<00:06:43.720> and<00:06:44.020> the<00:06:44.139> motion<00:06:44.319> is<00:06:44.560> really<00:06:44.860> more<00:06:45.009> of

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:45.099 
motion and the motion is really more of

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:47.279 
motion and the motion is really more of
a<00:06:45.190> rolling<00:06:45.669> motion<00:06:45.699> with<00:06:46.539> your<00:06:46.569> heel<00:06:46.990> rather

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:47.289 
a rolling motion with your heel rather

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:49.499 
a rolling motion with your heel rather
than<00:06:47.470> a<00:06:47.530> flick<00:06:47.979> like<00:06:48.639> the<00:06:48.759> kickflip<00:06:49.150> so<00:06:49.360> it's

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:49.509 
than a flick like the kickflip so it's

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:51.180 
than a flick like the kickflip so it's
more<00:06:49.720> about<00:06:49.870> just<00:06:50.229> getting<00:06:50.740> your<00:06:50.949> board

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190 
more about just getting your board

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.920 
more about just getting your board
spinning<00:06:51.699> and<00:06:51.909> rolling<00:06:52.389> it<00:06:52.449> and<00:06:52.659> getting<00:06:52.780> your

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930 
spinning and rolling it and getting your

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.659 
spinning and rolling it and getting your
foot<00:06:53.050> out<00:06:53.229> of<00:06:53.259> the<00:06:53.440> way<00:06:53.560> watching<00:06:54.460> it<00:06:54.550> come

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:54.669 
foot out of the way watching it come

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:56.700 
foot out of the way watching it come
around<00:06:54.909> as<00:06:55.150> it<00:06:55.270> flips<00:06:55.539> you<00:06:55.810> have<00:06:56.349> a<00:06:56.380> lot<00:06:56.590> more

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
around as it flips you have a lot more

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.140 
around as it flips you have a lot more
room<00:06:56.949> for<00:06:57.130> error<00:06:57.340> on<00:06:57.430> this<00:06:57.639> one<00:06:57.819> because<00:06:57.940> you

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:58.150 
room for error on this one because you

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.790 
room for error on this one because you
don't<00:06:58.479> have<00:06:58.630> to<00:06:58.690> worry<00:06:58.900> about<00:06:59.020> the<00:06:59.380> precise

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
don't have to worry about the precise

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.619 
don't have to worry about the precise
flip<00:07:00.219> so<00:07:00.699> anything<00:07:00.879> to<00:07:01.060> show<00:07:01.150> you<00:07:01.210> a<00:07:01.300> few<00:07:01.449> right
