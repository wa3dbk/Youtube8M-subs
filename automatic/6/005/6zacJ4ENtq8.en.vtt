00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
offend today I'm doing a forged tutorial

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.230 
offend today I'm doing a forged tutorial
which<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.319> will<00:00:07.470> be<00:00:07.770> continuing<00:00:08.250> in<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.730> series

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
which I will be continuing in a series

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.000 
which I will be continuing in a series
for<00:00:09.480> some<00:00:09.780> time<00:00:09.990> but<00:00:10.260> anyway<00:00:10.530> today<00:00:10.830> I'm

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
for some time but anyway today I'm

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.499 
for some time but anyway today I'm
covering<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.429> little<00:00:11.700> aesthetic<00:00:12.150> trick<00:00:12.389> you

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
covering a little aesthetic trick you

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.209 
covering a little aesthetic trick you
can<00:00:12.540> do<00:00:12.809> it's<00:00:13.440> not<00:00:13.530> really<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.769> trick<00:00:14.009> but<00:00:14.130> it's

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
can do it's not really a trick but it's

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.460 
can do it's not really a trick but it's
building<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.820> they<00:00:14.910> are<00:00:15.000> towers<00:00:15.570> now<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.350> make

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
building and they are towers now to make

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.109 
building and they are towers now to make
the<00:00:16.560> base<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:17.010> take<00:00:17.160> one<00:00:17.340> sniper's<00:00:17.760> nest<00:00:17.789> put

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
the base you take one sniper's nest put

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.580 
the base you take one sniper's nest put
it<00:00:18.240> like<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.420> then<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:18.960> take<00:00:19.109> another<00:00:19.289> two

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
it like this then you take another two

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.140 
it like this then you take another two
and<00:00:19.619> put<00:00:20.039> them<00:00:20.160> like<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.609> at<00:00:20.820> 90-degree

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
and put them like this at 90-degree

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.150 
and put them like this at 90-degree
angles<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.350> finish<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.769> off<00:00:22.920> with<00:00:22.949> a

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
angles to it you finish it off with a

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.689 
angles to it you finish it off with a
fourth<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:24.180> makes<00:00:24.420> your<00:00:24.570> base<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.250> you<00:00:26.250> can

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
fourth this makes your base and you can

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.370 
fourth this makes your base and you can
phase<00:00:27.180> these<00:00:27.420> together<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.019> they<00:00:28.080> will<00:00:28.230> have

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
phase these together and they will have

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.580 
phase these together and they will have
a<00:00:28.410> tiny<00:00:28.769> bit<00:00:29.099> less<00:00:29.580> texture<00:00:30.060> lag<00:00:30.269> but<00:00:30.810> then<00:00:31.410> you

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
a tiny bit less texture lag but then you

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.819 
a tiny bit less texture lag but then you
put<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:32.009> 2<00:00:32.430> by<00:00:32.610> 2<00:00:32.640> block<00:00:33.630> or<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> 2<00:00:34.050> by<00:00:34.290> 2<00:00:34.320> short<00:00:34.649> on

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
put a 2 by 2 block or a 2 by 2 short on

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.370 
put a 2 by 2 block or a 2 by 2 short on
them<00:00:34.980> now<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:36.149> can<00:00:36.329> do<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.450> variety<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:37.110> things

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
them now you can do a variety of things

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.720 
them now you can do a variety of things
with<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.770> one<00:00:38.160> thing<00:00:38.399> I'm<00:00:38.550> demonstrating

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
with this one thing I'm demonstrating

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.240 
with this one thing I'm demonstrating
here<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.360> by<00:00:39.480> putting<00:00:39.660> covers<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.860> can<00:00:41.100> make

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
here is by putting covers you can make

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.400 
here is by putting covers you can make
it<00:00:41.340> into<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.910> sort<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.480> Gunners<00:00:42.809> nesta<00:00:43.170> pipes

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
it into a sort of Gunners nesta pipes

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.040 
it into a sort of Gunners nesta pipes
but<00:00:44.090> the<00:00:45.090> car<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.020> itself<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:47.600> freestanding<00:00:48.600> it

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
but the car in itself is freestanding it

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.510 
but the car in itself is freestanding it
has<00:00:49.200> its<00:00:49.379> own<00:00:49.500> structure<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.160> requires

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
has its own structure and it requires

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.760 
has its own structure and it requires
very<00:00:50.910> cheap<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.210> make<00:00:51.539> as<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.320> base<00:00:52.530> it's

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
very cheap to make as just a base it's

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.160 
very cheap to make as just a base it's
only<00:00:53.010> 50<00:00:53.309> bucks<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.730> forge<00:00:53.969> now<00:00:54.629> as<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.930> can

see nice to you from over here now what
is<00:00:57.390> really<00:00:57.750> great<00:00:57.989> about<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.219> fact

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
is really great about this is the fact

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.340 
is really great about this is the fact
that<00:00:59.579> there's<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.300> lot<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.690> do<00:01:00.809> as<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:00.989> see

that there's a lot you can do as you see

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.349 
that there's a lot you can do as you see
i<00:01:01.559> spawned<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.039> bridge<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.640> connects<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.270> it

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
i spawned a bridge it it connects to it

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.910 
i spawned a bridge it it connects to it
perfectly<00:01:03.899> because<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> two<00:01:04.710> by<00:01:04.890> two

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
perfectly because it's on a two by two

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.190 
perfectly because it's on a two by two
now<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:06.150> take<00:01:06.210> another<00:01:06.479> tower<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.049> can

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
now you can take another tower you can

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.010 
now you can take another tower you can
add<00:01:07.320> various<00:01:08.310> platforms<00:01:08.549> up<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.600> make<00:01:09.840> it

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
add various platforms up you can make it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.570 
add various platforms up you can make it
a<00:01:10.049> connecting<00:01:10.530> part<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.920> series<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.220> bridge

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
a connecting part of a series of bridge

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.859 
a connecting part of a series of bridge
if<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.850> don't<00:01:12.060> think<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.510> bridge<00:01:12.689> needs

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
if you don't think the bridge needs

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.300 
if you don't think the bridge needs
support<00:01:13.110> what<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.470> really<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.890> do<00:01:14.070> with<00:01:14.220> it

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
support what I really like to do with it

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.980 
support what I really like to do with it
is<00:01:14.610> sometimes<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.299> will<00:01:15.420> make<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.659> into<00:01:15.750> these

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
is sometimes I will make it into these

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.870 
is sometimes I will make it into these
sniper's<00:01:16.590> nest<00:01:16.619> or<00:01:16.979> gunner<00:01:17.220> towers<00:01:17.700> or

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
sniper's nest or gunner towers or

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.730 
sniper's nest or gunner towers or
watchtowers<00:01:18.509> you're<00:01:19.110> making<00:01:19.380> some<00:01:19.590> kind<00:01:19.710> of

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
watchtowers you're making some kind of

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.109 
watchtowers you're making some kind of
prison<00:01:20.070> map<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.430> maybe<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.729> might<00:01:20.939> be<00:01:21.060> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
prison map and maybe this might be a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.899 
prison map and maybe this might be a
good<00:01:21.150> idea<00:01:21.330> or<00:01:21.570> some<00:01:22.140> kind<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.409> unity<00:01:22.830> base<00:01:23.040> but

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
good idea or some kind of unity base but

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.910 
good idea or some kind of unity base but
I<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.150> take<00:01:24.720> these<00:01:24.930> cover<00:01:25.229> correlations

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
I like to take these cover correlations

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.969 
I like to take these cover correlations
and<00:01:26.159> then<00:01:26.909> phase<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.720> through<00:01:28.229> by<00:01:28.350> 3s<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.829> cut

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
and then phase in through by 3s to cut

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.999 
and then phase in through by 3s to cut
off<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.130> kind<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.759> slit<00:01:30.720> downwards<00:01:31.320> then<00:01:31.829> then

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
off the kind of slit downwards then then

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.340 
off the kind of slit downwards then then
put<00:01:32.220> covers<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:32.729> top<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.150> make<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.299> roof<00:01:33.570> now<00:01:33.810> to

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
put covers on top to make a roof now to

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.780 
put covers on top to make a roof now to
give<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.560> guys<00:01:34.770> an<00:01:34.920> idea<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.280> how<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.579> could

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
give you guys an idea of how you could

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.039 
give you guys an idea of how you could
use<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.240> I've<00:01:36.450> made<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> couple<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.020> things

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
use this I've made a couple of things

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.950 
use this I've made a couple of things
over<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:39.180> also<00:01:39.479> kind<00:01:39.930> of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
over here so this also kind of

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.050 
over here so this also kind of
introduces<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> scaffolding<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.700> i'll<00:01:41.880> talk

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
introduces a scaffolding but i'll talk

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.780 
introduces a scaffolding but i'll talk
about<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.630> little<00:01:42.869> bit<00:01:42.990> later<00:01:43.790> so

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
about that and a little bit later so

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.450 
about that and a little bit later so
you've<00:01:45.180> got<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.869> bridge<00:01:46.259> up<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:47.040> which<00:01:47.280> is

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
you've got this bridge up here which is

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.910 
you've got this bridge up here which is
how<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.670> essentially<00:01:48.180> access<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.899> tower<00:01:49.140> as

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
how you essentially access the tower as

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.889 
how you essentially access the tower as
you<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.159> see<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.610> have<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.360> base<00:01:51.570> there

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
you can see you have the base there

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.410 
you can see you have the base there
which<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.170> seeable<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.280> really<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.240> want

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
which is seeable and I really and I want

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.760 
which is seeable and I really and I want
to<00:01:54.509> show<00:01:54.750> off<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.020> off<00:01:55.200> because<00:01:55.350> it's

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
to show off this off because it's

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.770 
to show off this off because it's
something<00:01:56.009> uses<00:01:56.820> sniper's<00:01:57.270> nest<00:01:57.299> that's<00:01:57.540> kind

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
something uses sniper's nest that's kind

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.870 
something uses sniper's nest that's kind
of<00:01:57.810> unique<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.380> many<00:01:58.500> people<00:01:58.770> use<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.100> but<00:01:59.729> as

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
of unique not many people use it but as

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.520 
of unique not many people use it but as
you<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.119> see<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.719> connect<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.170> here<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.500> a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
you can see you can connect it here to a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.060 
you can see you can connect it here to a
bridge<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.369> bridge<00:02:02.729> leads<00:02:03.329> over<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:04.070> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
bridge and this bridge leads over to the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.550 
bridge and this bridge leads over to the
watchtower<00:02:05.280> now<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.869> great<00:02:07.170> thing<00:02:07.500> for

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
watchtower now it's a great thing for

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.219 
watchtower now it's a great thing for
walkway<00:02:08.280> plus<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.910> very<00:02:09.119> easy<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.479> make<00:02:09.810> which

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
walkway plus is very easy to make which

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.559 
walkway plus is very easy to make which
is<00:02:10.500> great<00:02:10.709> it's<00:02:11.069> not<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.459> detractor<00:02:12.120> from

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
is great it's not a detractor from

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.259 
is great it's not a detractor from
one<00:02:13.200> thing<00:02:13.409> you<00:02:13.499> will<00:02:13.680> have<00:02:13.769> to<00:02:13.890> do<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.249> for<00:02:14.670> two

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
one thing you will have to do is for two

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.770 
one thing you will have to do is for two
of<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:16.340> snipers<00:02:17.340> nests<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:17.790> parallel<00:02:18.239> you

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
of the snipers nests in parallel you

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.899 
of the snipers nests in parallel you
have<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.230> take<00:02:19.739> them<00:02:19.950> down<00:02:19.980> just<00:02:20.159> a<00:02:20.430> touch<00:02:20.639> and

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
have to take them down just a touch and

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.709 
have to take them down just a touch and
forge<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.480> fine<00:02:21.749> edit<00:02:22.079> them<00:02:22.200> now<00:02:23.510> back<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.689> the

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:24.719 
forge so fine edit them now back to the

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.270 
forge so fine edit them now back to the
scaffolding<00:02:25.349> just<00:02:25.530> very<00:02:25.680> quickly<00:02:25.859> the<00:02:26.189> way

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
scaffolding just very quickly the way

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.429 
scaffolding just very quickly the way
you<00:02:26.340> make<00:02:26.609> it<00:02:26.879> is<00:02:26.999> by<00:02:27.060> putting<00:02:27.569> ramps<00:02:28.049> on<00:02:28.290> the

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
you make it is by putting ramps on the

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.720 
you make it is by putting ramps on the
other<00:02:28.590> side<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:28.950> then<00:02:29.040> just<00:02:29.159> adding<00:02:29.459> wharf

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
other side and then just adding wharf

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.020 
other side and then just adding wharf
and<00:02:30.030> wall<00:02:30.239> doubles<00:02:30.629> and<00:02:30.840> for<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.680> like<00:02:32.489> stack

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
and wall doubles and for the like stack

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.000 
and wall doubles and for the like stack
pillars<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.689> suppose<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.049> could<00:02:34.139> say<00:02:34.319> you<00:02:34.799> just

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
pillars I suppose you could say you just

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.789 
pillars I suppose you could say you just
have<00:02:35.129> to<00:02:35.250> add<00:02:35.370> walls<00:02:35.670> up<00:02:36.450> sorry<00:02:36.780> columns<00:02:37.379> and

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
have to add walls up sorry columns and

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.709 
have to add walls up sorry columns and
possibly<00:02:38.519> enter<00:02:38.819> a<00:02:38.849> small<00:02:39.030> spend<00:02:39.450> on<00:02:39.569> choice

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:39.719 
possibly enter a small spend on choice

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.629 
possibly enter a small spend on choice
now<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:40.469> see<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.769> little<00:02:40.980> bit<00:02:41.040> there<00:02:41.250> that

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
now you see that a little bit there that

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.539 
now you see that a little bit there that
will<00:02:41.790> look<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.689> kind<00:02:43.049> of<00:02:43.109> sticking<00:02:43.469> out<00:02:43.709> now

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
will look this kind of sticking out now

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:45.619 
will look this kind of sticking out now
that<00:02:44.609> is<00:02:44.849> the<00:02:44.879> problem<00:02:45.120> with<00:02:45.239> these<00:02:45.359> towers

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
that is the problem with these towers

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.330 
that is the problem with these towers
but<00:02:46.019> there<00:02:46.230> are<00:02:46.319> several<00:02:46.560> ways<00:02:46.829> to<00:02:46.889> counter<00:02:47.280> it

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
but there are several ways to counter it

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.949 
but there are several ways to counter it
but<00:02:47.639> just<00:02:47.879> to<00:02:47.969> show<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.150> how<00:02:48.299> bad<00:02:48.659> it<00:02:48.810> can<00:02:48.900> be

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
but just to show you how bad it can be

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.509 
but just to show you how bad it can be
I'm<00:02:49.650> going<00:02:49.799> to<00:02:49.859> take<00:02:50.010> this<00:02:50.159> and<00:02:50.219> I'm<00:02:50.340> going<00:02:50.489> to

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
I'm going to take this and I'm going to

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:51.949 
I'm going to take this and I'm going to
remove<00:02:50.790> some<00:02:50.819> of<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.180> senior<00:02:51.540> air<00:02:51.689> placed

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
remove some of the senior air placed

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.199 
remove some of the senior air placed
here<00:02:52.139> earlier<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.739> you<00:02:53.699> have<00:02:53.879> this<00:02:54.030> very

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
here earlier and you have this very

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.059 
here earlier and you have this very
ugliest<00:02:54.900> thing<00:02:55.109> that<00:02:55.319> can<00:02:55.469> stick<00:02:55.739> out<00:02:55.889> and

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
ugliest thing that can stick out and

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.409 
ugliest thing that can stick out and
stick<00:02:56.280> in<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.430> air<00:02:56.579> and<00:02:56.760> float<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.150> not<00:02:57.269> look

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
stick in the air and float and not look

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:58.939 
stick in the air and float and not look
very<00:02:57.449> realistic<00:02:57.780> there<00:02:58.349> are<00:02:58.439> four<00:02:58.620> ways<00:02:58.650> to

00:02:58.939 --> 00:02:58.949 
very realistic there are four ways to

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:00.439 
very realistic there are four ways to
counter<00:02:59.219> this<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.969> need<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.180> phase<00:03:00.419> of

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:00.449 
counter this you need the phase of

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:02.270 
counter this you need the phase of
rockin<00:03:01.049> to<00:03:01.199> it<00:03:01.260> naturally<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.889> make<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.159> look

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
rockin to it naturally to make it look

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.099 
rockin to it naturally to make it look
as<00:03:02.430> though<00:03:02.459> it's<00:03:02.639> built<00:03:02.849> into<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.180> ground<00:03:03.389> you

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
as though it's built into the ground you

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.289 
as though it's built into the ground you
can<00:03:04.409> phase<00:03:04.889> it<00:03:05.069> into<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.310> building<00:03:05.819> as<00:03:05.969> it's

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
can phase it into a building as it's

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.640 
can phase it into a building as it's

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
building you can build it into the

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.949 
building you can build it into the
