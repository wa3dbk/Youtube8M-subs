afternoon moves into Gemini it picks up

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.350

on<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.770> conjunction<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.579> Venus<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.030> it

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
on that conjunction to Venus and it

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.060 
on that conjunction to Venus and it
really<00:00:51.539> does<00:00:51.840> set<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.230> stage<00:00:52.440> quite<00:00:52.829> nicely

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070

for<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> weekend<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.000> fun<00:00:54.239> that's<00:00:54.870> right<00:00:55.230> but

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
for a weekend of fun that's right but

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.680 
for a weekend of fun that's right but
before<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.219> get<00:00:56.460> there<00:00:56.789> what<00:00:57.000> happens<00:00:57.449> is

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
before we get there what happens is

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.529 
before we get there what happens is
Taurus<00:00:58.289> which<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.680> my<00:00:58.859> son<00:00:59.190> zine<00:00:59.489> likes<00:01:00.210> its

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
comfort and likes consistency I think

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.780 
comfort and likes consistency I think
yesterday's<00:01:04.199> eclipse<00:01:04.739> shook<00:01:05.100> things<00:01:05.339> up<00:01:05.640> a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
yesterday's eclipse shook things up a

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.520 
yesterday's eclipse shook things up a
little<00:01:05.970> bit<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.450> moon<00:01:06.659> makes<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.080> couple<00:01:07.380> of

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
little bit the moon makes a couple of

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.640 
little bit the moon makes a couple of
hard<00:01:07.890> aspects<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.909> morning<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:09.960> important

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
hard aspects this morning it's important

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.340 
hard aspects this morning it's important
that<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:10.890> don't<00:01:11.340> resist<00:01:12.030> change<00:01:12.600> we<00:01:13.200> don't

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
that we don't resist change we don't

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.410 
that we don't resist change we don't
have<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.710> give<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:14.790> least<00:01:15.000> if<00:01:15.270> we

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
have to give in to it but at least if we

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.270 
have to give in to it but at least if we
neutralize<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.439> i<00:01:16.470> think<00:01:16.619> when<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:16.979> moon

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
neutralize it i think when that moon

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.609 
neutralize it i think when that moon
goes<00:01:17.520> into<00:01:17.820> gemini<00:01:18.240> shortly<00:01:18.720> after<00:01:19.020> five<00:01:19.229> p.m.

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
goes into gemini shortly after five p.m.

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.160 
goes into gemini shortly after five p.m.
east<00:01:19.830> coast<00:01:19.920> time<00:01:20.220> here<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> US<00:01:21.570> we're

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
east coast time here in the US we're

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.539 
east coast time here in the US we're
going<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.439> get<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.710> lightness<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.220> we're

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
going to get the lightness that we're

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.550 
going to get the lightness that we're
looking<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.420> i<00:01:24.600> think<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:25.020> as<00:01:25.200> that

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
looking for and i think that as that

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.340 
looking for and i think that as that
lightness<00:01:26.100> comes<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.790> i<00:01:26.970> think<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
lightness comes in i think that the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.219 
lightness comes in i think that the
change<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.100> fought<00:01:29.549> while<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.750> moon<00:01:30.960> was

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
change that we fought while the moon was

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.679 
change that we fought while the moon was
in<00:01:31.439> Taurus<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.340> perhaps<00:01:32.700> even<00:01:33.060> during<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
in Taurus and perhaps even during the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.080 
in Taurus and perhaps even during the
Eclipse<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.530> kind<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.070> begins<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.579> dissipate

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
Eclipse it kind of begins to dissipate

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.719 
Eclipse it kind of begins to dissipate
and<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.689> change<00:01:36.960> becomes<00:01:37.439> easy<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.490> like

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and the change becomes easy it's like

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.969 
and the change becomes easy it's like
yet<00:01:38.939> all<00:01:39.060> tractor<00:01:39.630> even<00:01:40.290> attractive<00:01:40.799> it's

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
yet all tractor even attractive it's

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.580 
yet all tractor even attractive it's
like<00:01:41.159> falling<00:01:41.579> off<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.479> log<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.470> know

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
like falling off of a log you know

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.280 
like falling off of a log you know
that's<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.430> boom<00:01:45.060> here<00:01:45.689> we<00:01:45.810> go<00:01:45.990> it's

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
that's just like boom here we go it's

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.230 
that's just like boom here we go it's
