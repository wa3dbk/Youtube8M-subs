required ability Tang lied seduce you'll
need<00:00:19.140> five<00:00:19.410> points<00:00:19.859> into<00:00:20.070> climbing<00:00:20.460> which

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
need five points into climbing which

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.120 
need five points into climbing which
will<00:00:20.880> need<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.330> be<00:00:21.570> level<00:00:21.869> well<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.920> could

will need you to be level well you could
technically<00:00:23.430> do<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:23.730> level<00:00:23.939> three<00:00:24.619> so<00:00:25.619> you

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
technically do this level three so you

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.890 
technically do this level three so you
need<00:00:26.369> five<00:00:26.580> points<00:00:26.760> into<00:00:27.060> climbing<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.660> have

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
need five points into climbing to have

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.080 
need five points into climbing to have
one<00:00:28.080> point<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.380> time<00:00:28.410> gliding<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.160> then<00:00:29.970> you

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
one point in time gliding and then you

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.460 
one point in time gliding and then you
can<00:00:30.240> upgrade<00:00:30.359> hang<00:00:30.660> gliding<00:00:30.900> as<00:00:31.050> much<00:00:31.199> as<00:00:31.349> you

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
can upgrade hang gliding as much as you

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.130 
can upgrade hang gliding as much as you
want<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.149> the<00:00:33.149> first<00:00:33.390> thing<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.570> need<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.750> do<00:00:33.930> is

a higher place other way there's not

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.280 
a higher place other way there's not
going<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.650> be<00:01:04.739> very<00:01:04.949> effective

sure that make sure that you don't hang

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.910 
sure that make sure that you don't hang
low<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.049> too<00:01:16.140> long<00:01:16.290> otherwise<00:01:16.439> we've<00:01:16.740> just

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
low for too long otherwise we've just

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.310 
low for too long otherwise we've just
drop<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.340> probably<00:01:17.670> die<00:01:18.200> although<00:01:19.200> I've

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
drop and probably die although I've

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.960 
drop and probably die although I've

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
the situation where they've been hang

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.740 
the situation where they've been hang
right<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.560> long<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.090> they<00:01:24.090> need<00:01:24.540> to

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
right in for so long that they need to

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.899 
right in for so long that they need to
um<00:01:24.930> anything<00:01:25.799> here<00:01:26.070> run<00:01:26.220> out<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.369> stamina<00:01:26.610> so

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
um anything here run out of stamina so

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.719 
um anything here run out of stamina so
here's<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.780> nice<00:01:27.960> place<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.920> what<00:01:29.220> do<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:29.490> is

before you actually start a jumping then

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.060 
before you actually start a jumping then
you<00:01:44.490> jump<00:01:44.790> off<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.270> your<00:01:45.869> hang<00:01:46.020> gliding<00:01:46.229> now

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
you jump off and your hang gliding now

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.550 
you jump off and your hang gliding now
this<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.310> very<00:01:47.490> convenient<00:01:47.880> for<00:01:48.299> getting<00:01:48.560> to

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
this is very convenient for getting to

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.109 
this is very convenient for getting to
other<00:01:49.740> places<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.220> thereby<00:01:50.670> all<00:01:50.820> higher

gliding<00:02:04.200> from<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.649> very<00:02:04.799> high<00:02:04.950> place<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.399> fun

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
gliding from a very high place is fun

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.570 
gliding from a very high place is fun
and<00:02:06.240> then<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.350> kind<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.649> start<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.920> drop<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
and then you kind of start to drop and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.279 
and then you kind of start to drop and
spin<00:02:09.330> uncontrollably

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
spin uncontrollably

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.809 
spin uncontrollably
well<00:02:10.440> not<00:02:10.590> uncontrollably<00:02:11.129> completely<00:02:11.610> but

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
well not uncontrollably completely but

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.809 
well not uncontrollably completely but
so

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
so

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.849 
so
spin<00:02:13.120> luckily<00:02:14.079> enough<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.379> went<00:02:14.530> into<00:02:14.709> the
