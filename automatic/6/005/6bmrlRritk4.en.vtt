00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.000
 Car behind the on the way one 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.939
 mobile pedestal for his customers of 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:27.779

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:50.340
 built in 2000 190 hp diesel looks right 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:50.340
 good international market place in Carinthia 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:59.220
 a final price 249 1000 more 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.220
 10 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.550
 hey 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.550
 flat wool still at the start 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.659
 Not 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.090
 clean in there 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.830
 but be cheap 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.300
 not only 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.300
 sold 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:02.530
 2 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:06.440
 already three o'clock and its hello one 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.270
 little know well yes this is 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.030
 So you have the splendor piece me 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.390
 would sell what did you have 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.390
 presented 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.850
 2000 yes that was an optimal price 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.590
 English but I would have that time 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.340
 look at it closer 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.340
 OK 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.840
 Let's look at my mother 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.410
 schiller what I once where as 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.960
 engine 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.090
 you just have to get the new ps motors 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:57.260
 take care that a little thing over 70 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.260
 liter motor can go 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.250
 investment 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.340
 the other thing as 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.080
 I think 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.950
 written 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.950
 and I think firmly can start 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:24.000
 so need 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:28.920
 Let's go as a listed super that is 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.550
 a super motor 90 ps ps monster needs 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.970
 You say if his years are pretty 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.310
 Well 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:42.120
 So I have no problem so one 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.050
 car times to drive for this price yes 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.050
 that would have to be looked at exactly so 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.050
 ramadan 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:08.840
 so before speed so he is running 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:11.110
 perfect for his age for that he 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.000
 also in whistler he is great 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:18.769
 he can brake also good 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.609
 and he currently has none 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.609
 defects noticed 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.520
 so now let's have a look 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:38.410
 car out there at times 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:41.840
 So here I see mature optimally 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.610
 state yes dirty you can see that too 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.010
 a bit of the mask is almost 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.010
 dropped around is no problem 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:59.480
 So there are a bit wobbly 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:04.580
 then it really sounds like it's not like that 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:07.610
 nice looking at what a beautiful 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.370
 she asked the eagle that 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.660
 start sign perfect 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.730
 so there 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.730
 we also have a good tire 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:21.760
 state systems are also maria then 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:27.150
 you also see that winter tires with 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:31.690
 sign and the turn signal of course 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:34.020
 saturday and drink to a right 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.020
 odd one 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:37.020
 foot patrols 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:49.760
 Yes 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:58.330
 I have a problem I do not seem to have 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:06:01.610
 but that's not good 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:06.730
 what could you go to the post cost 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:10.790
 yes that the appstore is a method one 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:13.360
 i believe with money or looking and if 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.360
 the xoom stops 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:25.929
 look something painted there or 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:28.490
 under it is also very good 

00:06:25.929 --> 00:06:30.770
 optimal 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.860
 So I have the part exactly 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:38.419
 watched 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:41.350
 it got a little bit more out of it 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:46.320
 as should be 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.320
 yes what will you do with minimum limit 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.870
 18 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:58.900
 that's that's turn to four yes how 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:01.840
 said rust and I can not them 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.410
 I can not give much more than 15 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.130
 given 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:14.760
 as I said that's a bit 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:16.230
 rust white rust 1 6 1 6 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.080

 Another customer is satisfied 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:34.229
