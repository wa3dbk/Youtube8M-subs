00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 and it was removed from the ham patties and 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.420
 cheese the idea is that you can cut a 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.890
 mozzarella bar and it tastes great 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.570
 to make the empanadas is going to be what 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.870
 same the only thing I wanted mozzarella 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.150
 and Parmesan then I have no one to 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.010
 grab from mixing mozzarella and 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.470
 parmesan I already have the two cheeses here 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.529
 we can put basil condiments 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.779
 for example or ground chili oregano once 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.150
 that these are mixing well and for 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.820
 a traditional pie the tapas that 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.390
 they buy in the super in the warehouse are 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.270
 approximately 30 grams 30 from 30 to 35 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.800
 grams of cheese this is so it is not 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.380
 imagine that if you want to use 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.370
 mozzarella nothing else would be even 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:48.390
 cheese cube cheese box for 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:52.860
 which we are going to put ham and ham 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.020
 always has the function of covering 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.440
 in coming back and this is going to prevent that after 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.090
 cheese cheese comes out 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.000
 once you are like this turn 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.030
 it's a turned cheese is the guarantee that 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.180
 then you will not lose the cheese outside 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.580
 we're going to wet it arias cristian once 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.080
 that is wet let's put it down 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.020
 little but ends up making a big 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.720
 amount of cheese accord that if you put 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.060
 the cheese in cubes with a spoon 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.619
 between that between each piece of cheese 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.270
 there is a lot of air when it melts later 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.009
 it takes up space and the empanadas are left 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.400
 empty although the cheese is not based outside 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.460
 of the empanada here there are two options 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.220
 let's go to one is the closure for the oven 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.170
 for me to salt these empanadas in your 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.240
 oven in your house that does not have the heat 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.910
 of those who sell empanadas the ovens 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.710
 industrial is to grab the pie and 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.390
 make this closure like this 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.920
 the repulse this 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.920
 Oh no 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.509
 for nothing are the classic to carry 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.610
 baked babies because the guarantee that 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.829
 although the cheese is founded as the closure 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.899
 is up does not escape 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.780
 all the securities that we can have 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.130
 third parties 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.130
 let's go 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.430
 and we close 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.650
 and the empanada is for now I show you 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.650
 to make the fries what you can 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.659
 closing them is thus closed in 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.730
 turn the cheese well in the jaguar and be 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:37.670
 a little bit according to whether the lids are 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.840
 dry water 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:45.740
 it is important not to grab between the two 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.970
 masses the ham this one stops in like this 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.670
 and once it's 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.260
 we can this is another repulse look 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.520
 it's like that 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.550
 easy for people who are not 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.550
 accustomed 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.360
 that's why the classic is what we do 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.640
 usually have this static 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.820
 rich and several times more complicated this 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.830
 It is very simple take the good oven 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.470
 preheat everything we give so 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.250
 simple to everything that gives the oven once 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.470
 who is but who flies who is almost at 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.020
 red live put the empanadas the more 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.540
 quick kitchens less possibilities 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.390
 they open to each pie estrada 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.459
 you have to place it continue to leave a 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.070
 space between each one so that always 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.410
 the heat and this then makes 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.600
 quickly brown 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.120
 Well let the hot oven if 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.890
 you want to make fries that with anyone 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.120
 of the spikes serve directly 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.970
 I have oil 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.650
 160 to 170 degrees do not put 20 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.870
 empanadas because because if you do not go down 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.970
 much the temperature of the oil then 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.390
 20 empanadas start cooking 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.190
 when they float they get browned and they'll be there 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.190
 are you watching them see them or how are they going 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.580
 being here what I manufacture is a 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.620
 weight this is so that it does not float 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.519
 in the products in the oil 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:15.930
 that's just where the 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:19.700
 We put it there well, I present them 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.700
 the empanadas look so to see 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:40.389
 that's why then I'm afraid I do not 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.580
 I want to cheat if these empanadas 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.039
 only I did the only thing he says 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.150
 that did not want to tell them the Chinese is that 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.150
 the rules 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.940
 you do not see them as brightly painted with 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.009
 egg also egg beaten a little bit of 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.380
 eggs on the outside is nothing more for the 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.800
 look so they look more look 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.800
 for nothing 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.420
 and how bad 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.420
 and there 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.700
 of sight 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.590
 Cargadita and in him the love and the love 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:25.100
 they are baked and these are the same but 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:27.640
 described and then each one what more 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.640
 He liked me 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.270
 He pointed out that from 5 to 10 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.639
 and 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.870
 I do not know if it is covered 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.870
 to see silva 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.740
 what I'm saying is that as soon as they cool down 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.750
 those of hams cheeses sounded this is 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.940
 true that ham and cheese pie that 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.440
 it cools the cheese hardens and every 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.600
 time you want it to melt again 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.889
 the cheese is harder that's why you're 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.889
 it's worth cooking 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.630
 spectacular
