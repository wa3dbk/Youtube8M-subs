00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
headset I know that the first one I did

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.440 
headset I know that the first one I did
was<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.769> little<00:00:11.160> bit<00:00:11.280> low<00:00:11.580> so<00:00:12.000> I'm<00:00:12.090> doing<00:00:12.360> it

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
was a little bit low so I'm doing it

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.079 
was a little bit low so I'm doing it
again<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:13.200> give<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.679> idea<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:14.250> what<00:00:14.580> it

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
again to give you the idea of what it

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.620 
again to give you the idea of what it
sounds<00:00:15.630> like<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.529> more<00:00:16.949> accurate<00:00:17.330> way<00:00:18.330> I'm

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
sounds like in a more accurate way I'm

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.450 
sounds like in a more accurate way I'm
not<00:00:18.750> gonna<00:00:18.930> compress<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.680> very<00:00:20.039> much<00:00:20.250> for

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
not gonna compress this very much for

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.099 
not gonna compress this very much for
some<00:00:20.640> reason<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> other<00:00:21.210> microphone<00:00:21.600> test

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
some reason the other microphone test

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.050 
some reason the other microphone test
even<00:00:22.350> though<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.590> has<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:22.920> many<00:00:23.100> views<00:00:23.460> wasn't

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
even though it has so many views wasn't

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.029 
even though it has so many views wasn't
as<00:00:24.150> good<00:00:24.390> it's<00:00:24.689> kind<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.990> low<00:00:25.230> it's<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.859> little

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
as good it's kind of low it's a little

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.710 
as good it's kind of low it's a little
bit<00:00:26.160> compressed<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.970> I'm<00:00:27.119> gonna<00:00:27.269> upload<00:00:27.539> in

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
bit compressed this I'm gonna upload in

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.660 
bit compressed this I'm gonna upload in
the<00:00:27.810> best<00:00:28.080> quality<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.560> possibly<00:00:29.070> can<00:00:29.400> so

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
the best quality I possibly can so

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.550

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
Jeeves you a better idea of what the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.410 
Jeeves you a better idea of what the
fatalities<00:00:32.130> mic<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.550> like<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:33.090> thing's<00:00:33.300> been

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
fatalities mic is like this thing's been

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.330 
fatalities mic is like this thing's been
a<00:00:33.480> trooper<00:00:33.989> for<00:00:34.020> me<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.829> headsets<00:00:35.160> been

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
a trooper for me this headsets been

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.310 
a trooper for me this headsets been
great<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:36.120> been<00:00:36.270> dropped<00:00:36.540> quite<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> few

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.260 
great it's been dropped quite a few
times<00:00:37.620> probably<00:00:38.340> tried<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.670> pull<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.969> cord

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
times probably tried to pull the cord

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.850 
times probably tried to pull the cord
out<00:00:39.329> accidentally<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> bunch<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.410> tech<00:00:40.590> never

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
out accidentally a bunch of tech never

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.799 
out accidentally a bunch of tech never
never<00:00:41.640> once<00:00:42.030> as<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.360> failed

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
never once as it failed

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.319 
never once as it failed
I<00:00:42.930> remember<00:00:43.739> reading<00:00:43.950> reviews<00:00:44.190> how<00:00:44.969> people

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
I remember reading reviews how people

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.940 
I remember reading reviews how people
broke<00:00:45.539> their<00:00:45.570> mic<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.110> couple<00:00:46.410> months<00:00:46.590> well

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
broke their mic in a couple months well

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.440 
broke their mic in a couple months well
guess<00:00:47.460> what<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> had<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:47.850> thing<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:48.329> least

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
guess what I had this thing for at least

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.240 
guess what I had this thing for at least
a<00:00:48.629> year<00:00:48.660> or<00:00:48.960> two<00:00:49.140> now<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.500> nothing<00:00:49.770> wrong<00:00:50.070> with

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
a year or two now is nothing wrong with

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.600 
a year or two now is nothing wrong with
it

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
it

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.850 
it
you<00:00:51.300> just<00:00:51.480> need<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.809> make<00:00:51.960> sure<00:00:52.020> when<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.590> pull

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
you just need to make sure when you pull

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.740 
you just need to make sure when you pull
out<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.160> mic<00:00:53.340> from<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.699> thing<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.420> pull<00:00:54.690> it

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
out the mic from this thing you pull it

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.060 
out the mic from this thing you pull it
out<00:00:54.809> from<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> base<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.680> don't<00:00:55.829> pull<00:00:56.039> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
out from the base and you don't pull it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.520 
out from the base and you don't pull it
out<00:00:56.280> by<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.460> mic<00:00:56.760> boom<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.899> really<00:00:58.230> think<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
out by the mic boom you really think the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.260 
out by the mic boom you really think the
engineers<00:00:58.980> would<00:00:59.160> design<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.609> thing<00:00:59.940> said<00:01:00.210> if

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
engineers would design the thing said if

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.819 
engineers would design the thing said if
you<00:01:00.359> pull<00:01:00.600> out<00:01:00.660> from<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> mic<00:01:01.260> boom<00:01:01.590> it's

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
you pull out from the mic boom it's

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:02.630 
you pull out from the mic boom it's
gonna<00:01:01.949> last

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
gonna last

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.670 
gonna last
no<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.780> mic<00:01:03.960> boom<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.320> thing<00:01:04.559> that's

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
no the mic boom is the thing that's

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.039 
no the mic boom is the thing that's
gonna<00:01:04.860> scrape<00:01:05.339> or<00:01:05.610> snap<00:01:05.909> or<00:01:06.299> bend<00:01:06.570> or<00:01:06.810> break<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
gonna scrape or snap or bend or break a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.020 
gonna scrape or snap or bend or break a
wire<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:08.040> always<00:01:08.159> pull<00:01:08.430> things<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:08.790> by<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
wire you always pull things out by the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.880 
wire you always pull things out by the
base<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:09.930> pulling<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> plug<00:01:10.470> out<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
base it's like pulling a plug out of a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.280 
base it's like pulling a plug out of a
socket<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> wall<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.600> don't<00:01:12.750> pull<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.049> out

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
socket in the wall you don't pull it out

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.550 
socket in the wall you don't pull it out
by<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.530> cord<00:01:14.250> he<00:01:14.460> pull<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.670> up<00:01:14.850> by<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.060> plug<00:01:15.990> at

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
by the cord he pull it up by the plug at

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.890 
by the cord he pull it up by the plug at
the<00:01:16.619> end<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.970> sounds<00:01:18.240> been<00:01:18.420> great<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the end so the sounds been great the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.390 
the end so the sounds been great the
base<00:01:19.080> has<00:01:19.290> been<00:01:19.320> good<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.770> mean<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.220> is

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
base has been good I mean this is

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.310 
base has been good I mean this is
probably<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.180> best<00:01:21.360> head<00:01:21.659> said<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.200> is

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
probably the best head said this is

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.440 
probably the best head said this is
probably<00:01:22.590> gonna<00:01:22.710> be<00:01:22.799> my<00:01:23.400> daily<00:01:23.820> driver<00:01:24.150> for<00:01:24.240> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
probably gonna be my daily driver for a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.780 
probably gonna be my daily driver for a
while<00:01:24.630> now<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.900> had<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> HD<00:01:25.560> 201<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
while now I had the HD 201 this with the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.050 
while now I had the HD 201 this with the
Zalman<00:01:27.780> zm1<00:01:28.080> or<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> Z<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.220> mic<00:01:29.520> one<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.880> think

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
Zalman zm1 or the Z up mic one I think

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.760 
Zalman zm1 or the Z up mic one I think
is<00:01:30.299> what<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.540> called<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.200> while<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
is what it's called for a while but the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.060 
is what it's called for a while but the
mic<00:01:32.700> wasn't<00:01:33.420> very<00:01:33.659> loud<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.890> much

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
mic wasn't very loud and this is much

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.600 
mic wasn't very loud and this is much
nicer

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
nicer

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.810 
nicer
so<00:01:36.479> for<00:01:37.140> gaming<00:01:37.500> I'll<00:01:37.619> use<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.790> some

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
so for gaming I'll use this and for some

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.520 
so for gaming I'll use this and for some
music<00:01:39.060> listening<00:01:39.630> or<00:01:39.750> movie<00:01:39.960> listening<00:01:40.320> maybe

face like I have it now and that way it

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.660 
face like I have it now and that way it
eliminates<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.740> hum<00:02:01.890> by<00:02:02.159> quite<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> bit

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
eliminates the hum by quite a bit

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.859 
almost no hiss like on this mic at all
it's<00:02:07.320> amazing<00:02:07.560> but<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.640> 60<00:02:09.239> cycle<00:02:09.569> hum

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869

it's amazing but the 60 cycle hum
she<00:02:10.319> changes<00:02:10.830> depending<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.280> where<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.459> are

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
she changes depending on where you are

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.470 
she changes depending on where you are
in<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.849> room

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
in the room

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.000 
in the room
it's<00:02:12.810> because<00:02:13.080> it's<00:02:13.200> probably<00:02:13.440> not<00:02:13.560> shielded

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
it's because it's probably not shielded

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.820 
it's because it's probably not shielded
very<00:02:14.250> well<00:02:14.490> from<00:02:14.940> AC<00:02:15.360> power<00:02:15.720> sources<00:02:16.260> so

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
very well from AC power sources so

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.589 
very well from AC power sources so
that's<00:02:17.220> just<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:17.610> technical<00:02:17.940> explanation<00:02:18.510> if

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
that's just a technical explanation if

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.699 
that's just a technical explanation if
you<00:02:18.660> know<00:02:18.750> what<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:18.989> means<00:02:19.200> great<00:02:19.500> if<00:02:19.620> you

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
you know what that means great if you

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.990 
you know what that means great if you
don't<00:02:19.920> that's<00:02:20.099> not<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.340> big<00:02:20.520> deal<00:02:20.550> just<00:02:20.730> know

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
don't that's not a big deal just know
