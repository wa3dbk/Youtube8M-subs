00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
one you want there to be one block in on

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.520 
one you want there to be one block in on
each<00:01:23.729> section<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.659> goes<00:01:24.810> down<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.380> like

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
each section that goes down so it's like

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.350 
each section that goes down so it's like
that<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.490> should<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.790> all<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> deck

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
that so it should be all to the deck

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
trench yeah and there by the way that

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.580 
trench yeah and there by the way that
size<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.479> identical<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.229> side<00:01:43.409> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
size just identical to this side and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.469 
size just identical to this side and
then<00:01:43.770> you'll<00:01:43.950> see<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.579> comes<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.149> blocky

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
then you'll see it comes to that blocky

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.020 
then you'll see it comes to that blocky
over<00:01:45.750> all<00:01:45.990> over<00:01:46.159> come<00:01:47.159> down<00:01:47.369> go<00:01:47.700> over<00:01:47.909> that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
over all over come down go over that

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.190 
over all over come down go over that
block<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.450> it'll<00:01:48.600> carry<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.930> all<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.140> way

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
block and it'll carry on all the way

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.859 
block and it'll carry on all the way
down<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.560> bottom<00:01:50.210> now<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.750> keep

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
down to the bottom now I like to keep

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.929 
down to the bottom now I like to keep
things<00:01:52.049> neat<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.740> just<00:01:53.399> cover<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.729> up

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
things neat so just cover that up

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.420 
things neat so just cover that up
quickly<00:01:54.210> with<00:01:54.390> stone<00:01:56.329> right<00:01:58.159> then<00:01:59.159> do<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
quickly with stone right then do the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.469 
quickly with stone right then do the
same<00:01:59.460> on<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.790> side<00:02:00.259> now<00:02:01.259> m<00:02:02.030> for<00:02:03.030> crops<00:02:03.390> to

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
same on that side now m for crops to

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.999 
same on that side now m for crops to
grow<00:02:03.570> they<00:02:03.840> need<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.170> within<00:02:04.350> eight<00:02:04.680> blocks

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
grow they need to be within eight blocks

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.980 
grow they need to be within eight blocks
of<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.340> water<00:02:05.610> source<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.360> could<00:02:06.689> do<00:02:06.840> without

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
of a water source so I could do without

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.410 
of a water source so I could do without
this<00:02:07.290> one<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:07.890> could<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.129> 16<00:02:08.729> wide<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.330> it

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
this one so this could be 16 wide and it

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.940 
this one so this could be 16 wide and it
would<00:02:09.539> still<00:02:09.780> work<00:02:10.099> look

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
would still work look

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.380 
would still work look
because<00:02:12.400> we<00:02:12.489> don't<00:02:12.640> take<00:02:12.819> up<00:02:12.970> too<00:02:13.180> much<00:02:13.209> space

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
because we don't take up too much space

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.150 
because we don't take up too much space
