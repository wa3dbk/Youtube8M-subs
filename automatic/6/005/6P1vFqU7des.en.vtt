00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
printer world expo into this idea of

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.700 
printer world expo into this idea of
impossible<00:00:10.590> forms<00:00:10.950> like<00:00:11.759> how<00:00:12.380> many<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.559> these

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
impossible forms like how many of these

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.420 
impossible forms like how many of these
are<00:00:14.009> our<00:00:14.910> single<00:00:15.360> sided<00:00:15.599> surfaces<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:16.980> they

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
are our single sided surfaces so they

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.290 
are our single sided surfaces so they
sort<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:17.970> represent<00:00:19.310> non-duality<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.850> unity

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
sort of represent non-duality the unity

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.599 
sort of represent non-duality the unity
of<00:00:21.330> opposites<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.500> on<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.859> they<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
of opposites and so on and they in the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.779 
of opposites and so on and they in the
inside<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.330> outside<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.930> there<00:00:25.289> also

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
inside and the outside and there also

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.570 
inside and the outside and there also
they're<00:00:26.789> very<00:00:27.539> much<00:00:27.779> like<00:00:27.990> vessels<00:00:28.560> like<00:00:28.859> this

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
they're very much like vessels like this

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.970 
they're very much like vessels like this
is<00:00:29.789> Alyssa<00:00:30.090> swimmers<00:00:30.570> again<00:00:31.320> it's<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.740> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
is Alyssa swimmers again it's just the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.840 
is Alyssa swimmers again it's just the
box<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.230> in<00:00:34.230> holes<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.190> whatnot<00:00:35.579> but

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
box and and in holes and whatnot but

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.440 
box and and in holes and whatnot but
it's<00:00:36.540> actually<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:37.020> single<00:00:37.500> surface<00:00:37.770> on<00:00:38.450> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
it's actually a single surface on the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.500 
it's actually a single surface on the
inside<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.079> outside<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.739> ambiguous<00:00:41.510> these

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
inside and outside it's ambiguous these

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.690 
inside and outside it's ambiguous these
basic<00:00:42.930> forms<00:00:43.320> are<00:00:43.469> all<00:00:43.620> inclusive<00:00:44.040> services

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
basic forms are all inclusive services

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.869 
basic forms are all inclusive services
and<00:00:44.910> then<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.270> then<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.930> use<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.640> turbulence<00:00:47.640> and

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
and then and then I use a turbulence and

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.500 
and then and then I use a turbulence and
noise<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.750> then<00:00:49.469> also<00:00:50.059> like<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.480> a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
noise and then also like this is a

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.729 
noise and then also like this is a
derived<00:00:53.719> geometry<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.840> derived<00:00:55.230> from<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
derived geometry it's derived from the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.560 
derived geometry it's derived from the
original<00:00:56.190> surface<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.850> then<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.390> this

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
original surface and then like this

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.400 
original surface and then like this
surface<00:00:58.530> inside<00:00:59.539> that<00:01:00.539> again<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.989> derived

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
surface inside that again is derived

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.189 
surface inside that again is derived
from<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.160> result<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.750> really

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
from the result of that and I really

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.590 
from the result of that and I really
enjoy<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.430> juxtaposition<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> two

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
enjoy the the juxtaposition of the two

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.230 
enjoy the the juxtaposition of the two
things<00:01:06.930> also<00:01:07.380> they<00:01:08.040> really<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:09.060> really

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
things also they really you really

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.660 
things also they really you really
gained<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> lot<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.840> benefits<00:01:10.470> when<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.580> know

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
gained a lot of benefits when you know

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.660 
gained a lot of benefits when you know
often<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.420> procedural<00:01:13.369> sculptures<00:01:14.369> or

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
often with the procedural sculptures or

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.590 
often with the procedural sculptures or
rule-based<00:01:15.360> sculptures<00:01:16.759> random<00:01:17.759> functions

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
rule-based sculptures random functions

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600 
rule-based sculptures random functions
and<00:01:18.750> whatnot<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.740> get<00:01:19.920> things<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.310> are<00:01:20.400> you

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
and whatnot you get things that are you

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.039 
and whatnot you get things that are you
would<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:20.909> never<00:01:21.150> think<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.780> would

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
would just never think of you would

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.700 
would just never think of you would
never<00:01:22.229> imagine<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:23.159> really<00:01:24.110> about<00:01:25.110> sort<00:01:25.680> of

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
never imagine it's really about sort of

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.289 
never imagine it's really about sort of
this<00:01:25.920> idea<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:27.229> establishing<00:01:28.700> rules<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.180> then

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
this idea of establishing rules and then

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.020 
this idea of establishing rules and then
not<00:01:30.509> adhering<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.079> them<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.650> has<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.030> cool

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
not adhering to them it has a cool

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.730 
not adhering to them it has a cool
quality<00:01:33.659> with<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> lot<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.110> these<00:01:34.320> things<00:01:34.619> that

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
quality with a lot of these things that

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.240 
quality with a lot of these things that
are<00:01:35.009> deceptive<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.320> continuous<00:01:37.320> complex

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
are deceptive the continuous complex

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.969 
are deceptive the continuous complex
compound<00:01:38.820> curvature<00:01:41.210> creates<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.299> feeling<00:01:42.509> of

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
compound curvature creates a feeling of

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.920 
compound curvature creates a feeling of
from<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.520> could<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.479> know<00:01:45.689> this

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
from that you could you can know this

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.499 
from that you could you can know this
form<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.530> understand<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.240> it's

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
form you can understand it but it's it's

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.770 
form you can understand it but it's it's
too<00:01:48.720> complex<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:50.149> like<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.509> just

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
too complex you can like this is just

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.170 
too complex you can like this is just
hand<00:01:52.049> sculpted<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.860> yet<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.060> know

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
hand sculpted and yet that it's you know

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.770 
hand sculpted and yet that it's you know
it's<00:01:54.320> procedurally<00:01:55.320> shelled<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.280> then

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
it's procedurally shelled and then

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.840 
it's procedurally shelled and then
you<00:01:57.500> know<00:01:57.650> I<00:01:57.680> have<00:01:58.040> various<00:01:58.460> of<00:01:58.670> the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
you know I have various of the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.120 
you know I have various of the
techniques<00:01:59.360> for<00:01:59.570> poking<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.440> holes<00:02:00.799> and<00:02:00.920> work

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
techniques for poking the holes and work

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.730 
techniques for poking the holes and work
and<00:02:01.670> it's<00:02:02.360> it's<00:02:02.930> designed<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.590> really<00:02:05.740> it's

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
and it's it's designed to really it's

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.040 
and it's it's designed to really it's
unsolvable<00:02:07.280> it's<00:02:07.880> unknowable<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.750> can't

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
unsolvable it's unknowable you can't

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.240 
unsolvable it's unknowable you can't
know<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.289> whole<00:02:09.560> form<00:02:09.830> there's<00:02:10.039> things

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
know the whole form there's things

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.790 
know the whole form there's things
hidden<00:02:10.429> inside<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:11.240> things<00:02:11.840> are<00:02:11.990> implied<00:02:12.380> but

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
hidden inside and things are implied but

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.120 
hidden inside and things are implied but
then<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.190> go<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.459> you<00:02:13.760> can't<00:02:14.060> quite<00:02:14.390> work<00:02:14.690> out

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
then you go and you can't quite work out

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.440 
then you go and you can't quite work out
how<00:02:16.130> it<00:02:16.220> works<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.610> there's<00:02:16.790> places<00:02:17.030> where

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
how it works and there's places where

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.390 
how it works and there's places where
you<00:02:18.020> know<00:02:18.170> there<00:02:18.319> seems<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.709> be<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.830> logic

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
you know there seems to be a logic

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.490 
you know there seems to be a logic
there's<00:02:19.790> holes<00:02:20.030> for<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.540> things<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:21.080> go<00:02:21.260> in
