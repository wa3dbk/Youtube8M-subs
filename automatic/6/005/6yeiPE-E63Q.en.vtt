swim<00:00:15.020> to<00:00:15.230> another<00:00:15.619> cast<00:00:15.920> at<00:00:16.129> ok<00:00:16.550> ok<00:00:16.880> I<00:00:19.210> said<00:00:20.210> he

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
swim to another cast at ok ok I said he

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.759 
swim to another cast at ok ok I said he
had<00:00:20.390> a<00:00:20.419> bit<00:00:20.599> of<00:00:20.630> a<00:00:20.720> funk<00:00:20.960> around<00:00:21.259> before<00:00:21.439> but<00:00:21.740> I

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
had a bit of a funk around before but I

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.950 
had a bit of a funk around before but I
couldn't<00:00:22.009> really<00:00:22.509> determine<00:00:23.509> what's<00:00:23.689> on<00:00:23.869> the

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
couldn't really determine what's on the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.329 
couldn't really determine what's on the
features<00:00:24.140> I<00:00:24.410> felt<00:00:24.589> when<00:00:24.679> I<00:00:24.740> was<00:00:24.890> dragging<00:00:25.220> its

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:25.339 
features I felt when I was dragging its

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.069 
features I felt when I was dragging its
slight<00:00:25.550> differences<00:00:26.119> but<00:00:26.359> when<00:00:26.839> you<00:00:26.929> just

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079 
slight differences but when you just

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:28.509 
slight differences but when you just
mentioned<00:00:27.439> the<00:00:27.499> bang<00:00:27.710> on<00:00:27.919> the<00:00:28.039> Rob<00:00:28.189> took<00:00:28.369> I

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
mentioned the bang on the Rob took I

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.669 
mentioned the bang on the Rob took I
haven't<00:00:28.699> quite<00:00:28.849> got<00:00:29.089> the<00:00:29.300> and<00:00:30.079> quite<00:00:30.380> grasp

what you trying to tell me on that to be

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.360 
what you trying to tell me on that to be
quite<00:00:32.960> honest<00:00:33.320> right<00:00:33.620> I'd<00:00:33.890> only<00:00:34.039> before

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
quite honest right I'd only before

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.310 
quite honest right I'd only before
that's<00:00:34.670> a<00:00:34.820> crucial<00:00:35.180> part<00:00:35.480> of<00:00:35.690> it<00:00:35.840> really<00:00:36.140> in<00:00:36.199> my

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
that's a crucial part of it really in my

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.350 
that's a crucial part of it really in my
mind<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:37.039> very<00:00:37.219> beginning<00:00:37.969> of<00:00:38.059> the<00:00:38.149> Casa

star to the cast I want to know right

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.830 
star to the cast I want to know right
from<00:00:40.520> the<00:00:40.760> moment<00:00:40.850> it's<00:00:41.210> bottom<00:00:41.510> what<00:00:41.660> it's

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
from the moment it's bottom what it's

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.340 
from the moment it's bottom what it's
hit<00:00:42.280> as<00:00:43.280> a<00:00:43.340> cast<00:00:43.760> same<00:00:44.570> with<00:00:44.719> the<00:00:44.809> rig<00:00:44.960> same<00:00:45.199> as

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
hit as a cast same with the rig same as

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.049 
hit as a cast same with the rig same as
when<00:00:45.500> I'm<00:00:45.620> fishing<00:00:45.800> always<00:00:46.370> feather<00:00:46.730> it<00:00:46.879> quite

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
when I'm fishing always feather it quite

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.849 
when I'm fishing always feather it quite
strongly<00:00:47.359> as<00:00:47.719> in<00:00:47.870> casting<00:00:48.260> they<00:00:48.590> start

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
strongly as in casting they start

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.250 
strongly as in casting they start
slurring<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.219> line<00:00:49.370> down<00:00:49.640> yeah<00:00:50.079> few<00:00:51.079> feet

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
slurring the line down yeah few feet

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.110 
slurring the line down yeah few feet

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
fall up with Rod high and just feel it

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.090 
fall up with Rod high and just feel it
down<00:00:56.090> your<00:00:56.300> filler<00:00:56.510> don't<00:00:56.870> you<00:00:57.440> feel<00:00:57.620> a<00:00:57.649> proper

casting hole in the rudders or no yeah
the<00:01:02.960> hardware<00:01:03.500> is<00:01:03.679> it's<00:01:03.829> just<00:01:03.890> like<00:01:04.129> dropping

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
the hardware is it's just like dropping

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.090 
the hardware is it's just like dropping
led<00:01:04.610> on<00:01:04.730> to<00:01:04.760> it<00:01:05.000> onto<00:01:05.390> a<00:01:05.420> break<00:01:05.690> you<00:01:06.530> notice<00:01:06.860> led

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
led on to it onto a break you notice led

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.830 
led on to it onto a break you notice led
earlier<00:01:07.460> that<00:01:07.640> I<00:01:07.790> showed<00:01:08.090> i<00:01:08.240> use<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.540> dumpy

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
earlier that I showed i use the dumpy

lads<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:10.070> wider<00:01:10.280> LEDs<00:01:10.640> rather<00:01:10.910> than<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.240> cast

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
lads the wider LEDs rather than the cast

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
lot more through them as well so the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.230 
lot more through them as well so the
dumpy<00:01:15.380> led<00:01:15.560> you<00:01:16.100> feeling<00:01:16.520> for<00:01:16.640> that<00:01:16.670> donk<00:01:17.000> if

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
dumpy led you feeling for that donk if

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.300 
dumpy led you feeling for that donk if
you<00:01:17.360> don't<00:01:17.510> feel<00:01:17.690> it<00:01:17.720> hit<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.020> bottom<00:01:18.320> chances

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
you don't feel it hit the bottom chances

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.460 
you don't feel it hit the bottom chances
are<00:01:19.400> it's<00:01:19.520> in<00:01:19.610> soft<00:01:19.880> silt<00:01:20.150> or<00:01:20.510> its<00:01:20.720> hit<00:01:20.990> weed<00:01:21.170> am

are it's in soft silt or its hit weed am
i<00:01:21.620> right<00:01:21.740> in<00:01:21.800> thinking<00:01:21.920> when<00:01:22.310> you<00:01:22.340> talk<00:01:22.610> about

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
i right in thinking when you talk about

i right in thinking when you talk about
the<00:01:22.970> hard<00:01:23.180> areas<00:01:23.570> are<00:01:23.960> these<00:01:24.140> just<00:01:24.350> areas

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
the hard areas are these just areas

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.530 
the hard areas are these just areas
where<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.100> fish<00:01:25.280> have<00:01:25.430> actually<00:01:25.850> fed<00:01:26.360> and

where the fish have actually fed and

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.570 
where the fish have actually fed and
cleaned<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.050> area<00:01:27.200> or<00:01:27.560> are<00:01:28.190> we<00:01:28.280> looking<00:01:28.550> for

obvious look around the amount of trees
here<00:01:42.350> yeah<00:01:42.680> trees<00:01:43.130> are<00:01:43.160> very

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
here yeah trees are very

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.220 
here yeah trees are very
well-established<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.570> several<00:01:44.870> years<00:01:45.080> of

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
well-established so the several years of

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.810 
well-established so the several years of
leaves<00:01:45.440> gone<00:01:45.680> into<00:01:45.890> a<00:01:45.950> referee's<00:01:46.400> yes<00:01:46.580> please

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
leaves gone into a referee's yes please

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.970 
leaves gone into a referee's yes please
break<00:01:47.030> down<00:01:47.150> into<00:01:47.660> the<00:01:48.170> dust<00:01:48.410> consult<00:01:49.540> and<00:01:50.980> the

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
break down into the dust consult and the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.810 
break down into the dust consult and the
the<00:01:52.400> firmer<00:01:52.640> areas<00:01:53.180> on<00:01:53.540> a<00:01:53.600> late<00:01:53.840> like<00:01:54.020> this

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
the firmer areas on a late like this

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.280 
the firmer areas on a late like this
just<00:01:55.820> about<00:01:55.940> all<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.270> time<00:01:56.510> it<00:01:56.690> is<00:01:56.720> caused<00:01:57.110> by

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
just about all the time it is caused by

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.380 
just about all the time it is caused by
fish<00:01:57.470> feed<00:01:57.680> and<00:01:57.890> does<00:01:58.310> that<00:01:58.460> silt<00:01:58.730> stay<00:01:59.090> all

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
fish feed and does that silt stay all

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.870 
fish feed and does that silt stay all
year<00:01:59.780> round<00:01:59.810> yeah<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.920> silts<00:02:01.520> there<00:02:01.670> all<00:02:01.790> the

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
year round yeah the silts there all the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.430 
year round yeah the silts there all the
time<00:02:01.910> and<00:02:02.300> just<00:02:02.480> gradually<00:02:02.810> builds<00:02:03.170> up<00:02:03.290> builds

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
time and just gradually builds up builds

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.280 
time and just gradually builds up builds
up<00:02:03.650> builds<00:02:03.800> up<00:02:04.040> and<00:02:04.750> let's<00:02:05.750> have<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.870> cut<00:02:06.050> into

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
up builds up and let's have a cut into

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.360 
up builds up and let's have a cut into
the<00:02:06.380> swim<00:02:06.590> then<00:02:06.710> let's<00:02:06.860> see<00:02:07.040> if<00:02:07.100> we<00:02:07.220> can

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
the swim then let's see if we can

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.809 
the swim then let's see if we can
actually<00:02:08.140> find<00:02:09.140> anything<00:02:09.649> you'll<00:02:10.399> see<00:02:10.609> at<00:02:10.700> the

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
actually find anything you'll see at the

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.449 
actually find anything you'll see at the
end<00:02:10.849> of<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.120> cast<00:02:11.560> just<00:02:12.560> might<00:02:12.799> the<00:02:12.950> casa

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.309 

stop<00:02:16.459> feathering<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.180> strongly<00:02:17.480> lock<00:02:17.989> it<00:02:18.170> up

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
stop feathering it strongly lock it up

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.130 
stop feathering it strongly lock it up
donk<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.310> watch<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.760> rod<00:02:19.910> bang<00:02:20.209> did<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:20.989> see

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
donk and watch the rod bang did you see

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.530 
donk and watch the rod bang did you see
the<00:02:21.260> rod<00:02:21.379> okay<00:02:21.739> see<00:02:22.010> ya<00:02:22.250> there's<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.700> proper<00:02:22.910> I

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
the rod okay see ya there's a proper I

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.759 
the rod okay see ya there's a proper I
will<00:02:23.840> pull<00:02:24.019> the<00:02:24.050> float<00:02:24.319> back<00:02:24.500> along<00:02:24.739> the

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
will pull the float back along the

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.839 
will pull the float back along the
bottom<00:02:25.010> its<00:02:25.550> hit<00:02:25.700> into<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:26.120> soft<00:02:26.390> cell<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:27.849> my

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
bottom its hit into that soft cell so my

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.309 
bottom its hit into that soft cell so my
mind<00:02:29.150> they're<00:02:29.390> just<00:02:29.720> trying<00:02:30.050> get<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.200> bait

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
mind they're just trying get the bait

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.890 
mind they're just trying get the bait
just<00:02:30.500> over<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.769> back<00:02:30.890> of<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.099> silt<00:02:31.450> say<00:02:32.450> Mike

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
just over the back of the silt say Mike

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.780 
just over the back of the silt say Mike
said<00:02:33.140> before<00:02:33.470> got<00:02:33.650> natural<00:02:33.980> food<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.640> got

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
said before got natural food and you got

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.030 
said before got natural food and you got
the<00:02:34.819> firm<00:02:35.060> area<00:02:35.480> yeah<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.230> where<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.800> float<00:02:37.010> is

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
the firm area yeah so where the float is

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.190 
the firm area yeah so where the float is
long<00:02:37.550> as<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:38.239> Baker's<00:02:38.569> past<00:02:38.810> their<00:02:39.019> the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
long as the Baker's past their the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.900 
long as the Baker's past their the
rigors<00:02:39.440> passed<00:02:39.470> there<00:02:39.920> you're<00:02:40.280> on<00:02:40.430> spot<00:02:40.760> on

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
rigors passed there you're on spot on

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.970 
rigors passed there you're on spot on
grandma<00:02:41.360> we<00:02:42.049> need<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.260> be<00:02:42.349> able<00:02:42.410> castrate<00:02:42.830> back

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
grandma we need to be able castrate back

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.509 
grandma we need to be able castrate back
there<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:43.700> simple<00:02:44.360> not<00:02:44.540> on<00:02:45.440> that<00:02:45.769> just<00:02:46.160> lay<00:02:46.340> the

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
there so simple not on that just lay the

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.530 
there so simple not on that just lay the
elastic<00:02:47.060> up<00:02:47.180> against<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.690> line<00:02:47.900> make<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.560> loop

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
elastic up against the line make a loop

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.509 
elastic up against the line make a loop
through<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.599> loop<00:02:50.840> three<00:02:51.110> times<00:02:54.519> lubricate

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
through the loop three times lubricate

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.089 
through the loop three times lubricate
set<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:58.010> pull<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:58.220> up<00:02:58.959> simpler<00:02:59.959> zap<00:03:00.170> nice

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
set and pull it up simpler zap nice

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.880 
set and pull it up simpler zap nice
thing<00:03:01.250> about<00:03:01.310> polar<00:03:01.670> last<00:03:01.819> it<00:03:02.090> breaks<00:03:02.510> easily

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
thing about polar last it breaks easily

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.140 
thing about polar last it breaks easily
if<00:03:03.890> you<00:03:04.010> don't<00:03:04.190> catch<00:03:04.370> anything<00:03:04.579> on<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:04.880> spot

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
if you don't catch anything on that spot

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.759 
if you don't catch anything on that spot
if<00:03:05.299> I<00:03:05.360> don't<00:03:05.480> want<00:03:05.599> to<00:03:05.660> fish<00:03:05.810> there<00:03:06.019> again<00:03:06.319> just

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
if I don't want to fish there again just

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.130 
if I don't want to fish there again just
pull<00:03:06.920> it<00:03:07.010> off<00:03:07.130> pulls<00:03:07.670> off<00:03:07.790> easy<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.720> it's<00:03:08.870> so

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
pull it off pulls off easy and it's so

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.870 
pull it off pulls off easy and it's so
soft<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:09.920> don't<00:03:10.160> have<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.400> worry<00:03:10.549> about<00:03:10.640> your

soft you don't have to worry about your

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.520 
soft you don't have to worry about your
line<00:03:10.970> catching<00:03:11.360> on<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.540> Nazis<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:11.959> cast<00:03:12.200> your

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
line catching on the Nazis you cast your

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.650 
line catching on the Nazis you cast your
largest<00:03:12.799> trip<00:03:13.040> straight<00:03:13.280> over<00:03:13.579> there<00:03:13.730> alright

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
largest trip straight over there alright

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.270 
largest trip straight over there alright
so<00:03:14.780> we've<00:03:14.870> got<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.019> market<00:03:15.319> in<00:03:15.380> place<00:03:15.620> we<00:03:16.250> can

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
so we've got the market in place we can

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.370 
so we've got the market in place we can
castrate<00:03:16.730> back<00:03:17.030> there<00:03:17.209> we've<00:03:17.660> got<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.989> line

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
castrate back there we've got the line

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.140 
castrate back there we've got the line
of<00:03:18.560> trees<00:03:18.799> that<00:03:19.010> we<00:03:19.100> would<00:03:19.220> cast<00:03:19.430> into<00:03:19.790> is<00:03:19.970> just

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
of trees that we would cast into is just

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.140 
of trees that we would cast into is just
in<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:20.359> V<00:03:20.510> of<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.690> trees<00:03:20.959> yeah<00:03:21.670> really<00:03:22.670> useful

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
in the V of the trees yeah really useful

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.240 
in the V of the trees yeah really useful
gadget<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:23.510> found<00:03:23.810> is<00:03:24.019> these<00:03:24.290> line<00:03:24.560> counters<00:03:25.100> I

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
gadget I found is these line counters I

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.090 
gadget I found is these line counters I
use<00:03:26.120> those<00:03:26.389> at<00:03:26.569> this<00:03:26.720> stage<00:03:26.959> when<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:27.709> wind<00:03:27.950> the

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
use those at this stage when I wind the

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.770 
use those at this stage when I wind the
float<00:03:28.310> back<00:03:28.459> in<00:03:28.700> and<00:03:28.910> know<00:03:28.970> exactly<00:03:29.120> how<00:03:29.510> far<00:03:29.750> I

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
float back in and know exactly how far I
