my own business when I stumbled across
what<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.880> thought<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.570> be<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:19.189> Corvette<00:00:20.189> c7<00:00:21.020> and

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020

probably<00:00:24.269> not<00:00:24.449> probably<00:00:24.750> just<00:00:25.230> an<00:00:25.580> exotic<00:00:29.060> but

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060

you've<00:00:50.340> played<00:00:50.940> previous<00:00:51.480> titles<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.199> write<00:00:53.039> a

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
you've played previous titles so write a

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.970 
you've played previous titles so write a
notice<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.780> mean<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.530> lot<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
notice that and I mean a lot of the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.410 
notice that and I mean a lot of the
details<00:00:56.430> down<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> lights<00:00:57.210> and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
details down to the lights and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.170 
details down to the lights and
everything<00:00:57.949> look<00:00:58.949> very<00:00:59.460> similar<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.329> c7<00:01:01.020> now

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
everything look very similar to a c7 now

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.299 
everything look very similar to a c7 now
what<00:01:03.180> first<00:01:03.449> came<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.690> my<00:01:03.870> mind<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.710> c7<00:01:05.250> is

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
what first came to my mind is the c7 is

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.700 
what first came to my mind is the c7 is
a<00:01:05.369> very<00:01:05.790> recent<00:01:06.500> car<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.299> I<00:01:09.299> would<00:01:10.080> think<00:01:10.320> that

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
a very recent car and I would think that

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.620 
a very recent car and I would think that
it<00:01:11.070> takes<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.430> long<00:01:11.580> time<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.939> design<00:01:12.420> these

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
it takes a long time to design these

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.770 
it takes a long time to design these
types<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.049> things<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.530> my<00:01:13.799> idea<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.780> GN

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
types of things so my idea is that GN

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.940 
types of things so my idea is that GN
might<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.140> been<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.380> works<00:01:16.710> with

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
might have been in the works with

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.730 
might have been in the works with
Rockstar<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:18.360> actually<00:01:18.930> come<00:01:19.290> out<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.590> this

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
Rockstar to actually come out with this

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.770 
Rockstar to actually come out with this
really<00:01:20.040> i<00:01:20.970> thought<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.330> was<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.479> pretty

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
really i thought that was just pretty

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.340 
really i thought that was just pretty
cool<00:01:22.020> pointed<00:01:22.740> out<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.490> uh<00:01:23.549> i<00:01:24.450> don't

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
cool pointed out to you and uh i don't

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.260 
cool pointed out to you and uh i don't
know<00:01:25.500> i<00:01:25.590> guess<00:01:25.680> i'll<00:01:26.009> just<00:01:26.040> drive<00:01:26.790> around<00:01:27.030> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
know i guess i'll just drive around a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.690 
know i guess i'll just drive around a
little<00:01:27.390> bit<00:01:27.600> did<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.439> engine<00:01:28.740> upgrade<00:01:29.280> but

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
little bit did the engine upgrade but

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.429 
little bit did the engine upgrade but
seems<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.390> be<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.990> cars<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
seems to be one of the cars with the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.490 
seems to be one of the cars with the
highest<00:01:31.680> ceilings<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.299> game<00:01:33.509> i<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:34.380> did

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
highest ceilings in the game i just did

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.770 
highest ceilings in the game i just did
a<00:01:34.530> little<00:01:34.740> upgrade<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.329> stats<00:01:36.630> on

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
a little upgrade to it and the stats on

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.460 
a little upgrade to it and the stats on
way<00:01:37.020> up<00:01:37.220> leads<00:01:38.220> me<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.700> believe<00:01:39.320> maybe<00:01:40.320> a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
way up leads me to believe maybe a

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.840 
way up leads me to believe maybe a
little<00:01:40.560> bit<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.040> GM<00:01:41.340> product<00:01:41.820> placement<00:01:42.390> here

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
little bit of GM product placement here

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.770 
little bit of GM product placement here
because<00:01:44.850> i<00:01:44.970> mean<00:01:45.119> i<00:01:45.149> don't<00:01:45.360> think<00:01:45.570> they<00:01:45.659> would

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
because i mean i don't think they would

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.210 
because i mean i don't think they would
want<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.259> associated<00:01:46.799> with<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.610> game<00:01:47.930> but

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
want to be associated with this game but

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.249 
want to be associated with this game but
yeah<00:01:50.220> now<00:01:50.640> subliminal<00:01:51.450> advertising<00:01:51.600> like

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
yeah now subliminal advertising like

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.540 
yeah now subliminal advertising like
this<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.829> know

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.740 

you<00:01:55.940> could<00:01:56.530> bring<00:01:57.530> attention<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:58.100> their<00:01:58.340> brand

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
you could bring attention to their brand

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:06.010 
you could bring attention to their brand
so<00:02:02.020> yeah<00:02:03.020> it's<00:02:03.620> about<00:02:03.710> it
