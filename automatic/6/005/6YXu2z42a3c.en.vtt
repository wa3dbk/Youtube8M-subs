00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.530
 we may not be able to interrupt 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.019
 wars but we can stop the 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.610
 wars in our minds and in our 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.400
 own lives 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.210
 love says you have the right to be 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.140
 and the others also taking into account this 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.390
 reality 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.550
 you can kindly decide who 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.399
 live with you or not 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.040
 although we know that most of 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.140
 you can not do much to solve 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.320
 wars between nations 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.719
 you can easily affect the vibration 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.010
 of war by ceasing wars in their 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:44.350
 own lives wars you ask 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.309
 what wars exist in my own 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.460
 life 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.460
 dear ones we would never judge them more 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.710
 we see many wars in their lives to 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.789
 wars between your head and your 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.129
 heart 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.499
 You feel the way you do and try 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.379
 tell themselves that they should not be 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:05.710
 so you go to war with a 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.960
 feeling a belief a perception in 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.840
 instead of saying to themselves 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.290
 well this is an interesting feeling 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.320
 this is an interesting thought you 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.810
 You do not have to like your thoughts. 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.020
 You do not have to like your 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.509
 feelings but you can expect me 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.299
 takes his expression many times in 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:31.090
 particular and simply recognize the 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:34.119
 their right to be until when they are 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.280
 frustrated, sad and angry with 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.799
 envy or with a million other 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.549
 states of being taught to 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.950
 to judge 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.250
 you can just be with the 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.740
 feeling and allow it to exist 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.280
 for it is only by loving something that you 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.799
 they can transform it, say, for example 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.079
 that you are angry 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.770
 instead of trying to push away this feeling 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:02.799
 and pretend they are not telling themselves 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.950
 I'm angry what this anger is 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:08.590
 trying to tell me to do as she 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.759
 trying to tell me to adjust the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.370
 my life 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.740
 She's asking me to be kinder. 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.770
 and honest with someone about 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.280
 my own needs 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.620
 She's telling me that I'm wanting. 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.930
 a more gentle treatment of the 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.360
 understand such feelings of such 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.400
 instead of promoting war and 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.330
 that they do not have the right to 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.880
 exist 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.150
 you accept them, take them to your light and 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.050
 find the love beneath them the same 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.420
 form 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.510
 you do not have to wage war with the 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.480
 others you do not agree with 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.160
 when someone rites the wrong way 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.370
 tell yourself 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.560
 I do not like this person or I do not 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.080
 I like your behavior 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.340
 they have the right to be and I have a 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.570
 right to be 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.640
 and now you move away from them you 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.040
 they express themselves gently and only 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.730
 share their point of view without 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.940
 no attachment whether they agree or not 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.520
 You just live, let live. 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.460
 only you can choose the course of 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.300
 action that seems better but all these 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.950
 actions are kinder than usual. 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.770
 transpires between two humans 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.530
 when they try to submit their 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.170
 own point of view to fit 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.320
 the other or try to accept the point of 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.440
 view of the other so that they adjust will be 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:41.370
 that you can not meet in the middle 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.260
 yes if they can we encourage them more 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.530
 we tell them not to promote war 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.560
 trying to force the other to believe as 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.800
 you or try to force yourself to feel 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.410
 different way they feel 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.170
 all perspectives on this earth has the 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.050
 right to be the trick to being 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.720
 human is to discover the most loving form 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.060
 let them be yourselves 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.209
 while allowing others to be 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.000
 themselves also if all of you 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.790
 can really do it all their 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.989
 world would be reconciled and there would be no 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.419
 wars 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.270
 humanity is very far from this 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.700
 reality and yet you can 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.680
 choose peace in your mind in your 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.229
 heart in your life 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.129
 no matter what the other person is 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.999
 choosing to accept 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:36.569
 God bless you we love you very much 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:36.569
