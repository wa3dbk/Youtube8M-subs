new Apple now in order to play basically
you<00:00:18.000> hold<00:00:18.150> shift<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.990> then<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.320> use<00:00:19.529> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
you hold shift and then you use the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.830 
you hold shift and then you use the

shift-click it into the chest but but
otherwise<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.849> mean<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.420> really

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
otherwise is you just I mean it's really

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.930 
otherwise is you just I mean it's really
intuitive<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.289> just<00:00:31.470> put<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:32.040> use<00:00:32.790> it

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
intuitive you just put you just use it

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.299 
intuitive you just put you just use it
as<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> directional<00:00:33.540> pad<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.170> if<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.920> run<00:00:35.130> into

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
as a directional pad and if you run into

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.940 
as a directional pad and if you run into
a<00:00:35.399> wall<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.969> have<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.149> start<00:00:36.360> all<00:00:36.480> over<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.950> it

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
a wall you have to start all over and it

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.580 
a wall you have to start all over and it
just<00:00:38.219> randomly<00:00:38.820> creates<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.390> apples<00:00:40.320> that

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
just randomly creates the apples that

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.830 
just randomly creates the apples that
you're<00:00:40.710> eating<00:00:40.980> are<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> apples<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.270> think

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
you're eating are the apples I think

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.080 
you're eating are the apples I think
they're<00:00:42.960> apples<00:00:43.370> your<00:00:44.370> snake<00:00:44.550> gets<00:00:44.730> longer

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
they're apples your snake gets longer

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.479 
they're apples your snake gets longer
every<00:00:45.120> time<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.660> eat<00:00:45.809> one<00:00:46.100> until<00:00:47.100> basically

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
every time you eat one until basically

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.290 
every time you eat one until basically
it's<00:00:48.000> unsustainable<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:49.160> you<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:50.430> have<00:00:50.910> you

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
it's unsustainable and you just have you

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.080 
it's unsustainable and you just have you
basically<00:00:51.690> die<00:00:51.870> because<00:00:52.219> you<00:00:53.219> can't<00:00:53.820> avoid

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
basically die because you can't avoid

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.670 
basically die because you can't avoid
running<00:00:54.360> into<00:00:54.510> your<00:00:54.719> own<00:00:54.809> tail<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.410> does

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
running into your own tail and it does

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.770 
running into your own tail and it does
work<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.100> course<00:00:56.309> let<00:00:57.149> me<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.420> run<00:00:57.539> into<00:00:57.660> my

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
work of course let me just run into my

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.479 
work of course let me just run into my
own<00:00:57.899> tail<00:00:58.379> for<00:00:58.620> demonstrations<00:00:59.160> sake<00:00:59.280> not

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
own tail for demonstrations sake not

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.000 
own tail for demonstrations sake not
that<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.670> would<00:00:59.850> ever<00:01:00.000> do<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:01.230> know<00:01:01.410> if<00:01:01.649> I

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
that I would ever do that you know if I

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.820 
that I would ever do that you know if I
was<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.699> playing<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:02.969> my<00:01:03.059> own<00:01:03.350> if<00:01:04.350> you're<00:01:04.559> if

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
was just playing on my own if you're if

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.320 
was just playing on my own if you're if
you're<00:01:04.860> say<00:01:05.220> okay<00:01:05.519> let's<00:01:05.670> great<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.240> if

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
you're say okay let's great but if

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.640 
you're say okay let's great but if
you're<00:01:06.450> say<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.810> left<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.409> click

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
you're say going left and you click

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.090 
you're say going left and you click
right<00:01:07.979> here<00:01:08.659> then<00:01:09.659> it'll<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.200> course<00:01:10.530> crash

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
right here then it'll of course crash

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.179 
right here then it'll of course crash
into<00:01:11.580> you'll<00:01:12.540> crash<00:01:12.780> into<00:01:12.810> yourself<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.560> have

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
into you'll crash into yourself and have

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.600 
into you'll crash into yourself and have
to<00:01:14.310> restart<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.110> very<00:01:16.110> intuitive<00:01:16.619> very<00:01:16.830> simple

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
to restart so very intuitive very simple

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.539 
to restart so very intuitive very simple
interface<00:01:18.290> you'll<00:01:19.290> notice<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.799> chest<00:01:20.280> is

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
interface you'll notice this chest is

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.789 
interface you'll notice this chest is
like<00:01:20.880> kind<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.360> weird<00:01:21.600> right<00:01:21.930> obviously

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
like kind of weird right obviously

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.590 
like kind of weird right obviously
usually<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.490> don't<00:01:23.670> get<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.939> many<00:01:24.150> slots<00:01:24.390> in

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
usually you don't get this many slots in

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.480 
usually you don't get this many slots in
a<00:01:24.659> chest<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> trick<00:01:26.009> some<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.400> may

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
a chest this is a trick some of you may

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.580 
a chest this is a trick some of you may
seen<00:01:26.700> before<00:01:27.030> basically<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.170> actually

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
seen before basically it's actually

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.800 
seen before basically it's actually
three<00:01:28.829> chests<00:01:29.280> next<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.700> each<00:01:29.820> other<00:01:30.000> by<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
three chests next to each other by the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.140 
three chests next to each other by the
way<00:01:30.900> if<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.110> close<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.790> it'll

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
way if I close it and this it'll

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.880 
way if I close it and this it'll
basically<00:01:33.270> pause<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.810> game<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.710> can

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
basically pause the game so I can I can

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.039 
basically pause the game so I can I can
resume<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.280> later<00:01:35.460> which<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.180> also<00:01:36.810> kind<00:01:37.020> of

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
resume it later which is also kind of

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.160 
resume it later which is also kind of
cool<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.229> think<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.960> there's<00:01:40.079> actually

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
cool I think and so there's actually

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.480 
cool I think and so there's actually
three<00:01:40.530> chests<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.040> see<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.250> line<00:01:41.460> of

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
three chests you can see that line of

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.700 
three chests you can see that line of
the<00:01:41.610> third<00:01:41.939> chest<00:01:42.210> here<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.409> click

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
the third chest here and so if you click

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.039 
the third chest here and so if you click
on<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:44.490> chest<00:01:44.909> you'll<00:01:45.149> get<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.720> bottom
