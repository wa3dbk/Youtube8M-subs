00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.780
 a rainy day in the city of mexico 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.600
 which has brought several consequences 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.180
 in different spaces of this city 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.920
 this capital was already advanced and for 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.619
 expand this information I tie with my 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.300
 mate daniel magaña because I understand 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.730
 daniel that the affectations have been 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.340
 strong with this tremendous rain that is 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.750
 registered in this afternoon so today 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.850
 in the afternoon we meet 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.130
 precisely in the eastern part of the 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.379
 gel letter until the drop in this 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.950
 literally a parking lot 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:39.079
 of 10 km is this very long line that is 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.200
 that several parts of the 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.329
 driveway zaragoza the area of ​​santa marta 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.399
 is the most affected to the street of time 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.430
 in the nation here the water reached up 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.500
 one meter with 20 centimeters also in 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.930
 the point at which the area of 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.480
 the lake road is the letter chapel of 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.300
 the Mexico-Puebla highway is denied 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.340
 this has hindered the arrival of equipment 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.290
 Emergency especially these 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.820
 vehicles called a factor that are by 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.710
 the ones this trains miss 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.180
 strainers the firemen have also 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.400
 had some difficulty 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.070
 since it is literally impossible 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.600
 transit at this time in the area of 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.970
 the house is the thing to this is that 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.430
 increase it well because that also because 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.830
 rain is inoperative 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.160
 collective transport metro line 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.990
 of the subway dog is suspended we are 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.360
 in this area we saw how the people 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.510
 descend from this transport to be able 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.460
 look for some other way of transportation 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.500
 until they find it they have started walking 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.800
 over the road for hundreds more and 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.850
 times of people so it's an afternoon 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.130
 truly problematic in shaping 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.680
 strong teeth let's hope that this 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.570
 situation then little by little go 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.850
 improving although at this moment it has 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.950
 I started to rain again Well 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.750
 let's be aware of what happens 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.840
 especially also with this transport 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.110
 massive that is with the metro line a 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.610
 but good many thanks to daniel 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.979
 for your report we will be on the lookout 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.080
 of course above all 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.509
 alternatives that are being given 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.739
 remember what I do is precisely the 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.810
 application of district government 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.209
 federal so you know that the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.030
 alternatives when you when you 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.400

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.400
 of situations in the city
