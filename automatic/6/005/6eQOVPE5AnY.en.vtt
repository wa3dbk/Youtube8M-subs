of awful bacteria in your colon these
bad<00:00:44.250> bacteria<00:00:44.940> cause<00:00:45.270> some<00:00:45.600> unhealthy<00:00:46.020> things

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
bad bacteria cause some unhealthy things

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.279 
bad bacteria cause some unhealthy things
to<00:00:46.710> occur<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:48.300> presence<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.840> these<00:00:49.020> bad

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
to occur the presence of these bad

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.090 
to occur the presence of these bad
bacteria<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.610> intestine<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.239> dysbiosis

bacteria in the intestine is dysbiosis
remember<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.550> word<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:55.440> what<00:00:55.920> causes

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
remember this word so what causes

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.330 
remember this word so what causes
crohn's<00:00:56.760> disease<00:00:57.140> we<00:00:58.140> know<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.620> genetics<00:00:59.250> is

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
crohn's disease we know that genetics is

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.770 
crohn's disease we know that genetics is
important<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.239> can't<00:01:00.480> really<00:01:00.690> change

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
important but you can't really change

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.939 
important but you can't really change
your<00:01:01.320> genes

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
your genes

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.250 
your genes
a<00:01:02.000> second<00:01:03.000> fact<00:01:03.239> there<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.539> something<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
a second fact there is something in the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.679 
a second fact there is something in the
diet<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.799> foods<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.309> eat<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:06.270> know<00:01:06.450> for

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
diet and foods we eat we know for

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.929 
diet and foods we eat we know for
instance<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.680> put<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.100> ballot<00:01:08.520> complete

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
instance if you put the ballot complete

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.020 
instance if you put the ballot complete
rest<00:01:09.210> no<00:01:09.990> food<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.590> all<00:01:10.799> then<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.729> Crohn's

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
rest no food at all then the Crohn's

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.810 
rest no food at all then the Crohn's
seems<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.720> settle<00:01:13.020> down<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.409> get<00:01:13.560> better<00:01:13.820> we

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
seems to settle down and get better we

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.910 
seems to settle down and get better we
also<00:01:15.030> know<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.750> if<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.080> are<00:01:16.110> eating<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.680> high

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
also know that if you are eating a high

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.730 
also know that if you are eating a high
vegetable<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.880> fruit<00:01:18.360> diet<00:01:18.720> then<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.560> are

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
vegetable and fruit diet then you are

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.469 
vegetable and fruit diet then you are
less<00:01:19.920> likely<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.369> get<00:01:20.610> Crohn's<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.270> first

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
less likely to get Crohn's in the first

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.230 
less likely to get Crohn's in the first
place<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.680> same<00:01:22.710> thing<00:01:23.220> goes<00:01:23.460> for<00:01:23.490> those<00:01:23.909> who

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
place the same thing goes for those who

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.050 
place the same thing goes for those who
are<00:01:24.390> big<00:01:24.600> meat<00:01:25.049> eaters<00:01:25.580> increased<00:01:26.580> veggies

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
are big meat eaters increased veggies

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.749 
are big meat eaters increased veggies
and<00:01:27.210> fruits<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.780> less<00:01:28.290> red<00:01:28.650> meat<00:01:28.920> means<00:01:29.460> less

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
and fruits and less red meat means less

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.359 
and fruits and less red meat means less
chance<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.570> getting<00:01:30.630> Crohn's<00:01:31.200> these<00:01:32.009> are

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
chance of getting Crohn's these are

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.480 
chance of getting Crohn's these are
facts<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:34.200> what<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.680> do<00:01:34.950> if<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.310> already

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
facts so what do you do if you already

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.300 
facts so what do you do if you already
have<00:01:35.880> Crohn's<00:01:36.180> disease<00:01:36.890> let's<00:01:37.890> talk<00:01:38.159> about

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
have Crohn's disease let's talk about

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.140 
have Crohn's disease let's talk about
prebiotics<00:01:39.979> prebiotics<00:01:40.979> are<00:01:41.220> different<00:01:42.000> from

prebiotics prebiotics are different from

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
probiotics that are the bacteria you get

probiotics that are the bacteria you get
in<00:01:45.210> yogurt<00:01:45.659> or<00:01:45.869> pills<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.470> buy<00:01:47.720> prebiotics

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
in yogurt or pills you buy prebiotics

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.109 
in yogurt or pills you buy prebiotics
are<00:01:48.899> special<00:01:49.409> plant<00:01:49.890> fibers<00:01:50.340> found<00:01:50.549> only<00:01:50.970> in

certain vegetables in some fruit here is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.050 
certain vegetables in some fruit here is
how<00:01:53.820> prebiotics<00:01:54.630> work<00:01:54.899> as<00:01:55.369> I've<00:01:56.369> noted<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
how prebiotics work as I've noted the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.819 
how prebiotics work as I've noted the
lower<00:01:57.299> cut<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.899> filled<00:01:58.200> with<00:01:58.439> enormous

not so good the best bacteria are

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.469 
not so good the best bacteria are
