00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.750
 here anthony ridden and these are the 

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:11.369
 lessons to earn beyond all 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.750
 this scenario 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:15.670
 let's say you're in the gym and you give 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.350
 count the large number of machines 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.120
 Dumbbell bars a series of equipment 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.020
 and the question that comes to mind 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.960
 is what exercises I will perform which 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.990
 two teams I will use 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.820
 but this is easier in the gym 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.059
 can perform two main types of 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.730
 exercises as are the compounds and 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.649
 others are the enlistment 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.960
 difference between the two is the compounds 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.110
 to feel we are going out they are required 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.079
 several muscle groups instead the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.579
 of insulation only one is required 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.460
 only muscle group 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:58.530
 so that you will be clearer of everything as 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.530
 example leg extensions 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.170
 working sides are necessary 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.650
 only which, on the other hand, 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.650
 squats 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.450
 they are composite exercises that work 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.920
 what is this part after being 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.420
 the legs the temples the glutes 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.860
 even the abs and back 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.289
 low then they use it as 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.229
 stabilizers how to access your account 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.600
 the difference between the two is abysmal 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.350
 it is proven that we the 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:44.250
 compounds are one are more effective 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:47.200
 2 require more muscle groups and 3 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.430
 They provide greater anabolic effects to 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.570
 whole body 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.270
 keep in mind this is black rum and coleman 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.479
 all all the other bodybuilders of 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.580
 before and those of now still person who 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.850
 has really managed to transform its 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.170
 body did not achieve those muscles 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.080
 awesome with these little machines 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.260
 modern we see today and what 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.410
 they got doing exercises 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.480
 basic compounds as a primary basis 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.909
 of these curtains 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.430
 I know that the biggest gains in 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.990
 muscle size and strength are in 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.240
 this type of exercises 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.000
 and the question that I now ask you is that 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.510
 you're waiting if you want to see profits 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.370
 massive of your muscular size and strength 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.130
 focus on 500 exercises in the 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.050
 compounds below I'll make you 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.050
 a list of exercises and those who day 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.720
 you should be incorporating in your routine and so 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.490
 you will see excellent results in 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.490
 squats are first 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.320
 dominated in a fixed bar 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.590
 in case they can not be mastered in 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.090
 fixed bar you are going to do in pulley 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.090
 until a force is going to arrive 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.690
 deadlift with mud 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.140
 soak bar 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.400
 the leg press 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.810
 the bench press 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.900
 strides 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.310
 the military pres with bar 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.530
 background yes in parallel 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.500
 in case they can not make funds in 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.480
 parallel you are going to be funds between two 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.480
 banks until you're going to grab strength 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.660
 [Music] 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.470
 uncomfortable 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.300
 they do not care to act that way 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.400
 totally contradicts your dream of 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.520
 perfect room schedule even that 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.699
 so much you want 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.669
 as much as I at his pair are bigger and 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.979
 stronger then true if a 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.590
 person is always looking for the 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:26.409
 zero and the easiest to do is 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.150
 totally contradicting your luck of 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.650
 become bigger and stronger you give 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.830
 account 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.620
 so from now on concentrate 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.360
 in compound exercises just as 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.430
 the other bodybuilders and people who 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.000
 achieved the body those dreams have not 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.280
 done and they are doing it about 500 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.930
 Exercises are present among others 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.389
 training 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.340
 it should be noted that perform a few 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.070
 isolation exercises can also 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:57.729
 be present in your routine but yes 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:01.689
 never to make a compound 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:03.879
 One tip is that for every 2 x your 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:06.550
 compounds that you make someone is one 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:09.320
 of insulation or compound 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.330
 home isolation at the end 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.550
 among his guys that was all for today 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.290
 I hope I have been very helpful 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.690
 all in the next video that is in 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.430
 way if you have any questions towards 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:23.350
 the comments part 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.350
 Until next time I was sane
