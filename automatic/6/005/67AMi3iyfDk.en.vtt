00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.730
 Here I would like to briefly show how a sixth class is soldered correctly 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.019
 For this we now have the notice at the bottom of the pastor 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.209
 First of all, we are only interested in the four inner abilities 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.209
 to the two teams from the Finn we will come later 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.689
 if we first go to pins labeled 1 and 2 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.060
 the two teams have the function interrupt the circuit 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.670
 If you now hear a fan on this pence as an example, this will be 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.310
 First of all, we are the first to stop the fan 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.430
 we are now with their twelve people have which from the power supply or from 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.850
 the power supply come 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.660
 to the PIN with the inscription 1 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.090
 the damage in device in our example the fan comes to the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.370
 drove 2 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.110
 Now you leaf through the power supply to the PIN with the number three instead of the 1 and 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.590
 the damage to the device to the four instead of the 2 have just that 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.040
 Opposite of the previous estimate 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.240
 Now the fan would not run at all and RS pressed 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.050
 would that be what it would start and let go of course 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.410
 to stop again 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.790
 Let's get to the remaining two pence 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.780
 which serve for connection to the lighting 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.500
 Again, the connection is quite simple 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.640
 on the outside and each of the in the picture with the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.460
 Label he lives that - is marked is the water came 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.940
 from the power supply connected 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.350
 how that works exactly you can see the checks LÃ¶w video 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.400
 Now there are several variants how to let the LDD shine 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.800
 In any case, we need a small cable bridge 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.120
 you just take a piece that is isolated at both ends 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.920
 the one end you heard the PIN with the label Lata Plus instructed 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.909
 the first option would be to do it regardless of lights 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.980
 to leave if the button is pressed or not 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.890
 For this, the other end of the cable bridge must always be at the same 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.870
 can be soldered for the power supply 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.560
 So either to the PIN 1 for the first estimate or other three for 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.390
 the second divorce 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.770
 Now we do not want that something of the first estimate in advance 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.489
 lights up and he presses it 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.120
 so must the other car turn of the LDD Plus because of the PIN with the 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.980
 Labeling two should be the reality at the second 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.420
 Estimate now in advance lights and he press it while that's what 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:26.439
 go out the other end of the LLG Plus because of the PIN with the 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.489
 Labeling 4 will be instructed
