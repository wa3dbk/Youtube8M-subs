interesting<00:00:08.880> fact<00:00:09.120> also<00:00:10.759> Hamilton<00:00:11.759> began

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
interesting fact also Hamilton began

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.789 
interesting fact also Hamilton began
making<00:00:12.450> watches<00:00:12.900> because<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.620> all<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
making watches because of all the

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.039 
making watches because of all the
fatalities<00:00:14.429> on<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.670> railroad<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.360> previous

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
fatalities on the railroad the previous

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.410 
fatalities on the railroad the previous
watches<00:00:16.590> weren't<00:00:17.460> accurate<00:00:17.670> enough<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.359> so

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
watches weren't accurate enough and so

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.849 
watches weren't accurate enough and so
they<00:00:18.539> actually<00:00:18.660> made<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.350> designed<00:00:19.439> this

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859

pull the crown out you said it you can't
do<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.330> designed<00:01:24.720> with<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
do that to this this is designed with a

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:34.719 
do that to this this is designed with a
removable<00:01:25.409> bezel<00:01:28.159> unscrews

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.440 

it's<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.789> lever<00:01:36.030> set<00:01:36.560> pull<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.679> lever<00:01:37.890> out<00:01:38.450> then

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
it's a lever set pull the lever out then

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.830 
it's a lever set pull the lever out then
you<00:01:39.569> can<00:01:39.719> set<00:01:39.929> the<00:01:40.079> hands<00:01:41.509> push<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.659> lever

you can set the hands push the lever

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.109 
you can set the hands push the lever
back<00:01:43.109> in<00:01:43.350> then<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.280> would<00:01:44.399> screw<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.759> bezel

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
back in then you would screw the bezel

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.559 
back in then you would screw the bezel
or<00:01:45.240> what<00:01:45.869> would<00:01:45.990> happen<00:01:46.319> there<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:47.569> the

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
or what would happen there is the

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.440 
or what would happen there is the
engineers<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.709> railroad<00:01:50.219> they<00:01:51.119> couldn't

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
engineers on the railroad they couldn't

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.999 
engineers on the railroad they couldn't
bump<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.869> there's<00:01:52.049> virtually<00:01:52.500> no<00:01:52.619> way<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> get

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
bump it there's virtually no way to get
