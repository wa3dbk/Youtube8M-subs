 I invented it came up with an outstanding 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.210
 Russian guitarists are gay saints and roads 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.609

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.800
 electric guitar 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.310

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.109

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.290
 decorate them with various songs and 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.719
 compositions 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.149
 but this melody which I called plus you 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.660
 can you by the way find the file in 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.180
 video description print it and 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.829
 can play as an independent play 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.860
 but only that you can 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.910
 come up with more chords for chords which 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.940
 written on a branch 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.440
 extra charge you can also come up with your 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.570
 some melody based on that 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.129
 exercises that we will today 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.080
 disassemble now proceed 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.210
 not working in the beginning let's listen 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.990
 how do I collect under the backing by the way 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.290
 link to cons and to files and shopping 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.340
 pdf from in the description for this video 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.940
 then I will stay with you for those 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.810
 questions 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.810
 all records 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:04.170
 okay now let's take a tab 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:08.239
 which we have format guitar pro and 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.130
 pdf and look at the first beat 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.730
 notice i'm doing triol she 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.459
 should sound exactly 2 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.860
 but that hammer which I do at the beginning 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.860
 I explain that the arc it always means 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.850
 hamster i hope you are already thinking 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.370
 need to print payment water 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.410
 or opening on your monitor on 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.750
 tablet 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.310
 because this sound sounds layered on us 2 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.680
 and then the second third of the policy here 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.290
 and from here i 'm doing a slide this is done 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.680
 so fast movement sharp 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.680
 movements are transferred from 6 of us are young and so 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.340
 In theory, you can all play a mediator 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.700
 it is easy enough if 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.390
 control those strings that aren't 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.390
 participate 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.860
 while you drink the strings down then 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.599
 you need to take care if you 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.340
 play with a pick so that you donâ€™t 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:14.390
 sounded the second string which all the time 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.629
 will be between 1 2 or when we play at 4 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.150
 2 so that it sounds 3, respectively, there will be 5 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.829
 too, and it is impossible to make it sound 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.140
 and when we play on reorganize in 4 not 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.060
 sounded but as it is enough 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.390
 hard for novice guitarists so 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.519
 I explain how to play one sound with my fingers 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.319
 don't play that thumb another sound 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:37.609
 i play either forefinger or last 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:45.139
 and so 2 so we transfer to 4 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:47.500
 the device well and then here too 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.500
 worth 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.560
 note that all long legs i 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:57.670
 do kindness to prolong their sound 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.670
 now again 1 so 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.390
 and back 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.230
 in this way now 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.060
 we get it 5 so 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.300
 then 6 and for this amount we start at 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.300
 fifth play 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:32.070
 now repeat 3 4 yes of course what i am 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.880
 explain prop and so it is always 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.880
 stay 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:46.410
 and finally on where are our chords 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.660
 signed there you can put the bar can 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:55.760
 squeeze it like this with three passing 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:55.760
 as if to make such 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.750
 at the end we make a slide 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:14.410
 and go back to 34 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:17.260
 and at the very end I use such 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:22.720
 Here is a form and jackets and 1 2 him 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:25.330
 finger 3 on 4 and 4 then you can take 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.189
 these chords 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.189
 and come up with some of your line 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:38.139
 for example you know I'll just be right now 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:40.150
 play as they say from bolts randomly 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:43.409
 I use with this sound that I have 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.409
 each tactic then citizens and 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.360
 but 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:17.819
 tighten I think I have 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.870
 sorry i showed just an example of what you 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:22.259
 can think of 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:25.319
 based on the time of the boat that you are given 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:27.500
 you can come up with your own melody 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:30.419
 once again I advise 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.650
 work carefully books sergei 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:36.599
 gray who 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:39.419
 set at the beginning of this video so well here 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:41.370
 here today is a lesson for 9 what was 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:44.970
 Interestingly, I hope that you are still 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:47.699
 learn beautiful cool easy in 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.440
 melody see you again and again remember that 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:51.900
 in the background people you will find all my 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.849
 free up to all video tutorials 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.680
 and you can also order the analysis of the song 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:57.930
 only for myself there is such a section 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:02.150
 order the analysis of the song and goodbye 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.150
 all the best of luck so far
