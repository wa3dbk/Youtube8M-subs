leeway of time when it comes to
development<00:00:57.059> they've<00:00:57.300> only<00:00:57.570> had<00:00:57.719> about<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
development they've only had about a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.450

year<00:00:58.379> or<00:00:58.410> maybe<00:00:58.649> even<00:00:58.739> half<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.190> year<00:00:59.340> to

year or maybe even half a year to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.220

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
again we see that this move that

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.370 
again we see that this move that

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
actually the midair web brush maneuver

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.180 
actually the midair web brush maneuver
that<00:05:08.750> Spiderman<00:05:09.050> could<00:05:09.349> do<00:05:09.440> to<00:05:09.560> enemies<00:05:09.919> in

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190

in which it's going to be you know your
left<00:06:11.780> trigger<00:06:11.990> would<00:06:12.199> control<00:06:12.590> your<00:06:12.860> left<00:06:13.099> arm

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
left trigger would control your left arm

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.740 
left trigger would control your left arm
and<00:06:13.699> your<00:06:13.940> right<00:06:13.970> sugar<00:06:14.270> we're<00:06:14.479> gonna<00:06:14.630> tow

your<00:06:14.900> right<00:06:15.080> arm<00:06:15.259> it's<00:06:15.500> also<00:06:15.620> gonna<00:06:15.800> be<00:06:15.889> a

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:16.009 
your right arm it's also gonna be a

boost<00:06:16.280> feature<00:06:16.490> I'm<00:06:17.479> not<00:06:17.659> too<00:06:18.080> sure<00:06:18.289> how<00:06:18.440> to

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
boost feature I'm not too sure how to

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.589 
boost feature I'm not too sure how to
feel<00:06:18.800> on<00:06:18.979> that<00:06:19.009> I<00:06:19.190> think<00:06:19.460> it's<00:06:19.849> gimmicky<00:06:20.360> to<00:06:20.479> be

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 
feel on that I think it's gimmicky to be

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.350 
feel on that I think it's gimmicky to be
honest<00:06:20.870> with<00:06:21.020> you<00:06:21.110> I<00:06:21.169> think<00:06:21.259> it's<00:06:21.530> odd<00:06:22.360> that

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
honest with you I think it's odd that

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.140 
honest with you I think it's odd that
you're<00:06:23.539> not<00:06:23.780> using<00:06:24.500> l2<00:06:25.460> for<00:06:25.639> something<00:06:25.970> else

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
you're not using l2 for something else

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.740 
you're not using l2 for something else
maybe<00:06:26.659> sprint<00:06:27.349> you<00:06:27.620> know<00:06:28.400> a<00:06:28.430> sprint<00:06:29.360> on<00:06:29.599> the

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
maybe sprint you know a sprint on the

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.399 
maybe sprint you know a sprint on the
ground<00:06:29.990> would<00:06:30.229> have<00:06:30.380> been<00:06:30.500> great<00:06:30.800> but<00:06:32.409> you

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:33.409 
ground would have been great but you

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:34.810 
ground would have been great but you
know<00:06:33.500> it<00:06:33.710> is<00:06:33.830> what<00:06:33.979> it<00:06:34.010> is<00:06:34.159> they<00:06:34.400> chose<00:06:34.610> to<00:06:34.639> make

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
know it is what it is they chose to make

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.050 
know it is what it is they chose to make
that<00:06:35.240> what<00:06:36.229> they<00:06:36.409> wanted<00:06:37.010> to<00:06:37.190> use<00:06:37.340> the

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
that what they wanted to use the

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.510 
that what they wanted to use the
trigger<00:06:38.270> four<00:06:38.510> so<00:06:38.900> I<00:06:39.169> can't<00:06:40.040> I<00:06:40.250> can't

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
trigger four so I can't I can't

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.310 
trigger four so I can't I can't
necessarily<00:06:40.760> knock<00:06:41.480> them<00:06:41.660> down<00:06:41.840> for<00:06:42.080> wanting

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.320 
necessarily knock them down for wanting

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.510 
necessarily knock them down for wanting
to<00:06:42.440> do<00:06:42.530> something<00:06:42.740> but<00:06:42.919> we<00:06:43.040> can<00:06:43.190> see<00:06:43.310> that<00:06:43.430> the

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
to do something but we can see that the

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.310 
to do something but we can see that the
animation<00:06:43.880> here<00:06:44.210> is<00:06:44.330> exactly<00:06:44.630> the<00:06:44.900> same<00:06:45.110> as

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.320 
animation here is exactly the same as

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.129 
animation here is exactly the same as
the<00:06:45.770> amazing<00:06:46.550> spider-man<00:06:46.820> one<00:06:47.060> and<00:06:47.300> if<00:06:48.020> you

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.139 
the amazing spider-man one and if you

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:49.570 
the amazing spider-man one and if you
ever<00:06:48.470> played<00:06:48.740> the<00:06:48.830> amazing<00:06:49.100> spider-man<00:06:49.340> one

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
ever played the amazing spider-man one

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.400 
ever played the amazing spider-man one
you<00:06:49.790> would<00:06:49.910> know<00:06:50.060> that<00:06:50.090> the<00:06:50.480> swinging<00:06:51.050> in<00:06:51.230> that

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.410 
you would know that the swinging in that

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.320 
you would know that the swinging in that
game<00:06:51.650> had<00:06:51.889> a<00:06:51.919> total<00:06:52.220> of<00:06:52.310> two<00:06:52.490> animations<00:06:53.120> that

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
game had a total of two animations that

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.110 
game had a total of two animations that
would<00:06:53.600> go<00:06:54.190> back<00:06:55.190> and<00:06:55.220> forth<00:06:55.430> every<00:06:55.880> single

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
would go back and forth every single

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.200 
would go back and forth every single
time<00:06:56.300> so<00:06:56.750> essentially<00:06:57.880> we're<00:06:58.880> getting<00:06:59.090> that

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.210 
time so essentially we're getting that

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.520 
time so essentially we're getting that
back<00:06:59.510> in<00:06:59.660> this<00:06:59.780> game<00:06:59.870> I<00:07:00.169> don't<00:07:00.380> know<00:07:00.440> if

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 
back in this game I don't know if

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.750 
back in this game I don't know if
there's<00:07:00.680> brand<00:07:00.919> new<00:07:01.010> animations<00:07:01.490> but<00:07:01.639> it

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.760 
there's brand new animations but it

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.110 
there's brand new animations but it
looks<00:07:01.940> to<00:07:02.120> look<00:07:02.419> the<00:07:02.600> same<00:07:02.630> and<00:07:03.820> and<00:07:04.820> I'm<00:07:04.970> not

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 
looks to look the same and and I'm not

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.460 
looks to look the same and and I'm not
looking<00:07:05.419> forward<00:07:05.600> to<00:07:05.720> that<00:07:05.810> I'm<00:07:06.110> not<00:07:06.260> looking

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:06.470 
looking forward to that I'm not looking

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:07.810 
looking forward to that I'm not looking
forward<00:07:06.680> to<00:07:06.889> playing<00:07:07.130> the<00:07:07.280> same<00:07:07.490> game<00:07:07.700> I

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:07.820 
forward to playing the same game I

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.850 
forward to playing the same game I
played<00:07:08.060> two<00:07:08.270> years<00:07:08.300> ago<00:07:08.720> and<00:07:08.960> they<00:07:09.500> really

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860 
played two years ago and they really

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.990 
played two years ago and they really
need<00:07:10.010> to<00:07:10.070> change<00:07:10.280> it<00:07:10.430> up<00:07:10.550> and<00:07:10.700> there's<00:07:10.850> also

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 
need to change it up and there's also

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.760 
need to change it up and there's also
some<00:07:11.330> other<00:07:11.780> moves<00:07:12.080> that<00:07:12.200> are<00:07:12.380> in<00:07:12.500> the<00:07:12.590> game

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:12.770 
some other moves that are in the game

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.080 
some other moves that are in the game
like<00:07:13.040> you<00:07:13.250> know<00:07:13.370> spider-man<00:07:13.580> throwing

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:14.090 
like you know spider-man throwing

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.460 
like you know spider-man throwing
somebody<00:07:14.240> up<00:07:14.419> against<00:07:14.660> the<00:07:14.810> wall<00:07:15.020> and<00:07:15.050> letting

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470 
somebody up against the wall and letting

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.620 
somebody up against the wall and letting
them<00:07:15.620> that<00:07:16.340> was<00:07:16.669> also<00:07:17.000> in<00:07:17.210> shattered

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:17.630 
them that was also in shattered

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.030 
them that was also in shattered
Dimensions<00:07:17.750> so<00:07:18.350> it<00:07:18.470> seems<00:07:18.680> like<00:07:18.860> they're

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.040 
Dimensions so it seems like they're

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.830 
Dimensions so it seems like they're
integrating<00:07:19.580> other<00:07:19.790> stuff<00:07:20.210> from<00:07:20.389> their<00:07:20.540> past
