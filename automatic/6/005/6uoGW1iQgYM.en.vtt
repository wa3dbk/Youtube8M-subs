00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.359
 hi friends welcome to the chain 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.510
 techno 01net all the high tech news 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.849
 it's here jérôme today a beautiful 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.639
 screen and yes because the arrival of windows 8 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.540
 allows the manufacturer to renew himself 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.550
 and inventing little things 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.400
 interesting so close up on a 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.990
 computer monitor for pc it is signed 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.420
 of her and he knows how to do a lot of things 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.590
 and he is especially tactile bruno cormier 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.590
 Zero urban blabla 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.510
 it's the new 23 inch touch screen 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.199
 of dell a screen that is made for 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.129
 windows 8 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:46.230
 so it's a capacitive touch screen 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.870
 who can handle up to 10 points at the same 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.549
 time so ten fingers at the same time there 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.239
 will have no problem to use it with 

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:56.760
 both hands and it's a screen that's 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.070
 quite original and very good in terms of 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.829
 very innovative design starting with 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.180
 the foot that allows to move a little 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.339
 slab in all the east in every way 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.440
 and especially to put it horizontally 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.440
 to act as touch panels 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:18.750
 it's a high quality lcd tile that 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.850
 has very wide viewing angles and which 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.880
 is without any very faithful adjustment in 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.649
 color so all the graphic designers the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.130
 photo lovers will be able to widely 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.619
 to be satisfied with it except perhaps 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.080
 really the pros who will ask 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.909
 a screen even more sophisticated but 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.739
 this one is very good in terms of 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.379
 image rendering fidelity 

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:42.140
 he has a good contrast so blacks 

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:44.819
 deep enough and secondly 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.129
 the exploitation of usb3 is totally 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:50.369
 bluffing on this screen ie 

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:52.590
 that in fact a single usb cable 30 can 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.899
 enough to connect the screen to a 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.050
 computer taking charge 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.270
 the image but also the audio since 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.099
 has the screen has two high 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.429
 integrated speakers of very good quality 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:07.619
 besides, but also the webcam and its 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.379
 micro it is an ethernet network socket 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.510
 to connect to the web 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.250
 behind the screen not only the screen 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.080
 full of features but more 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.650
 it does not block it is not a factory 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.379
 gas 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.860
 it works very well and it's very 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.860
 easy to use 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.709
 for the players we have a time of 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.260
 relax local which is too slow so there 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.550
 a lot of ghosting his call this is 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.410
 a lot of hanging out behind the 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.680
 slab movements so what makes 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.410
 that actually images that move very 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.560
 quickly are less clear than on a screen 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.209
 made for video games that allows 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.849
 to have a much sharper image 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.500
 in the second action scenes 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:52.610
 disadvantage actually is the price 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.010
 since this screen costs 760 euros it's 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.640
 a lot it's huge for a 23 inch 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.620
 you have to know that he is still 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.420
 the tip of what is done in terms 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.360
 technology in the market with a 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.360
 capacitive slab that weighs heavily 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.799
 the note know that a capacitive slab 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.680
 capacitive touch on 23 inches that's 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.670
 very very expensive to manufacture and last 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.239
 weak point is that indeed 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.660
 always this capacitive slab adds 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.250
 a glossy coating on the screen that 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.000
 actually that the screen is a 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.000
 real mirror 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.950
 despite all its technological excellence 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.810
 we remain quite mixed in terms of 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.519
 verdict and say that the screen is all about 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.720
 even pretty expensive for a 23 inch 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.670
 the only thing we can say 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.040
 currently it is that people 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.260
 wealthy and wealthy who want to 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.780
 offer it will get a screen 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.549
 excellent quality with 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.620
 integrated technologies that works 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.319
 very very good you're crandall 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.450
 jérôme if we want how many copies 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.680
 usual products for a pallet a 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.900
 pallet please for jérôme 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.639
 here is the techno channel 01net you the 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.980
 know all the high-tech news all 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.750
 the days do not hesitate to take a look 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.760
 on our website to find all the 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.680
 tests that we have been able to offer you these 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.630
 last weeks and of course at this 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.519
 turnaround at 01 there of course that 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.510
 these months and we find ourselves very quickly 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.510
 of course to him at all
