 I've been taking Kendon-san and I've been hurt and Kentoshi-san is a model centered around a little 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.799
 I took it to 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.730
 It is a prize that can be approached to a great close Winning because it is a macro lens I wonder how to use it 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:49.840
 It is a thing but 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:50.000
 I just thought that I could use it as a 60 mm lens with 2 f 2-brightness. 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.190
 Ne 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.030
 The picture is not bad, the hole is good , the focus is a bit narrow 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:04.760
 It will be perfect if you increase a little and follow 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:09.020
 Surprisingly I wonder if Toka video to be that follow that the characteristics of this lens I was able to take beautiful 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.990

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.060
 But machine 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.990
