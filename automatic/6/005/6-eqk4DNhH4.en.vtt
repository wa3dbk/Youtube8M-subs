00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
previous video I went over how to set

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.579 
previous video I went over how to set
3dsmax<00:00:04.890> 2013<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.819> use<00:00:06.029> them<00:00:06.660> my<00:00:06.870> interaction

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
3dsmax 2013 to use them my interaction

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.759 
3dsmax 2013 to use them my interaction
model<00:00:07.890> but<00:00:08.340> there's<00:00:08.519> one<00:00:08.610> big<00:00:09.599> flaw<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:10.590> that

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
model but there's one big flaw so that

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.799 
model but there's one big flaw so that
we<00:00:10.950> run<00:00:11.370> into<00:00:11.519> in<00:00:11.880> that's<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.450> ability<00:00:12.719> to

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
we run into in that's the ability to

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.279 
we run into in that's the ability to
deselect<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:14.639> Prius<00:00:15.630> max<00:00:15.900> when<00:00:16.139> you

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
deselect in that Prius max when you

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.170 
deselect in that Prius max when you
change<00:00:16.650> some<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.920> options<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.789> again<00:00:18.000> for

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
change some of the options so again for

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.070 
change some of the options so again for
those<00:00:18.300> who<00:00:18.390> didn't<00:00:18.600> watch<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.750> previous

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
preferences and after I set the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
interaction model to Maya you can then

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.639 
interaction model to Maya you can then
go<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.470> customize<00:00:31.470> user<00:00:31.800> interface<00:00:32.340> and

go to the customize user interface and
once<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.770> loads<00:00:34.980> up<00:00:35.250> under<00:00:35.610> mouse<00:00:35.989> you<00:00:36.989> can

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
once this loads up under mouse you can

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.740 
once this loads up under mouse you can
check<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:38.760> check<00:00:38.940> off<00:00:39.149> my<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.480> mode

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
check on you can check off my a mode

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.750 
check on you can check off my a mode
selection<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.860> problem<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.280> get<00:00:41.520> is

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
selection but the problem you get is

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.959 
selection but the problem you get is
that<00:00:42.090> your<00:00:42.440> alt<00:00:43.440> key<00:00:43.860> which<00:00:44.100> use<00:00:44.340> deselected

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
that your alt key which use deselected

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.779 
that your alt key which use deselected
max<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.450> still<00:00:45.870> overridden<00:00:46.350> by<00:00:46.829> Maya's

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
max is still overridden by Maya's

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.439 
max is still overridden by Maya's
navigations<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:49.320> what<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.770> did<00:00:49.890> was<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:51.120> decided

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
navigations so what I did was I decided

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.439 
navigations so what I did was I decided
to<00:00:51.600> change<00:00:51.899> my<00:00:52.050> shortcuts<00:00:53.030> from<00:00:54.030> alt<00:00:54.270> to

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
to change my shortcuts from alt to

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.930 
to change my shortcuts from alt to
control<00:00:54.809> alt<00:00:55.190> for<00:00:56.190> some<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.640> can

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
control alt for some of you you can

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.250 
control alt for some of you you can
probably<00:00:57.239> live<00:00:57.329> with<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.840> fine<00:00:58.079> with

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
probably live with this and be fine with

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.170 
probably live with this and be fine with
it<00:00:58.289> but<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.980> still<00:00:59.219> preferred<00:00:59.550> using<00:00:59.820> just<00:00:59.940> one

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
it but I still preferred using just one

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.349 
it but I still preferred using just one
key<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.550> what<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.579> decided<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.000> do<00:01:03.090> was<00:01:03.210> i

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
key and what I decided to do was i

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.230 
key and what I decided to do was i
overwrote<00:01:03.809> my<00:01:04.500> windows<00:01:05.250> key<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.880> become<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
overwrote my windows key to become the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.990 
overwrote my windows key to become the
ctrl<00:01:06.810> alt<00:01:07.080> combinations<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.820> those<00:01:08.939> of

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
ctrl alt combinations so for those of

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.789 
ctrl alt combinations so for those of
you<00:01:09.299> who<00:01:09.479> have<00:01:09.600> never<00:01:09.750> never<00:01:10.170> done<00:01:10.500> some<00:01:10.680> like

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
you who have never never done some like

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.380 
you who have never never done some like
those<00:01:10.950> before<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.939> little<00:01:12.119> simple

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
those before it's a little simple

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.480 
those before it's a little simple
registry<00:01:12.780> hack<00:01:12.990> there<00:01:13.650> are<00:01:13.770> programs<00:01:14.100> out

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
registry hack there are programs out

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.749 
registry hack there are programs out
that<00:01:14.760> help<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> registry<00:01:16.560> hack<00:01:16.770> so

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
that help you do the registry hack so

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.710 
that help you do the registry hack so
I'm<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.030> talk<00:01:18.150> about<00:01:18.270> both<00:01:18.540> those

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
I'm going to talk about both those

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.190 
I'm going to talk about both those
programs<00:01:19.220> so<00:01:20.220> one<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.580> them<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.970> sharp<00:01:21.960> Keys

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
programs so one of them is sharp Keys

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.039 
programs so one of them is sharp Keys
3.5<00:01:23.130> or<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.030> use<00:01:24.060> three<00:01:24.360> point<00:01:24.570> out<00:01:24.689> both

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
3.5 or you can use three point out both

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.230 
3.5 or you can use three point out both
still<00:01:25.860> work<00:01:25.890> what<00:01:26.640> allows<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.119> do<00:01:27.210> is

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
still work what allows you to do is

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.630 
still work what allows you to do is
remap<00:01:27.810> any<00:01:28.080> key<00:01:28.439> on<00:01:28.650> your<00:01:28.680> keyboard<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.310> any

remap any key on your keyboard to any

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.730 
remap any key on your keyboard to any
other<00:01:29.970> key<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.390> want<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.380> realized<00:01:31.650> my

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
other key you want and I realized my

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.770 
other key you want and I realized my
windows<00:01:32.280> key<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.610> general<00:01:32.909> kind<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.540> gets<00:01:33.689> in

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
windows key in general kind of gets in

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.289 
windows key in general kind of gets in
the<00:01:33.869> way<00:01:34.020> when<00:01:34.950> I'm<00:01:35.070> using<00:01:35.250> Maya<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.970> press<00:01:36.270> it

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
the way when I'm using Maya I press it

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.630 
the way when I'm using Maya I press it
on<00:01:36.509> accident<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:38.009> still<00:01:38.280> lets<00:01:38.490> me

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
on accident and it still lets me

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.910 
on accident and it still lets me
navigate<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.390> real<00:01:39.990> Start<00:01:40.290> menu<00:01:40.500> pops<00:01:40.710> up

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
navigate but the real Start menu pops up

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.800 
navigate but the real Start menu pops up
and<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.549> use<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:41.939> games<00:01:42.210> when<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.450> don't<00:01:42.630> mean

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
and I use it in games when I don't mean

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.810 
and I use it in games when I don't mean
to<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.560> instead<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.890> removing<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.490> key<00:01:44.670> like

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
to so instead of removing the key like

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.280 
to so instead of removing the key like
many<00:01:45.060> have<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.390> decided<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.810> make<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.079> key

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
many have I decided to make that key

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.679 
many have I decided to make that key
quite<00:01:46.680> useful<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.280> still<00:01:47.970> left<00:01:48.149> my<00:01:48.270> window<00:01:48.329> ski

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
quite useful I still left my window ski

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.999 
quite useful I still left my window ski
on<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.810> right-hand<00:01:49.229> side<00:01:49.350> because<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.920> are

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
on the right-hand side because you are

the problem with sharp keys is you can

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.950 
the problem with sharp keys is you can
assign<00:02:27.130> multiple<00:02:27.460> keys<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.090> one<00:02:28.300> it's<00:02:28.810> only

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
assign multiple keys to one it's only

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.520 
assign multiple keys to one it's only
step<00:02:29.260> one<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.890> how<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:30.910> get<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.960> windows<00:02:32.260> key

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
step one of how to get the windows key

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.930 
step one of how to get the windows key
to<00:02:33.030> work<00:02:34.030> like<00:02:34.870> multiple<00:02:35.680> key<00:02:35.860> process<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:36.910> i

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
to work like multiple key process so i

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.310 
to work like multiple key process so i
decided<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.600> set<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.080> that<00:02:39.010> key<00:02:39.280> two<00:02:39.840> f-15<00:02:40.840> so

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
decided to set the that key two f-15 so

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.020 
decided to set the that key two f-15 so
i<00:02:41.350> decided<00:02:41.740> to<00:02:41.800> change<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.250> windows<00:02:42.580> key<00:02:42.820> two

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.570 
i decided to change the windows key two
f-15<00:02:43.570> why<00:02:43.810> f15<00:02:44.380> because<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.100> doesn't<00:02:45.370> do

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
f-15 why f15 because it doesn't do

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.820 
f-15 why f15 because it doesn't do
anything<00:02:45.880> so<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.810> key<00:02:46.990> is<00:02:47.020> absolutely

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830

ctrl + alt it's easier to have it so it

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.659 
ctrl + alt it's easier to have it so it
