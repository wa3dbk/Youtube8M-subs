go and actually upgrade this gun you can

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.300 
go and actually upgrade this gun you can
a<00:01:20.780> multiple<00:01:21.409> upgrade<00:01:21.909> this<00:01:22.909> weapon<00:01:23.299> the<00:01:23.420> m27

a multiple upgrade this weapon the m27
now<00:01:25.310> first<00:01:25.549> off<00:01:25.790> we<00:01:25.970> actually<00:01:26.299> get<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.510> reflex

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
now first off we actually get the reflex

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.410 
now first off we actually get the reflex
sight<00:01:26.990> I<00:01:27.380> know<00:01:27.920> why<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.310> last<00:01:28.760> video<00:01:29.090> is<00:01:29.270> it

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
sight I know why the last video is it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.630 
sight I know why the last video is it
wads<00:01:29.600> red<00:01:30.260> dot<00:01:30.470> on<00:01:30.650> it's<00:01:30.830> a<00:01:30.920> red<00:01:31.100> dot<00:01:31.250> sight<00:01:31.520> but

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
wads red dot on it's a red dot sight but

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.190 
wads red dot on it's a red dot sight but
this<00:01:31.760> is<00:01:31.939> a<00:01:31.970> reflex<00:01:32.420> I<00:01:32.540> guess<00:01:32.840> they<00:01:33.170> really

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
this is a reflex I guess they really

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.890 
this is a reflex I guess they really
call<00:01:33.740> it<00:01:33.770> reflex<00:01:34.340> sight<00:01:34.549> there's<00:01:34.790> no<00:01:35.000> red<00:01:35.689> dot

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
call it reflex sight there's no red dot

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.070 
call it reflex sight there's no red dot
sight<00:01:36.229> for<00:01:36.560> for<00:01:37.070> assault<00:01:37.490> rifles<00:01:37.909> so<00:01:38.720> with<00:01:38.960> the

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
sight for for assault rifles so with the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.950 
sight for for assault rifles so with the
upgrade<00:01:39.380> we<00:01:39.590> get<00:01:39.770> an<00:01:39.890> additional<00:01:40.600> 120<00:01:41.600> rounds

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
upgrade we get an additional 120 rounds

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.440 
upgrade we get an additional 120 rounds
and<00:01:42.470> again<00:01:42.680> obviously<00:01:43.250> these<00:01:43.759> are<00:01:43.970> upgraded

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
and again obviously these are upgraded

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.060 
and again obviously these are upgraded
rounds<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:44.960> they're<00:01:45.110> more<00:01:45.470> effective<00:01:45.710> against

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
rounds so they're more effective against

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.890 
rounds so they're more effective against
the<00:01:46.220> zombies<00:01:46.549> it's<00:01:46.759> going<00:01:46.939> to<00:01:47.000> take<00:01:47.150> take<00:01:47.630> less

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
the zombies it's going to take take less

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.520 
the zombies it's going to take take less
rounds<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.890> get<00:01:49.070> through<00:01:49.579> the<00:01:50.090> rounds<00:01:50.540> less

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
rounds to get through the rounds less

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.990 
rounds to get through the rounds less
bullets<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:52.009> get<00:01:52.100> through<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.369> rounds<00:01:52.610> let's

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
bullets to get through the rounds let's

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.270 
bullets to get through the rounds let's
use<00:01:53.210> that<00:01:53.390> word<00:01:53.630> alright<00:01:54.439> moving<00:01:54.740> right<00:01:54.799> along

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
use that word alright moving right along

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
up until at least around 30 especially

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.319 
up until at least around 30 especially
when<00:02:00.259> you're<00:02:00.470> running<00:02:00.619> co-op<00:02:01.520> in<00:02:01.850> in<00:02:02.180> an

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
when you're running co-op in in an

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.410 
when you're running co-op in in an
individual<00:02:03.020> area<00:02:03.350> such<00:02:03.619> as<00:02:03.770> we<00:02:03.920> are<00:02:04.130> we<00:02:04.850> don't

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
individual area such as we are we don't

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.569 
individual area such as we are we don't
really<00:02:05.570> run<00:02:05.840> into<00:02:06.020> any<00:02:06.290> trouble<00:02:06.409> until<00:02:07.040> we<00:02:07.369> get

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
really run into any trouble until we get

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.539 
really run into any trouble until we get
up<00:02:07.729> into<00:02:07.909> at<00:02:08.659> least<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:09.079> the<00:02:09.709> rounds<00:02:10.129> above

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
up into at least the the rounds above

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.940 
up into at least the the rounds above
around<00:02:10.789> 30<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:11.959> we're<00:02:12.140> gonna<00:02:12.260> go<00:02:12.470> on<00:02:12.590> upgrade

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
around 30 so we're gonna go on upgrade

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.500 
around 30 so we're gonna go on upgrade
it<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.099> couple<00:02:13.280> more<00:02:13.459> times<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:13.999> you<00:02:14.180> know

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
it a couple more times and you know

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.019 
it a couple more times and you know
quite<00:02:14.779> honestly<00:02:15.169> it<00:02:15.799> just<00:02:15.829> after<00:02:16.819> going

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:17.029 
quite honestly it just after going

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:18.339 
quite honestly it just after going
through<00:02:17.059> some<00:02:17.419> of<00:02:17.450> these<00:02:17.540> weapons<00:02:17.959> it<00:02:18.139> just

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
through some of these weapons it just

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.870 
through some of these weapons it just
feels<00:02:18.590> like<00:02:18.799> Treyarch<00:02:19.249> added<00:02:19.639> this

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
feels like Treyarch added this

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.480 
feels like Treyarch added this
in<00:02:20.030> just<00:02:20.870> because<00:02:21.050> like<00:02:21.560> sort<00:02:21.950> of<00:02:22.010> as<00:02:22.310> an

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
in just because like sort of as an

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.720 
in just because like sort of as an
afterthought<00:02:23.000> perhaps<00:02:23.480> I<00:02:24.230> mean<00:02:25.190> not<00:02:25.430> only

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
afterthought perhaps I mean not only

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.030 
afterthought perhaps I mean not only
does<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.180> cost<00:02:26.450> not<00:02:26.810> change<00:02:27.200> like<00:02:27.530> if<00:02:27.650> I'm<00:02:27.830> up

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
does the cost not change like if I'm up

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.220 
does the cost not change like if I'm up
there<00:02:28.190> with<00:02:28.220> an<00:02:28.460> upgraded<00:02:28.760> m27<00:02:29.480> it's<00:02:29.990> still

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
there with an upgraded m27 it's still

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.930 
there with an upgraded m27 it's still
saying<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.620> cost<00:02:30.830> me<00:02:31.100> five<00:02:31.310> thousand<00:02:31.850> to

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
saying it cost me five thousand to

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.430 
saying it cost me five thousand to
upgrade<00:02:32.270> it<00:02:32.390> again<00:02:32.630> even<00:02:33.170> though<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.380> only

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
upgrade it again even though it only

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.350 
upgrade it again even though it only
costs<00:02:33.920> two<00:02:34.070> thousand<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.670> really<00:02:35.240> the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
costs two thousand and really the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.410 
costs two thousand and really the
attachments<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:36.080> don't<00:02:36.380> feel<00:02:36.740> are<00:02:37.100> great<00:02:37.940> for

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
attachments I don't feel are great for

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.170 
attachments I don't feel are great for
zombies<00:02:38.990> I<00:02:39.260> mean<00:02:39.440> yeah<00:02:39.890> it's<00:02:40.640> fine<00:02:40.970> for

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
zombies I mean yeah it's fine for

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.360 
zombies I mean yeah it's fine for
multiplayer<00:02:41.630> but<00:02:41.870> for<00:02:42.110> zombies<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:42.800> really

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
multiplayer but for zombies I really

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.840 
multiplayer but for zombies I really
don't<00:02:43.700> see<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:44.690> real<00:02:45.350> need<00:02:45.380> for<00:02:45.850> getting

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
don't see a real need for getting

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.610 
don't see a real need for getting
attachments<00:02:47.480> I<00:02:47.570> mean<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.870> target<00:02:48.200> finder<00:02:48.380> is

could be FMJ I mean they're for probably
about<00:03:02.720> four<00:03:03.550> options<00:03:04.550> here<00:03:04.730> are<00:03:04.850> four

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
could have had on there we've got the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.160 
could have had on there we've got the
MMS<00:03:09.170> site<00:03:09.440> again<00:03:10.040> it's<00:03:10.580> totally<00:03:11.120> useless<00:03:11.750> it's

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
MMS site again it's totally useless it's

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.680 
MMS site again it's totally useless it's
useless<00:03:12.560> it's<00:03:12.950> not<00:03:13.130> useful<00:03:13.790> at<00:03:14.180> all<00:03:14.300> in<00:03:14.510> my

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
useless it's not useful at all in my

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.630 
useless it's not useful at all in my
opinion<00:03:14.780> in<00:03:15.290> zombies<00:03:15.980> so<00:03:16.190> it's<00:03:16.310> kind<00:03:16.520> of<00:03:16.550> a

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
opinion in zombies so it's kind of a

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.210 
opinion in zombies so it's kind of a
waste<00:03:16.850> so<00:03:17.720> we<00:03:17.810> do<00:03:17.960> upgrade<00:03:18.320> it<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.530> few<00:03:18.710> times<00:03:18.830> I

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
waste so we do upgrade it a few times I

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.920 
waste so we do upgrade it a few times I
don't<00:03:19.280> we<00:03:19.790> probably<00:03:20.030> don't<00:03:20.270> get<00:03:20.390> every<00:03:20.720> single

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
don't we probably don't get every single

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.380 
don't we probably don't get every single
weapon<00:03:21.500> upgrade<00:03:22.310> combination<00:03:23.000> here<00:03:23.210> or
