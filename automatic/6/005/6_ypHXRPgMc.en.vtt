00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.859
 demonstrated in this contemporary dance 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.180

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.749
 and for ten years working with the body in honor of June 12 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:44.920
 have prepared a choreography that in addition to the public informs the 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.820
 dancers may be wanting to show people to the stage given by her 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:51.400
 relationships 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.260
 but also with right now having to be very picky in January 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.750
 in the first set the saite team 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.110
 in the way that the people that this is more than a little said lula we have so many 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.200
 public or noir during this month the choreography wins an accident 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.619
 vascular-brain the new being back to the audience in an interactive way like this 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.270
 with love messages at the foot of the ear 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.470
 she also spoke of the importance of love she spoke 'love' 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.730
 this very important loss-feeling thing 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.040
 What do you think of this kind of presentation? 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.730
 for me it's wonderful country to grow this interface without the city of hop 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.500
 can have the contact between paid nothing are not all the people that can get 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.730
 to the theater 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.400
 so my concern is together with the boys was to bring 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.370
 the art and the street 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.880
 which I think allows people a standard pressure for the next they 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.840
 They look to happen, they do not have this contact. 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.250
 and I'm leaving but they were what they think is right for them what goes 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.590
 Give yourself to each one of their lives. 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.680
 and the singles who watch 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.680
 This lawn recognition is a girlfriend. 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.820

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.329
 I'm in favor 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.400
