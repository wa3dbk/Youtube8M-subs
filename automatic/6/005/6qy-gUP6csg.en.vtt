00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
line but we can actually skip around a

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.460 
line but we can actually skip around a
little<00:02:11.039> bit<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:12.030> gives<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.510> poem<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:13.110> kind

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
little bit and it gives the poem a kind

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.130 
little bit and it gives the poem a kind
of<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.800> nice<00:02:14.069> shape<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.910> in<00:02:15.239> that<00:02:15.810> it's<00:02:15.989> not

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
of a nice shape to it in that it's not

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.780 
of a nice shape to it in that it's not
just<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:17.430> know<00:02:17.660> ratbat<00:02:18.660> cats<00:02:19.080> at<00:02:19.500> Mat<00:02:19.860> right

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
to write in and you can actually make

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.479

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.699 
have read ODEs that are as long as whole
entire<00:02:43.019> books<00:02:44.390> but<00:02:45.390> probably<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.170> good<00:02:46.500> length
