00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 friends of the film welcome to defa and 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.150
 the review with a new trailer check 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.830
 and that is about a movie 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.050
 billberry in the main role to be 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.679
 unbelievably happy and that's about it 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.780
 Hyde Park on the heart 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.529
 hello who was that the president wishes 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.970
 to see me 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.199
 I would go to Hyde for a visit 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.020
 park on the estate of president 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.830
 roosevelt invited daisy what a 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.869
 rare piece 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.430
 his mother was of the opinion he needed 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.869
 something distracting from his work and 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.490
 the pressure of the president on him 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.500
 how it would be if we both times 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.780
 go out somewhere where it is quiet 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.460
 in each spring showed me franklin 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.110
 a secular is therefore not on 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.850
 I no longer see our minders from 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.040
 and so we have to start 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.579
 namely, and soon we became the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.780
 best friends better present the king 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.379
 and the queen is on the way 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.329
 then they are not king right there 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.489
 of england had until then ever america 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.260
 Visited so nice that you visit us 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.210
 the president is distributing that me 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.250
 do not set up and so they were drinking 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.350
 Here in the country where we all are 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.670
 should relax because of the mother - to 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.470
 Tenth said that I her 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.830
 call royal sovereignty stylized 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.720
 should 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.720
 Do you mind if I call it 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.689
 the picnic has the president's wife 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.659
 planned that as main storage and 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:25.380
 to be under surveillance and ridiculous 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:33.390
 I do not know its me 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:35.070
 Beloved the king looked nervous 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.840
 without our help maybe it will at 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.530
 No one in England will give his king 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.020
 can be 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.090
 good luck we serve the king and 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.100
 the queen of england one is coming now 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.920
 You never know that madhouse 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.420
 They did not want me as their king 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.229
 I did not know the king of 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.659
 England is elected as it gets 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.810
 I could persuade America to 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.880
 help 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.000
 I'm going to swim a round come 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.000
 With 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.010
 then not no pictures 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.130
 swimwear 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.980
 we believe you see our weaknesses 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.410
 but they do not want to see them when 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.580
 they look at us 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.580
 Do you have it comfortable back there 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.750
 I know how important this is 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.390
 weekend was 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.400
 for her 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.379
 for us for the world 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.879
 for hyde park am Harz we would have for 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.930
 this topic should demand entry 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.560
 then we would have a lot of money 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.560
 earned 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.459
 when I saw the trailer for the first time 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.230
 I was incredibly surprised I like 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.640
 the story already i love bill bray 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.680
 and the whole thing can really happen here 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.690
 Great feeling hammer woman is only possible 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.020
 Once in Hyde Park on the Hudson it will be 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.730
 1939 tells the first time that 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.050
 head of the English crown king 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.810
 George VI 6 together with Queen Elizabeth 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.800
 to visit the us president 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.530
 Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.300
 roosevelt over the weekend and what 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.069
 just this president and this king 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.739
 to live together a love affair of 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.200
 us presidents and all prejudices of 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.519
 Between England and the US he often 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.750
 but they are already being parodied 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.310
 they probably lead one 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.840
 whole lot of funny moments 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.150
 come about and also the himself 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.040
 impending World War II and the 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.790
 ask if the usa is ready for england 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.140
 to stand side by side 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.299
 There is a whole lot of political 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.830
 Conflicts great characters of the trailer 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.019
 shows there already from this film could 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.580
 I changed my love for the thirties 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.590
 1940s filmic that can 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.959
 look really great and there mary wants 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.489
 has signed for the movie faith 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.019
 I think that 's right over it 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.790
 a sense for those beautiful movies 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.410
 swing between the lines and it 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.480
 do not overdo not sign 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.760
 and often create great magical moments 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.130
 him on the side hannelore lay semmel west 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.109
 Olivia Colman and some others 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.790

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.230

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.040

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.019
 piece of jewelry while I'm very curious 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.489
