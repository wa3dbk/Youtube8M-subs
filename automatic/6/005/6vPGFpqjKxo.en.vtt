 and husbands 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.920
 [Music] 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.570
 today from a cardboard strip of 22 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.570
 inches wide and 3 inches long 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.310
 find the center of the strip and make your 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.400
 design from the center to the 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.640
 ends leaving an inch and a half 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.640
 height 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.730
 Take your ruler to the middle of your design and 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.140
 Mark from the design to the end of 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.489
 the strip on both sides 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.489
 excess cut 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.770
 use the glue gun or glue to 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.640
 paste the craft gems in the 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.640
 desired position 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.210
 Now put the textile glue around 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.210
 to the edges of the earth 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.710
 I added glitter or frost but 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.289
 remember to leave an inch and 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.770
 medium without glitter to close the 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.770
 land 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.500
 Shake off excess glitter place 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.830
 the end of the tiara with glitter 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.830
 over the dull end and you're
