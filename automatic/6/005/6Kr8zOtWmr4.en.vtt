 and when what we're going to do what 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.060
 next we go to the mission 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.279
 secondary number 22 which is called the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.989
 land is in danger in which we are going 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.390
 to defeat the enemies of the next 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.890
 way first let's defeat the ceiba 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.629
 man who is accompanied by vegueta 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.640
 we defeated the shaiba amman after 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.920
 we beat vegueta once 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.260
 we beat a vegueta will appear napa and 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.780
 raditz once these two appear 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.390
 characters we are going to defeat napa no 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.489
 matter if vegueta resuscitates we 're going to 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.260
 keep focused on defeating napa 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.960
 once we defeat napa we're going 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.600
 after defeating vegueta and for 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.309
 last we beat rabbits once we 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.809
 we just defeated radice let's 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.480
 move to the next scenario where 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.890
 we'll find a freezer and his assistant 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.530
 Let's first defeat assistant 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.810
 freezer then to freezer and finally 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.030
 the guinean captain will appear in the same 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.729
 scenario after defeating these 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.680
 characters maybe freezer resurrected a 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.959
 Once he is resurrected we defeated him once 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.700
 more once we defeat the freezer 

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:22.619
 for the second time we will see 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.469
 we were lucky that it appeared trans 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.930
 if you see trunks you approach him and you 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.520
 will give the tap jon sword once you already 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.979
 gives you the traction sword simply 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.229
 you have to finish the mission to complete it 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.450
 you must not lose the mission if you lose the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.549
 mission you will also lose the object 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.490
 that you just gave trans the appearance 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.250
 of trance is totally random no no 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.229
 can be this insured that it appears 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.759
 always if you see that trans does not appear 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.130
 after defeating the freezer you can 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.960
 restart the mission and try once 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.459
 more defeat the enemies in the same 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.649
 order in which I mentioned them to 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.299
 beginning of the video and if they can not 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.310
 defeat also in any other order 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.229
 the truth is I'm not sure if he has 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.810
 much to see in the order that the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.239
 defeats but the appearance of tron if it is 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.770
 totally random that I do not assure you 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:10.349
 I can not assure you in what way 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.910
 it may seem exactly but this is 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.090
 the way to get the tap sword 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.950
 jon a unfortunately is not there is not the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.900
 traction sword as a goal in this 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.610
 mission is to say you can not see if you the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.130
 they give in that mission or that's not why 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.810
 many do not know how to get this sword and 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.220
 well up here the guide to take as 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.970
 tapon jon sword I hope you have them 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.920
 made clear 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.660
 If you have any questions, you can leave your 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.010
 comments now I will tell you how 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.200
 get the movements so that you 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.550
 character can move the sword the 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.590
 movements you get in the mission 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.840
 secondary number 24 which is called 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.970
 worse combination these movements are 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.830
 they call glowing cut and cut 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.530
 ardent at least those are the two that 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.540
 I have to use the sword and these 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.130
 you give them troms since it is one of the 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.690
 characters that you face in this mission 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.250
 the way these arrive 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.560
 movements then simply attack 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.950
 trump between a combination of combos 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.240
 with basic attacks, super attacks and 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.870
 last I finish it with an attack 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.820
 definitive 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.380
 first defeat thrones and then to 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.990
 vegueta since the two appear in the 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.250
 same scenario if you see that trump does not 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.800
 gives no skill after 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.780
 defeat him restart the mission and try 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.760
 back to this one start at the beginning 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.950
 the mission face and face through 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.080
 again one more time that's the way that 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.490
 they get does not have does not have something 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.050
 specifically what you should do to 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.580
 get them and well I hope you have them 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.350
 served this guide how to get the 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.300
 traction sword and the movements of 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.010
 the sword if you have any doubt or 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.660
 question about the video or some 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.709
 another suit that they want to take alternative 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.020
 You can let me know in your 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.550
