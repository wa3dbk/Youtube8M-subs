00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
anyway guys it's a sack 3 DNA bomb and

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.840 
anyway guys it's a sack 3 DNA bomb and
this<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.240> in<00:02:32.420> my<00:02:32.660> opinion<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.230> most<00:02:33.440> fun<00:02:34.070> run

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
this is in my opinion the most fun run

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.550 
this is in my opinion the most fun run
and<00:02:35.030> gun<00:02:35.180> class<00:02:35.540> now<00:02:35.840> notice<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.290> didn't<00:02:36.530> say

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
and gun class now notice I didn't say

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.470 
and gun class now notice I didn't say
the<00:02:36.890> best<00:02:37.160> running<00:02:37.550> gun<00:02:37.790> class<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.300> would

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
the best running gun class I would

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.040 
the best running gun class I would
definitely<00:02:39.110> put<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:40.280> ASM<00:02:40.790> one<00:02:41.060> over<00:02:41.480> this<00:02:41.690> gun

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
definitely put the ASM one over this gun

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.350 
definitely put the ASM one over this gun
for<00:02:42.650> any<00:02:42.890> running<00:02:43.340> gun<00:02:43.520> class<00:02:43.790> probably<00:02:44.120> any

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
for any running gun class probably any

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.600

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
SMG class if I really wanted to do as

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.699 
SMG class if I really wanted to do as
well<00:02:46.850> as<00:02:46.940> possible<00:02:47.450> but<00:02:47.750> as<00:02:47.840> far<00:02:48.110> as<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.410> fun

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
well as possible but as far as the fun

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.800 
well as possible but as far as the fun
factor<00:02:48.980> goes<00:02:49.370> this<00:02:49.700> class<00:02:50.030> is<00:02:50.300> that<00:02:50.390> in<00:02:50.570> my

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
factor goes this class is that in my

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.680 
factor goes this class is that in my
opinion<00:02:50.900> is<00:02:51.380> just<00:02:51.440> top<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.280> charge<00:02:52.550> chop<00:02:53.420> chop

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
opinion is just top the charge chop chop

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.630 
opinion is just top the charge chop chop
into<00:02:54.020> charge<00:02:54.320> chopping<00:02:55.040> up<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.160> charts

but this class is not as versatile as if
you<00:03:06.709> were<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:06.950> use<00:03:07.070> an<00:03:07.250> ASM<00:03:07.640> one<00:03:07.850> class<00:03:08.090> because

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
you were to use an ASM one class because

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.320 
you were to use an ASM one class because
there's<00:03:09.200> your<00:03:09.980> kind<00:03:10.190> of<00:03:10.280> limited<00:03:10.730> on<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.090> maps

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
you do want to be a little bit careful

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.650 
you do want to be a little bit careful
what<00:03:34.519> you<00:03:34.640> pick<00:03:34.850> but<00:03:35.030> you<00:03:35.120> do<00:03:35.299> have<00:03:35.390> a<00:03:35.480> couple

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
what you pick but you do have a couple

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.890 
what you pick but you do have a couple
of<00:03:35.900> options<00:03:36.110> I<00:03:36.530> do<00:03:36.950> like<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.370> laser<00:03:37.760> sight<00:03:38.150> for

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
of options I do like the laser sight for

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.960 
of options I do like the laser sight for
the<00:03:39.019> accuracy<00:03:39.860> you<00:03:40.310> could<00:03:40.489> also<00:03:40.670> use<00:03:40.790> a

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
the accuracy you could also use a

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.550 
the accuracy you could also use a
different<00:03:41.540> variant<00:03:41.959> that<00:03:42.049> gives<00:03:42.410> you

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
different variant that gives you

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.100 
different variant that gives you
handling<00:03:43.250> which<00:03:43.820> i<00:03:44.060> think<00:03:44.120> is<00:03:44.390> you<00:03:44.570> tighter

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
handling which i think is you tighter

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.440 
handling which i think is you tighter
hip<00:03:45.410> fire<00:03:45.620> spread<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:46.130> that<00:03:47.030> would<00:03:47.180> definitely

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
hip fire spread so that would definitely

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.289 
hip fire spread so that would definitely
help<00:03:47.780> out<00:03:48.320> with<00:03:48.590> this<00:03:48.769> class<00:03:49.100> you<00:03:49.940> want<00:03:50.120> to

help out with this class you want to

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.229 
help out with this class you want to
also<00:03:50.600> take<00:03:51.079> a<00:03:51.140> look<00:03:51.440> at<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:52.190> extended<00:03:52.910> mags

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
but I feel like rapid-fire makes you a

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.280 
but I feel like rapid-fire makes you a
little<00:04:15.139> too<00:04:15.500> inaccurate

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
consistency and the rapid fire just kind

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.720 
consistency and the rapid fire just kind
of<00:04:21.320> exacerbates<00:04:22.320> that<00:04:22.620> so<00:04:23.160> you<00:04:23.250> want<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.610> be
