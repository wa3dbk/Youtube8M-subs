00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.160
 I am looking forward to the 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.380
 BlockhÃ¼tte and I just got up 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.280
 bought new and just do it 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.690
 are cool 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.140
 I always have to do that right away 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.850
 I am a total fan of 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.650
 tune this clip I have times 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:25.750
 Nine bought from cork the patch squat g 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.750
 it is said so beautiful or petrucci 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.259
 and the thing is just awesome 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.520
 in contrast to my old one has the 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.350
 I'm already half way 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.879
 disposed of the disadvantage that one the 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.550
 display can not rotate and I think 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.230
 to describe it totally if you have one 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.760
 clip tuner has and you have to head 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.930
 always turn to the side then I will 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.670
 the display can be seen at all or 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.960
 if the display is too small or too small 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.790
 Somehow almost otherwise and this place here 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.350
 he just got new ones you can 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.700
 you see that has deflected that can 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.050
 you move forwards and backwards and 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.260
 then you can just stop the display 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.880
 generally turn on a ball joint and 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.540
 I think that really needs to be cool 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.610
 I say 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.070
 so you can the floor on each of 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.070
 the head plate so fasten that one 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.590
 really straight on it can see what 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.540
 are you going to love the man 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.190
 guitar as good as you see and then 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.470
 you can just turn it on 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.840
 I'm looking for a bit 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.310
 a little bit if you can grow that 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.770
 that's for the first problem so 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.479
 the demonstration effect I have to first 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.150
 but I can get used to it that way 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:35.170
 back and I hinbringt sum times a 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:38.229
 Little try on this device here 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.159
 I keep my guitar in view 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.549
 come again closer to my camera 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.250
 can not turn it on here 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.530
 But now that's not cool and that 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.030
 I can find that cool if I am now 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:58.170
 a page limit stops na that's even 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.170
 a liquid display 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:06.250
 it reacts immediately and abruptly and that 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.819
 display is super cool readable super big 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.340
 and snaps and works really cool 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.890
 really fast correctness totally cool 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.330
 So if that's not cool so there 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.050
 I do not really know it either way I do 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.180
 such times back here so and the 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.940
 over and over again and that's why I think 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.200
 such ones are totally cool 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.580
 this always has the advantage of being live 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.930
 Some may say that they are me now 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.930
 if you have such a clip tuner at the 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.790
 guitar I think that's totally cool 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.590
 can the guitar simply because in the regulator 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.510
 turn down there is no power left 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.390
 get out of the guitar I do not have a cable 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.819
 change and I can do it right away 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.690
 my guitar quickly through voices 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.459
 live on stage is the super cool it 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.650
 yes there are few inventions I 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.330
 but really great today 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.970
 that's what and that thing's basket 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.410
 pitchfork g will be so beautiful 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.190
 I think it's about 20 o 'clock 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.190
 Euro 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.319
 that's what horny each of the one 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.060
 reasonable tuner wants to have that 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.129
 I put that to the heart that is totally cool 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.480
 from the I'm thrilled the choir 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.480
 pitchfork g
