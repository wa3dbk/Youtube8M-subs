not it's called the Miller not and I
teach<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:17.940> how<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.060> tie

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.630 

the<00:00:22.170> reason<00:00:22.440> I<00:00:22.500> tie<00:00:22.770> this<00:00:22.830> knot<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.190> because

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
the reason I tie this knot is because

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.940 
the reason I tie this knot is because
it's<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.940> double<00:00:24.210> wrap<00:00:24.960> nut<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.650> two

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
it's a double wrap nut you have two

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.650 
it's a double wrap nut you have two
strands<00:00:26.369> aligned<00:00:26.730> that's<00:00:27.029> secured<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
strands aligned that's secured to the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.749 
strands aligned that's secured to the
eyelid<00:00:28.020> of<00:00:28.110> debate<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.560> which<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.860> tie<00:00:29.100> and<00:00:29.400> in

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
eyelid of debate in which you tie and in

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:30.890 
eyelid of debate in which you tie and in
my<00:00:29.910> opinion<00:00:30.270> that's<00:00:30.360> going<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.630> be<00:00:30.689> much

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
my opinion that's going to be much

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.299 
my opinion that's going to be much
stronger<00:00:31.170> than<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.470> lot<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.740> your<00:00:31.830> traditional

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
stronger than a lot of your traditional

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.160 
stronger than a lot of your traditional
nuts<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:33.090> going<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.270> start<00:00:33.450> off<00:00:33.570> by<00:00:33.600> passing

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
nuts you going to start off by passing

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.590 
nuts you going to start off by passing
the<00:00:34.650> line<00:00:34.830> through<00:00:35.220> the<00:00:35.309> eyelet<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.360> you're

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the line through the eyelet and you're

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.119 
the line through the eyelet and you're
going<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.780> come<00:00:37.020> through<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.530> you're<00:00:37.980> going

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
going to come through and you're going

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.740 
going to come through and you're going
to<00:00:38.190> pass<00:00:38.400> that<00:00:38.640> line<00:00:38.879> back<00:00:39.180> through<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.480> same

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
to pass that line back through that same

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.979 
to pass that line back through that same
eyelet<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.280> went<00:00:41.489> through<00:00:41.610> and

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
eyelet that you just went through and

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.090 
eyelet that you just went through and
you're<00:00:42.989> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.170> secure<00:00:43.500> those<00:00:43.710> two<00:00:43.920> lines

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
you're going to secure those two lines

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.890 
you're going to secure those two lines
in<00:00:44.280> your<00:00:44.400> left<00:00:44.550> hand<00:00:44.760> what<00:00:45.330> that<00:00:45.480> does<00:00:45.690> is

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
in your left hand what that does is

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.080 
in your left hand what that does is
creates<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.350> loop<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.769> top<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
creates a loop on top of the of the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.540 
creates a loop on top of the of the
eyelet<00:00:48.480> as<00:00:48.629> such<00:00:49.400> pull<00:00:50.400> on<00:00:50.580> this<00:00:50.730> tag<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:52.550> to

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
eyelet as such pull on this tag in to

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.160 
eyelet as such pull on this tag in to
make<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.879> loop<00:00:54.149> smaller<00:00:54.540> to<00:00:54.780> where<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.020> can

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
make this loop smaller to where we can

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.360 
make this loop smaller to where we can
work<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> knot<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:57.329> next<00:00:57.629> step<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.370> take

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
work with the knot the next step is take

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.279 
work with the knot the next step is take
this<00:00:59.550> tag<00:00:59.789> in<00:01:00.000> we're<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.660> go<00:01:00.780> two<00:01:00.840> wraps

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
this tag in we're going to go two wraps

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.080 
this tag in we're going to go two wraps
around<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.800> main<00:01:01.950> line<00:01:03.350> one

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
around the main line one

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.040 
around the main line one
two<00:01:07.670> after<00:01:08.670> we've<00:01:08.820> done<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.690> next<00:01:09.720> step

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
two after we've done that the next step

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.469 
two after we've done that the next step
is<00:01:10.410> to<00:01:10.710> pass<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.220> tag<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.729> through<00:01:12.330> this

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
is to pass this tag in through this

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.529 
is to pass this tag in through this
small<00:01:12.840> loop<00:01:13.200> secure<00:01:13.649> it<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.800> your<00:01:13.950> left<00:01:14.130> hand

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.700 

once<00:01:18.539> I've<00:01:18.690> passed<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.140> tag<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.530> through

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
once I've passed that tag in through

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.350 
once I've passed that tag in through
that<00:01:19.740> small<00:01:20.130> loop<00:01:20.310> I'm<00:01:20.490> going<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.700> secure<00:01:21.149> all

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
that small loop I'm going to secure all

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.160 
that small loop I'm going to secure all
three<00:01:22.170> lines<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.340> my<00:01:23.399> left<00:01:24.060> hand<00:01:24.300> as<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:25.020> can

right<00:01:33.330> here<00:01:33.740> twist<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.890> around<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.190> main<00:01:35.399> line

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
right here twist it around the main line

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:45.810 
right here twist it around the main line
once<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.119> grab<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.660> tag<00:01:36.929> in
