00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
you can see already they do actually

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.630 
you can see already they do actually
fold<00:02:14.060> up<00:02:14.240> like<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.920> make<00:02:16.070> a<00:02:16.100> little<00:02:16.550> bit

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
fold up like so to make a little bit

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.710 
fold up like so to make a little bit
more<00:02:16.820> compact<00:02:17.390> for<00:02:18.230> transporting<00:02:19.220> around

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
more compact for transporting around

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.160 
more compact for transporting around
