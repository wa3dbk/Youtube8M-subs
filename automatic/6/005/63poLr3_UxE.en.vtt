program you do need some of that time

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.680 
program you do need some of that time
because<00:02:50.040> you're<00:02:50.700> changing<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.330> weights<00:02:51.510> and

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
because you're changing the weights and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.140 
because you're changing the weights and
you<00:02:51.780> figure<00:02:52.020> out<00:02:52.170> what<00:02:52.350> you<00:02:52.440> can<00:02:52.590> live<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.150> it's

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
you figure out what you can live so it's

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.930 
you figure out what you can live so it's
not<00:02:54.270> 50<00:02:54.810> minutes<00:02:55.140> of<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.590> just<00:02:56.160> killing

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
not 50 minutes of you just killing

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.240 
not 50 minutes of you just killing
yourself<00:02:57.360> doing<00:02:57.720> hits<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.680> drills<00:02:59.010> and

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
yourself doing hits and drills and

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.100 
yourself doing hits and drills and
bootcamp<00:02:59.700> stuff<00:02:59.970> it's<00:03:00.210> it's<00:03:00.420> weight<00:03:00.750> lifting

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
bootcamp stuff it's it's weight lifting

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.020
