 Sam channel Well, it's time 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.880
 tell you about another animatronic 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:19.740
 from the game five night at freddys 3 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:22.500
 foxy to fantasy on your screens his model 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.400
 very similar to the foxy model and sleep on 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.250
 ted freddy's 2 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.880
 naked endoskeleton sticking out 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.090
 wires 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.910
 white eyes and slightly smaller sizes 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.880
 compared to other robots he 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.690
 looks pretty burnt like this ones 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.750
 and phantoms 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.969
 he has no dorn arm which 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.219
 there was a hook that can be seen in 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.770
 a box with parts of it for the top three 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.710
 standing in the office when you saw the phantom 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.940
 Foxy in the office immediately turn in 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.370
 right side of the office 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.980
 otherwise equestrian companion as in all 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:02.670
 parts of the foxy with the most uncontrollable 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:04.619
 the opponent as well as the phantom freddy and 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.770
 foxy can't be seen on camera he 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.729
 is the most unpredictable 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.610
 animatronic as it appears 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.280
 suddenly does not jump on the player 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.680
 at the earliest opportunity after his 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.750
 attacks like after attacking others 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.080
 phantoms of some system require 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.080
 reboot 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.250
 his scrimer is a bit like a scrimer 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.859
 Foxy from the second part in the office he stands 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.679
 just like in the parter visa in the second 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:37.049
 parts u foxy in the first part of the game two 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.450
 toes in the second and third 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.270
 parts three fingers though five does not give 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.729
 freddys 3 is a sequel to five nights at 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.819
 freddy's can be seen on the box with 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.329
 toys in the office hook maybe it's a hook 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.000
 foxy 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.599
 because fantasies foxy doesn't have a hook 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.869
 although it is strange that he has a head like that 

00:01:54.599 --> 00:02:00.209
 as on camera 04 you can see the layout of his head 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.899
 but then the guard could take him for 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:06.119
 his mouth is always open now 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.190
 even at the beginning of the skimmer blame 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.709
 extra it looks like a lower y 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.890
 massive rather than in the game this is due 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.500
 so that in this position and screamer he 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.390
 preparing to jump in the third part he 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.849
 attacks are covered with bandage 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.700
 unlike the first and second part 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.769
 mobile version it attacks immediately if 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.319
 remove the tablet system to avoid 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.329
 foxy attacks you should slowly 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.310
 turn to the center of the office 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.709
 if there are fuchsias stop 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.569
 rotates and turn on the foxy tablet 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.609
 after some time will leave 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.410
 however in emergency situations it is better 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.959
 get a suggestion from foxy 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.480
 than death from the springtrap mobile 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.579
 version of this trick is not free and fox 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.049
 the only phantom 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:53.840
 pounces on the player 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.840
 but why do it if he is a phantom 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.170
 but what have we looked at yet another 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.629
 mysterious animatronics 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.060
