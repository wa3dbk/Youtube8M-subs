00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
of the lines so just kind of think of it

as like if you're coloring in a coloring

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.140 
as like if you're coloring in a coloring
book<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.100> you<00:04:32.250> go<00:04:32.340> outside<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.640> lines<00:04:32.850> and

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
book and you go outside the lines and

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.490 
book and you go outside the lines and
then<00:04:33.270> you<00:04:33.330> just<00:04:33.450> take<00:04:33.630> an<00:04:33.750> eraser<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:34.320> erase

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
then you just take an eraser and erase

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:53.000 
then you just take an eraser and erase
all<00:04:35.040> the<00:04:35.490> edges

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010
