00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.070
 hello everyone welcome today we are going to 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.619
 teach how to make heaven's tocinillo 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.250
 making tocinillo del cielo is very easy 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.779
 we simply need water aromas 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.720
 we are going to put lemon skin 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.770
 orange peel cinnamon stick yolks 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.970
 egg and sugar apart in this mold 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.100
 we have put candy 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.470
 like the one of flan is a candy that 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.880
 you can see in our our channel 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.190
 Video recipes like celadora the process 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.540
 is the next let's fire 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.040
 our casserole and in it we are going to 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.110
 make a syrup 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.440
 with water 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.390
 and the good sugar let's let the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.129
 syrup is made and that reach 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.719
 the point of evra 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.230
 meanwhile what we are going to do is going to 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:11.930
 be incorporate also 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.230
 the aromas 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.050
 inside the mixture 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.170
 [Music] 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.119
 manuel cinnamon we are going to leave 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.040
 well let's remove the aromas 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.900
 because it is reaching the density that 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.550
 we look for 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.980
 and before that happens we need 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.980
 have the syrup totally clear 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.340
 of cinnamon peels and stick 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.820
 good if you look at camera 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.189
 has not yet reached the density you are going to 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.620
 see that it decays making a very 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.080
 fine 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.070
 and there comes a moment that the last drop to 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.159
 fall form a thread that is the point of 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.219
 strand 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.270
 the moment the drops fall intact has 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.270
 Let there be a small drawing 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.009
 when the drop falls, this occurs 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.020
 as the water evaporates 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.460
 reaches that density is the point of evra 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.740
 final 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.560
 it's important that I get to catch that 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.360
 point and also not to exceed it that 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.400
 it would be better to stay below 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.980
 point that is somewhat light to that 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.569
 get really thick because of another 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.360
 so if it is too thick then no 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:27.240
 we could mix it with the yolk 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.650
 and practically yes that is I do not know if 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.650
 You see falling integrally 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.490
 and so he's making me the strand already 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.819
 I would have it 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.420
 to see if you can see it on camera 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.420
 you see 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.209
 the last drops you see that evra 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.209
 there 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.300
 from the point 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.980
 well now once we have it and what 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.140
 we're going to do is going to be about it 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.700
 marble to lose the temperature and 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.370
 to be able to incorporate it without any kind of 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.640
 risk to the yolks 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.890
 on the other hand we are going to take these yolks 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.890
 and we're going to break them 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.690
 and mixing we are not looking for it right now 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.170
 introduce a lot of air just that 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.250
 break 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.470
 and form a homogeneous whole 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.450
 you see that the movements that I do not 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.010
 I barely introduce what would happen 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.600
 it would be that then the result would not be 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.570
 compact the sky screw 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.720
 there would be small holes fruit of that 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:41.580
 air introduction then the 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.580
 envolvent movements 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.940
 and good , and would simply 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.569
 let's wait for this mixture of 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.670
 syrup 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.250
 in warm 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.200
 that can take us there is not too much 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.770
 amount I believe that in five minutes there 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.020
 we are going to run no risk and we go to 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:04.330
 mix it with the yolk and then fill 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.100
 So you'll wait for now 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.350
 well we have had it for five 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.280
 minutes perched on the marble and now 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.790
 we are just going to pour it 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.250
 slowly 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.660
 about the mixture of the yolks at the same time 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.880
 that we are pouring it with fine thread what 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.990
 What are we going to do? 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.410
 to avoid 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.780
 make us any kind of the side 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.280
 [Music] 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.280
 and now what we are going to do is going to be 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.790
 simply pour the whole mixture in the 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.910
 mold that we have here arranged 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.910
 [Music] 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.959
 in turn we are going to put 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:46.689
 the mold inside a baking sheet 

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:49.920
 that we have filled in a little less than the 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:52.320
 half of water to make a bain marie 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.860
 and we will go to the oven for 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.710
 25 minutes at 170 180 degrees depends on 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.590
 little of the oven that you have at home 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.380
 here we could perfectly put paper 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.050
 of aluminum on the on the part 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.790
 top of the mold to prevent it from lasting 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.680
 or if you like a little the golden one there 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.470
 people who also like to leave it I 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.690
 I leave as is 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.390
 and nothing I'm going with it to the oven and now 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.600
 shows the good result we come from the 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.410
 oven 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.220
 and we already have it perfectly 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.290
 perfectly curdled now what we're going 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.510
 to do is going to be getting him to put it inside 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:31.110
 of the refrigerator for one hour 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.880
 so that it is very cold and unmold the 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.200
 without any kind of problem we have 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.270
 had in the fridge 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.850
 and it is already totally cold what we are going to 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.960
 to do is with the help of a lace 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.960
 let's go looking for the edges 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.310
 as if it were a flan 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.249
 exactly the same to facilitate the 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.499
 unmolding process 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:54.819
 in this case it is a mold 

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:56.409
 nonstick would not be necessary but good 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:57.900
 at home if you do not have it is always 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:02.040
 convenient 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.840
 that you do this action to make sure 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.090
 we are going to dismantle it with the 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.370
 help of this dish 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.330
 [Music] 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.330
 and this would be 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.050
 the result is important that you do not have 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.969
 much the mold because if not it is not going to 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.530
 be well homogeneous on the one hand will be 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:20.590
 and on the other it is possible that 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.830
 liquid then the thinner it is 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:26.150
 best 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.150
 I'm going to cut a portion 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:30.200
 so you can see how the 

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:32.870
 cut 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.710
 [Music] 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.260
 it's super juicy and good this would be 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:47.200
 our tocinillo say it 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:47.200
