picked up so many carrots on the cheap i

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.020 
picked up so many carrots on the cheap i
picked<00:03:09.750> up<00:03:09.840> joe<00:03:10.260> hertz<00:03:10.560> Walcott's<00:03:11.340> Chiellini

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
picked up joe hertz Walcott's Chiellini

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.050 
picked up joe hertz Walcott's Chiellini
david<00:03:12.600> luiz<00:03:12.800> de<00:03:13.800> maria<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.520> could<00:03:14.700> see<00:03:14.880> the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
david luiz de maria you could see the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.509 
david luiz de maria you could see the
pattern<00:03:15.450> at<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:16.320> that's<00:03:16.740> trending<00:03:17.190> like<00:03:17.340> you

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
pattern at the that's trending like you

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.850 
pattern at the that's trending like you
know<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:17.820> therefore<00:03:18.360> 1212<00:03:19.050> Chiellini<00:03:19.590> for

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
know and therefore 1212 Chiellini for

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.910 
know and therefore 1212 Chiellini for
today<00:03:20.180> 2400<00:03:21.180> I'm<00:03:21.420> gonna<00:03:21.540> make<00:03:21.720> well<00:03:22.230> over<00:03:22.260> 10-k

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
today 2400 I'm gonna make well over 10-k

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.290 
today 2400 I'm gonna make well over 10-k
for<00:03:22.980> him<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.340> I'm<00:03:23.459> quite<00:03:23.700> pleased<00:03:24.060> about<00:03:24.180> that

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
for him so I'm quite pleased about that

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.810 
for him so I'm quite pleased about that
four<00:03:25.170> three<00:03:25.380> two<00:03:25.560> one<00:03:25.590> Joe<00:03:25.980> Hart<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.400> will

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
four three two one Joe Hart I will

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.400 
four three two one Joe Hart I will
probably<00:03:27.209> be<00:03:27.330> a<00:03:27.360> tiny<00:03:27.630> bit<00:03:27.750> more<00:03:27.870> because<00:03:28.170> it

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
probably be a tiny bit more because it

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.080 
probably be a tiny bit more because it
is<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.560> better<00:03:28.739> formation<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:29.550> always<00:03:29.760> take

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
is a better formation so always take

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.220 
is a better formation so always take
that<00:03:30.239> into<00:03:30.420> consideration<00:03:30.450> when<00:03:31.080> you're

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
that into consideration when you're

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.410 
that into consideration when you're
using<00:03:31.440> technique<00:03:32.010> take<00:03:32.640> into<00:03:32.820> consideration

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
using technique take into consideration

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.570 
using technique take into consideration
at<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:34.380> formation<00:03:34.800> that<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.310> player<00:03:35.550> is

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
at the formation that the player is

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.449 
at the formation that the player is
because<00:03:36.180> obviously<00:03:36.330> for<00:03:36.720> 42<00:03:37.140> 43<00:03:37.530> 3<00:03:37.920> 4<00:03:38.190> 12<00:03:38.340> and

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
because obviously for 42 43 3 4 12 and

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.199 
because obviously for 42 43 3 4 12 and
two<00:03:38.670> will<00:03:38.970> go<00:03:39.180> for<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.630> considerable<00:03:40.320> a

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
two will go for a considerable a

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.090 
two will go for a considerable a
considerable<00:03:42.209> amount<00:03:42.330> more<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:42.930> know<00:03:43.100> so

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
considerable amount more you know so

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.920 
considerable amount more you know so
yeah<00:03:44.400> we'll<00:03:44.640> add<00:03:44.880> will<00:03:45.150> send<00:03:45.420> them<00:03:45.540> all<00:03:45.690> up<00:03:45.810> at

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
yeah we'll add will send them all up at

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.990 
yeah we'll add will send them all up at
the<00:03:45.959> trip<00:03:46.200> I'll<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.620> as<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:46.830> can<00:03:46.980> see<00:03:47.010> ya<00:03:47.370> I

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
the trip I'll and as you can see ya I

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
did sell them all and we'll check at the

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.000 
did sell them all and we'll check at the
trade<00:03:50.459> pilot<00:03:50.730> what<00:03:50.970> all<00:03:51.209> of<00:03:51.239> them<00:03:51.630> sold<00:03:52.140> for<00:03:52.500> so

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
trade pilot what all of them sold for so

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.920 
trade pilot what all of them sold for so
you<00:03:53.070> can<00:03:53.160> see<00:03:53.280> here<00:03:53.519> I<00:03:53.549> made<00:03:54.209> quite<00:03:54.570> a<00:03:54.630> bit<00:03:54.840> of

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
you can see here I made quite a bit of

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.130 
you can see here I made quite a bit of
profit<00:03:55.200> off<00:03:55.560> most<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.190> carrot<00:03:56.610> I<00:03:56.790> sold<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:58.019> lot

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
profit off most the carrot I sold a lot

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.530 
profit off most the carrot I sold a lot
of<00:03:58.530> them<00:03:58.620> on<00:03:58.799> for<00:03:59.190> double<00:03:59.790> or<00:03:59.910> triple<00:04:00.120> what<00:04:00.510> I

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
of them on for double or triple what I

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.090 
of them on for double or triple what I
actually<00:04:00.780> got<00:04:01.230> them<00:04:01.410> for<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.769> there<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.070> can

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
actually got them for and there you can

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.070 
actually got them for and there you can
see<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:02.370> so<00:04:02.790> Chiellini<00:04:03.239> for<00:04:03.390> nearly<00:04:03.510> 12<00:04:03.840> k

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
see I so Chiellini for nearly 12 k

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.580 
see I so Chiellini for nearly 12 k
picked<00:04:04.560> them<00:04:04.680> up<00:04:04.739> for<00:04:04.940> 2400<00:04:05.940> so<00:04:06.360> yeah<00:04:06.600> I<00:04:06.750> make<00:04:07.410> a

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
picked them up for 2400 so yeah I make a

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.440 
picked them up for 2400 so yeah I make a
massive<00:04:08.040> amount<00:04:08.400> of<00:04:08.459> profit<00:04:08.640> us<00:04:08.820> off<00:04:09.090> this

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
massive amount of profit us off this

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.210 
massive amount of profit us off this
technique<00:04:09.900> this<00:04:10.350> has<00:04:10.500> got<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.680> be<00:04:10.769> my<00:04:10.830> main

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
technique this has got to be my main

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.620 
technique this has got to be my main
technique<00:04:11.640> that<00:04:11.820> I'm<00:04:11.910> going<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.180> use<00:04:12.239> a

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
technique that I'm going to use a

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.750 
technique that I'm going to use a
throughout<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.380> series<00:04:13.680> because<00:04:13.950> it<00:04:14.250> is<00:04:14.430> so

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
throughout the series because it is so

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.550 
throughout the series because it is so
so<00:04:15.000> so<00:04:15.269> effective<00:04:15.750> and<00:04:15.870> you<00:04:15.959> can<00:04:16.080> make<00:04:16.169> so<00:04:16.440> many

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
so so effective and you can make so many

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.020 
so so effective and you can make so many
coins<00:04:16.769> from<00:04:16.979> it<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:17.430> you<00:04:17.489> can<00:04:17.609> see<00:04:17.729> were<00:04:17.850> nearly

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
coins from it so you can see were nearly

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.969 
coins from it so you can see were nearly
on<00:04:18.209> fifty<00:04:18.660> thousand<00:04:19.049> coins<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:19.560> also<00:04:19.830> you<00:04:19.890> can

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
on fifty thousand coins and also you can

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.430 
on fifty thousand coins and also you can
see<00:04:20.100> I<00:04:20.130> had<00:04:20.459> at<00:04:20.700> one<00:04:20.729> last<00:04:21.239> day<00:04:21.479> but<00:04:21.959> what<00:04:22.229> not

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
see I had at one last day but what not

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.810 
see I had at one last day but what not
bad<00:04:22.710> but<00:04:23.280> yeah<00:04:23.520> i'll<00:04:23.729> see<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.180> next<00:04:24.210> time<00:04:24.599> guys
