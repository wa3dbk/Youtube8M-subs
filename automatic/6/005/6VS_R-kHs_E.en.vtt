that<00:00:52.020> had<00:00:52.140> sort<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.410> all<00:00:52.559> ages<00:00:52.829> ago

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
that had sort of all ages ago

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.029 
that had sort of all ages ago
how<00:00:54.059> many<00:00:54.300> started<00:00:54.629> 12<00:00:54.870> string<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.320> didn't

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
how many started 12 string that didn't

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.250 
how many started 12 string that didn't
really<00:00:56.160> know<00:00:56.250> what<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.579> do<00:00:56.879> with<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:58.020> he

and again with the hardware and an

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.570 
and again with the hardware and an
internal<00:01:17.270> preamp<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.570> pick<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:19.340> using<00:01:20.340> this

internal preamp to pick up using this
spider<00:01:21.150> bridge<00:01:21.420> hardware<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.470> took<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
spider bridge hardware so I took the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.929 
spider bridge hardware so I took the
neck<00:01:23.189> out<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.549> or<00:01:23.670> guitar<00:01:25.310> put<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> new<00:01:26.520> top<00:01:26.790> on

which is Baltic birch ply refinished in

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.700 
which is Baltic birch ply refinished in
true<00:01:32.579> oil<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> new<00:01:33.750> sound<00:01:34.079> well<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.500> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
true oil but a new sound well in and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.039 
true oil but a new sound well in and
rather<00:01:34.890> than<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.220> full<00:01:35.490> depth<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.329> well<00:01:36.570> it's

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
rather than the full depth and well it's

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.050 
rather than the full depth and well it's
propped<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.070> more<00:01:38.250> modern<00:01:38.280> dubrow's

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
propped like the more modern dubrow's

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.889 
propped like the more modern dubrow's
and<00:01:39.619> fitted<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:41.310> 12<00:01:41.610> string<00:01:41.850> neck<00:01:42.540> need<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
and fitted the 12 string neck need a

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.060 
and fitted the 12 string neck need a
little<00:01:43.170> bit<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.380> work<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.770> it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
little bit of work to it

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.210 
little bit of work to it
I<00:01:44.100> gave<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.790> quick<00:01:44.880> blow<00:01:45.240> because<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.899> year

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
I gave it a quick blow because the year

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.649 
I gave it a quick blow because the year
and<00:01:47.220> something<00:01:47.640> weird<00:01:47.850> are<00:01:48.060> being<00:01:48.240> done<00:01:48.450> to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
and something weird are being done to

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.859 
and something weird are being done to
the<00:01:48.780> here<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> finish<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.630> we've<00:01:51.630> got<00:01:51.840> a

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the here to the finish and we've got a

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.380 
the here to the finish and we've got a
guitar<00:01:52.079> I'm<00:01:52.380> playing<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.680> with<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.799> pig<00:01:53.390> can't

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
guitar I'm playing it with a pig can't

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.149 
guitar I'm playing it with a pig can't
find<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.659> thumb<00:01:54.840> pick<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.259> quite<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.680> fun

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
find the thumb pick and it's quite a fun

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.819 
find the thumb pick and it's quite a fun
difficult<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:57.049> finger<00:01:58.049> pick<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.380> off<00:01:58.500> string

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
difficult to finger pick to off string

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:07.620 
difficult to finger pick to off string
cleanly<00:01:59.310> so

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.480 

you<00:02:08.630> know<00:02:08.780> from<00:02:08.929> cheap<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.619> think<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.100> strings

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
you know from cheap I think the strings

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.130 
you know from cheap I think the strings
are<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.670> little<00:02:10.789> bit<00:02:11.000> like<00:02:11.209> these<00:02:11.450> are<00:02:11.600> extra

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
are a little bit like these are extra

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.470 
are a little bit like these are extra
lights<00:02:12.380> which<00:02:12.770> I<00:02:12.980> think<00:02:13.220> mm<00:02:13.790> nines<00:02:14.060> down<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.450> Oh

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
lights which I think mm nines down to Oh

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.550 
lights which I think mm nines down to Oh
45<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:16.430> wasn't<00:02:16.760> quite<00:02:16.940> sure<00:02:17.150> what<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.750> what

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
45 so I wasn't quite sure what to what

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.199 
45 so I wasn't quite sure what to what
to<00:02:18.740> do<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.459> needs<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.700> little<00:02:19.850> bit<00:02:20.000> of

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
to do so it needs a little bit of

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.840 
to do so it needs a little bit of
fiddling<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:24.190> rattles<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.310> might<00:02:25.490> need<00:02:25.670> the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
fiddling it rattles and might need the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.449 
fiddling it rattles and might need the
action<00:02:26.540> sorting<00:02:26.990> out<00:02:27.140> my<00:02:27.380> need<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.010> change<00:02:28.340> the

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
action sorting out my need to change the

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.160 
action sorting out my need to change the
strings<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:30.230> this<00:02:30.590> not<00:02:30.890> although<00:02:31.360> it's<00:02:32.360> an<00:02:32.600> AR

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
strings the this not although it's an AR

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.130 
strings the this not although it's an AR
tech<00:02:34.209> it's<00:02:35.209> like<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:36.250> preamp<00:02:37.630> sound<00:02:38.630> jet<00:02:38.930> with<00:02:39.110> a

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
tech it's like a preamp sound jet with a

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.810 
tech it's like a preamp sound jet with a
little<00:02:40.330> Jack<00:02:41.330> with<00:02:41.570> a<00:02:42.100> little<00:02:43.100> gooseneck<00:02:43.580> it's

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
little Jack with a little gooseneck it's

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.449 
little Jack with a little gooseneck it's
very<00:02:44.300> very<00:02:44.630> powerful<00:02:45.200> now<00:02:45.320> think<00:02:45.739> it<00:02:45.950> might<00:02:46.160> it

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
very very powerful now think it might it

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.270 
very very powerful now think it might it
might<00:02:46.489> feedback<00:02:47.300> but<00:02:47.630> we'll<00:02:48.560> put<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:48.860> in<00:02:49.040> and

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
might feedback but we'll put it in and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.130 
might feedback but we'll put it in and
see<00:02:49.340> what<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:49.850> will<00:02:49.940> do<00:02:50.120> this<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:50.510> just<00:02:50.690> playin

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
see what it will do this is just playin

00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:18.250 
see what it will do this is just playin
the<00:02:51.200> acoustically<00:02:51.800> by<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.010> way<00:03:16.989> there<00:03:17.989> you<00:03:18.079> go

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
the acoustically by the way there you go

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.020 
the acoustically by the way there you go
so<00:03:18.590> needs<00:03:18.950> playing<00:03:19.250> in<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:19.519> literally<00:03:19.820> has

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
so needs playing in it literally has

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.420 
so needs playing in it literally has
only<00:03:20.150> been<00:03:20.329> strung<00:03:20.690> up<00:03:20.810> an<00:03:20.959> hour<00:03:21.110> or<00:03:21.350> so<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:21.769> the

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
only been strung up an hour or so so the

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.190 
only been strung up an hour or so so the
bridge<00:03:22.640> will<00:03:22.790> be<00:03:22.820> settling<00:03:23.299> in<00:03:23.480> and<00:03:23.660> that<00:03:23.750> but

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
bridge will be settling in and that but

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.620 
bridge will be settling in and that but
I<00:03:24.230> think<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:24.530> got<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.820> neck<00:03:26.000> angle<00:03:26.180> right

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
I think you got the the neck angle right

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.270 
I think you got the the neck angle right
the<00:03:26.870> action<00:03:27.170> might<00:03:27.320> need<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.590> come<00:03:27.769> down<00:03:27.799> a<00:03:27.980> wee

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
the action might need to come down a wee

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.430 
the action might need to come down a wee
bit<00:03:28.610> as<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.329> say<00:03:29.480> put<00:03:29.660> some<00:03:29.690> different<00:03:30.140> strings

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
bit as I say put some different strings

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.690 
bit as I say put some different strings
on<00:03:30.590> but<00:03:30.739> there's<00:03:30.860> enough<00:03:31.100> height<00:03:31.340> in<00:03:31.610> the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
on but there's enough height in the

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.229 
on but there's enough height in the
bridge<00:03:31.910> to<00:03:32.090> be<00:03:32.209> able<00:03:32.360> to<00:03:32.590> take<00:03:33.590> that<00:03:33.769> down<00:03:37.239> so

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
bridge to be able to take that down so

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.539 
bridge to be able to take that down so
the<00:03:38.360> a<00:03:38.390> there<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:38.780> go<00:03:39.049> it's<00:03:39.350> a<00:03:39.530> stellar<00:03:40.040> 12

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
the a there you go it's a stellar 12

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.430 
the a there you go it's a stellar 12
string<00:03:41.030> resonator<00:03:41.750> guitar<00:03:42.350> ok<00:03:42.920> bye<00:03:43.160> for<00:03:43.190> now
