 director magna 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.800
 the parties agreed that they beat 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:10.749
 besides that match the most 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:13.749
 Suffered

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.280
 two matches passed 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.750
 bailiff and the right 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.750
 found a typo 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.680
