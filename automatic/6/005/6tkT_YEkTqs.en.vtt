00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.860
 and I bring a piece of trick that will mark 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.800
 a story of a before and after in 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.170
 usa and it's the player just like what 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.480
 we remember the end of world war 2 is a 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.860
 little different but good first thing 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.660
 we would have to do is have these 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.810
 closed forces as you see the iron 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.390
 valdÃ©s 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.859
 and wait some when it's closed 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.320
 we go here and we have to make a cry 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.239
 a tone as it is called right now 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.590
 true of the rotating jump of let's say and 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.410
 have to put us to the left 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.110
 then we tell our partner 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.590
 you have to open the door already 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.620
 we will start directly 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.810
 to elevate not only we can not 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.489
 doing more just going up and going up I wanted to 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.650
 add in this trick that you can only 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.690
 do in safeguard mode I think that 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.070
 it's called you can not make a line you do not know 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.500
 can do in an infected but good 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.340
 to entertain with classmates 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.560
 well, it goes well, I think 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.440
 there is not much more to object to this 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.440
 trick the truth we have limited 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.610
 I do not think it will do much for the 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.409
 way to safeguard that they kill the 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.990
 companion we can not revive him and he's 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.280
 in difficulties internal debts 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.729
 we will end up reaching a height that 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.890
 overcome the helicopters the rays all and 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.250
 the truth does not have much much more than 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.170
 object this trick 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.070
 I hope you liked the truth 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.280
 which is a pretty delicate that only 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.720
 take out the voucher that is copied by 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.000
 identify and I think a trick 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.050
 pretty good to be able to add to my 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.150
 channel and I hope you like it 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.460
 and until the next let the mind 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.510
 raising the other two of young people who 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.550
 there is to the building if it happens to me and 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.620
 your clicks 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.120
 I do not have much else, you take anything that 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.120
 object and until the next 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.640
 Deleted friends get ready 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.830
 approaching a large enemy gate 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.830
 hungry
