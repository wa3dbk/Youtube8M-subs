00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
allowed and I mixed up loads of

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.780

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
groundbreaking all the pole rigs didn't

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.460 
groundbreaking all the pole rigs didn't
know<00:03:31.850> it<00:03:32.000> was<00:03:32.120> well<00:03:32.269> prepared<00:03:32.450> for<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:33.019> but<00:03:33.050> I

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
know it was well prepared for it but I

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.640 
know it was well prepared for it but I
decided<00:03:34.340> that<00:03:34.610> if<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:34.880> drew<00:03:35.230> where<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:36.260> was<00:03:36.470> today

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
decided that if I drew where I was today

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.800 
decided that if I drew where I was today
shallow-water<00:03:37.610> wasn't<00:03:38.330> gonna<00:03:38.450> put<00:03:38.690> anything

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
shallow-water wasn't gonna put anything

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.300 
shallow-water wasn't gonna put anything
there<00:03:38.989> wasn't<00:03:39.380> been<00:03:39.470> abandoned<00:03:40.130> simply

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
there wasn't been abandoned simply

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.880 
there wasn't been abandoned simply
because<00:03:40.850> I<00:03:41.150> felt<00:03:41.900> those<00:03:42.170> pegs<00:03:42.470> weren't<00:03:42.739> good

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
because I felt those pegs weren't good

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.110 
because I felt those pegs weren't good
enough<00:03:42.920> to<00:03:43.190> catch<00:03:43.340> in<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.550> fridge<00:03:43.760> to<00:03:43.970> win

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
enough to catch in the fridge to win

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.509 
enough to catch in the fridge to win
warframe<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:45.290> that's<00:03:46.100> what<00:03:46.220> I<00:03:46.250> was<00:03:46.370> here<00:03:46.489> to

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
warframe and that's what I was here to

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.140 
warframe and that's what I was here to
do<00:03:46.790> so<00:03:47.540> I<00:03:48.050> just<00:03:48.430> just<00:03:49.430> do<00:03:49.579> it<00:03:49.700> through<00:03:49.820> a<00:03:49.910> feed

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
do so I just just do it through a feed

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.540 
do so I just just do it through a feed
roared<00:03:50.450> through<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:50.780> bomb<00:03:51.019> or

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
roared through a bomb or

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.310 
roared through a bomb or
just<00:03:51.970> fish<00:03:52.150> football<00:03:52.720> so<00:03:52.990> rather<00:03:53.200> than

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
just fish football so rather than

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.870 
just fish football so rather than

pole

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.610

maybe then going on the feeder or
whatever<00:03:56.860> you've<00:03:57.040> actually<00:03:57.190> decided<00:03:57.640> just<00:03:57.670> to

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
whatever you've actually decided just to

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
and it was confirmed at 13 - so it was

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.550 
and it was confirmed at 13 - so it was
