00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
hey everybody this is matt from music

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.370 
hey everybody this is matt from music
muse<00:00:02.490> and<00:00:02.700> we're<00:00:03.179> gonna<00:00:03.270> start<00:00:03.870> off<00:00:04.049> our

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
muse and we're gonna start off our

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.680 
muse and we're gonna start off our
series<00:00:04.770> on<00:00:05.069> concepts<00:00:05.759> right<00:00:06.150> sweating<00:00:06.600> the

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
series on concepts right sweating the

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.690 
series on concepts right sweating the
details<00:00:06.720> today<00:00:07.259> we're<00:00:07.500> talking<00:00:07.649> about<00:00:07.890> inter

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
details today we're talking about inter

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.600 
details today we're talking about inter
dynamics<00:00:09.300> okay<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:10.139> what<00:00:10.590> are<00:00:10.740> inter<00:00:11.130> dynamics

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
dynamics okay so what are inter dynamics

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.150 
dynamics okay so what are inter dynamics
for<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:11.849> matter<00:00:12.000> what<00:00:12.269> are<00:00:12.420> dynamics<00:00:13.170> when

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
for that matter what are dynamics when

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.740 
for that matter what are dynamics when
you're<00:00:14.340> talking<00:00:14.639> about<00:00:14.790> music<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.540> word

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
you're talking about music the word

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.290 
you're talking about music the word
dynamics<00:00:16.220> generally<00:00:17.220> refers<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.580> an<00:00:17.940> overall

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
dynamics generally refers to an overall

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.320 
dynamics generally refers to an overall
volume<00:00:18.990> right<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.310> if<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.789> use<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.150> lot<00:00:21.270> in

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
volume right so if you use it a lot in

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.939 
volume right so if you use it a lot in
Orchestra<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.199> whole<00:00:22.380> band<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.740> know<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
Orchestra is the whole band you know the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.740 
Orchestra is the whole band you know the
dynamic<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.580> allow<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.820> dynamic<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.600> too

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
dynamic is to allow the dynamic is too

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.960 
dynamic is to allow the dynamic is too
soft<00:00:25.019> let's<00:00:25.439> build<00:00:25.830> up<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.130> dynamic<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
soft let's build up the dynamic in the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.429 
soft let's build up the dynamic in the
bridge<00:00:27.180> or<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.930> know<00:00:28.019> whatever<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
bridge or you know whatever the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.679 
bridge or you know whatever the
discussion<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.849> lot<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.150> drummers<00:00:30.539> are

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
discussion is but a lot of drummers are

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.720 
discussion is but a lot of drummers are
talking<00:00:31.199> about<00:00:31.320> dynamics<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.279> relation<00:00:32.700> to

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
talking about dynamics in relation to

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.840 
talking about dynamics in relation to
just<00:00:33.300> our<00:00:33.540> instrument<00:00:34.230> most<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> time<00:00:35.460> one

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
just our instrument most of the time one

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.400 
just our instrument most of the time one
of<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> things<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.300> separates<00:00:36.750> experienced

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
of the things that separates experienced

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.900 
of the things that separates experienced
drummers<00:00:37.739> from<00:00:37.860> maybe<00:00:38.100> less<00:00:38.340> experienced

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
drummers from maybe less experienced

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.000 
drummers from maybe less experienced
drummers<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.960> ability<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.410> control<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
drummers is the ability to control the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.740 
drummers is the ability to control the
dynamic<00:00:41.460> levels<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.850> every<00:00:42.329> part<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
dynamic levels of every part of the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.900 
dynamic levels of every part of the
instrument<00:00:43.170> alright<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.160> here's<00:00:44.370> an<00:00:44.489> example

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
instrument alright so here's an example

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.420 
instrument alright so here's an example
I'm<00:00:45.059> gonna<00:00:45.180> take<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.870> basic<00:00:46.289> pattern<00:00:46.500> on

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
I'm gonna take just a basic pattern on

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.729 
I'm gonna take just a basic pattern on
the<00:00:47.670> drums<00:00:47.910> we're<00:00:48.120> gonna<00:00:48.210> go<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.750> four<00:00:48.989> eighth

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the drums we're gonna go for four eighth

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.889 
the drums we're gonna go for four eighth
notes<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.219> hi-hat<00:00:50.430> one<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.210> two<00:00:51.660> and

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
notes on the hi-hat one and two and

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.680 
notes on the hi-hat one and two and
three<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.590> four<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.489> I'm<00:00:53.760> gonna<00:00:53.879> drop<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
three and four and I'm gonna drop the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.080 
three and four and I'm gonna drop the
backbeat<00:00:55.079> two<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.649> four<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.010> snare<00:00:56.160> kick

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
backbeat two and four on the snare kick

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.990 
backbeat two and four on the snare kick
drum<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.719> three<00:00:57.870> right<00:00:58.760> open<00:00:59.760> up<00:00:59.820> any

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
drum on one and three right open up any

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.819 
drum on one and three right open up any
book<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.480> know<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:01.079> drumset<00:01:01.469> playing<00:01:01.680> it's

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
book you know on drumset playing it's

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.500 
book you know on drumset playing it's
gonna<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> first<00:01:02.699> page<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.420> know

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
gonna be in the first page of you know

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.840 
gonna be in the first page of you know
drumset<00:01:03.899> 101<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.589> we're<00:01:05.280> gonna<00:01:05.369> borrow<00:01:05.640> that

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
drumset 101 so we're gonna borrow that

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.550 
drumset 101 so we're gonna borrow that
pattern<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.270> we're<00:01:06.420> gonna<00:01:06.570> talk<00:01:06.780> about<00:01:06.810> using

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
pattern and we're gonna talk about using

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.460 
pattern and we're gonna talk about using
that<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.250> create<00:01:08.869> you<00:01:09.869> know<00:01:09.900> dynamic

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
that to create you know dynamic

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.940 
that to create you know dynamic
variances<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.100> making<00:01:11.640> things<00:01:11.790> more<00:01:12.060> musical

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
variances and making things more musical

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:27.760 
variances and making things more musical
so<00:01:13.950> here's<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> pattern<00:01:14.400> itself<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.479> as<00:01:15.630> is

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.630 

okay<00:01:28.770> simple<00:01:29.670> nice<00:01:30.030> easy<00:01:30.329> tempo<00:01:30.979> now<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.280> lot<00:01:32.610> of

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
okay simple nice easy tempo now a lot of

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.399 
okay simple nice easy tempo now a lot of
times<00:01:32.759> again<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:33.509> back<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.960> idea<00:01:34.229> of

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
times again going back to the idea of

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.460 
times again going back to the idea of
overall<00:01:34.619> dynamics<00:01:35.610> right<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.869> somebody<00:01:37.170> says

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
overall dynamics right so somebody says

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.920 
overall dynamics right so somebody says
hey<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:37.799> we<00:01:37.979> raise<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.579> dynamic<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.720> know<00:01:39.810> or

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
hey can we raise the dynamic you know or

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.899 
hey can we raise the dynamic you know or
let's<00:01:40.110> change<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.590> dynamic<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.549> pattern

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
let's change the dynamic of the pattern

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.760 
let's change the dynamic of the pattern
a<00:01:42.090> lot<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.810> times<00:01:43.020> what<00:01:43.229> you're<00:01:43.290> gonna<00:01:43.439> hear<00:01:43.649> is

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
a lot of times what you're gonna hear is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:55.590 
a lot of times what you're gonna hear is
something<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.159> sounds<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.399> this

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.420 

right<00:01:56.600> in<00:01:57.140> other<00:01:57.320> words<00:01:57.560> everything<00:01:58.100> gets

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
right in other words everything gets

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.920 
right in other words everything gets
louder<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:59.090> opposite<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.540> that<00:01:59.690> would<00:01:59.780> be

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
louder the opposite of that would be

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:11.080 
louder the opposite of that would be
everything<00:02:00.259> gets<00:02:00.590> softer<00:02:09.759> all<00:02:10.759> right<00:02:10.940> so

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
everything gets softer all right so

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.460 
everything gets softer all right so
we're<00:02:11.270> adjusting<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.750> volume<00:02:11.930> level<00:02:12.380> of

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
we're adjusting the volume level of

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.770 
we're adjusting the volume level of
everything<00:02:13.010> in<00:02:13.130> this<00:02:13.250> case<00:02:13.459> right<00:02:14.360> leg<00:02:14.630> on<00:02:14.690> the

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
everything in this case right leg on the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.780 
everything in this case right leg on the
kick<00:02:14.930> drum<00:02:14.959> right<00:02:15.739> hand<00:02:15.890> on<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:15.980> hi-hat<00:02:16.160> left

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
kick drum right hand on the hi-hat left

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.130 
kick drum right hand on the hi-hat left
hand<00:02:17.000> on<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.209> snare<00:02:17.270> and<00:02:17.450> what<00:02:17.660> I'm<00:02:17.780> doing<00:02:17.810> is

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
hand on the snare and what I'm doing is

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.930 
hand on the snare and what I'm doing is
changing<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.890> volume<00:02:19.070> of<00:02:19.370> everything

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
changing the volume of everything

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.030 
changing the volume of everything
simultaneously<00:02:20.739> sometimes<00:02:21.739> that's<00:02:21.950> the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
simultaneously sometimes that's the

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.680 
simultaneously sometimes that's the
right<00:02:22.250> way<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.400> go<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:22.790> sometimes<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.330> isn't

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
right way to go and sometimes it isn't

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.530 
right way to go and sometimes it isn't
so<00:02:23.959> let's<00:02:24.170> talk<00:02:24.350> about<00:02:24.850> inter<00:02:25.850> dynamics<00:02:26.330> or

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
so let's talk about inter dynamics or

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.449 
so let's talk about inter dynamics or
the<00:02:26.780> relationship<00:02:27.380> in<00:02:27.620> volume<00:02:28.040> levels<00:02:28.340> of

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
the relationship in volume levels of

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.920 
the relationship in volume levels of
each<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:28.910> those<00:02:29.060> three<00:02:29.360> parts<00:02:29.750> of<00:02:29.870> the

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
each of those three parts of the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.120 
each of those three parts of the
instrument<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.800> each<00:02:30.950> other<00:02:31.190> right<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:33.130> when

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
instrument to each other right so when

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.430 
instrument to each other right so when
we're<00:02:34.310> putting<00:02:34.610> this<00:02:34.730> together<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:36.200> have<00:02:36.350> to

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
we're putting this together you have to

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.630 
we're putting this together you have to
remember<00:02:36.620> that<00:02:36.800> when<00:02:36.950> we're<00:02:37.069> talking<00:02:37.220> about<00:02:37.610> a

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
remember that when we're talking about a

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.280 
remember that when we're talking about a
lot<00:02:38.000> of<00:02:38.120> contemporary<00:02:38.480> music<00:02:38.660> whether<00:02:39.080> that's

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
lot of contemporary music whether that's

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.509 
lot of contemporary music whether that's
rock<00:02:39.590> pop<00:02:40.220> funk<00:02:41.290> metal<00:02:42.290> anything<00:02:43.069> that's<00:02:43.250> you

rock pop funk metal anything that's you
know<00:02:43.580> almost<00:02:44.000> entirely<00:02:44.360> straight<00:02:44.810> eighth

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
know almost entirely straight eighth

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.479 
know almost entirely straight eighth
based<00:02:45.380> right<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.819> power<00:02:47.060> or<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.569> groove

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
based right the power or the groove

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.610 
based right the power or the groove
right<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.670> pulse<00:02:49.970> that<00:02:50.480> drives<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.260> music

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
right that pulse that drives the music

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.560 
right that pulse that drives the music
is<00:02:51.739> almost<00:02:52.370> always<00:02:52.610> going<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.030> be<00:02:53.120> in<00:02:53.390> the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
is almost always going to be in the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.810 
is almost always going to be in the
drums<00:02:53.900> all<00:02:54.410> right<00:02:54.530> when<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.250> was<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.430> kid<00:02:55.670> my

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
drums all right when I was a kid my

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.400 
drums all right when I was a kid my
teachers<00:02:56.150> refer<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.690> as<00:02:56.810> playing<00:02:57.079> from<00:02:57.380> the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
teachers refer to it as playing from the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.229 
teachers refer to it as playing from the
bottom<00:02:57.530> up<00:02:58.100> in<00:02:58.459> other<00:02:58.670> words<00:02:58.910> you're<00:02:59.060> playing

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
bottom up in other words you're playing

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.400 
bottom up in other words you're playing
from<00:02:59.329> the<00:02:59.420> bottom<00:02:59.510> part<00:02:59.989> of<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.200> kit<00:03:00.380> the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
from the bottom part of the kit the

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.259 
from the bottom part of the kit the
lower<00:03:00.739> voices<00:03:01.220> which<00:03:01.430> are<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:01.640> drums<00:03:01.910> and

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
lower voices which are the drums and

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.569 
lower voices which are the drums and
then<00:03:02.959> adding<00:03:03.410> playing<00:03:03.860> up<00:03:04.070> which<00:03:04.459> would

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
then adding playing up which would

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:05.890 
then adding playing up which would
include<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.000> higher<00:03:05.180> voices<00:03:05.570> like<00:03:05.750> the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
include the higher voices like the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.229 
include the higher voices like the
cymbals<00:03:06.290> right<00:03:06.739> but<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.370> pattern<00:03:07.790> is<00:03:07.940> in<00:03:08.150> the

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
cymbals right but the pattern is in the

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.479 
cymbals right but the pattern is in the
drums<00:03:08.480> right<00:03:09.440> so<00:03:09.829> a<00:03:09.860> good<00:03:09.980> example<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.430> that

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
drums right so a good example of that

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:11.800 
drums right so a good example of that
would<00:03:10.610> be<00:03:10.760> if<00:03:11.150> you've<00:03:11.299> ever<00:03:11.450> been<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:11.660> a

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
would be if you've ever been to a

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.020 
would be if you've ever been to a
sporting<00:03:12.410> event<00:03:12.470> like<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.459> song<00:03:13.670> we<00:03:13.910> will

really<00:03:53.870> driving<00:03:54.530> that<00:03:54.739> so<00:03:55.519> when<00:03:55.670> we're

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
really driving that so when we're

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.089 
really driving that so when we're
talking<00:03:55.940> about<00:03:56.360> volume<00:03:56.840> relationships<00:03:57.590> among

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
talking about volume relationships among

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.559 
talking about volume relationships among
the<00:03:58.280> different<00:03:58.580> parts<00:03:58.819> of<00:03:58.879> the<00:03:59.030> kit

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
the different parts of the kit

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.360 
the different parts of the kit
right<00:03:59.840> at<00:03:59.989> driving<00:04:00.379> the<00:04:00.709> music<00:04:01.099> in

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
right at driving the music in

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.369 
right at driving the music in
contemporary<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:01.939> a<00:04:02.000> rock<00:04:02.239> pop<00:04:02.629> funk<00:04:03.110> metal

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
contemporary and a rock pop funk metal

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.649 
contemporary and a rock pop funk metal
any<00:04:03.739> form<00:04:04.340> of<00:04:04.430> almost<00:04:04.760> contemporary<00:04:05.299> music

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
any form of almost contemporary music

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.839 
any form of almost contemporary music
you're<00:04:06.319> going<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.560> drive<00:04:06.859> the<00:04:07.129> music<00:04:07.430> from<00:04:07.609> the

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
you're going to drive the music from the

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.420 
you're going to drive the music from the
drums<00:04:08.120> in<00:04:08.420> other<00:04:08.659> words<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.469> power<00:04:09.680> right

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
drums in other words the the power right

the<00:04:10.579> drive<00:04:10.790> comes<00:04:11.150> from<00:04:11.450> in<00:04:11.689> this<00:04:11.870> case<00:04:12.079> kick

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
the drive comes from in this case kick

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:19.210 
the drive comes from in this case kick
drum<00:04:12.530> and<00:04:12.650> snare<00:04:12.829> drum<00:04:17.739> so<00:04:18.739> you<00:04:18.829> could<00:04:18.949> show<00:04:19.130> up

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
drum and snare drum so you could show up

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.920 
drum and snare drum so you could show up
to<00:04:19.370> a<00:04:19.400> gig<00:04:19.669> with<00:04:19.880> nothing<00:04:20.359> more<00:04:20.509> than<00:04:20.570> a<00:04:20.720> kick

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
to a gig with nothing more than a kick

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.629 
to a gig with nothing more than a kick
and<00:04:21.049> snare<00:04:21.289> and<00:04:21.590> still<00:04:21.889> make<00:04:22.160> those<00:04:22.340> patterns

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
and snare and still make those patterns

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.340 
and snare and still make those patterns
happen<00:04:23.180> alright<00:04:23.539> so<00:04:23.780> what<00:04:23.930> does<00:04:24.020> that<00:04:24.050> mean

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
happen alright so what does that mean

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.260 
happen alright so what does that mean
well<00:04:24.620> it<00:04:25.009> means<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.310> hi-hat<00:04:25.759> in<00:04:25.910> this<00:04:26.060> case

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
well it means the hi-hat in this case

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.689 
well it means the hi-hat in this case
becomes<00:04:26.660> less<00:04:27.050> important<00:04:27.710> or<00:04:27.919> less<00:04:28.340> dominant

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
becomes less important or less dominant

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.550 
becomes less important or less dominant
as<00:04:29.090> a<00:04:29.120> voice<00:04:29.479> of<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:29.810> instrument<00:04:30.229> it's<00:04:30.350> still

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
as a voice of the instrument it's still

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.310 
as a voice of the instrument it's still
important<00:04:31.100> but<00:04:31.669> it's<00:04:31.849> not<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.330> focus<00:04:32.900> of<00:04:33.110> the

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
important but it's not the focus of the

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.589 
important but it's not the focus of the
pattern<00:04:33.680> that<00:04:33.710> you're<00:04:33.979> playing<00:04:34.220> okay<00:04:34.940> so<00:04:35.449> what

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
pattern that you're playing okay so what

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.540 
pattern that you're playing okay so what
we<00:04:35.690> want<00:04:35.720> to<00:04:35.900> be<00:04:36.020> able<00:04:36.199> to<00:04:36.289> do<00:04:36.470> is<00:04:36.740> bring<00:04:37.310> the

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
we want to be able to do is bring the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.460 
we want to be able to do is bring the
volume<00:04:37.789> of<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.120> hi-hat<00:04:38.479> level<00:04:38.750> down<00:04:39.110> and

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
volume of the hi-hat level down and

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.040 
volume of the hi-hat level down and
bring<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.580> volume<00:04:40.759> of<00:04:41.000> the<00:04:41.120> drums<00:04:41.389> up<00:04:41.630> in

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
bring the volume of the drums up in

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.670 
bring the volume of the drums up in
relation<00:04:42.770> right<00:04:43.370> so<00:04:44.110> here<00:04:45.110> would<00:04:45.259> be<00:04:45.410> an

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
relation right so here would be an

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.040 
relation right so here would be an
example<00:04:46.070> of<00:04:46.370> inter<00:04:46.820> dynamics<00:04:47.330> with<00:04:47.509> a<00:04:47.539> focus

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
example of inter dynamics with a focus

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.050 
example of inter dynamics with a focus
on<00:04:48.229> the<00:04:48.410> hi-hat<00:04:48.620> all<00:04:49.550> right<00:04:49.669> I'll<00:04:49.759> play<00:04:49.880> that

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
on the hi-hat all right I'll play that

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.790 
on the hi-hat all right I'll play that
for<00:04:50.240> four<00:04:50.449> measures<00:04:50.599> and<00:04:50.900> then<00:04:51.320> I'll<00:04:51.440> switch

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
for four measures and then I'll switch

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.430 
for four measures and then I'll switch
and<00:04:52.160> move<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.180> focus<00:04:53.389> or<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.840> volume<00:04:54.020> level

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
and move the focus or the volume level

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.650 
and move the focus or the volume level
to<00:04:54.949> the<00:04:55.099> drums<00:04:55.370> and<00:04:55.669> bring<00:04:55.970> the<00:04:56.060> hi-hat<00:04:56.419> down

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
to the drums and bring the hi-hat down

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.510 
to the drums and bring the hi-hat down
alright<00:04:57.560> so<00:04:57.770> here's<00:04:57.949> what<00:04:58.099> that<00:04:58.130> would<00:04:58.370> sound

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
alright so here's what that would sound

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:21.520 
alright so here's what that would sound
like<00:04:58.639> here's<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.509> difference<00:05:20.380> so<00:05:21.380> if<00:05:21.470> you

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
like here's the difference so if you

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.779 
like here's the difference so if you
look<00:05:21.650> at<00:05:21.740> the<00:05:21.800> first<00:05:22.039> section<00:05:22.250> with<00:05:22.639> the

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
look at the first section with the

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.270 
look at the first section with the
volume<00:05:23.690> emphasis<00:05:24.169> is<00:05:24.320> on<00:05:24.409> the<00:05:24.500> hi-hat<00:05:24.710> it

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
volume emphasis is on the hi-hat it

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.010 
volume emphasis is on the hi-hat it
doesn't<00:05:25.580> work<00:05:25.729> as<00:05:25.909> well<00:05:26.090> it<00:05:26.419> doesn't<00:05:26.659> drive

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
doesn't work as well it doesn't drive

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.649 
doesn't work as well it doesn't drive
the<00:05:27.199> musical<00:05:27.560> feel<00:05:27.800> as<00:05:28.070> powerful<00:05:28.669> in<00:05:28.909> rock<00:05:29.389> the

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:29.659 
the musical feel as powerful in rock the

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:31.360 
the musical feel as powerful in rock the
way<00:05:29.810> that<00:05:30.050> you<00:05:30.349> would<00:05:30.500> want<00:05:30.710> the<00:05:30.919> second<00:05:31.280> way

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
way that you would want the second way

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.980 
way that you would want the second way
through<00:05:31.580> which<00:05:31.789> is<00:05:31.940> what<00:05:32.090> the<00:05:32.180> drums<00:05:32.419> driving

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
through which is what the drums driving

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.050 
through which is what the drums driving
okay<00:05:33.530> so<00:05:33.590> if<00:05:34.010> we're<00:05:34.190> talking<00:05:34.340> about<00:05:34.610> inter

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
okay so if we're talking about inter

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.850 
okay so if we're talking about inter
dynamics<00:05:35.570> in<00:05:35.870> terms<00:05:35.930> of<00:05:36.260> contemporary<00:05:36.830> music

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
dynamics in terms of contemporary music

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.649 
dynamics in terms of contemporary music
we're<00:05:37.280> trying<00:05:37.490> to<00:05:37.610> drive<00:05:37.880> things<00:05:38.150> from<00:05:38.539> the

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
we're trying to drive things from the

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.689 
we're trying to drive things from the
drums<00:05:38.930> alright<00:05:39.590> so<00:05:40.070> let's<00:05:40.250> talk<00:05:40.370> about<00:05:40.520> the

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
drums alright so let's talk about the

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.360 
drums alright so let's talk about the
same<00:05:40.940> idea<00:05:41.300> flipped<00:05:41.870> around<00:05:41.990> right<00:05:42.710> where<00:05:43.250> do

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
same idea flipped around right where do

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.159 
same idea flipped around right where do
we<00:05:43.490> drive<00:05:43.760> music<00:05:43.970> from<00:05:44.270> the<00:05:44.419> cymbals<00:05:44.780> the<00:05:44.930> most

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
we drive music from the cymbals the most

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.450 
we drive music from the cymbals the most
common<00:05:45.470> place<00:05:45.650> for<00:05:45.830> that<00:05:45.949> would<00:05:46.099> be<00:05:46.190> jazz

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
common place for that would be jazz

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.899 
common place for that would be jazz
right<00:05:47.180> again<00:05:47.539> rock

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:50.909 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.580 

all<00:05:51.909> right<00:05:52.030> jazz<00:05:52.629> it's<00:05:52.930> the<00:05:53.080> obvious<00:05:53.379> at<00:05:53.470> the

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
all right jazz it's the obvious at the

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.529 
all right jazz it's the obvious at the
time<00:05:53.620> right<00:05:54.520> the<00:05:54.699> groove<00:05:54.940> is<00:05:55.150> all<00:05:55.300> in<00:05:55.449> the

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
time right the groove is all in the

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:03.930 
time right the groove is all in the
cymbals<00:06:01.889> so<00:06:02.889> when<00:06:03.039> we're<00:06:03.250> constructing<00:06:03.699> jazz

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
cymbals so when we're constructing jazz

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.309 
cymbals so when we're constructing jazz
patterns<00:06:04.360> with<00:06:04.509> what<00:06:04.599> the<00:06:04.690> cymbals<00:06:05.020> to<00:06:05.110> be<00:06:05.199> the

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:05.319 
patterns with what the cymbals to be the

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:06.960 
patterns with what the cymbals to be the
dominant<00:06:05.500> voice<00:06:05.860> and<00:06:06.159> the<00:06:06.250> drums<00:06:06.520> to<00:06:06.729> stay

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
dominant voice and the drums to stay

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.300 
dominant voice and the drums to stay
down<00:06:07.180> underneath<00:06:07.690> that<00:06:07.930> volume-wise<00:06:08.680> all

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
down underneath that volume-wise all

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.469 
down underneath that volume-wise all
right<00:06:09.430> so<00:06:09.580> that<00:06:09.729> would<00:06:09.879> sound<00:06:10.030> something<00:06:10.449> like

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
right so that would sound something like

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:24.439 
right so that would sound something like
this

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:26.700 

so<00:06:25.449> that's<00:06:25.630> the<00:06:25.810> difference<00:06:25.960> in<00:06:26.260> controlling

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
so that's the difference in controlling

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.909 
so that's the difference in controlling
interdite<00:06:28.169> so<00:06:29.169> how<00:06:29.290> do<00:06:29.350> we<00:06:29.410> develop<00:06:29.830> this

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 
interdite so how do we develop this

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:31.950 
interdite so how do we develop this
skill<00:06:30.100> well<00:06:30.460> the<00:06:30.760> easiest<00:06:31.060> way<00:06:31.180> to<00:06:31.300> work<00:06:31.540> on

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
skill well the easiest way to work on

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.930 
skill well the easiest way to work on
volume<00:06:32.440> levels<00:06:32.710> is<00:06:32.860> with<00:06:33.370> your<00:06:33.490> hands<00:06:33.729> is

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
volume levels is with your hands is

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.150 
volume levels is with your hands is
simply<00:06:34.210> to<00:06:34.330> adjust<00:06:34.660> a<00:06:34.810> stick<00:06:35.080> height<00:06:35.290> all

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 
simply to adjust a stick height all

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.540 
simply to adjust a stick height all
right

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
right

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.780 
right
so<00:06:37.479> if<00:06:37.540> I'm<00:06:37.660> playing<00:06:37.930> fairly<00:06:38.350> low<00:06:38.760> to<00:06:39.760> the

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 
so if I'm playing fairly low to the

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.939 
so if I'm playing fairly low to the
hi-hat<00:06:40.240> I'm<00:06:40.540> gonna<00:06:40.780> get<00:06:40.960> less<00:06:41.169> volume<00:06:41.500> than<00:06:41.680> if

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:41.949 
hi-hat I'm gonna get less volume than if

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:43.379 
hi-hat I'm gonna get less volume than if
I<00:06:42.040> play<00:06:42.250> with<00:06:42.430> a<00:06:42.490> much<00:06:42.729> higher<00:06:42.910> stick<00:06:43.240> height

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389 
I play with a much higher stick height

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:52.070 
I play with a much higher stick height
like<00:06:43.660> say<00:06:43.870> 8<00:06:44.139> or<00:06:44.169> 12<00:06:44.530> inches<00:06:48.300> all<00:06:49.300> right<00:06:49.479> softer

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
like say 8 or 12 inches all right softer

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.150 
like say 8 or 12 inches all right softer
louder<00:06:55.169> now<00:06:56.169> the<00:06:56.260> difference<00:06:56.590> here<00:06:56.740> is<00:06:56.770> only

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 
louder now the difference here is only

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.340 
louder now the difference here is only
in<00:06:57.490> the<00:06:57.580> height<00:06:57.789> I'm<00:06:58.030> still<00:06:58.360> keeping<00:06:58.960> the<00:06:59.169> same

00:06:59.340 --> 00:06:59.350 
in the height I'm still keeping the same

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.570 
in the height I'm still keeping the same
volume<00:06:59.560> level<00:06:59.860> I'm<00:06:59.979> not<00:07:00.100> using<00:07:00.250> anymore

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
volume level I'm not using anymore

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.670 
volume level I'm not using anymore
muscle<00:07:01.090> to<00:07:01.539> get<00:07:01.660> the<00:07:01.720> extra<00:07:02.080> volume<00:07:02.229> I'm<00:07:02.530> not

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 
muscle to get the extra volume I'm not

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.680 
muscle to get the extra volume I'm not
tensing<00:07:03.160> up<00:07:03.310> and<00:07:03.550> laying<00:07:04.150> into<00:07:04.419> you<00:07:04.600> know

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:04.690 
tensing up and laying into you know

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.570 
tensing up and laying into you know
swinging<00:07:05.020> for<00:07:05.139> the<00:07:05.169> fences<00:07:05.500> trying<00:07:05.800> to<00:07:05.889> crush

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
swinging for the fences trying to crush

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.700 
swinging for the fences trying to crush
that<00:07:06.760> hi-hat<00:07:07.180> I'm<00:07:07.389> just<00:07:07.930> simply<00:07:08.260> raising<00:07:08.620> this

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:08.710 
that hi-hat I'm just simply raising this

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.730 
that hi-hat I'm just simply raising this
stick<00:07:08.919> up<00:07:09.070> higher<00:07:09.250> and<00:07:09.960> letting<00:07:10.960> it<00:07:11.020> fall<00:07:11.380> and

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:11.740 
stick up higher and letting it fall and

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.950 
stick up higher and letting it fall and
the<00:07:11.889> force<00:07:12.130> of<00:07:12.280> gravity<00:07:12.729> is<00:07:13.300> what<00:07:13.600> makes<00:07:13.810> it

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960 
the force of gravity is what makes it

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.210 
the force of gravity is what makes it
louder<00:07:14.169> because<00:07:14.530> it<00:07:14.620> hits<00:07:14.800> with<00:07:14.979> a<00:07:15.010> greater

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.220 
louder because it hits with a greater

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.279 
louder because it hits with a greater
impact<00:07:15.400> so<00:07:16.330> there's<00:07:16.510> the<00:07:16.660> idea<00:07:16.690> when<00:07:17.139> we're

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:17.289 
impact so there's the idea when we're

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:19.500 
impact so there's the idea when we're
talking<00:07:17.440> about<00:07:17.740> inter<00:07:18.310> dynamics<00:07:18.820> again<00:07:18.940> the

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:19.510 
talking about inter dynamics again the

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.719 
talking about inter dynamics again the
volume<00:07:19.720> relationships<00:07:20.470> of<00:07:20.830> each<00:07:21.310> part<00:07:21.580> of<00:07:21.610> the

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:21.729 
volume relationships of each part of the

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:22.740 
volume relationships of each part of the
instrument<00:07:22.090> and<00:07:22.120> then<00:07:22.270> being<00:07:22.479> able<00:07:22.630> to

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:22.750 
instrument and then being able to

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.770 
instrument and then being able to
control<00:07:23.320> each<00:07:24.099> limb<00:07:24.430> right<00:07:25.060> right<00:07:25.389> hand<00:07:25.599> left

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:25.780 
control each limb right right hand left

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.200 
control each limb right right hand left
hand<00:07:25.960> right<00:07:26.229> foot<00:07:26.410> left<00:07:26.740> foot<00:07:27.210> individually

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.210 
hand right foot left foot individually

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.080 
hand right foot left foot individually
to<00:07:28.720> be<00:07:28.870> able<00:07:29.020> to<00:07:29.340> change<00:07:30.340> the<00:07:30.580> power<00:07:30.789> or<00:07:31.030> the

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.090 
to be able to change the power or the

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.700 
to be able to change the power or the
feel<00:07:31.389> of<00:07:31.419> what<00:07:31.690> it<00:07:31.960> is<00:07:31.990> that<00:07:32.139> we're<00:07:32.470> playing

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:32.710 
feel of what it is that we're playing

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.010 
feel of what it is that we're playing
right<00:07:33.280> so<00:07:33.490> we<00:07:33.580> want<00:07:33.789> more<00:07:33.849> projection<00:07:34.360> more

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:35.020 
right so we want more projection more

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.010 
right so we want more projection more
attitude<00:07:35.320> more<00:07:36.160> punch<00:07:36.490> more<00:07:36.910> aggression<00:07:37.810> and

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.020 
attitude more punch more aggression and

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.810 
attitude more punch more aggression and
energy<00:07:38.410> we<00:07:38.560> really<00:07:38.950> want<00:07:39.130> to<00:07:39.160> drive<00:07:39.400> the<00:07:39.580> drums

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:39.820 
energy we really want to drive the drums

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.360 
energy we really want to drive the drums
and<00:07:40.120> bring<00:07:40.570> the<00:07:40.690> cymbals<00:07:41.050> down<00:07:41.289> in<00:07:41.590> volume<00:07:42.130> in

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:42.370 
and bring the cymbals down in volume in

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.370 
and bring the cymbals down in volume in
relationship<00:07:43.120> to<00:07:43.150> the<00:07:43.419> drums<00:07:43.660> right<00:07:43.900> drums<00:07:44.200> up

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:44.380 
relationship to the drums right drums up

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.740 
relationship to the drums right drums up
cymbals<00:07:45.039> down<00:07:45.190> right<00:07:45.789> if<00:07:46.000> we're<00:07:46.300> playing<00:07:46.450> jazz

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:46.750 
cymbals down right if we're playing jazz

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.089 
cymbals down right if we're playing jazz
then<00:07:47.050> just<00:07:47.260> the<00:07:47.349> opposite<00:07:47.710> is<00:07:47.860> true

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:48.099 
then just the opposite is true

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:50.760 
then just the opposite is true
cymbals<00:07:48.669> up<00:07:48.820> drums<00:07:49.720> down<00:07:49.960> so<00:07:50.440> that's<00:07:50.590> the

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:50.770 
cymbals up drums down so that's the

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.710 
cymbals up drums down so that's the
basic<00:07:51.130> concept<00:07:51.520> of<00:07:51.580> inter<00:07:51.880> dynamics<00:07:52.449> right

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 
basic concept of inter dynamics right

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.570 
basic concept of inter dynamics right
being<00:07:53.020> able<00:07:53.139> to<00:07:53.260> control<00:07:53.710> the<00:07:54.010> volume<00:07:54.160> of<00:07:54.400> each

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:54.580 
being able to control the volume of each

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.430 
being able to control the volume of each
individual<00:07:55.180> part<00:07:55.419> of<00:07:55.479> the<00:07:55.599> instrument<00:07:55.930> using

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440 
individual part of the instrument using

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.719 
individual part of the instrument using
different<00:07:56.770> volume<00:07:56.979> levels<00:07:57.010> with<00:07:57.370> our<00:07:57.490> limbs

00:07:57.719 --> 00:07:57.729 
different volume levels with our limbs

00:07:57.729 --> 00:07:59.850 
different volume levels with our limbs
to<00:07:58.240> create<00:07:58.539> different<00:07:58.930> effects<00:07:59.260> within<00:07:59.650> the

00:07:59.850 --> 00:07:59.860 
to create different effects within the

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.800 
to create different effects within the
music<00:08:00.190> driving<00:08:00.550> it<00:08:00.820> in<00:08:00.940> different<00:08:01.120> ways<00:08:01.419> more

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:01.810 
music driving it in different ways more

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.570 
music driving it in different ways more
subtle<00:08:02.199> more<00:08:02.229> powerful<00:08:02.979> more<00:08:03.310> adrenaline

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:03.580 
subtle more powerful more adrenaline
