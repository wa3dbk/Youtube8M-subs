00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
probably in the video there but say it's

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.690 
probably in the video there but say it's
Mesmer<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.000> just<00:02:17.150> stay<00:02:17.300> in<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:17.450> line<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:19.130> go

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
Mesmer so you just stay in a line you go

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.440 
Mesmer so you just stay in a line you go
up<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.630> think<00:02:21.380> 17<00:02:22.070> once<00:02:22.459> you're<00:02:22.610> 17<00:02:23.090> you

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
up to I think 17 once you're 17 you

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.550 
up to I think 17 once you're 17 you
should<00:02:23.690> get<00:02:23.840> 5k<00:02:24.170> faction<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.959> a<00:02:26.959> net<00:02:27.260> made<00:02:27.440> it

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
should get 5k faction and a net made it

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.170 
should get 5k faction and a net made it
so<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:27.770> can't<00:02:28.040> get<00:02:28.160> any<00:02:28.310> more<00:02:28.490> than<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:28.700> per

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
so you can't get any more than that per

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.890 
so you can't get any more than that per
day<00:02:32.470> okay<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:33.580> c1<00:02:34.580> Mesmer<00:02:35.120> lived<00:02:35.360> that's<00:02:35.750> what

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900
