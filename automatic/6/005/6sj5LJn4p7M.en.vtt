least we have the curl and roll away
this<00:04:00.950> is<00:04:01.129> the<00:04:01.310> most<00:04:01.879> logical<00:04:02.150> one<00:04:02.599> I<00:04:02.840> like<00:04:03.709> it<00:04:03.889> a

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
this is the most logical one I like it a

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.580 
this is the most logical one I like it a
lot<00:04:04.299> so<00:04:05.299> you<00:04:05.359> can<00:04:05.510> see<00:04:05.660> it<00:04:05.750> here<00:04:05.870> just<00:04:06.109> kind<00:04:06.500> of

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
rolls away take a look at the apps it's

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:15.960 
rolls away take a look at the apps it's
kind<00:04:10.069> of<00:04:10.129> cool<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.940> way<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.209> form<00:04:11.629> a<00:04:11.780> circle

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.199 

so<00:04:16.989> that's<00:04:17.989> basically<00:04:18.169> it<00:04:18.729> again<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:19.940> tweak

so that's basically it again the tweak
is<00:04:20.359> called<00:04:20.599> barrel<00:04:21.019> the<00:04:21.680> source<00:04:21.979> will<00:04:22.130> be<00:04:22.220> down

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
is called barrel the source will be down
