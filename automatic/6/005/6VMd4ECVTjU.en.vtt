stuck<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.830> position<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.490> they<00:01:26.670> can't

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
stuck in this position so they can't

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.999 
stuck in this position so they can't
really<00:01:27.000> bend<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:28.409> they<00:01:28.650> do<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:28.950> a

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
really bend like this but they do have a

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.100 
really bend like this but they do have a
pretty<00:01:29.220> good<00:01:29.430> range<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.909> motion<00:01:30.150> at<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
pretty good range of motion at the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
shoulder blade and the only real way

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.090

that<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:33.840> move<00:01:33.960> her<00:01:34.200> tail<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.680> just<00:01:34.979> by

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
that you can move her tail is just by

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.190 
that you can move her tail is just by
