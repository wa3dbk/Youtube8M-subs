 gentlemen it was time to say it and 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.769
 during the beginning of the program we said 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.870
 that a person had to leave this 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.580

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.170
 unit that we have formed through the 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.210
 time and the moment led is a person 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.970
