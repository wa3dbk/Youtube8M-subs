00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.349
 Servus together here is moritz from 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.299
 appdata and I have the samsung here 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.059
 galaxy s 5 in front of me and I test that 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.919
 currently and where as a video entry 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.800
 I wanted to show you how to do that 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:20.790
 sim card and the micro sd card 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.630
 insert the device first 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.600
 of course I have that now 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.120
 ever done and then you can 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.880
 Back side open here on top left easy 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.140
 with the fingernail underneath and already 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.620
 the good things are open 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.219
 You can see it here, too, because of the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.579
 Certification that samsung the extra 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:45.159
 the water has avoided, for example 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.019
 on the contacts here or on 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:50.079
 the micro sim card and on this card 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.579
 and on the battery so this one 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.139
 Water protection and the traffic jam 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.850
 dust protection is guaranteed and yes order 

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:59.159
 Now insert the SIM card so you 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.389
 needs a normal one 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.760
 micro sim card no nano sim card and 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:08.010
 no normal sim card so a micro 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:14.080
 sim card just remove the battery 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:16.720
 here i have my micro sim card the 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.670
 must come in the lower slots so how 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.160
 you 're here for a while 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.960
 greater 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.820
 as you can see below the sim card 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.840
 the micro SIM card and above it 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.540
 micro sd card you just put it 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.220
 such a one with the top left must be this 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.960
 this corner should be rounded 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.930
 or be cut off 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:43.000
 then just push in, so to speak 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.420
 and that can also be a bit of a feeling 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.710
 be taken out again so 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:54.430
 then comes the micro sd card 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.320
 you can see that these jagged ones are there 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.670
 the jags have to be right what to see 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.799
 one here and also on the graphic and 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.810
 We'll do that too, that's fine 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.970
 Basically, you can not go wrong 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.130
 do 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.810
 and yes to the good piece is now so 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:19.069
 are the two cards in the phone 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:22.010
 installed now stuck on it inside 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.520
 make that the back completely 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.370
 is made because otherwise this is 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.860
 Water protection is not guaranteed and 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.019
 now goes the samsung galaxy s 5 too 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.630
 in the head knows that already with the 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.130
 have a small introduction or small 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.299
 with the interactive video about the 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.840
 sim card and the micro sd card 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.840
 Until next time
