00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 but no friends of youtube I am today the 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.049
 disc that was projected paranormal mexico 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.480
 and welcome to this new section yet 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.519
 I do not know what the title is when you 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.730
 already see the uploaded video to know which one 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.550
 is the title but in summary it is about 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.410
 a pretty simple section where we go 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.840
 to use the knowledge 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.830
 let's say complexes to explain 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.730
 situations that seem 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.490
 rare that seem complicated when they are 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.120
 on the contrary 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.460
 the first candidate that I chose for this 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.280
 section was the question that was 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.830
 first the egg or the chicken one 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.470
 ask with an exaggerated solution 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.020
 simple that anyone with 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.990
 medium biological knowledge could 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.090
 know however 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.780
 somehow this has been done as 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.910
 a rather complicated question before 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.310
 to go through with the answer we went to the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.530
 streets of the city of mexico 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.130
 ask several people who 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.110
 they thought that it was first the egg or the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.970
 hen then let's see their 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.070
 Answers are quite answers 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.380
 fast nothing more say egg or chicken 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.530
 so that later I tell them the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.530
 true 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:28.410
 do not 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.410
 the chicken for me the egg 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.550
 Y 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.119
 the hen 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.250
 in the egg 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.780
 good friends how could you realize 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.820
 there are different opinions some think 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.280
 that was the egg some think it was 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.040
 the hen however the answer is 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.110
 exaggeratedly simple but I do not know 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.430
 I'm going to say right now in front of a camera 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.410
 that we are going to move to a 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.390
 a part of the videos that they liked 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.350
 much to some fans that is that of the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.670
 the drawings where I explain something 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.440
 complicated with cartoons then we go 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.140
 to see it with cartoons as if we were 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.820
 small children not to mock me but 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.850
 to make it much easier to 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.850
 understand 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.370
 although we do not understand for sure 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:25.219
 how life originated speaking 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.319
 only with science and not with faith 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:29.510
 there is a theory that after 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.939
 emergence of the first living beings 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.780
 these fought a kind of battle 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:39.230
 where the winner was the luca acronym of 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.709
 the universal as ancestor in Spanish 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.650
 last universal common ancestor is 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.920
 say the infinitesimal great-great-grandfather of 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.209
 all current living beings in theory 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.189
 and in simple words the luca was a being 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.400
 unicellular that merged with the others 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:01.159
 Lucas what was modifying his code 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.200
 genetic the genetic code is the 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.180
 material of which we are all made 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.219
 the less material beings that you 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.860
 we will pass on to our children if it is 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.230
 we have 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.120
 by modifying the genetic code the 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.150
 lukas babies were born of different 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.560
 shapes and sizes some little adapted 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.310
 to the hostile environment of the earth 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.440
 primitive those lukasz died those who 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.610
 they survived they passed their genetic code 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.690
 winner to his children and so on 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.480
 eventually the lukas became 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.870
 much more complex beings appeared 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.880
 the microscopic beings the vertebrates 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.630
 amphibious fish and after a lot 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.140
 weather 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.990
 the birds I suppose that by now 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.780
 you will know the answer the egg was first 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.450
 the grandparents of the hens to be birds 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.640
 they laid eggs eggs where they passed their 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.430
 genetic code that after several 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.650
 failed attempts and achievements are also 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.140
 modified in such a way that of an egg 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:03.300
 finally a chick was born that 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.300
 to grow became a chicken 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.850
 good friends after this I hope that 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.820
 Obviously, it has already been made clear to them 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.740
 the egg was first that the chicken and 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.750
 good friends before I go we go with the 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.760
 greetings to danny boyle a 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.920
 I greet michel melÃ©ndez a greeting to 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.320
 mario matt site greetings to Bryan 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.630
 Aguilar saved a salute to Robledo 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.730
 greeting to carroll mendiola greetings to 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.080
 Juan Hernandez and greetings to Miguel with 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.330
 a 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.970
 Many have told me they ask for greetings if 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.949
 I do not send them what I need 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.639
 do they put it in the box 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:40.310
 Youtube comments or is where else 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.289
 the guys think and most likely 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.599
 is that you are going to leave if you ask me 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.520
 I do not know in instagram or twitter 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.169
 the rest as I sometimes do not say 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.759
 so much but youtube yes boy 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.139
 absolutely everything then if you 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.300
 you want greetings first here in the 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.310
 comment box and you can also 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.830
 comment here below that they told me 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.330
 that I say comment and I do it as if 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.229
 I was writing I had not been given 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.940
 account 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.530
 Anibal says that the box 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.650
 comments what was your opinion 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.780
 you really think that the answer 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.580
 was yes it is simple or did you think it was something 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.069
 much more complex and if the video you 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.110
 liked give it like share it and subscribe 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:17.569
 please like to overcome the 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.580
 record of likes of this channel and also 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:21.590
 to my secondary channel world and its 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.569
 historical and follow me in absolutely 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.169

 to the slope of everything I do 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.300
 share that would be all of it I'm older 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:33.050
 I enjoyed 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.050
 thank you very much
