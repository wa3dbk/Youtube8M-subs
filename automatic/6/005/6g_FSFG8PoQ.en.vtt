00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:13.949
 when came to me technology tv team knowledge magazine of biotechnology dei in 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.949
 We have the following themes for this program 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.159
 Alternative ways of generating energy from bacteria 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:28.699
 Curious and lost Rees short films on the biology of the future 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:34.920
 We interviewed about the first film festival on synthetic biology 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.830
 KNA 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.120
 4 100 years ago, a Briton has for the first time observed the clocking power 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.250
 can generate 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.740
 but long time when this phenomenon is not much interest 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.000
 the search for alternative energy sources the idea of ​​a knee 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.950
 Problems fuel cell 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.700
 in the last ten years gained momentum so too on the technical 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.190
 University of Brunswick 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.080
 Electricity from bacteria 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.070
 Rubel Schröder has long been fascinated by this concept as a professor of 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.770
 Sustainable Chemistry at the TVO Braunschweig was one of the few 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.870
 Researchers worldwide smiths of microbial fuel cell 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:15.880
 employ 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.440
 that can generate electricity via bacteria 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.720
 long seen as a curiosity 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.490
 if you actually existed if only 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.470
 of the one never voluntarily energy or 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.210
 Give off electrons 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.210
 In the evening, however, it is ultimately more than a natural process of songs 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.390
 The last ones here are organism which metabolism operates must ultimately 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.390
 Give EKD a pick and he wins 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.560
 SOZ stepped 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.560
 Electroactive bacteria from the genus portray Eller or Geo Wachter are 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.190
 the basis of the microbial fuel cell 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.740
 You simply put them in a solution to exotics made of carbon fibers on which yourself 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.720
 no biofilm forms 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.360
 this is then able to produce electricity on its own 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.740
 The bacteria do not have to be searched consuming 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.700
 contained in normal wastewater and thus also open up interesting application 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.800
 Strassberg deep 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.689
 at the turn of the millennium beginning of 2004 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:14.019
 Puhle discovered or around Bruno you realize that you sewage 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.639
 As other zoos take you can just imagine today 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.739
 Wastewater treatment food high energy consuming process 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:25.249
 only ten percent of municipal electricity consumption is downright costly 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:29.069
 or at the expense of wastewater treatment countering this is the point where microbial 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.929
 Fuel cells should begin 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:32.889
 by trying 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.119
 to the substance degradation 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.889
 which is coupled with wastewater treatment with an energy recovery quasi too 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.939
 Year to pair up 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.459
 Currently they can produce peak values ​​of 30 meters per square meter 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.450
 that's about a thousand times less than a conventional one 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.620
 Fuel cell and not enough for a meaningful use 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:56.729
 until then it is still a long way for the Braunschweiger 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:03:01.099
 But the researchers are convinced it will be the energy of the future 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.099
 Bacteria also find their place 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:09.309
 opposing biology is far too exciting just to see it 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:11.159
 To be left to scientists 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.750
 at least that's how the Artemis Azores by Bayer Fitschen 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.020
 the world's first film festivals so they are the students there 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.020
 the Maximilian Vienna took place many cases are now online to see 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.869
 our looks 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:30.669
 not only the winning films all 52 posts are on the shortlist 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:31.800
 have done 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.340
 are seen on Weyer Fitschen point com / videos 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:40.069
 If you click on the inconspicuous link Bonn at the contest 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.429
 then a cineast grant treasure box opens 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:47.839
 everything from the sombre vision of the future to the happy one for our animals 

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:48.739
 there 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.029
 the quality of the videos ranges from professional productions to 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:56.089
 Researcher who acts as a filmmaker himself 

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:58.989
 well worth it 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.459
 A total of 200 films make scientists and artists Kanzem 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.749
 Bank sit firmly meaning 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:08.959
 For two days, it was about the future of biology 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.939
 and of course Fehmarn I am now connected with Markus Metz who that 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.459
 Festival launched 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.219
 Hello Mr. Schmidt 

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:20.859
 in synthetic biology it is about very complicated topics 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.339
 Genetic circuits take minimal home or product heroes at first 

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:28.570
 Look, that's no material for the cinema 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.949
 they did not get the idea to make a film festival out of it 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.379
 Percent report Researchers show that we are playing the right books 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:42.779
 In addition, as many of the apprentices see for 0 5% population 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:44.909
 which rose to 2 7% 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.550
 nobody is ever there 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.889
 Stephan w 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.629
 and you can do that 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:51.160
 visitors 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.670
 this would 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.020
 Christel in the visor booked 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.240
 moscow / brussels dpa and Reuters playful is still some 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:02.400
 have now 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.629
 Hörstel ots finally go also the most entertaining way 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.460
 this always wants to introduce 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.349
 eight different questions 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.319
 Percent less 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.490
 some artists have approached this topic 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.710
 Vosseler percent how much money 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.419
 if the form is 9 bn 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:27.669
 How is it going to be in the focus of security that hitherto presents us 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.259
 it is 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:31.340
 and so 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.770
 and then now they benefited under Tel who themselves 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.530
 so that not enough already clarified everything anyway Sun percent was missing 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.719
 b 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:45.719
 he is also rarely in Münster 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.300
 30 Elena content 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.300
 but they liked the movie very much 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:55.150
 the percent 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.460
 many get 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.480
 August 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.999
 key player 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:00.430
 Daimler is 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.619
 Processor would expense costs 

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:04.990
 more 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.990
 the suspect is the benefit 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:10.169
 that it has just won 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.060
 was great 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.159
 which is 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:16.479
 how were the children constantly expanding like children? 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.309
 we noticed 

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:21.020
 we live here it makes sense 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.120
 the skulls 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.129
 they missed the singer like that 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:25.300
 more finish 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.479
 instances 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.479
 a curious way for VW 

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:33.339
 we want all names of Westerwelle 

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:35.499
 Bashir is the measure is full 

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:37.629
 to be very surprised with us 

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:39.009
 Picture de 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:43.039
 been done with a lot of action and PR SFC and over 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.689
 how many more fit 

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:48.949
 from our processes we from St 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:50.219
 they saw s 

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:53.819
 up to 50 percent energy it really is 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:56.849
 why should we the percentage 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:06:59.569
 all together 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:02.749
 the main difference is the lead set 

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:04.399
 and that's how it ends 

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:07.270
 thank you very much Mr. Schmitz 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.900
 that was already back by biotechnology TV if you are more in the 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.169
 Power generation microbes or fancy films 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:17.900
 Society want to experience bit of biology then they want to see the sight 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.569
 Biotechnology de 

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:22.569
 in this sense test eaters next time 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.389
 Increase percent
