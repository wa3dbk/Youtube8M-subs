it's as good as I've heard it's getting

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.910 
it's as good as I've heard it's getting
rid<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:41.270> but<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.600> feels<00:00:42.960> very<00:00:43.290> similar<00:00:43.860> to

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
rid of that but it feels very similar to

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.060 
rid of that but it feels very similar to
the<00:00:44.190> other<00:00:44.660> modi<00:00:45.660> puzzles<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.620> kind<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.890> got

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
the other modi puzzles it's kind of got

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.299 
the other modi puzzles it's kind of got
big<00:00:47.940> bevels<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:48.960> many<00:00:49.680> other<00:00:49.980> people

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
big bevels here as many other people

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.850 
big bevels here as many other people
have<00:00:50.399> pointed<00:00:50.579> out<00:00:50.879> these<00:00:51.750> pieces<00:00:52.170> are<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.559> lot

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
have pointed out these pieces are a lot

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.040 
have pointed out these pieces are a lot
larger<00:00:53.100> than<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.640> ones<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.000> here<00:00:54.059> however<00:00:54.570> i

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
larger than the ones in here however i

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.889 
larger than the ones in here however i
don't<00:00:55.110> really<00:00:55.469> think<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.890> will<00:00:56.190> bother<00:00:56.370> me

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
don't really think that will bother me

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.360 
don't really think that will bother me
maybe<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.020> little<00:00:58.079> at<00:00:58.440> first<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:58.890> more<00:00:59.250> than

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
maybe a little at first but more than

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.910 
maybe a little at first but more than
likely<00:00:59.430> not<00:00:59.969> but<00:01:00.780> let's<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.350> get<00:01:01.440> into<00:01:01.559> first

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
likely not but let's just get into first

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:16.490 
likely not but let's just get into first
turns<00:01:08.630> that's<00:01:09.630> insanely<00:01:10.200> smooth<00:01:14.960> all<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
turns that's insanely smooth all the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.440 
turns that's insanely smooth all the
layers<00:01:16.680> are<00:01:16.979> definitely<00:01:17.400> equally<00:01:17.909> smooth<00:01:18.270> on

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
layers are definitely equally smooth on

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.170 
layers are definitely equally smooth on
this<00:01:18.630> puzzle<00:01:19.759> which<00:01:20.759> I'm<00:01:20.939> really<00:01:21.180> happy<00:01:21.390> about

this puzzle which I'm really happy about
it<00:01:24.180> does<00:01:24.840> feel<00:01:25.710> as<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.610> have

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
it does feel as if it's going to have

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.980 
it does feel as if it's going to have
the<00:01:26.790> same<00:01:27.420> like<00:01:27.780> slight<00:01:28.259> issue<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.990> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
the same like slight issue that the the

the same like slight issue that the the
six<00:01:31.380> by<00:01:31.560> six<00:01:31.619> mo<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.130> 646<00:01:32.759> has<00:01:32.970> which<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.170> when

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
six by six mo you 646 has which is when

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.440 
six by six mo you 646 has which is when
it<00:01:34.680> kind<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.890> like<00:01:35.040> misshapen<00:01:35.640> as<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.329> see

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
it kind of like misshapen as you can see

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.510 
it kind of like misshapen as you can see
like<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.500> shifted<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.920> little<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.400> it's

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
like you just shifted a little and it's

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.380 
like you just shifted a little and it's
already<00:01:39.020> kind<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.140> strange<00:01:40.740> right<00:01:41.100> there

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
already kind of strange right there

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.510 
already kind of strange right there
deformed<00:01:42.470> but<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.799> don't<00:01:44.100> think<00:01:44.250> it'll<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.490> a

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
deformed but I don't think it'll be a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.359 
deformed but I don't think it'll be a
huge<00:01:44.790> problem<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:46.439> also<00:01:46.560> definitely<00:01:46.950> tell

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
huge problem I can also definitely tell

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.969 
huge problem I can also definitely tell
that<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.909> bigger<00:01:48.180> than<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.710> shang<00:01:49.710> xiao

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
that this is bigger than the shang xiao

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.850 
that this is bigger than the shang xiao
seven<00:01:50.369> by<00:01:50.490> seven<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.600> tiny<00:01:51.840> butt<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:52.829> I

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
seven by seven just a tiny butt but I

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.340 
seven by seven just a tiny butt but I
can<00:01:53.189> definitely<00:01:53.369> notice<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.840> we'll<00:01:55.079> see<00:01:55.259> if

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
can definitely notice it so we'll see if

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.959 
can definitely notice it so we'll see if
that<00:01:55.380> ends<00:01:55.740> up<00:01:55.920> being<00:01:55.979> an<00:01:56.280> issue<00:01:56.430> just

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.990 

slightly<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.719> really<00:02:01.020> not<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.380> bad<00:02:01.700> but<00:02:02.700> so

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
slightly to really not that bad but so

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.450 
slightly to really not that bad but so
far<00:02:03.329> I'm<00:02:03.840> really<00:02:04.290> enjoying<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:05.040> field<00:02:05.280> as

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
far I'm really enjoying the field as

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.180 
far I'm really enjoying the field as
puzzle<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.090> very<00:02:06.390> smooth<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.530> might<00:02:07.740> take<00:02:08.009> me

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
puzzle it's very smooth it might take me

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.059 
puzzle it's very smooth it might take me
a<00:02:08.220> little<00:02:08.459> bit<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.959> get<00:02:10.080> used<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.649> simply

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
a little bit to get used to this simply

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.090 
a little bit to get used to this simply
because<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.489> size<00:02:11.760> but<00:02:12.300> I

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
because of the size but I

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.160 
because of the size but I
think<00:02:13.310> it'll<00:02:13.490> be<00:02:13.520> too<00:02:13.610> bad<00:02:14.000> I<00:02:14.330> know<00:02:14.840> many

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
think it'll be too bad I know many

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.930 
think it'll be too bad I know many
people<00:02:15.500> have<00:02:15.620> broken<00:02:15.860> their<00:02:16.130> PBS<00:02:16.610> so<00:02:16.850> I'm

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
people have broken their PBS so I'm

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.980 
people have broken their PBS so I'm
definitely<00:02:17.120> going<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.510> be<00:02:17.600> playing<00:02:17.810> around

I'll<00:02:33.680> probably<00:02:34.130> put<00:02:34.460> out<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.670> solid<00:02:35.210> video<00:02:35.480> just

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
I'll probably put out a solid video just

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.070 
I'll probably put out a solid video just
to<00:02:35.870> show<00:02:35.960> you<00:02:36.160> simply<00:02:37.160> how<00:02:37.280> it<00:02:37.400> turns<00:02:37.670> out<00:02:38.080> of

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
to show you simply how it turns out of

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.010 
to show you simply how it turns out of
the<00:02:39.140> box<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:40.060> what<00:02:41.060> potential<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.810> has

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
the box and what potential it has

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.320 
the box and what potential it has
because<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.560> feel<00:02:42.770> like<00:02:42.980> especially<00:02:43.370> with<00:02:44.090> big

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330

turns<00:02:47.570> is<00:02:47.960> better<00:02:48.920> than<00:02:49.130> just<00:02:49.340> trying<00:02:49.670> to

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
turns is better than just trying to

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.670 
turns is better than just trying to
explain<00:02:50.150> how<00:02:50.480> it<00:02:50.630> turns<00:02:50.900> because<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:51.530> can

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
explain how it turns because you can

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.860 
explain how it turns because you can
normally<00:02:52.040> tell<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.640> problems<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.420> issues<00:02:53.510> it
