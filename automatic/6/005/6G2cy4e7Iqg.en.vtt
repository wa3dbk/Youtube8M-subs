endeavor of fulfilling that commitment
then<00:02:21.510> we<00:02:22.019> start<00:02:22.319> building<00:02:22.349> that<00:02:22.920> trust<00:02:23.099> that

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
then we start building that trust that

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.119 
then we start building that trust that
in<00:02:24.269> team<00:02:24.540> building<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:24.989> very<00:02:25.200> necessary<00:02:25.410> it's

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
in team building is very necessary it's

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.550 
in team building is very necessary it's
a<00:02:26.519> lot<00:02:26.760> easier<00:02:27.180> for<00:02:27.209> them<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.900> then<00:02:28.260> be

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
a lot easier for them to then be

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.710 
a lot easier for them to then be

program at Henderson

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.149 
program at Henderson
and<00:03:03.359> taken<00:03:03.719> to<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.959> limit<00:03:04.290> we<00:03:04.739> look<00:03:04.920> at<00:03:05.069> the

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
and taken to the limit we look at the

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.709 
and taken to the limit we look at the

then we match them up depending on the
student<00:03:09.269> need<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.719> this<00:03:10.230> is<00:03:10.439> helping<00:03:10.890> the
