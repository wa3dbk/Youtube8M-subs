away<00:04:26.650> if<00:04:26.920> they<00:04:27.370> show<00:04:27.610> something<00:04:28.120> like<00:04:28.330> Ino<00:04:28.870> and

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
away if they show something like Ino and

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.500 
away if they show something like Ino and
Choji<00:04:29.080> or<00:04:29.740> Sakura<00:04:30.430> and<00:04:30.520> Sasuke<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.210> then<00:04:31.360> I

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
Choji or Sakura and Sasuke and then I

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.180 
Choji or Sakura and Sasuke and then I
would<00:04:31.660> have<00:04:31.690> been<00:04:31.870> more<00:04:31.990> skeptical<00:04:32.590> but<00:04:33.040> they

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
would have been more skeptical but they

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.770 
would have been more skeptical but they
didn't<00:04:33.520> so<00:04:33.730> it<00:04:33.970> does<00:04:34.180> sound<00:04:34.420> more<00:04:34.600> realistic

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
didn't so it does sound more realistic

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.780 
didn't so it does sound more realistic
all<00:04:35.170> right<00:04:35.470> moving<00:04:35.680> on<00:04:35.890> I<00:04:36.070> forgot<00:04:36.310> to<00:04:36.460> mention

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
all right moving on I forgot to mention

that<00:04:36.820> varies<00:04:37.540> a<00:04:37.780> picture<00:04:38.650> of<00:04:38.770> a<00:04:38.830> character

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
that varies a picture of a character

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.630 
that varies a picture of a character
roster<00:04:39.400> showing<00:04:40.150> about<00:04:40.560> 161<00:04:41.560> characters<00:04:42.160> but

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
roster showing about 161 characters but

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.570 
roster showing about 161 characters but
you<00:04:43.030> know<00:04:43.180> virol<00:04:43.900> doubles<00:04:44.380> and<00:04:44.560> quadruples<00:04:45.130> so

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
you know virol doubles and quadruples so

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.780 
you know virol doubles and quadruples so
it's<00:04:46.120> not<00:04:46.330> really<00:04:46.830> 161<00:04:47.830> if<00:04:48.040> you<00:04:48.310> were<00:04:48.430> to<00:04:48.610> count

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
it's not really 161 if you were to count

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.820 
it's not really 161 if you were to count
them<00:04:49.030> singly<00:04:49.450> I<00:04:49.720> think<00:04:50.440> you<00:04:50.560> would<00:04:50.650> get

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
them singly I think you would get

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.870 
them singly I think you would get
somewhere<00:04:51.280> around<00:04:51.810> 115<00:04:52.810> 120<00:04:53.530> which<00:04:54.340> sounds

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
somewhere around 115 120 which sounds

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.670 
somewhere around 115 120 which sounds
like<00:04:55.000> a<00:04:55.060> reasonable<00:04:55.510> number<00:04:55.660> but<00:04:56.410> then<00:04:56.590> again

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
like a reasonable number but then again

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.640 
like a reasonable number but then again
you<00:04:57.100> see<00:04:57.520> on<00:04:57.730> coal<00:04:58.180> and<00:04:58.450> all<00:04:58.870> those<00:04:59.050> characters

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
you see on coal and all those characters

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.580 
you see on coal and all those characters
that<00:04:59.860> can<00:05:00.310> possibly<00:05:00.550> be<00:05:01.330> supports<00:05:01.930> only<00:05:02.140> so

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
that can possibly be supports only so
