thousand<00:04:12.700> seven<00:04:12.940> top<00:04:13.390> in<00:04:13.630> a<00:04:15.540> 2005<00:04:16.540> lower<00:04:17.370> but

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
thousand seven top in a 2005 lower but

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.729 
thousand seven top in a 2005 lower but
of<00:04:18.489> course<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:19.090> original<00:04:19.930> motor<00:04:20.169> was<00:04:20.440> a<00:04:20.500> two

of course the original motor was a two
thousand<00:04:21.310> what<00:04:21.549> I<00:04:21.579> bought<00:04:21.880> it<00:04:22.060> new<00:04:22.270> with<00:04:22.300> the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
thousand what I bought it new with the

I've<00:04:27.910> seen<00:04:28.330> right<00:04:28.720> here<00:04:28.750> on<00:04:29.230> this<00:04:29.380> left<00:04:29.740> side

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
I've seen right here on this left side

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.370 
I've seen right here on this left side
there's<00:04:30.820> a<00:04:30.910> little<00:04:31.150> bit<00:04:31.419> of<00:04:31.480> a<00:04:31.690> crack<00:04:31.960> I<00:04:32.139> can't

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
there's a little bit of a crack I can't

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.350 
there's a little bit of a crack I can't
even<00:04:32.530> see<00:04:32.710> it<00:04:32.800> right<00:04:33.010> now<00:04:33.160> but<00:04:33.370> there<00:04:33.610> is<00:04:33.790> in

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
even see it right now but there is in

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.530 
even see it right now but there is in
the<00:04:34.630> pain<00:04:34.870> here<00:04:35.169> somewhere<00:04:35.910> from<00:04:36.910> just

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
the pain here somewhere from just

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.330 
the pain here somewhere from just
probably<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:38.110> stress<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.650> torque<00:04:38.950> from<00:04:39.160> the

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
probably to stress the torque from the

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.120 
probably to stress the torque from the
motor<00:04:39.580> but<00:04:40.540> other<00:04:40.750> than<00:04:40.870> that<00:04:41.080> it's<00:04:41.500> it's<00:04:41.950> a

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
motor but other than that it's it's a

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.230 
motor but other than that it's it's a
real<00:04:42.370> good<00:04:42.400> solid<00:04:43.210> transit<00:04:43.810> I<00:04:43.990> have<00:04:44.740> a

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
real good solid transit I have a

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.000 
real good solid transit I have a
hydraulic<00:04:46.240> jack<00:04:46.270> plate<00:04:46.990> I'll<00:04:47.380> go<00:04:47.710> on<00:04:47.889> the

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
hydraulic jack plate I'll go on the

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:54.469 
hydraulic jack plate I'll go on the
other<00:04:48.220> side<00:04:48.610> here<00:04:50.850> and<00:04:51.850> it's<00:04:52.300> called<00:04:52.750> a<00:04:52.960> up<00:04:53.169> a

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
other side here and it's called a up a

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.040 
other side here and it's called a up a
CMG<00:04:55.479> power<00:04:56.290> lift<00:04:56.800> and<00:04:57.100> it's<00:04:57.729> a<00:04:58.030> I<00:04:58.300> got<00:04:58.690> a<00:04:58.720> button

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
CMG power lift and it's a I got a button

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.620 
CMG power lift and it's a I got a button
on<00:04:59.290> the<00:04:59.410> console<00:04:59.979> and<00:05:00.040> it<00:05:00.250> brings<00:05:00.639> it<00:05:00.850> up<00:05:00.970> six

on the console and it brings it up six
inches<00:05:01.840> I<00:05:02.850> also<00:05:03.850> have<00:05:04.270> to<00:05:04.300> factor<00:05:04.450> jack<00:05:05.110> plate

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
inches I also have to factor jack plate

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.260 
inches I also have to factor jack plate
which<00:05:05.710> is<00:05:05.950> right<00:05:06.340> there<00:05:07.050> and<00:05:08.050> I<00:05:09.000> may<00:05:10.000> put<00:05:10.210> that
