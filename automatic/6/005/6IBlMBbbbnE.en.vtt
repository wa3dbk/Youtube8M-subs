00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.840
 good more than a presentation of lives 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.190
 and daughter of rock and roll missing so 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.190
 few days with the premiere 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.269
 in this moment of your life comes the 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:15.600
 labor proposal and this fiction 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:20.150
 but no 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.150
 very nice moments bigger thing 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.970
 so I can dedicate dedicate 2002 to them 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.230
 those 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.430
 and there I will record 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.430
 to be able to divide the tasks 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.590
 when a little 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.999
 but now that it is bigger 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.820
 this year 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.790
 to tell us a little about your 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.950
 people who call me in the trailer 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.140
 driver of a radio program this 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.700
 link to the rock genre and also 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.700
 in mariela post years 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.890
 and that broke 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:15.060
 in several chapters 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.060
 the recordings and anecdotes 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.520
 last year 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.380
 and that moment was hopefully to save a 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.049
 and that 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.049
 also the person of the sea 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.969
 widows costs much room pay 39 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.219
 the night there were some changes in bold 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:56.520
 as you see today by the rating afflictions 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:02:00.370
 so many proposals that there are for the great 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.690
 that there are good frictions 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.690
 really divine 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.600
 and big that door 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.470
 again 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.310
 to continue exploring and I have to 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:23.270
 ask more as the theme of the day of the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.680
 clear week the facundo arana here happened 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.750
 the episode that is when there is the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.030
 american breakfast adriÃ¡n pallares that 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.720
 is a radio was like that 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.720
 as it was said 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.830
 and you know they're going to ask you in the 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.400
 I send 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.400
 it will be good 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.710
 I do not like to mix because while 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.870
 low is only true for 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.190
 a free visit and also a 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.190
 phrase in your twitter account 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.010
 but because at the time 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.519
 We speak 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.590
 and there's no chance of talking about it with 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.590
 him after all the senses 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.310
 but we can not anymore 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.310
 a bite 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.280
 and one can see the crisis interview and 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.590
 you know and not always in your mood tone of 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.980
 mischief but can not because he thinks that 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.980
 has bothered 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.290
 four years 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.290
 Isabel is life 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.960
 Y 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.670
 and the subject of the interview they see it 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.490
 entire 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.550
 the pain 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:09.360
 of mine mine was interviewing a 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:13.910
 goldmine 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.910
 I move if you are the mantero 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.150
 and 21 in a program 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.509
 because I'm against that good not 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.509
 I know how to do 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.419
 well I had a problem with pixels and 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.850
 although there were also some courses there 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.350
 a fake is now with bongos 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.060
 that is, come now that you are 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.100
 dedicated to acting is because the 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.770
 opportunity to work together 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:47.670
 it was not a strip that you think 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.930
 if possible nothing they do 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.930
 when more
