now<00:00:01.620> this<00:00:01.949> is<00:00:02.010> part<00:00:02.399> three<00:00:02.760> hopefully<00:00:03.419> the

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
now this is part three hopefully the

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.050 
now this is part three hopefully the
last<00:00:03.810> one<00:00:04.140> of<00:00:04.350> different<00:00:05.339> kinds<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:05.640> crunches

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
last one of different kinds of crunches

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.589 
last one of different kinds of crunches
crunches<00:00:06.350> that<00:00:07.350> we<00:00:07.560> do<00:00:07.940> I<00:00:08.940> will<00:00:09.420> demonstrate

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
crunches that we do I will demonstrate

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.600 
crunches that we do I will demonstrate
like<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.469> isolated<00:00:10.980> crunches<00:00:11.309> regular

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
like the isolated crunches regular

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.180 
like the isolated crunches regular
crunches<00:00:12.000> ABC<00:00:12.509> crunches<00:00:12.929> one<00:00:13.139> leg<00:00:13.349> up<00:00:13.500> one<00:00:14.009> arm

crunches ABC crunches one leg up one arm

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.170 
crunches ABC crunches one leg up one arm
up<00:00:15.199> oblique<00:00:16.199> stuff<00:00:16.619> upside<00:00:17.369> down<00:00:17.520> turtle<00:00:18.000> and

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
up oblique stuff upside down turtle and

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.040 
up oblique stuff upside down turtle and
the<00:00:18.210> ball<00:00:19.080> between<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.500> lakes<00:00:19.650> those<00:00:20.070> all

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
the ball between the lakes those all

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.840 
the ball between the lakes those all
involve<00:00:22.050> stomach<00:00:22.980> muscles<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.609> you're

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
involve stomach muscles that you're

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.150 
involve stomach muscles that you're
engaging<00:00:24.470> that's<00:00:25.470> why<00:00:25.619> I'm<00:00:25.740> putting<00:00:26.039> this

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
engaging that's why I'm putting this

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.970 
engaging that's why I'm putting this
together<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:29.150> what<00:00:30.500> structure<00:00:31.500> will<00:00:31.650> have<00:00:31.800> us

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
together so what structure will have us

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.580 
together so what structure will have us
do<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.520> our<00:00:32.610> wit<00:00:32.850> turning<00:00:33.149> class<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.989> after<00:00:34.440> we

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
do in our wit turning class is after we

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.310 
do in our wit turning class is after we
start<00:00:34.860> our<00:00:35.040> warm-ups<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:36.510> stretches<00:00:37.200> and

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
start our warm-ups like stretches and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.369 
start our warm-ups like stretches and
all<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.620> stuff<00:00:37.770> he<00:00:38.760> will<00:00:39.480> say<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:40.079> could<00:00:40.230> do

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
all that stuff he will say you could do

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.810 
all that stuff he will say you could do
free<00:00:40.620> crunches<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.879> 30<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.570> 40<00:00:42.960> seconds<00:00:43.410> and

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
free crunches for 30 to 40 seconds and

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.150 
free crunches for 30 to 40 seconds and
you<00:00:44.820> do<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.079> I'm<00:00:46.410> sure<00:00:46.680> some<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.100> you

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
you do it like this I'm sure some of you

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.360 
you do it like this I'm sure some of you
guys<00:00:47.340> know<00:00:47.399> how<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.700> do<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.739> like<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:52.370> do

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
guys know how to do this like this do

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.520 
guys know how to do this like this do
that<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:56.300> 30<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.449> 40<00:00:57.750> seconds<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.379> they

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
that for like 30 to 40 seconds and they

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.670 
that for like 30 to 40 seconds and they
says<00:00:58.770> rest<00:00:59.180> then<00:01:00.180> afterwards<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:01.379> will<00:01:01.469> make

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
says rest then afterwards it will make

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.179 
says rest then afterwards it will make
us<00:01:01.710> do<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> isolated<00:01:03.110> crunches<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.100> do

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
us do the isolated crunches you can do

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.030 
us do the isolated crunches you can do
however<00:01:05.460> me<00:01:05.760> sets<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.600> however<00:01:07.170> many<00:01:07.470> reps<00:01:07.920> you

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
however me sets of however many reps you

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.810 
however me sets of however many reps you
want<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:09.740> I'm<00:01:10.740> going<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.979> do<00:01:11.130> one<00:01:11.369> set<00:01:11.640> of

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
want to do I'm going to do one set of

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.240 
want to do I'm going to do one set of
three<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:13.310> he<00:01:14.310> will<00:01:14.460> make<00:01:14.490> us<00:01:14.790> go<00:01:14.970> up<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.799> then

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
three and he will make us go up and then

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.170 
three and he will make us go up and then
one<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.909> then<00:01:18.360> up<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:19.229> then<00:01:19.290> two<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.100> up<00:01:20.820> at

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
one and then up and then two and up at

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.410 
one and then up and then two and up at
the<00:01:21.720> last<00:01:21.930> one<00:01:22.320> because<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:22.799> three<00:01:23.240> he<00:01:24.240> will

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the last one because it's three he will

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.380 
the last one because it's three he will
say<00:01:24.920> okay<00:01:25.920> pulsate<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.490> go<00:01:26.640> I'm<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> new<00:01:27.060> just

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
say okay pulsate it go I'm the new just

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.530 
say okay pulsate it go I'm the new just
grows<00:01:27.630> best<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.530> these<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:30.030> 20<00:01:30.270> or<00:01:30.329> 30

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
grows best you can these for 20 or 30

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.830 
grows best you can these for 20 or 30
seconds<00:01:30.930> until<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.229> says<00:01:31.439> rest<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:33.090> that's<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
seconds until I says rest so that's the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.410 
seconds until I says rest so that's the
isolated<00:01:34.409> crunches<00:01:34.979> thing<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:36.060> can<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.329> it

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
isolated crunches thing you can do it

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.670 
isolated crunches thing you can do it
how<00:01:36.509> many<00:01:36.810> reps<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.229> want<00:01:37.590> or<00:01:39.380> however<00:01:40.380> many

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
how many reps you want or however many

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.200 
how many reps you want or however many
sets<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.220> reps<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.850> want<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.210> do<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.909> next<00:01:45.030> one

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
sets of reps you want to do the next one

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.859 
sets of reps you want to do the next one
is<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> ABC<00:01:46.020> crunches<00:01:47.119> you<00:01:48.119> there's<00:01:48.450> two<00:01:48.689> ways

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
is the ABC crunches you there's two ways

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.990 
is the ABC crunches you there's two ways
of<00:01:49.049> doing<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.680> can<00:01:49.860> do<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.070> on<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.369> ball<00:01:50.610> if

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
of doing it you can do it on the ball if

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.700 
of doing it you can do it on the ball if
it<00:01:51.420> hurts<00:01:51.600> too<00:01:51.780> much<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.500> ball

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
it hurts too much to do it on the ball

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.730 
it hurts too much to do it on the ball
you<00:01:53.369> can<00:01:53.520> do<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.729> under<00:01:53.909> back<00:01:54.439> whichever<00:01:55.439> feels

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
you can do it under back whichever feels

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.980 
you can do it under back whichever feels
comfortable<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.790> see<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.540> if<00:01:57.780> you're

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
comfortable for you see you if you're

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.929 
comfortable for you see you if you're
doing<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.409> your<00:01:58.439> back<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:59.520> your<00:01:59.670> legs

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
doing it on your back have your legs

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.950 
doing it on your back have your legs
cross<00:02:00.420> like<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.790> it<00:02:02.790> would<00:02:02.969> be<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.299> which

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
cross like this and it would be a which

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.560 
cross like this and it would be a which

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
because the ball likes to move so you go

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.920
