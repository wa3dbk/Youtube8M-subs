00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.670 
and that's how it kind of learns how to
behave<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.760> it's<00:02:43.030> much<00:02:43.239> easier<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.720> just<00:02:44.079> put

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
behave so it's much easier to just put

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.130 
behave so it's much easier to just put
it<00:02:44.769> on<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.130> go<00:02:45.459> whereas<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.390> first<00:02:46.630> week<00:02:46.959> that

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
it on and go whereas the first week that

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.300 
it on and go whereas the first week that
you're<00:02:47.260> dealing<00:02:47.440> with<00:02:47.590> this<00:02:47.860> unit<00:02:48.220> you're

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
you're dealing with this unit you're

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.130 
you're dealing with this unit you're
probably<00:02:48.610> gonna<00:02:49.060> have<00:02:49.269> to<00:02:49.299> comb<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:49.780> with<00:02:50.110> a

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
probably gonna have to comb it with a

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.180 
probably gonna have to comb it with a
paddle<00:02:50.650> brush<00:02:50.799> more<00:02:51.430> often<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:52.799> back<00:02:53.799> to<00:02:53.829> the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
paddle brush more often so back to the

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.780 
paddle brush more often so back to the
shiny<00:02:54.549> factor<00:02:55.269> shine<00:02:56.110> is<00:02:56.579> influenced<00:02:57.579> heavily

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
shiny factor shine is influenced heavily

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.970 
shiny factor shine is influenced heavily
by<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.420> products<00:02:59.079> that<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.319> use<00:02:59.349> when<00:02:59.769> you're

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
by the products that you use when you're

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.420 
by the products that you use when you're
natural<00:03:00.700> or<00:03:00.940> real<00:03:01.329> hair<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.410> sometimes<00:03:02.980> that

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
natural or real hair and sometimes that

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.460 
natural or real hair and sometimes that
seepage<00:03:04.239> can<00:03:04.690> tend<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.530> go<00:03:06.160> on<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.569> tracks

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
seepage can tend to go on to the tracks

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.490 
seepage can tend to go on to the tracks
of<00:03:08.739> the<00:03:09.129> unit<00:03:09.670> which<00:03:10.239> is<00:03:10.390> not<00:03:10.540> uncommon<00:03:10.959> so<00:03:11.470> I

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
of the unit which is not uncommon so I

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.460 
of the unit which is not uncommon so I
always<00:03:11.980> wear<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.700> wig<00:03:13.150> cap<00:03:13.180> so<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.690> can<00:03:13.989> kind<00:03:14.319> of

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
always wear a wig cap so I can kind of

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.039 
always wear a wig cap so I can kind of
you<00:03:15.040> know<00:03:15.129> decrease<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.760> chances<00:03:16.389> of<00:03:16.569> there

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
you know decrease the chances of there

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.370 
you know decrease the chances of there
being<00:03:17.079> an<00:03:17.579> overwhelming<00:03:19.230> concentration<00:03:20.230> of

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
being an overwhelming concentration of

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.900 
being an overwhelming concentration of
product<00:03:20.829> on<00:03:21.040> my<00:03:21.639> locks<00:03:21.970> also<00:03:22.690> I<00:03:23.319> only<00:03:23.920> used<00:03:24.519> an

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
product on my locks also I only used an

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.990 
product on my locks also I only used an
avocado<00:03:25.500> concentrate<00:03:26.500> on<00:03:26.709> this<00:03:27.639> particular

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
avocado concentrate on this particular

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.319 
avocado concentrate on this particular
style<00:03:29.250> every<00:03:30.250> two<00:03:30.670> and<00:03:30.849> a<00:03:30.880> half<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.299> three

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
style every two and a half to three

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.509 
style every two and a half to three
weeks<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:31.900> I've<00:03:32.019> been<00:03:32.290> wearing<00:03:32.560> this<00:03:32.920> unit

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
weeks and I've been wearing this unit

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.800 
weeks and I've been wearing this unit
for<00:03:33.880> almost<00:03:34.810> five<00:03:35.530> weeks<00:03:36.389> maybe<00:03:37.389> even<00:03:37.540> a

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
for almost five weeks maybe even a

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.930 
for almost five weeks maybe even a
little<00:03:37.900> bit<00:03:38.139> more<00:03:38.380> since<00:03:38.620> September<00:03:39.190> 28th<00:03:39.730> I

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
little bit more since September 28th I

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.759 
little bit more since September 28th I
believe<00:03:40.209> so<00:03:40.690> that's<00:03:40.840> probably<00:03:41.380> about<00:03:41.709> a

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
believe so that's probably about a

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.289 
believe so that's probably about a
little<00:03:42.310> over<00:03:42.639> five<00:03:43.389> weeks<00:03:43.750> or<00:03:44.019> so<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:46.150> do

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
little over five weeks or so and you do

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.379 
little over five weeks or so and you do
not<00:03:46.480> need<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.349> be<00:03:47.799> excessive<00:03:48.430> in<00:03:48.609> the<00:03:48.970> product

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
not need to be excessive in the product

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:50.759 
not need to be excessive in the product
that<00:03:49.510> you<00:03:49.780> use<00:03:50.049> because<00:03:50.260> you<00:03:50.410> want<00:03:50.709> to
