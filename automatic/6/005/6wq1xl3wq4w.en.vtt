00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
from the ground up with that console in

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.880 
from the ground up with that console in
mind<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.420> mean<00:00:51.840> obviously<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.260> most

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
after obviously the kind of descents a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.670 
after obviously the kind of descents a
resolution<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.940> halo<00:01:00.719> 3<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.260> then<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.500> know

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
making halo 4 were you almost right in a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.039 
making halo 4 were you almost right in a
hedge<00:01:08.700> against<00:01:09.180> what<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.479> thought<00:01:09.659> might<00:01:09.900> be

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
hedge against what you thought might be

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.370 
hedge against what you thought might be
coming<00:01:10.409> next<00:01:10.490> yeah<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.520> mean<00:01:11.909> both<00:01:12.270> story<00:01:12.689> like

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
coming next yeah I mean both story like

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.780 
coming next yeah I mean both story like
leaving<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.920> off<00:01:14.070> as<00:01:14.250> sort<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.549> cliffhanger

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
leaving it off as sort of a cliffhanger

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.249 
leaving it off as sort of a cliffhanger
so<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.330> could<00:01:15.450> pick<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.049> nice

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.249 
so we could pick it up with a nice
consult<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.280> also<00:01:17.460> thinking<00:01:18.000> about<00:01:18.090> what<00:01:19.080> can

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259

the early 2000s or or is it really took
hadn't<00:02:39.570> seen<00:02:39.720> what<00:02:39.840> technology<00:02:40.380> could<00:02:40.560> do<00:02:40.830> to

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
hadn't seen what technology could do to

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.280 
hadn't seen what technology could do to
start<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.790> have<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.060> imagination<00:02:42.290> where

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
start to have the imagination where

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.720 
start to have the imagination where
you're<00:02:43.470> going<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.680> go<00:02:43.800> with<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.010> yeah<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.459> would

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
you're going to go with it yeah I would

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.400 
you're going to go with it yeah I would
say<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.000> imagination<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.900> actually<00:02:46.260> trying

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
say the imagination of actually trying

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.949 
say the imagination of actually trying
to<00:02:46.620> create<00:02:46.890> an<00:02:47.010> epic<00:02:47.370> sci-fi<00:02:47.640> world<00:02:48.150> with<00:02:48.510> epic

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
to create an epic sci-fi world with epic

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.870 
to create an epic sci-fi world with epic
battles<00:02:49.380> has<00:02:49.800> always<00:02:50.190> been<00:02:50.459> there<00:02:50.700> but<00:02:50.730> I

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
battles has always been there but I

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.670 
battles has always been there but I
think<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.150> wasn't<00:02:51.330> until<00:02:51.660> Xbox<00:02:52.140> one<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.620> the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
think it wasn't until Xbox one that the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.320 
think it wasn't until Xbox one that the
team<00:02:52.890> could<00:02:53.070> really<00:02:53.370> think<00:02:53.670> about<00:02:53.970> how<00:02:54.150> they

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
team could really think about how they

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.350 
team could really think about how they
could<00:02:54.510> make<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:54.870> happen<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.920> new<00:02:56.790> technology

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
could make that happen so new technology

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.970 
could make that happen so new technology
opens<00:02:57.480> up<00:02:57.780> possibilities<00:02:57.930> what<00:02:58.620> we<00:02:58.739> can<00:02:58.890> do

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
opens up possibilities what we can do

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.830 
opens up possibilities what we can do
creatively<00:02:59.459> in<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.180> single<00:03:00.480> player<00:03:00.570> demo

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
creatively in the single player demo

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.080 
creatively in the single player demo

story<00:04:06.260> in<00:04:06.379> a<00:04:06.470> much<00:04:06.650> different<00:04:06.860> way<00:04:07.069> I<00:04:07.489> think<00:04:08.090> I

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
story in a much different way I think I

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.059 
story in a much different way I think I
think<00:04:08.629> certainly<00:04:09.019> like<00:04:09.349> one<00:04:09.739> of<00:04:09.769> the<00:04:09.890> things

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
think certainly like one of the things

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.680 
think certainly like one of the things
we<00:04:10.220> wanted<00:04:10.489> to<00:04:10.549> do<00:04:10.730> with<00:04:10.910> master<00:04:11.239> chief<00:04:11.450> was

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
we wanted to do with master chief was

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.960 
we wanted to do with master chief was
explore<00:04:12.170> him<00:04:12.349> more<00:04:12.500> deeply<00:04:12.860> and<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.640> way<00:04:13.790> that

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
explore him more deeply and the way that

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.449 
explore him more deeply and the way that
you<00:04:14.090> do<00:04:14.299> that<00:04:14.329> is<00:04:14.780> by<00:04:15.560> applying<00:04:15.890> a<00:04:16.130> different

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
you do that is by applying a different

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.979 
you do that is by applying a different
lens<00:04:16.639> to<00:04:16.850> him<00:04:17.000> and<00:04:17.180> that's<00:04:17.299> part<00:04:17.660> of<00:04:17.750> what

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
lens to him and that's part of what

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.650 
lens to him and that's part of what
Spartan<00:04:18.739> Locke<00:04:18.919> is<00:04:19.190> able<00:04:19.519> to<00:04:19.669> do<00:04:19.850> he's<00:04:20.479> at

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
Spartan Locke is able to do he's at

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.629 
Spartan Locke is able to do he's at
outside<00:04:21.139> perspective<00:04:21.799> he's<00:04:21.949> coming<00:04:22.340> in<00:04:22.460> and

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
outside perspective he's coming in and

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.460 
outside perspective he's coming in and
trying<00:04:22.729> to<00:04:22.910> learn<00:04:23.090> about<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.510> chief<00:04:23.720> as<00:04:24.169> he

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
trying to learn about the chief as he

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.000 
trying to learn about the chief as he
does<00:04:24.710> that<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:25.550> player<00:04:25.820> learns<00:04:26.570> also<00:04:27.169> so<00:04:27.979> that

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
does that the player learns also so that

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.770 
does that the player learns also so that
i<00:04:28.220> think<00:04:28.580> i<00:04:28.760> think<00:04:29.030> is<00:04:29.090> a<00:04:29.120> big<00:04:29.330> difference<00:04:29.479> and

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
i think i think is a big difference and

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.990 
i think i think is a big difference and
then<00:04:29.900> trying<00:04:30.560> to<00:04:30.650> tell<00:04:30.860> a<00:04:30.889> story<00:04:31.220> with<00:04:31.430> eight

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
then trying to tell a story with eight

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.020 
then trying to tell a story with eight
main<00:04:32.600> characters<00:04:33.320> is<00:04:33.650> a<00:04:33.710> huge<00:04:34.370> challenge<00:04:34.430> and

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
main characters is a huge challenge and

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.730 
main characters is a huge challenge and
it's<00:04:35.150> something<00:04:35.360> that<00:04:35.600> has<00:04:35.720> really<00:04:35.990> forced<00:04:36.470> us

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
it's something that has really forced us

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.080 
it's something that has really forced us
to<00:04:36.770> change<00:04:37.190> the<00:04:37.460> way<00:04:37.580> we<00:04:37.760> approach

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
to change the way we approach

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.840 
to change the way we approach
storytelling<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.050> find<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.979> time<00:04:40.220> and<00:04:40.520> the

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
storytelling and find the time and the

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.610 
storytelling and find the time and the
moments<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.479> let<00:04:41.660> those<00:04:41.810> characters<00:04:42.380> come<00:04:42.590> to

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
moments to let those characters come to

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.159 
moments to let those characters come to
life<00:04:42.770> I<00:04:43.220> mean<00:04:43.699> it<00:04:43.910> is<00:04:44.000> interesting<00:04:44.539> that<00:04:44.570> as
