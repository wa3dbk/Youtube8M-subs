00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 well guys here in china is today i'm here 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.410
 with this new video my first one 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.380
 squat builder and even if I have a fever 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.960
 guys I can not bring it in 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.630
 this video because it seems to me that it is 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.680
 a really epic and super team 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.320
 paid 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.150
 obviously it has a price of about 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.910
 on the 2 million credits boys or 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.730
 1,700,000 now depends on the market and yes 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.399
 it's a multi-hybrid one thing 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.820
 strange and sorry if I don't put the face 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.030
 Cams 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.920
 but I'm really sick but I had to 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.690
 bring this squad builder but 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.000
 Let's start guys immediately 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.600
 we find salvador sirigu wandering 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.700
 around 1200 1300 credits and for a 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.430
 goalkeeper is very little for the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.730
 characteristics that precisely 86 of 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.620
 85 tuff of reflections positioning 87 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.140
 this is what characterizes that 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.539
 sirigu savior and I bought more 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.609
 also because in any case a misunderstood e 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.830
 second of all, we must 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.380
 really spend so much for the players 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.750
 that I will show you later we now turn to 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.390
 defenders of this hybrid team a 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.850
 right I chose david lewis because he is a 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.610
 complete player in my opinion though 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.520
 I call it caciarone, it is around 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.970
 around 13 thousand children credits with 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.340
 a 77 speed and or 79 defense and a 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:33.060
 82 the accuracy of the head slipped e 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.950
 contrast an 80 jump guys and a 84 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.780
 of aggressiveness and therefore I believe that it is 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.509
 one of the strongest defenders of both 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.610
 barclays that of fifa 14 as defender 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.880
 on the left instead I chose mine 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.939
 tiago emiliano da silva because it wanders 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.280
 around 30 thousand to 35 thousand credits and 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.310
 guys this player is maybe the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.939
 strongest defender of fifa 14 I remove the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:01.229
 perhaps because at 80 of speed 87 of 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:06.659
 defense 80 of ball control 91 of 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.900
 91 contrast marking and 90 jump marking 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.620
 besides having 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.840
 91 interception things they make 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.820
 this player as you know the 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.590
 strongest defender in the world like 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.950
 left-back girls I chose 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.660
 marcelo that in fact to the statistics 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:27.040
 very high is around 7 thousand 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:33.130
 and 300 7,400 credits and 86 checks 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:36.700
 85 ball of stalin slip 87 with to 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.370
 an 86 of aggressiveness guys make it 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.800
 one of the sinister fullbacks just more 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.750
 forts of this game and have so much 2 of 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.150
 speed that is not bad at all like 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.610
 right back guys i chose johnson 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.200
 because in addition to costing little indeed 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.920
 we have to save a little for this 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.520
 team 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.050
 about 1,300 credits to statistics 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.890
 scary to be the right back 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:03.490
 or a speed of 85 a defense 76 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.230
 a 74 passing a 76 dribble 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.090
 that is, however, a labor price 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.530
 boy and a very calm player 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.110
 let's move on to the central midfielders 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.700
 on the right we find ramires 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.400
 unfortunately I could not register 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.070
 nothing on this player however like 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.010
 you can see coast around it 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.640
 10,000 11,000 credits raised on 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.420
 price however with an 86 of 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:31.660
 acceleration an initial speed of 90 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.000
 precisely of sprint co so to speak 94 of 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.709
 stamina really recovers so much 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.300
 ball and it's as fast as 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.160
 central left midfielder 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.769
 we have the first by virtue of this 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.430
 team or felipe melo this 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.560
 boys player is very strong has more 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:53.290
 yaya tourÃ© statistics and if you see 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:57.280
 race on the 99 about 110,000 more or less 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.840
 it depends on the market and on a defense 85 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.260
 that to be a midfielder and has 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.910
 really a lot of speed but that 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.610
 what interests us are the statistics in the 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:11.470
 detail or 99 stamina 98 force e 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.300
 99 aggression guys like 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.030
 central offensive midfielder mine 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.989
 choice fell on sneijder that costs 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.370
 around 86 thousand 85,000 because it is the 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.250
 its seaf version 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:29.000
 but guys I tell you the truth is a 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:33.320
 truly highly paid player 99 of 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.210
 shock power and 99 stamina beyond 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.930
 precisely to his statistics as you can 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:42.830
 see 90 of shooting pass 86 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.350
 overall it is a defense 63 that for a 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.390
 coc really high guys like wing 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.610
 left girls I have chosen willian 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.180
 because as you know it's a player 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.160
 really fast nobody stops him 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.770
 on the wing practically when part goes to 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.510
 part of what I've done well with 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.520
 willian anyway what has me 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.970
 particularly affected is his 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:09.520
 acceleration that has a nice 91 then 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:11.780
 for a player who costs 22750 or 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.760
 23 thousand in this case is really 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.500
 great expense but let's move to the highlight of 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.500
 this hybrid guys like right wing 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.530
 we find daniel sturridge iv that yes 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.990
 I go around it I paid 222 thousand but you can 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.780
 very well find it at around 160 thousand 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.390
 and I would spend these 100,000 times 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:33.260
 credits because with a 90 speed a 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:37.100
 82 of shots in general but with 90 of soft 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:40.130
 reaction power and 90 99 distant thousand 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.340
 guys this is one of the gunners that 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.860
 It is precisely, however, stands as the most right wing 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.890
 strong indeed that have come out like 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.860
 informs as well as being just bankrupt 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.870
 in its non-iv version it was missed 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.730
 also in its version iv boys 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.830
 we see here just as with the 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.910
 filter passage boys star iger 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.120
 throws a bomb 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.070
 as I said before 90 of shock power e 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.260
 82 overall shock 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.930
 the absurd thing and here we are at the peak 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:12.560
 of this squat builder with robin van 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.240
 persie iv is around 650 but yes 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.200
 is lowered a bit of price you find it 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:22.670
 out of 625 630,000 apart from its speed 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:27.050
 boys at a total 91 shot 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:30.860
 96 of shoot power boys and 96 of ok 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:35.000
 stamina reaction with a control 91 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:38.750
 ball and a finishing of 97 ie 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.900
 in front of the door van persie guys 97 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:44.690
 percent out of 100 makes goals 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.870
 so if obviously it has the possibility 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:50.480
 guys otherwise if I know the 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.200
 hunter who files annoy you don't 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.480
 can do anything 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.370
 here we see that in any case slider is 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.740
 managed to take it from head, yes 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.320
 understands how and van persie has bagged 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:03.080
 the goal of one by one doing a nice 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.760
 moonwalk so guys hope this
