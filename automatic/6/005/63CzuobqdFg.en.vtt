00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.250 
you don't you know overheat your gun and
you<00:01:48.790> also<00:01:48.970> have<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:49.240> time<00:01:49.690> it<00:01:49.720> with<00:01:50.080> it<00:01:50.230> with

you also have to time it with it with
the<00:01:50.410> ginning<00:01:50.800> up<00:01:50.920> so<00:01:51.100> there's<00:01:51.280> a<00:01:51.430> lot<00:01:51.700> of

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730
