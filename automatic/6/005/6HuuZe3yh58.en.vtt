00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
now this button is a little bit harder

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.270 
now this button is a little bit harder
to<00:01:54.750> press<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.290> would<00:01:55.410> like<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:55.980> cannot

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
to press that I would like but I cannot

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.650 
to press that I would like but I cannot
think<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.550> a<00:01:56.640> better<00:01:56.670> way<00:01:56.940> to<00:01:57.000> do<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.330> so<00:01:57.630> I

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
think of a better way to do it so I

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:06.140 
think of a better way to do it so I
guess<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.140> will<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.260> to<00:01:58.530> work

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.400
